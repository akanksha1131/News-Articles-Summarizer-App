NEW DELHI: Odisha 's Cuttack witnessed fresh communal tensions and violent clashes on Sunday after police denied permission for a bike rally organised by a group.The confrontation escalated, leading to stone pelting, arson, and a police crackdown that left at least 25 people, including eight police personnel, injured. Authorities have imposed a 36-hour curfew and suspended internet services to prevent further unrest as rioters set fire to eight to ten locations on Sunday.As the atmosphere in Cuttack remains highly tense, demonstrators occupied major streets on Sunday, culminating in a call for a Cuttack Bandh on Monday. During the rally, protesters were heard raising provocative slogans demanding an “exclusive Hindu-only identity” for the city.Chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi expressed sorrow over the group clash and urged all citizens to maintain peace and order.""Cuttack, with its rich thousand-year history, stands as a testament to unity and brotherhood. However, in recent days, the peace in the city was disrupted by some miscreants, affecting the daily lives of ordinary people. The govt is keeping an eye on these miscreants and will take strict action against them,"" the CM's statement read.The violent confrontation in Cuttack stemmed from a series of incidents that began during the Durga idol immersion procession late Friday night and escalated further on Sunday.Tension first broke out around 2 am on the intervening night of Friday-Saturday when the Jhanjirimangala Bhagabat Puja Committee’s procession was heading to Debigada for the immersion of Goddess Durga.Local residents reportedly objected to the loud music accompanying the procession, sparking a heated argument between the two groups. The situation quickly spiralled out of control as stones and glass bottles were hurled near Dargah Bazar Jail Road, turning the area into a conflict zone.Police were forced to resort to a lathi-charge to disperse the mob. Several people were injured in the melee, including Deputy Commissioner of Police Rishikesh Khilari, who sustained a forehead injury after being hit by a stone.After this incident, police heightened security across the city amid fears of communal tension. On Sunday, an organisation sought permission to conduct a bike rally, but authorities denied it, citing the fragile situation after the earlier clash. Despite the denial, some members of the group attempted to go ahead with the rally, resulting in a fresh confrontation with the police.As the rally participants clashed with security forces, stone pelting resumed, injuring several police personnel. The unrest spread to nearby areas, with reports of fires being set at multiple locations. Authorities eventually used force to disperse the mob, imposed a 36-hour curfew, and suspended internet services to restore order in the city.""Today, an organisation in Cuttack requested permission to hold a bike rally, but it was denied. This led to a clash with the police. When the police enforced that they would not be allowed to pass through the road, as it could lead to communal tensions. Eight policemen were injured in the stone pelting. These individuals were later dispersed using force,"" Police Commissioner Suresh Debadutta Singh told news agency ANI.After the clashes, authorities imposed a 36-hour curfew in affected areas and suspended internet services for 24 hours.Cuttack District Magistrate Dattatraya Bhausaheb Shinde confirmed the measures, said: ""Right now, the situation is under control. Unfortunately, some issues arose during the evening. Unfortunately, the crowd went out of control, and there were some injuries on the police side, so we have immediately stopped internet services for 24 hours in the city. The curfew will be imposed immediately. Additional forces have been requisitioned, and we already have around ten companies in place. But we will also be getting around three platoons of force from the Central Armed Forces.""He appealed for peace, emphasising the city’s communal harmony.""We request everybody, and we appeal to everybody that Cuttack has always been the city of brotherhood, and let us continue that way. We have also been engaging with the community leaders of various communities over the last two to three days. We have been engaging with them, and we are continuing this engagement, and they have all assured us that this will not happen again,"" Shinde said.He assured that within the next 24 hours the situation will be under control.""DGP has already ensured that whoever has tried to breach this peace in this peaceful city will not be spared. The internet has been banned for 24 hours, and we think that within 24 hours, we will be able to bring that under control. If not, we are ready to ban it for the next 24 hours also,"" the Cuttack DM said.Police officials dismissed rumours circulating on social media about a death linked to a prior incident during Durga idol immersion.""We have also learned that rumours were being spread that one of the four individuals who were injured in the stone-pelting incident during Durga idol immersion has died. Those who spread these rumours will be arrested. Of the four injured that day, all had minor injuries. Three were discharged the same day. One is being treated. A curfew will be imposed to maintain peace,"" Commissioner Singh clarified to news agency ANI.The state government suspended internet and social media services in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the 42 Mauza Region until 7 PM on Monday.According to a government circular, a prohibition has been imposed ""on the use and access of social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and X, until 7 PM on Monday in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the 42 Mauza Region.”The order was issued under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and Rule 2(1) of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency/Public Safety) Rules, 2017.Even as security forces conducted flag marches to maintain order, rioters set fire to multiple locations in the Gouri Shankar Park area.Assistant Fire Officer Sanjeeb Kumar Behera said: ""We received information that near the Gouri Shankar Park, rioters have set fire to 8-10 places. We have extinguished the fire. The rioters are pelting stones at us. Police have been deployed to control the situation.""According to reports, stone pelting continued in parts of the city as police reinforcements were deployed.Odisha Director-General of Police Yogesh Bahadur Khurania assured that the situation was under control.""The police are closely monitoring the situation. Action will be taken against all anti-social elements involved in the violence. I would like to inform all residents of Cuttack not to trust any rumour. They should immediately check the police website, the Commissionerate's website, and their Twitter handle.""Former Odisha chief minister and leader of opposition Naveen Patnaik appealed for calm and harmony, expressing deep concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in the city.Local leaders have condemned the incident. MLA Sofia Firdous and former MLA Md. Moquim described the situation as ""very unfortunate"" and urged citizens to work towards restoring peace. Both leaders emphasised the importance of maintaining Cuttack's long-standing tradition of unity and cooperation among communities.""We must remain patient and committed to making everything normal again. The city has always been a symbol of unity, and it is crucial that we all work together to ensure this doesn't divide us,"" said MLA Sofia Firdous.Echoing similar sentiments, former MLA Md. Moquim emphasised that the authorities would ensure the accused would face strict punishment. ""Justice will be served, and the rule of law will prevail,"" he assured.","Cuttack witnessed fresh communal tensions and violent clashes on Sunday after police denied permission for a bike rally organised by a group.

Poll Should hospitals be required to improve safety regulations for ICU facilities? Yes, it's essential for patient safety. No, existing regulations are sufficient.

Relatives allege negligence



NEW DELHI: Six patients died and five remain critical after a fire broke out at the trauma ICU of Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital late on Sunday night.Police said the exact cause of the fire is yet to be determined, though a short circuit is suspected. ""At first glance, it appears to be a short circuit, but the final cause will only be determined after the FSL investigation,"" Jaipur Police Commissioner Biju George Joseph said.SMS Hospital Trauma Centre In-charge Anurag Dhakad told ANI that the fire started in the trauma ICU on the second floor and spread quickly, releasing toxic gases. “Our trauma centre has two ICUs on the second floor: a trauma ICU and a semi-ICU. We had 24 patients there; 11 in the trauma ICU and 13 in the semi-ICU. A short circuit occurred in the trauma ICU, and the fire spread rapidly, releasing toxic gases,” he said.Dhakad added that most of the patients in the ICU were comatose. “Our trauma centre team, our nursing officers, and ward boys, immediately rescued them on trolleys and brought as many patients as we could out of the ICU and shifted them to another location.Six of those patients were very critical; we tried very hard to revive them with CPR, but they couldn't be saved,” he said.According to Dhakad, two of the deceased were women and four were men. Five patients are still critical. “There were 24 that we evacuated: 11 in the trauma ICU and 13 in the adjacent ICU,” he said.Also read - Doctors, compounders fled as smoke spread, say kin; CM reviews situation at SMS trauma centre Authorities are investigating the cause of the short circuit and assessing damage to the facility. Rescue operations were completed shortly after the blaze was brought under control.Meanwhile, relatives of the patients recounted distressing scenes as smoke engulfed the ward, alleging lapses in safety measures and delayed response from hospital staff.Puran Singh, a relative of a patient, said, as quoted by news agency ANI, ""When there was a spark, there was a cylinder beside it. The smoke spread throughout the ICU, causing everyone to flee in panic. Some managed to rescue their own patients, but mine was left alone in the room. As the gas spread further, they shut the gates.""Narendra Singh, another relative, was quoted by ANI as saying, ""There was a fire in the ICU, and I didn't even know. I had come downstairs to have dinner at the time. There wasn't even any equipment to douse the fire — no facilities were available. My mother was admitted there.""Om Prakash, whose 25-year-old maternal aunt’s son was admitted, recounted, ""Smoke started spreading around 11:20pm, and I warned the doctors that it could cause discomfort to patients. By the time the smoke intensified, the doctors and compounders had already fled. Only 4 to 5 patients were evacuated. Tragically, my maternal aunt's son lost his life due to the incident. He was about to recover and was scheduled to be discharged in two-three days. ""Jogendra Singh alleged negligence by hospital staff. ""My mother was admitted to the ICU. When the spark occurred, I alerted the doctors four to five times that it was coming from there, but they dismissed it as normal. Suddenly, smoke engulfed the area, and all the staff ran out, leaving no one to help or save my mother. I was outside when I asked the police, and they said everyone had been evacuated. However, my mother and brother were still trapped inside the hospital. Somehow, I managed to rescue my brother, but he is now in critical condition,"" he said.Ranjit Singh Rathore, whose brother was admitted, said he received a call at 11:30pm. ""I had just arrived this evening. I rushed to the hospital, but initially, they wouldn't let me inside. After some time, I managed to enter. When I went in, I found my brother dead,"" he was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.","A fire broke out at the trauma ICU of Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital late on Sunday night.

Uttar Pradesh: 'Shoot on sight' orders for wolves in Bahraich,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttar-pradesh-shoot-on-sight-orders-for-wolves-in-bahraich/articleshow/124328091.cms,"File photo

LUCKNOW/BAHRAICH: Uttar Pradesh's forest department issued Sunday ""shoot on sight"" orders for wolves following a spate of attacks in Bahraich district that have left six people, including four children, dead in the past two months. The order coincided with fresh attacks that left three villagers injured.""Given the repeated attacks by wolves on villagers, state government has authorised our teams to take strict action to neutralise any aggressive wolves posing a direct threat to human life,"" district forest officer (DFO) Ram Singh Yadav said.Officials emphasised that the measure was intended as a last-resort safety step, targeting only wolves that exhibit violent behaviour towards humans, while regular wildlife in the forest remains protected under state laws. Authorities said Bahraich's Kaiserganj and Mahsi areas were the worst affected.The latest attacks on Sunday left two villagers in Tediya Kotia in Ramganj area and one in Bahorwa Naubasta seriously wounded. Following this, enraged villagers reportedly cornered and killed the animal. DFO Yadav directed a team to visit the spot. ""We examined the animal and found it to be a jackal. The attacks were carried out by the jackal,"" he said.According to reports, Sushila (21) was attacked when she stepped out of home for routine chores. The animal, hiding in the bushes, leapt on her. Hearing her screams, villagers rushed to the scene. During the commotion, it entered the house of Ram Kumar (40) and attacked him. Both were rushed to hospital, where their condition was said to be stable.In Bahorwa Naubasta village, Barsati Lal Shukla, 62, was attacked by a wolf on his farm. He suffered leg injuries but fended off the animal by charging at it with a sickle.State minister Arun Kumar, meanwhile, conducted a survey of Kaiserganj along with DM Akshay Tripathi and other senior officials. He met the families of some of the villagers who died or were injured in wolf attacks and pledged aid. Officials briefed him on efforts to contain the menace. tnn","Six people, including four children, have been killed by wolves in the past two months.

Bengal floods: Trajectory change of low-pressure system led to havoc,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-floods-trajectory-change-of-low-pressure-system-led-to-havoc/articleshow/124328070.cms,"A portion of a road connecting Siliguri and Darjeeling, damaged after landslide on Sunday

KOLKATA: Devastating rain that flooded the plains and hills of north Bengal was brought by an unexpected change in the trajectory of a low-pressure system triggered by the retreating monsoon, meteorologists have said.The system, which formed over the Bay of Bengal on Sept 30, made landfall in Odisha as a depression and was moving north-northwest towards Chhattisgarh when it suddenly recurved towards north Bihar, coming dangerously close to north Bengal.“Even though not very intense, such systems cover a wide region. North Bengal fell within the periphery of this one, which explains the heavy rain. In fact, Kolkata, too, continues to be impacted by the same system,” a meteorologist said.Sourish Bandopadhyay, a scientist at the regional meteorological centre, said, “Clouds kept floating into the hills and over Dooars. Extremely heavy rain, over 200mm in around 24 hours, occurred in some parts of Darjeeling, Alipurduar, Kalimpong, and Jalpaiguri on Friday and Saturday. Its intensity reduced Sunday.”Darjeeling recorded 261mm of rain in 24 hours till 8 am on Sunday, followed by Cooch Behar (192mm), Jalpaiguri (172mm), and Bagdogra-Siliguri (134mm).Excess water flowing through rivers entering Bengal from Sikkim and Bhutan only worsened the devastation.“Since monsoon is now retreating from north India, strong westerly winds diverted the system towards north Bihar, bringing it closer to north Bengal. It was prevented from advancing into central India, which is the usual path for such systems... The ‘recurve’ was unexpected but not unusual,” said a meteorologist. In its current state as a cyclonic circulation, the system still covers a wide area — across north Bihar, hills of Bengal, and eastern Nepal.“Rain will continue in these areas. The system is likely to move towards Bangladesh, though it may lose steam over the next 48 hours,” the meteorologist added.","The system, which formed over the Bay of Bengal on Sept 30, made landfall in Odisha as a depression.

NAGPUR: At least 14 more children from Madhya Pradesh's Chhindwara district who had been administered the now-banned cough syrup Coldrif are battling for life in government and private hospitals in Nagpur after suffering renal failure.Lab reports confirmed the six children who died at GMCH-Nagpur had suffered renal failure due to diethylene glycol (DEG) toxicity. Syrup samples were found to be contaminated with 48.6% DEG, a toxic substance used as antifreeze and in brake fluids. Initially, these deaths were assumed to be cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), but zero urine output in patients with a history of cough and fever raised alarm among govt doctors.Nagpur municipal corporation is set to issue guidelines to all medical practitioners, advising them not to prescribe cough syrups, especially to children below five years.On Sunday, Maharashtra government banned Coldrif, manufactured by Sresan Pharma in Tamil Nadu's Kancheepuram. Head of GMCH's paediatrics department, Dr Manish Tiwari, said three children remain on ventilator support while two are in critical condition.Deputy director of health services Dr Shashikant Shambharkar said 14 children are currently admitted to govt and private hospitals in Nagpur. ""We have instructed all public health hospitals in Nagpur, spanning six districts, not to prescribe this syrup. However, none of our hospitals had any supply or stock of Coldrif. No renal failure cases among children from Nagpur or Vidarbha districts have been reported. We only have sporadic AES cases from some Vidarbha districts, but they are not related to cough syrup,"" he said.Paediatric intensivist Dr Anupam Bahe, who treated six children from MP for renal failure at Nelson Hospital, said besides Coldrif, their patients were also given two other cough syrups. ""Two children were administered cough syrups of different local brands. Both were later shifted to other hospitals and remain critical,"" he said.NMC officials said surveillance and monitoring are still underway.","At least 14 children from Madhya Pradesh's Chhindwara district are battling for life in government and private hospitals in Nagpur.

'Failure Of Personalised Diplomacy’: Congress Hits Out At PM Modi Over Russia-Pakistan Arms Deal

The BJP hit back on Sunday, citing another media report that said Moscow had termed the claim false.On Saturday, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had shared on social media a report that alleged Russia had ignored India's objections and moved ahead with the sale of the RD-93MA engines for Pakistan's upgraded JF-17 Thunder Block-III aircraft.

Recruiter timeline and tracking

Significance and pressure points

The University of Delhi (DU) will conduct a large-scale job fair on 8 October 2025, bringing recruiters to campus for placements and internships across disciplines. The clock is tight: student registrations shut on 5 October and the portal auto-closes after 5,000 submissions—whichever comes first. The drive is organised by the Central Placement Cell (CPC) under the Dean of Students’ Welfare. The fair will run across the Indoor Stadium, Multipurpose Hall and Gate No. 2 facilities on the university campus. Candidates who receive a confirmation email must report by 9:00 a.m. on 8 October.Participation is open to regular undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students, as well as DU alumni. However, School of Open Learning (SOL) students are not eligible, a line of exclusion that leaves a large distance-learning cohort outside the ambit of this placement exercise.Registration is free and can be completed via a Google form. It requires:The form’s 5,000-entry cap means late applicants can find the portal locked before the date, and incomplete/incorrect entries risk disqualification.All participating students are required to carry multiple hard copies of their CVs for direct submission to employers. Digital uploads alone will not suffice.Recruiting organisations are expected to complete their own sign-ups by 6 October, allowing the CPC to finalise schedules.Students have been advised to regularly check the official placement site (placement.du.ac.in) and the registration form page for job descriptions and the evolving list of participating companies in the run-up to the fair.The job fair arrives in a demanding labour market where entry-level roles are fiercely contested. For final-year students and recent graduates, the event is a decisive springboard; for DU, it is a public test of employability readiness—from logistics and recruiter mix to actual offers made. Pressure points are clear: the exclusion of SOL candidates, the compressed registration window, and the strict documentation regimen. Each will influence both student experience and outcomes.","The University of Delhi will conduct a large-scale job fair on 8 October 2025.

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness. ""These unclaimed amounts are not government property but belong to individuals and families,"" Sitharaman said. ""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This is their money.""She said such funds often arise due to missing documentation, forgotten policies or lack of awareness. ""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

SRINAGAR/JAIPUR: Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk has demanded an independent judicial inquiry into the September 24 firing in Leh, which left four people dead and over 70 wounded, and said he was prepared to remain in prison until the probe is conducted.In his first message from Jodhpur central jail, Wangchuk appealed to the people of Ladakh to maintain peace and unity while continuing their fight for statehood and Sixth Schedule status “in the true Gandhian way of non-violence”.“I stand firmly with Apex Body Leh, Kargil Democratic Alliance, and the people of Ladakh in our genuine constitutional demand for Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Wangchuk said in the message relayed by Mustafa Haji, legal advisor to the apex body. “Whatever actions Apex Body Leh takes in the interest of Ladakh, I am with them wholeheartedly.”Haji and Wangchuk’s elder brother Ka Tsetan Dorjey Ley met him at Jodhpur jail Saturday. Haji posted Sunday the activist’s message on X and Facebook, quoting Wangchuk as saying he was “doing well, both physically and mentally” and thanking supporters for their concern and prayers. He expressed condolences to the families of those killed and said his “prayers are with those wounded and arrested”.Wangchuk was taken into custody on September 26 under NSA, two days after protests in Leh turned violent. Police and paramilitary forces fired at demonstrators demanding Ladakh’s inclusion under Sixth Schedule and restoration of statehood. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Monday a petition filed by Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali J Angmo challenging his arrest under NSA and seeking his immediate release.The unrest came amid Wangchuk’s hunger strike, launched on Sept 10 to press for those demands. The clashes and fatal firing on Sept 24 prompted Wangchuk to call off his fast.Union home ministry had earlier announced that the next round of talks with Ladakh representatives would be held on October 6, but both ABL and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) withdrew after the killings, insisting that dialogue could resume only after a judicial probe into the firing and the release of those arrested, including Wangchuk.While the UT administration in Ladakh has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the Leh violence, ABL and KDA have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired Supreme Court judge before returning to talks.",Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk has demanded an independent judicial inquiry into the September 24 firing in Leh.

Poll Do you think the safety measures on flights are adequate? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, AI was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, AI said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.

BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said on Sunday that Lingayat is a separate religion, a statement that is likely to reignite the opposition’s allegations made during 2013-18 that he was trying to divide Veerashaiva-Lingayat community.Speaking at the closing ceremony of Basava cultural campaign 2025, which was organised by Lingayat Seers’ Association, the CM said, “Caste system is rooted in our society. To uproot this caste system, Basavanna launched a separate religion.”The statement comes amid the confusion within Lingayat community, which has been divided over whether to register themselves in the ongoing socio-educational survey as a separate religion or as a caste under Hindu religion.While opposition BJP has been urging Veerashaiva-Lingayats to identify themselves as a caste and strengthen Hindu community in the state, the Congress leadership has been seeking to project the community as a separate religion.In fact, at the beginning of his speech, he said he did not want to dwell upon a lot of matters at the Lingayat convention as whatever he says will soon turn into a controversy. Attacking the caste system in his speech, Siddaramaiah said, “I’m a Shudra under the Chaturvarna system.Just because I’m Shudra (doesn’t mean) I can be denied opportunity for education and equality. Caste does not make anyone big or famous ... Knowledge is nobody’s property and cannot be denied. ”Siddaramaiah urged the lower castes and all those who follow the principles of Basavanna to consolidate towards ensuring a casteless society in the country.“(Ram Manohar) Lohia once said rallies by forward castes is a caste consolidation effort. But rallies by backward castes and the downtrodden is not consolidation, but a rally towards seeking equality. If we want an equal and humane society then we must consolidate to achieve this goal,” he said.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said on Sunday that Lingayat is a separate religion.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Key details have emerged following the investigation of Mohammad Yousuf Katari, 26, who was arrested for his role in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Officials said on Sunday that Katari met the three terrorists behind the attack—Sulieman alias Asif, Jibran, and Hamza Afghani, four times and provided them logistical support, including an Android phone charger, which became a key piece of evidence leading to his capture, reported PTI.Katari, a resident of South Kashmir’s Kulgam district, reportedly told investigators that he had met the attackers in the Zabarwan hills outside Srinagar. He had also guided them through the difficult terrain.His arrest followed weeks of investigation, including forensic analysis of items recovered during Operation Mahadev in July, which killed the three terrorists linked to the Pahalgam massacre. Security agencies tracked the partially destroyed phone charger to Katari, confirming his connection to the attackers.Authorities indicated that Katari’s interrogation may uncover further links in the terror support network in the Kashmir Valley. The case could be transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is already probing the broader conspiracy behind the Pahalgam attack.The NIA has arrested two individuals so far in connection with the April 22 terror attack for allegedly offering logistical support and shelter to the terrorists.The April 22 attack in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot often called “mini Switzerland,” marked the deadliest terror attack in the Valley since the 2019 Pulwama attack. TRF, a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), had claimed responsibility.","Mohammad Yousuf Katari, 26, was arrested for his role in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.

NEW DELHI: Those who violate traffic and other motor vehicle (MV) rules will soon be required to either accept and pay challans or contest them with supporting evidence within 45 days, says a draft notification proposing amendments to the MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.As per the proposed changes notified by the road transport ministry, regional transport offices (RTOs) won’t process any applications related to the licence or vehicle registration of such offenders until the dues are cleared. Such vehicles and driving licence holders will also be flagged as “not to be transacted” on Vahan and Sarathi portal.Sources said these changes have been proposed to nudge violators to clear their dues.However, experts cautioned that, before implementing the changes, the govt must ensure that systems are in place for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) holders to raise objections against challans, and for their names to be promptly removed from the pending payment list once the dues are cleared.“The draft rules specify that anyone receiving a challan may contest it on the portal with supporting documentary evidence before an authority designated by the respective state govt.There is a need to clearly define the responsibilities of this authority, and there should be a penalty provision in place if the authority fails to remove a vehicle or individual from the defaulter list after dues have been cleared,” said a veteran from the transport industry.The ministry has proposed that police officers in uniform or any other official authorised by state govts be allowed to issue challan physically. They could also auto-generate challans. These challans must be delivered either in person within 15 days or electronically within three days.If a person does not contest a challan before the designated authority, it will be deemed accepted 45 days after issuance.According to the draft rules, if a challan is contested and the authority fails to resolve it within 30 days, or if it decides to quash the challan with recorded reasons, the penalty will no longer be enforceable.The petitioner may either accept the order and pay the fine within 30 days of it being uploaded on the portal or file an application before a court after depositing 50 per cent of the penalty amount. If the individual neither pays the fine nor contests the challan in court within 30 days of receiving the order, the challan will be deemed accepted.",Road transport ministry proposes changes to MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.

JAIPUR: Princely states are long gone, but the ‘Maharaj’ has lingered.Now, Rajasthan high court has drawn a line.Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal directed descendants of the former Jaipur royal family to drop the prefixes “Maharaj” and “Princess” from their ongoing petitions or see their 24-year-old case dismissed. The court set Oct 13 as the final deadline.One week’s time is granted to the petitioners to file a correct amended cause title deleting the prefix Maharaj and Princess from the names of the petitioners and respondent, Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal said on Friday.Failure to comply, the court warned, would mean automatic dismissal “without reference to the court”.The directive came while hearing petitions filed in 2001 by legal heirs of late Jagat Singh and Prithviraj Singh, descendants of the erstwhile Jaipur royal family, challenging the collection of house tax by municipal authorities.The judge questioned the relevance of royal honorifics in today’s republic, pointing out that princely privileges were abolished decades ago. The court asked bluntly why such titles should continue to appear in legal proceedings.In Jan 2022, the Jaipur bench raised similar objections in a related case, seeking responses from both the Union and Rajasthan governments over the continued use of royal designations. Earlier, Jodhpur principal seat of the high court had also flagged the same concern in multiple petitions.",Rajasthan high court has directed descendants of former Jaipur royal family to drop the prefixes “Maharaj” and “Princess” from their ongoing petitions.

‘Truth Will Come Out’: Vijay Releases First Video Message After Karur Stampede Tragedy

KARUR: Tamil Nadu police charged the driver of actor-politician Vijay's bus with negligent driving, a day after Madras high court questioned why no FIR was filed over two alleged hit-and-run accidents involving the convoy of the TVK chief's campaign during the September 27 Karur stampede that killed 41 people.Inspector RS Om Prakash said a case was registered against the campaign bus driver under Section 281 of BNS, which deals with rash driving or riding on a public way that endangers life. Asked why no separate case was filed under provisions specific to hit-and-run, he said Section 281 ""also covers that aspect"", but declined to elaborate.HC had earlier said: ""Media footage shows the bus carrying Vijay was involved in an accident where two motorcycles were hit. The driver, after seeing the accident, fled the scene. A similar collision at the rear of the bus is also visible. In both cases, FIRs have not been registered.""A police SIT formed to probe the stampede began its work Sunday. Headed by IG Asra Garg, the team inspected the Velusamypuram rally site.

NEW DELHI: Cuttack remained tense on Sunday following new incidents of violence linked to a group clash during a Durga idol immersion procession two days ago.Due to the tense law and order situation, the state government suspended internet services from 7 pm on Sunday to 7 pm on Monday in areas under Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the nearby 42 Mauza region to curb the spread of misinformation.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had organised a motorcycle rally on Sunday evening despite orders from the district administration. Officials said CCTV cameras along the route were damaged and shops in the Gourishankar Park area were set on fire after police tried to stop the procession.According to PTI, the rally began at Bidyadharpur on the city’s eastern outskirts and moved through key areas, including the Dargah Bazar locality where the previous violence occurred, before ending at Sector 11 of CDA. Participants were heard chanting “Jai Shri Ram” as they moved through the city.Odisha's CM Mohan Charan Majhi, in a statement issued by the chief minister’s office, expressed sorrow over the disturbances. “Cuttack is a thousand-year-old city known for its brotherhood. Due to the actions of some miscreants, the peace of the city has been disturbed in recent days,” he said. He added that the government was monitoring troublemakers closely and strict action would be taken against them as per the law.BJD chief Naveen Patnaik also expressed concern over the situation, saying Odisha has a reputation as a peace-loving state.Meanwhile, the VHP has announced a 12-hour bandh in Cuttack on Monday to protest the clash during the Durga immersion procession.The original clashes broke out around 1.30 am to 2 am on Saturday near Haathi Pokhari in Dargah Bazar as the immersion procession moved towards Debigara on the Kathajodi river banks. Officials said the violence started after locals objected to high-decibel music. The confrontation escalated when a mob began pelting stones and glass bottles from rooftops, injuring several revellers, including Cuttack DCP Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo.

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies suspect that last month’s attack on an Assam Rifles convoy in Nambol, Manipur, may have been a politically motivated “contract killing.” Officials, quoted by PTI, say it could have been aimed at destabilising the state’s fragile situation, undermining President’s rule.Officials alleged that certain vested interests could be seeking to weaken President’s rule, which has helped curb severe ethnic violence in the state. According to them, these groups are promoting the view that the present administration is ineffective and pushing for the immediate reinstatement of the suspended state assembly.The attack, which killed two Assam Rifles personnel on September 19, was unusual as the PLA, a banned valley-based insurgent group, did not claim responsibility—breaking its 48-year tradition of owning operations. PTI Sources indicate the PLA leadership may have been unaware of or had not sanctioned the assault.In a major crackdown following the attack, security forces arrested 15 PLA members, including key suspects Thoungram Sadananda Singh alias Purakpa (18) and Khomdram Ojit Singh alias Keilal (47), within 72 hours of the incident. Authorities recovered six weapons likely stolen from a police armoury during earlier ethnic clashes and a van believed to have been used in the ambush.The Nambol attack, carried out in Sabal Leikai where the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) is not in force, marked the first assault on central forces since the outbreak of ethnic clashes between Meiteis and Kuki-Zos in May 2023. Naib Subedar Shyam Gurung and Rifleman Ranjit Singh Kashyap were killed when their vehicle was attacked en route from Patsoi to the Nambol base.Officials are also probing potential political support for the PLA, particularly following the UNLF’s recent announcement to cease hostilities and join the Union Home Ministry’s Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement. Analysts warn that disaffected members of PLA, UNLF, KYKL, and PREPAK could exploit the ceasefire to target civilians.Thoungram Sadananda Singh had previously been with the UNLF before transferring to the PLA. The PLA, originally known as ‘Polei’, seeks Manipur’s independence and a separate Meitei homeland in the Imphal Valley. Other insurgent groups, including KYKL, PREPAK, and KCP, maintain significant presence in the valley and along the India-Myanmar border.Manipur has witnessed sustained ethnic tensions since May 2023, resulting in over 260 deaths and nearly 50,000 displaced, driven by disputes over land rights and political representation.","Intelligence agencies suspect that last month’s attack on an Assam Rifles convoy in Nambol, Manipur, may have been a politically motivated “contract killing” Officials say it could have been aimed at destabilising the state’S fragile situation.

AI 117 incident

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP), a pilots’ body, on Sunday called for a thorough inspection of the electrical systems of all Boeing 787 planes operating in India “in the interest of air safety. ”The FIP’s appeal to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) comes a day after an Air India Boeing 787 flight from Amritsar to Birmingham deployed emergency turbine power while preparing to land in the UK city. The incident, too, comes just months after another Air India Boeing 787 operating between India and the UK (Ahmedabad-London) crashed minutes after take-off in one of India’s worst aviation disasters.“It is pertinent to note that the incident (Amritsar–Birmingham) is another pointer towards the Air India crash of B-787 aircraft. Thus, in the interest of air safety, FIP insists that DGCA must thoroughly check and investigate the electrical system of B-787 aircraft in the country,” the Federation said in its letter to the DGCA, according to PTI.“There have been numerous incidents on the B-787 aircraft. We have strongly taken up with the Civil Aviation Ministry and Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) to thoroughly check the electrical system of all B-787 planes in the country,” the letter stated.The pilots’ body also highlighted that ever since the AI-171 (Ahmedabad–London) crash on June 12, it has been constantly urging a comprehensive review of the Boeing 787 electrical systems. “Subsequent to the crash, DGCA checked only the fuel control switches of B-787 in Air India (fleet),” it added.The latest incident involved the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of Air India flight AI 117 — a Boeing 787 Dreamliner — deploying during the flight's final approach, at around 400 feet, just seconds before landing. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for further checks. Notably, RAT had also deployed seconds after the ill-fated AI 171 lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.“The operating crew of flight AI-117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine RAT during its final approach. All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing,” the airline said in a statement.The RAT is a last-resort emergency power system that deploys automatically in the event of a dual engine failure or total electronic or hydraulic failure, using wind speed to generate emergency power.Engine or hydraulic/electrical failure or software malfunction are being cited as among the several probable causes of the AI 171 crash that killed 260 people, of whom 241 were onboard the flight.","The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP), a pilots’ body, on Sunday called for a thorough inspection of the electrical systems of all Boeing 787 planes operating in India.

NEW DELHI: Amid the controversy over deaths of children in parts of Madhya Pradesh, allegedly due to consumption of sub-standard cough syrup, Union health secretary Punya Salila Srivastava on Sunday asked states/UTs to ensure strict compliance with Revised Schedule M – updated Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) — by all drug manufacturers.Srivastava, at a meeting with top health officials from all states/UTs, which was also attended by the chief of Indian Council for Medical Research and Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), directed rational use of cough syrups, particularly for children, as most coughs are self-limiting and do not require pharmacological treatment.Health ministry sources said the matter had been earlier reviewed by Union health minister J P Nadda, who had directed that the matter be discussed with states/UTs to ensure necessary action.Metropolitan Surveillance Unit (MSU), Nagpur, established under Pradhan Mantri-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM), had reported a cluster of cases and related deaths from a block in Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh a few days ago.The samples of 19 medicines which had been consumed by the children were collected from treating private practitioners and nearby retail stores. Health ministry said chemical analysis so far indicates that nine out of 10 samples meet quality standards.However, one of them, viz cough syrup ‘Coldrif’, contained Diethylene Glycol — contaminant known to cause serious kidney injury if used in higher proportions — beyond the permissible limit.“Cancellation of manufacturing licence of the unit that supplied the specific batch of the drug has been recommended by CDSCO based on inspection findings. Criminal proceedings have also been initiated,” the ministry said.DCGI Dr Rajeev Raghuvanshi reiterated the need for drug manufacturing units to strictly comply with Revised Schedule M for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).He noted that certain firms which had applied for the government’s infrastructure upgrade have been given an extension till December.","Health ministry sources said the matter had been earlier reviewed by Union health minister J P Nadda.

'Doesn't befit him': Kiren Rijiju on Rahul Gandhi's 'call' to Gen Z; says youth support PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doesnt-befit-rahul-gandhi-to-speak-of-gen-z-kiren-rijiju-on-lop-says-youth-stand-with-pm-modi/articleshow/124321289.cms,"Kiren Rijiju and Rahul Gandhi (File photos)

NEW DELHI: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said it doesn’t “befit” the Lok Sabha’s leader of opposition, Rahul Gandhi , to speak of Gen Z, saying that it was the young generation which ousted the Congress from power.Rijiju added that the youth support Prime Minister Narendra Modi .""It doesn't befit Rahul Gandhi to speak of Gen Z. The young generation has ousted them (Congress) from power. Gen Z means the new mindset of a new generation – it stands with PM Modi. India's Gen Z is against the control of this country in the hands of one party, one family. It is against corruption... Gen Z's anger is directed towards those who are not capable but want to run the Government, against the family that has captured the party. Our government is dedicated to people. Gen Z is against the Congress,"" the parliamentary affairs minister told ANI.The phrase “Gen Z” entered India’s political lexicon after youth-led protests led to a change of government in neighbouring Nepal.On September 18, just after his second round of presentation on alleged poll fraud, Gandhi had called on India’s Gen Z to “protect the Constitution” and pledged his support to them in stopping “vote chori (vote theft).”Responding to this, Rijiju said, ""Now, when they can't win elections, they abuse the Election Commission, put allegations of 'vote chori'. Youth are connected with Modi ji, the country stands with Modi ji.""In his first press conference in August, Gandhi had alleged electoral malpractice in the Mahadevapura assembly segment in Bengaluru, in Congress-ruled Karnataka. In the second, he focused on the Aland assembly seat, also in Karnataka.The Election Commission, which Gandhi has accused of indulging in ""vote chori"" to benefit the ruling BJP, has dismissed his allegations.Meanwhile, Gandhi has been teasing a “hydrogen bomb” after his “atom bomb” claims in the first press conference.","Kiren Rijiju: It doesn't befit Rahul Gandhi to speak of Gen Z.

‘Indira never spoke outside’: Kiren Rijiju slams Rahul Gandhi over Colombia comments; questions Congress’s free speech usage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indira-never-spoke-outside-kiren-rijiju-slams-rahul-gandhi-over-colombia-comments-questions-congresss-free-speech-usage/articleshow/124321097.cms,"Kiren Rijiju (File - ANI)

NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his recent remarks made during a visit to Colombia, claiming that he is the first leader of opposition (LoP) to speak against India on foreign soil.In an interview to ANI, the parliamentary affairs minister said, “Even Indira Gandhi ji was LoP after losing elections, but she never spoke about the country outside. All other LoPs after her - whether it is Lal Krishna Advani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sushma Swaraj, Sharad Pawar - never did that.”“Show me one LoP who has ever gone outside India and made statements against the country or the Government. Rahul Gandhi is the first LoP who goes abroad and speaks against the country, our system and our democracy,” Rijiju added.The remarks come after Rahul, while speaking at an event at EIA University in Colombia on Thursday, said, “India has strong capabilities in areas like engineering and healthcare, so I am very optimistic about the country. But at the same time, there are also flaws in the structure that India has to correct. The biggest challenge is the attack on democracy taking place in India.”Rijiju alleged that Rahul's comments misrepresent India and could harm its global image.“Our LoP went abroad and said that India cannot be a global leader. The problem is that if people abroad get the impression that everyone in India is like Rahul Gandhi, it would tarnish the country's reputation,” he said.“There are intelligent people in our country, we have good leaders and people with good ideology. But if Rahul Gandhi speaks like this, people would think that such people are higher in number in India. This is not right,” Rijiju added.The Union minister also rejected Congress’s allegations of curbs on free speech, saying that the party was misusing the idea of freedom of expression for political purposes. “From morning to evening, they keep on abusing PM Modi and say there is no freedom to speak. They want to misuse this freedom of expression to such an extent that they want to split the nation,” he said.Rijiju further claimed that some leaders advocating for free speech are those who, according to him, have supported divisive causes. “Those who talk about freedom of speech are the people who want to separate Jammu and Kashmir and the North East from the nation,” he said.He emphasised that the BJP’s response to Rahul’s remarks is not personal. “We have nothing to do with him personally. He is LoP... If he speaks irresponsibly, we will not like it,” Rijiju said.","Kiren Rijiju claims that Rahul Gandhi is the first leader of opposition to speak against India on foreign soil.

Brett Phillips: A career built on heart and hustle



Numbers that tell Brett Phillips' story



Brett Phillips, the fan-favorite outfielder known for his infectious energy and clutch moments, has officially announced his retirement from professional baseball. In a heartfelt post on Instagram, the 31-year-old shared his gratitude for the sport, his teammates, and fans, marking the end of an illustrious journey in MLB.Phillips first broke into the majors in 2017, quickly earning a reputation not only for his athletic skill but for his electric personality both on and off the field. His most iconic moment came during the 2020 World Series, when his game-winning hit for the Tampa Bay Rays became an instant classic. That play cemented his place in baseball lore and showcased the spirit that defined his career.In his Instagram announcement, Phillips wrote, “To my teammates, as I look back on my career I can say with certainty that you all made my time in professional baseball the most fun and I appreciate each and every one of you for how you treated and welcomed me, thank you!""Beyond his on-field heroics, Phillips was celebrated for his approachable nature. His lighthearted moments, from playful interviews to engaging with fans during games, made him one of the sport’s most relatable figures. Players like him remind us that baseball is more than numbers and trophiesOver his eight-year major league career, Phillips played for five teams: the Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, Tampa Bay Rays, Baltimore Orioles, and Los Angeles Angels. He appeared in 397 games, recorded 23 home runs, and drove in 79 RBIs with a career batting average of .188. Although his offensive numbers were modest, Phillips carved out a niche with his outstanding defense—posting a lifetime fielding percentage above .985—and his speed and versatility across the outfield.What separated him, however, was his ability to deliver when it mattered most. His 2020 postseason heroics earned him a place in baseball history, and his fearless diving catches and cannon-like arm routinely made highlight reels. Phillips also became known for his humor and humility, connecting with fans through lighthearted interviews and viral moments, from fake mound visits to playful celebrations.Also Read: Chaos hits Red October as Bryce Harper's family expands with fourth child ahead of NLDS","Brett Phillips announced his retirement from professional baseball on Instagram.

"Security tightened at Amarnath Yatra: Surveillance drones, bomb squads deployed; 50,000 CRPF personnel to secure route",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/security-tightened-at-amarnath-yatra-surveillance-drones-bomb-squads-deployed-50000-crpf-personnel-to-secure-route/articleshow/121703186.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Surveillance drones, bomb disposal squads and canine teams will be deployed along the two designated routes of the Amarnath Yatra , as part of heightened security measures that also include the highest ever deployment of CRPF personnel for the 38-day event.Nearly 50,000 CRPF personnel, in addition to the J&K police, will fan across the route of the yatra, engaging in road opening (ROP) duties to detect and defuse IEDs, besides having quick action teams stationed at vantage points. All approach roads and routes to the national highway will be blocked when the yatri convoys, escorted by CRPF troops who will be equipped with satellite phones, will pass through. All convoys will have jammers.The Amarnath yatra, which is much shorter than its 52-day edition last year, comes in the wake of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which killed 25 tourists and a local, and led to retaliatory strikes on terror bases in Pakistan as part of Operation Sindoor. When the Pakistani forces hit back by trying to target civilian settlements and military assets here, the Indian armed forces responded with full force, carrying out precision strikes on several military targets in Pakistan.Like the past year, there will be radio frequency IDs for both the yatris and convoy vehicles, to help the security forces track their onward journey and return. Drones will keep an eye on any suspicious movement along the yatra routes — both through Pahalgam and Baltal — and quick action teams will swoop in to neutralise such elements before they can strike.CRPF is already providing security to the Chenab and Anji rail bridges in J&K.Joint police control rooms will be set up along the two Amarnath pilgrimage routes for enhanced coordination among the security agencies and forces, to immediately resolve issues faced by the yatris. There will be mountain rescue teams as well to aid the yatris.Another security measure on the table is to have plain-clothed security personnel as ‘marshals’ in the buses carrying the yatris.","Nearly 50,000 CRPF personnel, in addition to the J&K police, will fan across the route of the yatra.

Amit Shah honours police team that scalped Basavaraju,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-honours-police-team-that-scalped-basavaraju/articleshow/121702762.cms,"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Saturday met and felicitated officers of the Chhattisgarh police who had played a key role in the recent anti-Naxal operations in Bijapur and Narayanpur, which led to the elimination of top CPI(Maoist) leader Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju and 57 others.Taking to ‘X’ platform later, Shah stated: “Met the officers who played a crucial role in the recent anti-Naxal operations and congratulated them on the historic success of these operations. I am eager to meet the brave jawans who made these operations successful with their courage and will soon visit Chhattisgarh to meet them. The Modi government is committed to freeing India from the menace of Naxalism.”The officers honoured by Shah here – in the presence of Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai and deputy chief minister Vijay Kumar Sharma -- include Chhattisgarh DGP Arun Dev Gautam, ADGP (anti-Naxal ops) Vivekanand, IGP (Bastar Range) Sundarraj P, SP Narayanpur Prabhat Kumar, SP Bijapur Jitendra Yadav and SP of Naxal-free Bastar district Shalabh Singh.As part of stepped up offensive in the Maoists’ last bastions, Chhattisgarh police and CRPF, in coordination with other state police, BSF and Indian Air Force, had undertaken a 21-day operation in April-May in Karreguttalu Hills on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border. The operation led to the neutralisation of 31 Naxalites, including some senior cadres of the dreaded People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) Battalion No.1, and the recovery of a huge cache of arms and Maoists’ supplies.In another intelligence-based operation in Narayanpur on May 21, personnel from district reserve guard (DRG) of Chhattisgarh police eliminated the most-wanted Naxal leader – CPI(Maoist) general secretary Basavaraju – and 26 other Naxalites.In May and June (so far), 65 Maoists – including Basavaraju and central committee member Sudhakar – have been eliminated in Chhattisgarh.So far this year, bodies of 192 Maoists neutralised in intelligence-based operations have been recovered in Bastar range, as compared to 217 in entire 2024. Also, 555 Naxals surrendered in this area in the first five months of 2025 and 420 were arrested. As many as 183 arms and 674 IEDs were recovered in the same period.",Home minister Amit Shah felicitated officers of the Chhattisgarh police who had played a key role in the recent anti-Naxal operations in Bijapur and Narayanpur.

"Rahul's claims absurd, bring into disrepute Cong's own polling reps, say EC officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahuls-claims-absurd-bring-into-disrepute-congs-own-polling-reps-say-ec-officials/articleshow/121702679.cms,"Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Election Commission officials on Saturday slammed Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi for accusing it of “fixing” Maharashtra polls, saying that the “absurd” allegations – already dismissed in a letter to the Congress dated Dec 24, 2024 – not only demotivate lakhs of govt staff who work untiringly to deliver transparent elections but also “bring into disrepute” party’s own representatives from the polling station to the constituency level.“Any misinformation being spread, by anyone, is a sign of disrespect towards the law, under which polls are held. After an unfavourable verdict by the voters, trying todefame the Election Commission by saying that it is compromised, is completely absurd,” an EC functionary told TOI.EC also found it strange that the LoP, instead of directly writing to the EC, has thus far chosen to air his grievances at various other forums – party meetings, Lok Sabha, even interactions on foreign soil and, now, an Op-Ed article. “If he is aggrieved, why is he shying from write to EC directly or seeking a meeting?” asked the functionary mentioned above.On Rahul faulting the appointment process of CEC and election commissioners, officials underlined that it was only under Modi govt that the law was amended to allow LoP a say in the appointments. “All CECs and election commissioners under previous Cong govts were appointed at the sole will of the Executive,” said an officer.Stating that Rahul, in his Op-ED article, has only harped on the allegations denied by the poll panel in December 2024, with additional clarifications published in TOI on April 22, EC officials rejected his charge of extraordinary surge in last two hours. It emphasised that over 6.4 crore electors in Maharashtra, who reached the polling station from 7 am to 6 pm on November 20, 2024, had voted. Thus, about 58 lakh votes were polled per hour on an average. “Going by these average trends, nearly 116 lakh voters could have voted in the last two hours. Therefore, casting of 65 lakh votes by electors in two hours is much below the average hourly voting trends,” an EC functionary pointed out.As regards the anomalies alleged by Rahul in roll revision, the functionary underlined that over 27,000 booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by the Congress were actively involved at every step of the summary revision of Maharashtra rolls ahead of the state polls, including raising claims and objections against the draft roll.Interestingly, while electors increased by 8.1% in Maharashtra since the last assembly poll, the corresponding rise was 13.4% for Jharkhand and 16.2% for Telangana. Congress won both Jharkhand (in alliance with JMM) and Telangana polls.Even after the final roll was published with a total 9.7 crore electors and its copies shared with all political parties including the Congress – allowing them to file two-point appeals, if dissatisfied – only 89 appeals were filed before the first appellate authority (district magistrate) and one before the second (chief electoral officer). “It is thus amply clear that there was no grievance of Congress or any other political party before the conduct of Maharashtra polls,” said the EC functionary.As regards allegations of irregularities in polling, EC officials shared that polling agents of all candidates and parties, including Congress, were present at the polling stations. “Congress’s nominated candidates or their authorized agents did not raise any substantiated allegations with regard to any kind of abnormal voting at the time of scrutiny before the returning officer and the election observers,” said an officer.“It appears that all these facts brought to the Congress notice by EC in its letter dated December 24, 2024, have completely been ignored,” said an EC functionary.","Election Commission officials slammed Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi for accusing it of “fixing’ Maharashtra polls. “Any misinformation being spread, by anyone, is a sign of disrespect towards the law, under which polls are held.

Government approves shifting of Gurgaon’s Kherki Daula toll plaza on Delhi-Jaipur NH to Pachgaon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-approves-shifting-of-gurgaons-kherki-daula-toll-plaza-on-delhi-jaipur-nh-to-pachgaon/articleshow/121702665.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government has approved shifting of Gurgaon’s Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Delhi-Jaipur National Highway (NH-48) to Pachgaon, a place beyond Manesar, paving the way for easy commute for lakhs of office goers.When the plaza is moved to Pachgaon, over 15 kilometres from Gurgaon, commuters travelling between Delhi and Manesar also won’t have to pay toll. Locals have been demanding its removal since 2014.TOI has learnt that Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has approved the plan, and to ensure the new spot doesn’t see any congestion, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will go for Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) toll collection system. For the new facility, the Haryana government has provided nearly 28 acres of land to the highway authority, sources said.The process of shifting and starting the MMLF system to collect toll at Pachgaon may take around six months. “Pachgaon is the ideal location as it falls beyond Gurgaon and Manesar. Since there is an interchange of the Western Peripheral Expressway and the NH-48 at Pachgaon, the new toll collection point couldn’t have been beyond the intersection,” a source said.In the MMLF system, vehicles don’t need to stop as overhead cameras installed for each lane will read the vehicle registration number and automatically deduct the charge from the FASTag wallet linked to the vehicle.Sources said a decision has also been taken to have an integrated system to ensure that traffic coming from the Dwarka Expressway side and heading towards Jaipur don’t end up paying toll at this point once again as user fee. “This is very much possible. Once the annual toll pass for private vehicles is rolled out most of the issues will be resolved automatically,” said a source.The shifting of the toll plaza will end conflicts between operators and people from areas adjoining Kherki Daula, and fulfil the promise the Haryana and central governments have been making for the past seven to eight years.Locals have been demanding that the NHAI shift the toll plaza citing that the govt has recovered more than the investment made in constructing the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway by private players and the highway authority.In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha in March, the road transport ministry said against Rs 2,489 crore incurred as cost for the NH-48’s Delhi-Gurgaon stretch, the toll collection has been around Rs 2,775 crore, around 11% more than the investment.After completion of this 27-km Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, commuters were paying user fees at Sirhaul (Delhi-Gurgaon border) and Kherki Daula toll plazas. Tolling was stopped at the Delhi-Gurgaon border in 2014, bringing relief to commuters travelling between Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and Kherki Daula. However, those going beyond this point paid toll for the entire stretch. At present, NHAI collects toll through its agency.Meanwhile, sources said the decision to shift the Kherki Daula toll plaza by the road transport ministry will create more pressure on the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to do away with physical entry fee collection booths on the capital’s borders to prevent congestion. Traffic jams at these places defeat the purpose of huge investment in building highways and expressways for faster connectivity to Delhi.","The government has approved shifting of Gurgaon’s Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Delhi-Jaipur National Highway (NH-48) To ensure the new spot doesn’t see any congestion, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will go for Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) toll collection system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121702670,imgsize-1905676,width-400,resizemode-4/121702670.jpg"

Musk vs Trump: Did Vivek Ramaswamy 'Doge' a bullet by getting out in time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-vs-trump-did-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-a-bullet-by-getting-out-in-time/articleshow/121664165.cms,"Trump WIPES OUT Elon Musk's $15 BILLION In Just 6 Minutes; Tesla Shares Tank, MAYHEM At Wall Street

Elon Musk EXPOSES Donald Trump-Epstein Link From 1992 Video: Mar-a-Lago Tapes Go Viral





In Washington’s latest episode of Tech Titans vs MAGA Caesar, D onald Trump has turned on Elon Musk —his former bromantic partner-in-disruption, SpaceX messiah, and self-appointed guardian of Western civilisation. The trigger? Musk labelled Trump’s much-hyped One Big Beautiful Bill “a disgusting abomination” and warned that America was hurtling toward “debt slavery. ”Trump, never one to take offence lightly—or privately—responded with a MAGA-flavoured blitzkrieg. Contracts for Musk’s companies? At risk. His reputation in conservative circles? Torched. “Just another whiny billionaire,” Trump sneered, “who forgot who made him matter.”As the Trump-Musk bromance dissolves faster than a Tesla on Autopilot in Washington traffic, one man watches the fireworks from a safe, well-lit distance—sipping Perrier, adjusting his campaign blazer, and thanking his stars he got out early, having clearly absorbed Sun Tzu’s timeless wisdom: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”—Vivek Ramaswamy.Also read: 'Disgusting abomination' to 'bombshell': Trump & Musk feud spirals; timeline of the public meltdown Once the philosophical darling of the new right, Ramaswamy was handed a shiny new toy in Trump’s second term—DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.A meme-ified federal Frankenstein, DOGE was Trump’s idea of bureaucratic reform through Silicon Valley swagger. Musk was the co-head. Vivek was the “sane one.” Together, they were meant to revolutionise Washington. Or at least yell at it until it agreed to be disrupted.But like any startup built on vibes and vague mission statements, DOGE began to implode before it launched. Musk wanted to fire half of Washington via app. Trump wanted press conferences with golden eagles and fog machines. And Vivek? Vivek quietly disappeared.Officially, he left to run for Ohio governor. Unofficially, insiders suggest he saw the writing on the Twitter wall —that DOGE was less a reform movement and more a digital kamikaze mission, powered by ego, caffeine, and libertarian hallucinations.And now, in hindsight, his exit looks less like a career pivot and more like a Sun Tzu manoeuvre. Because while Musk is now battling Trump, Congress, and his own booster-fuelled paranoia, Ramaswamy is free to reinvent himself as a centrist tech-whisperer in the Rust Belt. MAGA enough to get the base. Moderate enough to avoid the madness.Except MAGA, like any self-devouring revolution, doesn’t forget. Or forgive.Since stepping away from DOGE and softening his Trumpian rhetoric, Ramaswamy has found himself in the crosshairs of the same base that once anointed him their biotech Brahmin. Hardcore influencers have branded him a traitor. Conservative meme accounts now photoshop him next to Liz Cheney. And in the subterranean rage economy of right-wing internet culture, he's been rebranded from “America First entrepreneur” to “globalist plant with a Harvard tongue. ”Also read: Feud intensifies: Musk shares 1992 video; Trump seen with Jeffrey Epstein in clip The irony? The same mob now grilling Ramaswamy for “disloyalty” is turning on Musk for “disrespect.” In MAGAland, loyalty is a zero-sum blood sport, and the only acceptable exit is the one through public execution.DOGE, predictably, has become a political punchline. It was doomed from conception—run like a Reddit thread, branded like a crypto coin, and staffed by men who confuse spreadsheets with scripture. The only surprising thing is how quickly it crashed. Musk thought he could out-Trump Trump. But in MAGA-land, there can only be one sun god—and he’s orange, not emerald-mined.Ramaswamy, to his credit, didn’t wait around to become collateral damage. He understood what Musk didn’t: that proximity to Trump is radioactive. Stay too long and you mutate. Get out early and you might just survive.The result? Musk is in political freefall. Trump is in attack mode. And Ramaswamy? He’s in Ohio, sipping Perrier and talking about “innovation in public policy”—while ducking MAGA Twitter grenades and hoping they forget he ever existed.Call it foresight. Call it cowardice. Or just call it good political hygiene.Because as Sun Tzu said—he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.And in the dystopian sitcom that is American politics, that makes Vivek Ramaswamy the guy who ghosted the group chat before the firestorm—and lived to run another episode.","Vivek Ramaswamy was the co-head of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.

Nirjala Ekadashi takes place on the Ekadashi Tithi of Shukla Paksha in the month of Jyeshtha.Nirjala Ekadashi Vrat refers to the practice of fasting without consuming food or water.Devotees may drink water only after breaking their fast on Dwadashi Tithi. The fast of Nirjala Ekadashi occurs during the intense heat of summer, and those who observe it must take care of their health while observing this fast. This fast is also viewed as the most rigorous and sacred. Many devotees observe the Nirjala Ekadashi Vrat with sincere intentions and devotion, seeking the blessings of Lord Vishnu.It is also believed that those, who observe this fast, receive the benefits of all 24 Ekadashis, and Lord Vishnu grants them happiness, prosperity, and all worldly pleasures. These devotees are also liberated from all forms of suffering and attain salvation after death.According to Hindu Scriptures, Nirjala Ekadashi is one of the most potent day to worship Lord Vishnu. It is believed that once, Bheem struggled to manage his hunger while observing the Ekadashi fast but he felt quite distressed and questioned his lack of willpower, wondering why he couldn't suppress his hunger during the fast. Consequently, he resolved to consult sage Vyasa for a solution to his dilemma. Sage Vyasa recommended that he can observe the single Nirjala Ekadashi fast, which would grant him the rewards of all 24 Ekadashis. This is why it is commonly referred to as Bhimseni Ekadashi, Bhima Ekadashi, and Pandava Ekadashi.1. Devotees rise early in the morning and perform a holy bath before commencing the puja rituals.2.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru win IPL 2025 final



Why Sanskrit phrase still shines on the IPL trophy



Why IPL winners don’t keep the original cup







Since its inception in 2008, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has evolved into more than just a cricket tournament; it embodies the intersection of talent, ambition, and opportunity. Amidst the glitz, cheering crowds, and nail-biting matches, one subtle detail often escapes notice: the Sanskrit inscription etched onto the IPL trophy. The line written in Sanskrit quietly encapsulates the very spirit of the league, reflecting its mission to provide a grand stage for emerging players to shine and transform their lives through the power of performance.In 2025, the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) ended their long drought and won their inaugural IPL title, becoming the 8th title-winning team after 18 long years. However, as the camera panned over the trophy during the celebrations, fans might have caught sight of an etched line in Roman script (English letters) that stood out from the rest in terms of its age in comparison with glitz around it.The line states:Though the trophy has undergone transformations over the years, this Sanskrit phrase has been consistent subtly affirming values IPL believes in.The phrase translates to:This line isn't merely ornamented—it's philosophical and deliberate.It captures the spirit of what IPL seeks to do: providing untapped talent the opportunity to shine on the biggest platform.As per a top IPL official:Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won their first-ever IPL title by beating Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 6 runs in the 2025 final at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. In a battle between two teams that had never won the IPL, it was Rajat Patidar's RCB that kept their cool to defend a target of 191 on a demanding pitch.The win also saw a long-awaited victory for Virat Kohli, whose unwavering quest for the IPL title had finally been realised. Earlier in the season, RCB had become the first team in IPL history to win all away games in a season. They had placed second in the league standings behind Punjab but then defeated PBKS twice during the playoffs - once in the qualifier and again in the final - to secure a historic title push.Sanskrit, as an ancient language, has timeless wisdom. Inscribing a line of Sanskrit on the IPL trophy was a symbolic gesture by the organisers—paying homage to India's cultural heritage while commemorating an event followed by the world.Inscribing it in Roman script rather than Devanagari makes it readable by an international audience, yet maintaining its Indian essence.""It proves that tradition and modernity exist together. That the principles of ancient India are still relevant even in a flashy, commercialised league like the IPL,"" opined a sports culture historian.The IPL is a live party to ""Yatra Pratibha Avsara Prapnotihi."" Hundreds of cricketers have climbed from anonymity to fame due to their performances in the tournament.Surprisingly, the original IPL trophy is not kept by the winning team. After the last match, it was returned to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The champions do receive a replica to put on display, but the actual trophy stays with the BCCI as an ongoing honour. Also, the same trophy is used every year—with the name of the new champion inscribed after each season. Only when space gets exhausted on the current one is a new trophy commissioned.",Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) won their first-ever IPL title by beating Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 6 runs in the 2025 final at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium.

Mirwaiz and Hurriyat Conference chairman Umar Farooq’s family has traditionally led prayers at the mosque for generations.“It is deeply regrettable that once again, people were not allowed to offer Eid prayers at the historic Jamia Masjid,” Omar said. He expressed helplessness, saying law and order in J&K Union territory fell under the purview of lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha’s administration. “I have no idea on what grounds such decisions are made,” the CM said.Omar urged the authorities to trust J&K’s residents, saying “these are the same people who, after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, came forward and unequivocally condemned it”. The CM called on “the govt” to reconsider such actions in the future, alluding probably to the administration of the Centre-appointed LG.Mirwaiz Umar Farooq decried the mosque closure.“Yet again, Kashmir wakes up to the sad reality: no Eid prayers at Eidgah, and Jama Masjid locked down for 7th straight year. I, too, have been detained at my home. In a Muslim-majority region, Muslims are deprived of their fundamental right to pray even on their most important religious occasion celebrated across the world! What a shame on those who rule over us, and on those elected by the people who choose to remain silent as our rights are trampled over, again and again,” the Mirwaiz posted on X.J&K police and home department had not issued any statement on locking of the mosque and Mirwaiz’s detention.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti joined the condemnation, accusing the Omar-led govt of being “mere spectators”. “J&K is the only Muslim-majority region in the country, and yet it is here that a major mosque is shut down on Eid, denying people their right to offer prayers. If govt claims everything is normal in J&K, why is the Mirwaiz not allowed to offer prayers,” Mehbooba said.Asked about the restrictions, BJP functionary and J&K Waqf Board chairperson Darkshan Andrabi declined comment. “Jamia Masjid doesn’t come under Waqf Board,” she said.","Srinagar's historic Jamia Masjid locked and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq placed under house arrest on Eid-ul-Adha.

NEW DELHI: Haragobindo Das and his son Chandan Das were dragged out of their home and brutally killed with an axe in front of their family members during the communal violence that erupted in Murshidabad in April, police said in a chargesheet filed in the case.The police on Friday submitted a 900-page chargesheet before the Jangipur court, naming 13 accused in connection with the killings and the broader violence that rocked the district.According to the chargesheet, the victims, residents of Betbona village in Zafarabad, were among three people killed during the unrest, which broke out amid protests over the Waqf (Amendment) Act in the Muslim-majority district.The 13 accused have been charged under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including murder committed by a group, rioting, house-trespass, and house-breaking.

It also documents the police's efforts to track down and arrest the suspects, some of whom went into hiding immediately after the crime.The violence, which engulfed parts of Murshidabad from April 8 to 12, led to large-scale arson and destruction of property.The situation grew so volatile that the Calcutta High Court had to intervene, ordering the deployment of Central Armed Police Forces to restore order.Police have since registered over 60 FIRs across the district and arrested more than 300 individuals in connection with the riots.The trial in the Das murder case is expected to begin soon, officials said, as the court begins examining the voluminous evidence submitted by officials.","Haragobindo Das and his son Chandan Das were dragged out of their home and brutally killed with an axe in front of their family members.

Manipur cuts internet in 5 districts: Mobile services shut; crackdown follows protest flare-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manipur-cuts-internet-in-5-districts-mobile-services-shut-crackdown-follows-protest-flare-up/articleshow/121702492.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Manipur government has suspended internet and mobile data services in five key districts for five days, citing a serious law and order situation and the risk of social media being misused to spread inflammatory content. The order, issued late on 7 June by Commissioner-cum-Secretary (Home) N Ashok Kumar, affects Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Kakching and Bishnupur districts.The official directive stated, “In view of the prevailing law and order situation in the State of Manipur especially in Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Kakching & Bishnupur districts… there is apprehension that some anti-social elements might use social media extensively for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video messages inciting the passions of the public which might have serious repercussions for the law and order situation. ”The government cited an “imminent danger of loss of life and/or damage to public/private property” and the risk of “wide spread disturbances to public tranquillity and communal harmony” due to the circulation of false rumours and inflammatory material on platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter). The suspension, according to the order, covers internet and mobile data services, including VSAT and VPN, and took effect from 11:45 pm on 7 June.“The order is being passed ex-parte in view of the emergent situation,” it noted.The action followed protests on Saturday night in Imphal East and Imphal West, where demonstrators took to the streets after the arrest of a leader of the Meitei outfit Arambai Tenggol. Protesters reportedly blocked roads with burning tyres and furniture in areas like Kwakeithel and Uripok, demanding the leader’s release. In a video widely circulated online, BJP MP Leishemba Sanajaoba appeared to confront security personnel, urging them to arrest him alongside another MLA if such arrests continued.The unrest coincided with an intensified security crackdown. Police confirmed the arrest of three militants from banned groups including the Kangleipak Communist Party (Peoples' War Group) and the United People's Party of Kangleipak (UPPK). Weapons, IEDs and mortars were also recovered during search operations in multiple districts.The state remains tense amid ongoing ethnic conflict between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, which has claimed over 260 lives since May 2023. President’s rule was imposed in February this year after chief minister N Biren Singh resigned.","The order affects Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Kakching and Bishnupur districts.

Viral Dubai chocolate gets desi spin. India can’t get knafeh of it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/viral-dubai-chocolate-gets-desi-spin-india-cant-get-knafeh-of-it/articleshow/121697009.cms,"Kochi-based Paul And Mike were one of the first to launch their own take

Sometimes, a global trend finds its sweetest home far from where it began. Ashmeet Singh Dua didn’t think a viral chocolate bar with a pistachio filling from Dubai would define his five-year-old Hyderabad-based dessert brand but the kunafa pistachio chocolate bar he introduced in Sept last year did just that. “It’s become our brand identity. In Hyderabad, people already love kunafa, so this was a hit the moment we launched it,” says the chef and founder of Xocolatl.If you haven’t heard of Dubai chocolate, you probably don’t have a sweet tooth. Inspired by the traditional Middle Eastern dessert knafeh (also called kunafa), it’s become such a craze that global pistachio prices started climbing and every chocolate brand launched its own versions. Indian brands too have put their spin on it.Dua’s take on the bar uses imported kataifi pastry for the crunch, house-roasted pistachio paste and a creamy filling. He’s got a range of flavours as well: nutella, lotus biscoff, salted caramel. “We’ve had celebrities try it and it’s our best-selling product even today. Unlike other dessert fads, this one’s here to stay,” he says.At Manam Chocolate, the award-winning craft chocolate brand from Hyderabad, the Dubai chocolate bar gets a layered, decadent spin.Called ‘The Kunafa Stack’, it brings together their house-made custard, tart bursts of fresh mulberries, pistachio cake crumbs with toasted granola and chopped dates. It’s topped with crisp pistachio kataifi and a scoop of house-made gelato, and a final flourish comes with a warm pour of molten Manam chocolate.Ruby Islam, head chef at Manam Chocolate, says The Kunafa Stack was launched during Ramzan this year. “I always look forward to creating unique experiences. But it’s also important to hear what people are asking for. When the Dubai Kunafa chocolate went viral, people started asking us if we had something with crunchy pistachio and milk chocolate.” The brand is opening a New Delhi outlet this month, where this version will be available.Mumbai’s French pastry shop Le15 Patisserie has also tapped into the Dubai chocolate trend. Founder Pooja Dhingra, aka the macaron queen, tried the famed bar in Dubai earlier this year and immediately understood the hype. “It was bold, sweet, crunchy and satisfying. But I knew I wanted to reimagine it through the lens of French pastry. A tart felt like the perfect format,” says Dhingra. Her kunafa chocolate pistachio tart, launched last month, features a buttery chocolate tart shell filled with pistachio cream, toasted kunafa and dark chocolate ganache topped with a pistachio macaron. Dhingra admits that viral trends come with their own set of expectations. “Trends push you to stay current and experiment, which is fun and keeps the creative energy high. But there is a pressure to constantly be ‘new’ and sometimes, that can feel more reactive than intentional,” she says.Kochi-based Paul And Mike’s bar has a golden kataifi pastry and a pistachio-rich filling. Founder and business head Vikas Temani says openness to global trends isn’t just philosophy — it’s now an operational reality. “What virality has done is really compress the product innovation cycle. We wanted to be the first among reputed Indian chocolate brands to launch this, so we did it real quick in terms of R&D and sourcing. That also gave us a window of no competition,” he says.As kataifi pastry is hard to find, home bakers in India have substituted the ingredients with what’s locally available. Some have used roasted sevaiya noodles to recreate that signature crunch. Arun Viswanathan of Chitra’m Craft Chocolates in Coimbatore didn’t want to replicate the trending Kunafa chocolate. Instead, he used a base of nool peni — a South Indian festive sweet made with fine strands of deep-fried dough, resembling delicate vermicelli, layered with ghee and powdered sugar — and cheekily named his bar Dubai Return, almost saying we’ve been there and come back with something of our own. The nool peni is layered with pistachio, saffron, rose and a touch of gulkand (rose petal preserve). “Nool peni has a flaky, crisp texture that reminds me of kunafa. So, I thought, why not reimagine the Dubai bar with it? Our Dubai Return is familiar, yet it surprises you,” says Viswanathan, who did his chocolate training in Belgium.Poetry by Love and Cheesecake, a cafe chain in Delhi, gave the trend a seasonal spin last month with their Chocolate Mango Kunafa Cheesecake. “We’ve never done anything like this before,” says chef Amit Sharma. “But after the Dubai chocolate went viral, people got curious—now we’re seeing repeat orders and planning more Kunafa experiments.”","Dubai chocolate, inspired by Middle Eastern dessert knafeh (also called kunafa), has become a global craze.

NEW DELHI: Canadian PM Mark Carney defended the last-minute invitation to his counterpart Narendra Modi for the G7 summit , saying it made sense for Canada and other members to invite the ""5th largest economy"" and the most populous country in the world that's central to a number of supply chains.While Modi's travel programme is not finalised yet, he's expected to reach Alberta in time for the G7 outreach session on June 17.The G7 summit begins on June 15. Asked repeatedly about why Canada would have Modi over when the probe into the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar is still on, Canadian PM Mark Carney said there had been progress on law enforcement dialogue which ""recognises issues of accountability"".Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau had wrecked the India-Canada relationship by alleging the Indian govt's role in the murder without, as India continues to maintain, sharing any evidence. ""Bilaterally, we have now agreed-importantly-to continued law enforcement dialogue. So, there's been some progress on that, which recognises issues of accountability. I extended the invitation to Prime Minister Modi in that context, and he has accepted,'' said Carney, responding to questions from the media about the issue and the invitation to Modi.""We are a country of the rule of law. The rule of law is proceeding as it should in Canada, and I am not going to disrupt that process,'' he added.Carney hinted that other G7 members were keen on seeing participation by the Indian leader. ""First, we are in the role - Canada is in the role - of the G7 chair, and in those discussions, as agreed with our G7 colleagues, we're addressing important issues like energy security, the digital future, and critical minerals, among others. Partnerships in building infrastructure in the emerging and developing world are also part of the agenda,'' he said. ""In my capacity as G7 chair, and in consultation with others - some of whom also make these determinations - it makes sense to include India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, effectively the most populous country, and central to a number of those supply chains,'' he added.","Canadian PM Mark Carney defended the last-minute invitation to his counterpart Narendra Modi for the G7 summit.

HYDERABAD: In a major breakthrough, Telangana Anti Narcotics Bureau's (TGANB) investigation to trace the inter-state hawala cash trail of international drug cartels ended in a washing machine in a Goa flat, from which it seized Rs 50 lakh a few days ago.TGANB director Sandeep Shandilya, said the money, collected over just two days, was moments away from being laundered to Nigeria. ""Had we delayed the raid by an hour, the entire amount would have been transferred. It was neatly stashed inside the washing machine, ready for dispatch,"" he said.Following a month-long surveillance operation in Goa, TGANB --- assisted by Goa police --- zeroed in on hawala transactions being conducted from Sangeetha Mobile Shop in Mapusa and an apartment in Goa's Highland Park.The key accused, Uttam Singh, who runs the mobile shop, was arrested. Investigators revealed he had laundered Rs 2.1 crore of drug proceeds in just one week.""Drug money collected in cash was handed over to Uttam, often by foreign nationals. He then moved the funds to Mumbai through informal channels, and from there, it was transferred to Nigeria,"" Shandilya explained. The investigation into the hawala trail started after Nigerian national Emmanuel Bediako, alias Maxwell, revealed it to TGANB.Between May 26 and June 1, officials tracked 58 hawala transactions involving Rs 2.1 crore. A few days after establishing this link, a raid on Highland Park apartment led to the recovery of Rs 50 lakh in cash. Over the past month, four Nigerian nationals have been arrested during TGANB operations in Goa.Authorities believe Uttam is one of several hawala operators facilitating cross-border drug money transfers. Police officials suspect a wider network of hawala operators is active, working hand-in-glove with international narcotics cartels.","Telangana Anti Narcotics Bureau's investigation to trace the inter-state hawala cash trail of international drug cartels ended in a washing machine in a Goa flat. TGANB director Sandeep Shandilya, said the money, collected over just two days, was moments away from being laundered to Nigeria.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121701006,imgsize-144518,width-400,resizemode-4/121701006.jpg"
"Despite World Bank raising threshold, India achieves big dip in extreme poverty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-world-bank-raising-threshold-india-achieves-big-dip-in-extreme-poverty/articleshow/121700912.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade after the World Bank updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data in its June upgrade of the methodology.Based on the update, the latest World Bank data showed that the extreme poverty rate had declined from 27.1% in 2011-12 to 5.3% in 2022-23. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23. This would mean that nearly 270 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during the same period.In a blog, the World Bank said that the international poverty line for low-income countries has been raised to $3 per person per day from the existing $2.15 per person per day, and for lower middle-income countries it's changed from $3.65 to $4.20 per day and for upper middle-income countries it went up from $6.85 to $8.40.Given India's inflation rate, between 2017 and 2021, a revised extreme poverty line of $3 would constitute a 15% higher threshold than $2.15 expressed in 2021 prices and result in a 5.3% poverty rate in 2022-23. A new LMIC line of $4.20 would imply a 5% lower threshold for poverty than $3.65 adjusted in 2021 prices and yield a poverty rate of 23.9%, according to the World Bank.Using the new poverty line for low middle income countries (LMIC), which is at $4.20 per day per person, India's poverty rate fell to 23.9% in 2022-23 from 57.7% in 2011-12.The number of people in extreme poverty was down from 732.48 million in 2011-12 to 342.32 million in 2022-23, according to the data available on the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform.Free and subsidised food transfers supported poverty reduction, and the rural-urban poverty gap narrowed. The five most populous states account for 54% of the extremely poor, it had said.According to the poverty and equity brief published by World Bank in April, extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day) fell from 16.2% in 2011- 12 to 2.3% in 2022-23, lifting 171 million people above this line. Rural extreme poverty dropped from 18.4% to 2.8% , and urban from 10.7% to 1.1% , narrowing the rural-urban gap from 7.7 to 1.7 percentage points-a 16% annual decline.The poverty report had also said India has transitioned into the lower-middle-income category. Using the $3.65 per day LMIC poverty line, poverty fell from 61.8% to 28.1%, lifting 378 million people out of poverty. Rural poverty dropped from 69% to 32.5%, and urban poverty from 43.5% to 17.2%, reducing the rural-urban gap from 25 to 15 percentage points with a 7% annual decline, the April report had said.The updated World Bank data is expected to come as a shot in the arm for the govt and bolster its record of handling the economy and pursuing policies to push inclusive growth and lift millions out of poverty.Last year, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subhramanyam had indicated that the poverty level could be less than 5% based on preliminary estimates on the household consumption expenditure (HCES) data released by the statistics office.World Bank has said that in recent years, the scope and quality of information provided by household surveys has improved enormously, particularly in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, offering a clearer view into people's welfare and day-to-day lives.Several research papers have also indicated the reduction in extreme poverty over the last decade thanks to robust growth. A survey released last year estimated poverty to have declined to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12 and pointed out that chronic poverty has come down but there is a significant proportion of people who can slip back into poverty due to ""accident of life"".World Bank, which introduced the international poverty line (IPL) in 1990, has undertaken several updates to include changing prices and costs, and the latest update was undertaken on June 5.The first update to IPL happened in 2001, with subsequent revisions in 2008, 2015, 2022, and more recently this month. This latest update, which also applies to the poverty lines for middle-income countries, follows the release last year of a new set of PPPs based on prices collected in 2021 by the International Comparison Programme.It also reflects changes in national poverty lines, which is a big reason for the increase, especially for the line that tracks extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23. This would mean that nearly 270 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during the same period.

Bengaluru stampede: Cops had warned against feting RCB at legislature,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengaluru-stampede-cops-had-warned-against-feting-rcb-at-legislature/articleshow/121700878.cms,"Sidda, DKS have blood on their hands, they're trying to wipe it on cops: BJP

Complaint Filed Against Virat Kohli Over Bengaluru Stampede | RCB | IPL | Karnataka

BENGALURU: Three days after a stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium killed 11 peopleat RCB's IPL win celebration, it emerged that senior police officer MN Karibasavana Gowda had red-flagged the risks just before the event. His written warning to top bureaucrats on June 4, the day of the tragedy, also cautioned against the felicitation at Vidhana Soudha.""Lakhs of cricket fans are likely to come to Vidhana Soudha. Since there is a shortage of security personnel, making bandobast will be a problem,"" Gowda, in-charge of security at the legislature, wrote to department of personnel and administrative reforms secretary G Sathyavathi.In the letter, which TOI is in possession of, Gowda also pointed to the venue's sensitive status and lack of adequate CCTV coverage.Hours before the surge, department of personnel and administrative reforms secretary and senior IAS officer G Sathyavathi, overseeing arrangements at Vidhana Soudha steps, publicly urged fans to head to the stadium instead - a short distance away. The team was feted at the legislature and the celebrations then moved on to the stadium. But fears of overcrowding had set in well in advance.Despite the warning, RCB's IPL victory celebrations were allegedly rushed through - less than 24 hours after the final match - without proper crowd control or safety protocols.Sources said the DCP's note was also shared with then Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda, who in turn flagged it to chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh. But permissions were still granted.Adding fuel to the political fire, Union minister and JD(S) functionary HD Kumaraswamy alleged Saturday that the celebrations were ""pre-planned"" even before RCB won. ""The FIR says permission for the June 4 event was sought on June 3 at 6pm - 90 minutes before the final even began. Did they dream about winning?"" he asked, demanding accountability from CM Siddaramaiah , deputy CM DK Shivakumar, and home minister G Parameshwara.He questioned the need for a felicitation so soon. ""Was such a slipshod felicitation needed? Who put pressure on the police commissioner at 7.30am that day for permission?""BJP's Bangalore North MP and Union minister Shobha Karandlaje echoed the outrage, calling it a ""misuse of govt space"". ""The grand stairs of Vidhana Soudha have always been used for swearing-in or state functions. You used it for a private team,"" she said.Accusing the Congress brass, Karandlaje said: ""Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar have blood on their hands. Now they're trying to wipe it on police officers. Where are KC Venugopal and Randeep Singh Surjewala hiding?""","Senior police officer MN Karibasavana Gowda had red-flagged the risks just before the event.

"Delhi AQI deteriorates again, CAQM reimposes Stage-I GRAP measures across NCR",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-aqi-deteriorates-again-caqm-reimposes-stage-i-grap-measures-across-ncr/articleshow/121696929.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: In response to a renewed spike in pollution levels, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has reimposed Stage-I measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect.The decision was announced in an official order on Saturday, after Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) climbed to 209, placing it in the ‘Poor’ category.As per the CAQM order, the Sub-Committee reviewed air quality data and forecasts from the IMD and IITM and observed a steady deterioration. “The AQI of Delhi has shown an increasing trend and has been recorded at 209 on 07.06.2025. Further, the forecast also predicts AQI to mainly remain in ‘Poor’ category in coming days,” the order stated.In light of this, the Sub-Committee has directed all agencies in NCR to invoke Stage-I actions of the extant GRAP with “immediate effect”. These include stricter monitoring of air quality levels and enhanced dust mitigation efforts, especially in Delhi-NCR. Citizens may also be urged to follow the citizen charter under Stage-I.Stage-I GRAP measures aim to prevent further air quality degradation through targeted interventions.These include enforcing dust control protocols at construction sites, promoting public transport, and regulating open waste burning.The decision comes just three weeks after Stage-I measures were revoked on May 18, when Delhi's AQI had improved to 179 and settled into the ‘Moderate’ category. The CAQM had then observed that dust pollution caused by episodic strong winds and thunderstorms had subsided, leading to better air quality.However, with levels climbing again, dust control has once more become a key focus. In May, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) made it mandatory for all construction and demolition sites to register on its Dust Portal before plan approvals.To further strengthen action, the Delhi government, in coordination with DSIIDC, has already begun deploying GPS-enabled hydraulic anti-smog gun vehicles, each capable of spraying mist up to 30 metres. These CNG-powered vehicles are operational in two shifts across industrial zones like Bawana and Narela.Reiterating the government’s dual commitment to development and environment, Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said last month, “We are taking concrete steps to minimise industrial waste and improve infrastructure so that businesses can thrive responsibly.”The CAQM has assured that it will keep a close watch on pollution levels and reassess the situation for further action based on IMD forecasts and real-time air quality data.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has reimposed Stage-I measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR.

1st passenger train to Srinagar on Saturday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1st-passenger-train-to-srinagar-on-saturday/articleshow/121659886.cms,"LUCKNOW: Neetu Sapra has bittersweet memories of the 14 years she spent in J&K since 1997.""No quarters, peak insurgency, Kargil War - it was a roller coaster,"" she says of life in a CRPF camp in Srinagar with a two-year-old son and a railway officer husband handling a project as fraught with danger as it was technically daunting. ""On a shopping trip to Lal Chowk in 1998, we narrowly escaped a bomb blast. The USBRL shaped us as much as we shaped it.""Neetu's story is intertwined with the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) that PM Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate Friday, marking the physical bridging of what was once considered a geographical implausibility: seamless rail connectivity from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.""Wives of all railway personnel associated with USBRL would have similar stories to tell,"" says Neetu, whose husband Suresh Kumar Sapra was then an executive engineer with Northern Railway.Sapra was posted in Udhampur when former PM H D Deve Gowda laid USBRL's foundation stone in Udhampur in early 1997. Many thought the task of carving a route through the undulating, terrorist-infested terrain was a fanciful idea.By April that year, India had a new PM in I K Gujral, and a second foundation ceremony was soon planned in Srinagar for the Qazigund-Baramulla section.Sapra recalls receiving an official note from his senior colleague Sandeep Gupta - the executive engineer assigned to lead the 13-strong technical team - to proceed to Srinagar for the July 12, 1997, event.With the odds as steep as the Pir Panjal, the team got cracking. ""Srinagar was synonymous with militancy. Nobody was prepared,"" Gupta, who retired as USBRL's chief administrative officer in Feb this year, writes in the 2009 TOI coffee table book, 'Linking Paradise: A Northern Railway Project'.""We had no choice but to dive in. This was bigger than us,"" he writes in the book, remembering how his team got by erratic phone and electricity connections and an inadequate number of vehicles.Sapra's trip to Srinagar from Udhampur to lay the ground for the foundation ceremony prepared him for what lay ahead.""Just 13km beyond Udhampur, we dodged the possibility of death by a few metres as a landslide occurred in front of our eyes. The national highway was blocked for 48 hours."" A week later, Gupta joined them, reaching Srinagar on a rickety van. A team from CRPF's 69th battalion was then occupying the railway-owned holiday home in Srinagar's Tulsi Bagh, leaving Gupta's team to cram into four dingy rooms within the complex.""We had only candles for light and hauled water in buckets from CRPF tankers,"" says Sapra, currently principal executive director in the Research Design and Standards Organisation in Lucknow.Living conditions and logistics remained a challenge throughout. The state power department refused to restore electricity to the railway facility, citing unpaid bills throughout a decade of unrest. It took several meetings with the then divisional commissioner of Kashmir, SL Bhat, for power supply to be restored. Mudassara, the PA to DoT's then general manager, intervened to provide landlines.On Nov 12, 1997, a railway survey team comprising two officers, three junior engineers and six helpers reached Nowgam (later named Srinagar railway station) on a cloudy, uneasy morning. Locals mistook them for a police raid party, causing an already tense situation to almost spiral out of control.""I had butterflies in my stomach due to sheer anxiety and fear,"" Gupta recalls in his essay.Every day, a road-opening party would set out ahead of the railway survey team to detect and defuse potential mines. After spending weeks studying topography sheets and working out other details, Gupta and Sapra drove the first two wooden pegs into the ground to mark the project's first alignment.""It felt like we had planted a dream,"" recalls Sapra.As winter took hold, the survey covered Pampore and Kakapora. The first snowfall of 1997 came on Nov 27. Work had to be halted by Dec 15. The team would return next April to resume work.""On our off days, we hunted for vegetarian food in Srinagar. However, the CRPF wasn't happy about our venturing out of the railways complex,"" reminisces Gupta.While surveying Anantnag, the team would run into surrendered militants still carrying AK-47s. ""They looked intimidating, but didn't do us harm; in fact, they seemed encouraging,"" says Gupta.By Oct 31, 1998, the Qazigund-Baramulla survey report was ready. The railway team didn't just beat the odds; they completed the task ahead of schedule.After the Baramulla-Qazigund section, Sapra and his colleagues were asked to survey the proposed Katra-Qazigund stretch. That was in 2001. The then rail minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation for this portion two years later.""During the survey, we closely observed how difficult life was for people of the Valley. Pregnant women, critically ill patients and elderly people would be brought down from hilly terrain on makeshift palanquins as there were no roads. Mules and horses were the only modes of transport to ferry goods,"" recalls Sapra.Just when things seemed to be going well, tragedy struck on June 25, 2004, when IRCON engineer R N Pundhir and his brother were kidnapped and killed by terrorists at Sugan in Shopian. ""It was a jolt. Work paused. But buoyed by local sympathy and police support, the railway men restarted with the same zeal,"" writes Bhanu Prakash, the then deputy chief engineer of USBRL, in his memoir.The first trial run in Oct 2008, from Budgam to Kakapora, was a milestone in more ways than one. A Hindu priest, a Muslim cleric and a Sikh granthi presided over prayers before the train rolled in at 30kmph. ""Locals lined the tracks and children skipped school to see the trial run. Even the cattle seemed puzzled!"" recounts Bhanu.By the time the Qazigund-Baramulla section was commissioned in 2009, tracks were ready for trains to run at speeds of up to 100kmph.Built at a cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, including a parallel highway, the 272km rail route has 36 tunnels and 943 bridges, including the world's highest, the Chenab Bridge.The rail route promises all-weather connectivity, slashing the 800km Delhi-Srinagar journey to under 13 hours.This isn't just a story of steel tracks, concrete arches and staggering statistics. USBRL is an odyssey of workers and officials fighting the elements, braving the threat of guns, and enduring separation from their families to finally ""connect"" Kashmir to the rest of India.",The Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) will be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on Friday. Neetu Sapra's husband Suresh Kumar Sapra was then an executive engineer with Northern Railway.

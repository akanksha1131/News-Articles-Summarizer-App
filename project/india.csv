"Government identifies 10 highway segments for zero-emission truck movement, the move to help India reach its climate goals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-identifies-10-highway-segments-for-zero-emission-truck-movement-the-move-to-help-india-reach-its-climate-goals/articleshow/121259365.cms,"India has picked 10 key highway routes for zero-emission trucks to cut freight pollution and push green logistics (Representative Image: AI-generated)

New Delhi: India has identified 10 high-impact highway segments where only zero-emission trucks (ZET) will be used for freight movement in the near future, as part of the country's larger goal for decarbonising the logistics sector, reducing air pollution, ensuring energy security and meeting the long-term climate goal of 'net zero' by 2070.These priority corridors, list of which was released by the office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to the government early this month, will be used as pilots for early ZET deployment, laying the groundwork for a dedicated national infrastructure network focusing on electric and hydrogen-based fuel technologies across all highways in the country in due course.Despite comprising only 3 per cent of all vehicles, trucks are responsible for more than one-third of transport-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the country. This is particularly concerning given that road transportation accounts for a staggering 71% of overall freight movement in India.According to the Niti Aayog estimates, the number of trucks will be increased by more than four times, from 4 million in 2022 to around 17 million by 2050. It is, therefore, important to move fast towards ZET deployment for long-term benefits and that's why the Office of the PSA has undertaken the initiative to identify the top corridors for initial deployment of such trucks in India.“These (10) corridors serve not only as the best candidates for ZET pilots, but as blueprints for the future of freight movement,” said Ajay K Sood, PSA, in his foreword to the 56-page report on India’s priority corridors for Zero-Emission Trucking .He said, “The adoption of ZET in India will play a crucial role in decarbonising the logistics sector, improving public health, enhancing energy independence, and showcasing the country’s leadership in the global transition to a net-zero future.”ZET corridors are highway segments equipped with charging or refuelling infrastructure to facilitate seamless goods movement. ""Establishing ZET corridors can help ensure the use of truck and infrastructure assets, demonstrate ZET operational and financial feasibility, help manage risks and lower costs, and unlock private capital for ZET projects,"" said the report.Efforts are already under way to kick-start ZET adoption in India as the central government has allocated Rs 500 crore for the purchase of such trucks under the Prime Minister Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) scheme.The top 10 corridors are: Delhi - Chandigarh; Delhi -Jaipur; Pune - Nashik; Dhanbad - Kolkata; Kolkata - Haldia; Vijayawada - Visakhapatnam; Bengaluru - Chennai; Chennai - Viluppuram; Coimbatore - Salem; and Coimbatore - KochiThese corridors were identified through a three-phase process: quantitative and qualitative assessment of an initial list of 230 corridors using parameters such as toll traffic data and mapping of supply/demand centres, stakeholder consultations and detailed field research.Other factors such as high freight traffic, industrial activity, availability of ancillary services, grid infrastructure readiness, corridor length relative to battery range, and strategic stakeholder inputs for commercial and business viability were also taken into account while finalising the corridors.The report, identifying the high priority corridors, was prepared with the support of Centre of Excellence for Zero Emission Trucking (CoEZET) - IIT Madras, Rocky Mountain Institute, and pManifold as knowledge partners.",India has identified 10 high-impact highway segments where only zero-emission trucks (ZET) will be used for freight movement in the near future.

India’s port curbs threaten regional trade: Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-port-curbs-threaten-regional-trade-bangladesh/articleshow/121255685.cms,"Agency photo

DHAKA: Bangladeshi exporters are raising concerns over India’s newly imposed port restrictions on key export items such as readymade garments (RMG) and processed foods, warning that the move will lead to “delays, higher costs, and disruptions” in bilateral and regional trade. While experts view the restrictions as non-tariff barriers that could significantly impact Bangladesh’s export competitiveness, the interim govt has said that any issues arising from the new measures will be addressed through dialogue, expressing hope that trade ties will remain stable.Commerce adviser SK Bashir Uddin on Sunday said the govt has not yet received any formal notification on the restrictions. Expressing optimism that trade will continue, he said, “This is in the interest of consumers and production sectors on both sides.”Meanwhile, 17 trucks carrying food products were stuck at the Burimari border due to the restrictions. These truckloads of goods were scheduled to cross the border on Sunday morning and head to Siliguri (West Bengal).A former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) said it will now take longer for Bangladeshi garments to reach their destinations than before, and costs will rise. “That means exports will decrease to some extent,” he added. “At a time when world trade is beset by various problems, such reciprocal trade restrictions will further increase the level of damage to both sides,” the exporter noted.The commerce adviser also said the govt has started assessing the potential impact of the Indian govt’s move. “We have initiated a preliminary review to determine the steps Bangladesh should consider,” he said.On Saturday, in a “retaliatory move”, the Indian govt restricted the import of several products from Bangladesh, including a ban on the entry of readymade garments through the land route.In a notification issued on Saturday, the directorate general of foreign trade, however, allowed garments, the mainstay of Bangladesh industry, to be only shipped via Nhava Sheva and Kolkata ports. While fish, edible oil, LPG and crushed stones have been spared, import of several products via all land customs stations and integrated check posts in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Changrabandha and Fulbari in West Bengal will be discontinued.","Bangladeshi exporters are raising concerns over India’s newly imposed port restrictions on key export items.

IMPHAL/NEW DELHI: Security forces in Manipur have arrested more than 350 insurgents during intensified crackdown on extortion rackets that have taken an unusual turn, with groups mainly from the Valley now demanding money to resolve matrimonial disputes, along with traditional targets like property and “cuts” in govt tenders, officials said on Sunday. The insurgents were picked from mid-Feb this year after the imposition of President’s rule in the state.A clear instruction has been issued by the governor’s administration to the general public to report any extortion attempts to police or face legal consequences for aiding the insurgents.The officials said investigations against the more than 350 people arrested in the crackdown indicate that insurgent groups, feeling the pressure from security forces post-President’s rule, are becoming more desperate for funds and more brazen in their methods.The majority of insurgents have been nabbed from Imphal East, followed by Imphal West in the valley. It's just about money, and for that, they settle personal scores, family feuds and even matrimonial disputes. If you have a problem, and you have the right connections, they become your ‘solution’ but for a price, of course, the officials said.Recently, a person codenamed ‘Tiger’ was picked up from Imphal East by Manipur police while he was busy settling a matrimonial dispute with family members of a bride and groom, the officials said. Later, he was identified as Laishram Ramesh Singh, belonging to the banned United National Liberation Front (UNLF). During preliminary verification, he told the police that he joined the organisation in Sept 2024 and is presently working in its “finance section”.The officials said he confessed to being involved in extortion activities by serving monetary demands and threats and by collecting money from government officials located in and around the Imphal area, besides collecting “cuts” from business houses who had been allotted various government tenders.Two mobile handsets and Rs 21,50,000 of extortion money were recovered from him.The officials said the insurgent groups were exploiting technology and one of the tactics involved obtaining SIM cards with false documentation from any northeastern state and using them to make Voice over Internet Protocol calls routed through Wi-Fi networks.","Security forces in Manipur have arrested more than 350 insurgents during intensified crackdown on extortion rackets.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today. We will give an answer to that on July 31, when this petition along with the pending one would be taken up for hearing.” Gonsalves said this would allow govt to deport more Rohingyas, whose number exceed 8,000 in different parts of the country and 800 of them are in Delhi.","Supreme Court irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims.

BENGALURU: A resident at Prestige Sunrise Park in Electronics City phase 1 in Bengaluru has been paying daily penalties of Rs 100 for maintaining his shoe rack outside his flat.The residential complex, comprising 1046 units, launched an initiative to remove all personal items, including shoe storage units, plants in pots and storage cabinets from common areas. Nearly 50% of residents were found to have placed their belongings outside, violating established guidelines.The Residents' Association distributed notices and engaged in thorough communication with occupants, requesting removal of items. They provided a reasonable timeline of two months for compliance. Despite initial opposition, the majority of residents complied with the directive.Approximately four weeks later, all but two residents had cleared their belongings from the corridors. One resident eventually complied after continuous reminders. The second resident remained adamant about keeping the shoe rack outside.This resident even made an advance payment of rupees 15,000, requesting it be applied towards future penalties and asked to be left undisturbed.Despite escalating fines, the resident continued paying while refusing to remove the shoe rack.""He has paid a fine of Rs 24,000 over the last eight months,"" Arun Prasad, president of the association told TOI, adding the association is planning to raise the daily penalty from Rs 100 to Rs 200 to address this specific situation.Fire safety regulations stipulate that corridors in high-rise buildings must remain clear of obstacles to facilitate safe evacuation during emergencies.","A resident at Prestige Sunrise Park in Electronics City phase 1 in Bengaluru has been paying daily penalties of Rs 100 for maintaining his shoe rack outside his flat.

Short circuit turned get-together into tragedy

None of 17 Hyd fire victims taken to hospitals could be revived

HYDERABAD: A century-old three-storey Hyderabad building close to the iconic Charminar caught fire early Sunday, killing 17 members across three generations of a jeweller’s family that had assembled in their ancestral home for what was to be a weekend get-together.Patriarch Prahlad Modi , whose roots in Gulzar Houz go back to the Nizam era, and eight children were among the victims, ranging from 2 to 73 years old. They died either from burn injuries or asphyxiation, officials said.Four family members, two of whom were not at home, and some of their workers survived the 6am blaze, suspected to have been caused by an electrical short circuit. Fire engines needed more than two hours to douse the flames, by which time much of the residential-cum-commercial building had been gutted.Fire brigade officials identified the main electrical panel on the ground floor that houses three jewellery stores of the family as the source of the fire. One of the stores had been in business since 1906.“Sparks caused by the short circuit in the main electrical line spread through the wooden panel and triggered a blast in the compressor unit of one of the ACs, resulting in the blaze growing,” director general of fire services Y Nagi Reddy said. “Since the building has only one entrance and exit, and the staircase is very narrow, residents couldn’t escape. The smoke further made it difficult for them to navigate their way out.”Nagi Reddy said 11 fire engines, a firefighting robot, 17 officers and 70 personnel were deployed to rescue survivors and douse the flames. He contested allegations by relatives of the dead about a delayed response. “We received a call at 6.16am and immediately rushed our teams to the fire scene,” the DG said.Charminar police station registered a fire accident case based on a complaint by a relative of Prahlad Modi.None of the 17 victims who had been taken to different hospitals – Osmania General Hospital, Apollo Hospital and Yashoda Hospital – could be revived. They were all cremated in the evening.Residents of the Gulzar Houz neighbourhood recalled hearing ominous noises from the building where Prahlad Modi lived with his wife Munni and others soon after the fire broke out. “By the time we reached the site, the entire building was engulfed in flames. There was little hope of anyone surviving,” said Mir Zahid, a neighbour.PM Narendra Modi announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each of the deceased from the PM’s National Relief Fund. “Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to a fire tragedy in Hyderabad, Telangana. Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon,” he wrote on X.Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy, too, announced Rs 5 lakh in ex gratia to the victims’ immediate families.Prahlad Modi and his family migrated to Hyderabad from Rajasthan decades ago and have been based in Gulzar Houz since. The extended clan, now spread across the city, would often meet at the patriarch’s home, sources said.","Patriarch Prahlad Modi and eight children were among the victims, ranging from 2 to 73 years old.

Right to shelter

is fundamental right: CJI on bulldozer justice

MUMBAI: Amidst the debate over the timelines set by the SC for governors and the President, Chief Justice of India Bhushan Gavai on Sunday said neither the judiciary nor the executive or the legislature had an upper hand, but rather it is the Constitution of India that is “supreme” and “all the three wings have to work together as per the Constitution.The statement comes barely days after President Droupadi Murmu sent a 14-point Presidential Reference to SC asking if the court can “impose” timelines and prescribe the conduct of governors and the President when handling state bills sent for assent or reserved for consideration. Centre had accused SC of stepping into executive domain.Justice Gavai, who took oath as the 52nd CJI last week, was speaking at a felicitation function organised by the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa . Justice Gavai said, “The basic structure is strong, and all three pillars of the Constitution are equal. And all the organs of the Constitution must reciprocate and give due respect to each other,” he said.Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, but it cannot touch the “basic structure”, he said. The ‘basic structure’ doctrine holds that certain fundamental features of the Constitution, such as its supremacy, the rule of law, and independence of the judiciary, cannot be amended or abrogated by Parliament through a constitutional amendment.The recent Presidential Reference invoked SC’s advisory jurisdiction under Article 143 (1) of the Constitution to determine if timelines can be set.The President’s move stemmed from a May 8 judgment by an SC bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on a petition by the Tamil Nadu govt challenging the governor’s delay in clearing bills passed a second time by the legislature and his move to reserve them for the President’s consideration.The reference pointed out that “there are conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court as to whether the assent of the President of India under Article 201 of the Constitution of India is justiciable or not”.In April, while hearing two matters before his elevation as CJI, Justice Gavai had observed, “As it is, we are alleged of encroaching upon the parliamentary and executive functions .” The executive had questioned apparent judicial overreach while hearing a matter over violence in West Bengal. In another matter regarding explicit online content, Justice Gavai had orally observed that it was for the Union to frame rules in that regard. “As it is, we are now criticised that we are interfering with the executive’s function, the legislative functions ,” he had said.Gavai on Sunday said he was glad that the country has not only strengthened, but developed on the social and economic justice fronts. Referring to his judgment against ‘bulldozer justice’, he said the right to shelter is supreme.“The right to shelter is a fundamental right. Whether a person is accused of any crime or convicted, the family’s house, if legally occupied, cannot be removed or demolished. The rule of law has to be followed.”Regarding his visits to various areas across the country, including Maharashtra, he said, “We also recently visited Manipur and assured both warring communities that the country is with you and justice is at your doorstep, so avail it.”The event also saw the release of a book chronicling 50 remarkable judgments pronounced by Justice Gavai.",Justice Gavai was speaking at a felicitation function organised by the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa.

India continues to stress there’s only a pause in

NEW DELHI: The understanding with Pakistan to cease cross-border military hostilities does not have an “expiry date”, Indian Army said on Sunday, rejecting reports from Islamabad that the “ceasefire” was being extended periodically.India has made it clear that the ongoing truce, which came into effect at 5 pm on May 10 after India’s deep precision strikes on nine Pakistani airbases as well as a few radar sites earlier that day, is conditional and depends on Islamabad’s behaviour.The Indian Army also said that no further talks were scheduled between its DGMO Lt-General Rajiv Ghai and his Pakistani counterpart, Major General Kashif Abdullah.Stressing that India has kept Pakistan “on probation” to ascertain whether it ceases cross-border terror, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said on Friday, “If Pakistan’s behaviour improves, it is fine. But if there is any disturbance, harshest punishment will be given.”“As far as continuation of the break in hostilities is concerned, as decided in the interaction between the DGMOs of May 12, there is no expiry date to it,” the Army added, in a brief statement on Sunday.The two countries have decided to continue their confidence building measures to gradually reduce the high alertness levels between the rival militaries ranged against each other all along the western front.“This is being done to ensure neither side fires or initiates any aggressive and inimical action,” an official said. On May 10, the two sides had also agreed to “consider immediate measures” to ensure troop reduction along the Line of Control as well as the international boundary.India, however, has repeatedly stressed that there is only a “pause” in Operation Sindoor, with the armed forces maintaining full operational readiness to respond to any misadventure from Pakistan. “Our actions were just a trailer, and if need be, we will show the full picture. Attacking and eliminating terrorism is the new normal of New India,” the defence minister had said at the Bhuj air force station on Friday.","India has made it clear that the ongoing truce is conditional and depends on Islamabad’s behaviour.

"Trump Jr’s buddy pushes group’s biz in Pak, Bangladesh & Turkiye",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-jrs-buddy-pushes-groups-biz-in-pak-bangladesh-turkiye/articleshow/121254847.cms,"US President Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump ’s interest in Pakistan seems to go deeper than just the cryptocurrency venture his aides have been found pushing for recently with Islamabad for his family firm.It has now emerged that Gentry Beach , a hunting buddy and college friend of Donald Trump Jr , the US President’s son, visited Pakistan in Jan and later Bangladesh and Turkiye, and came back to brief Trump Sr and his close aides at Mar-a-Lago about the “amazing place called Pakistan” and a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals , oil & gas, and real estate.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hosted him twice, first in Islamabad in Jan in the presence of his senior cabinet colleagues, including the ministers for finance and foreign affairs, and again in Dubai on Feb 11, on the sidelines of the summit of world govts.Beach was an exceptionally unknown face among hosts of foreign dignitaries and heads of state Sharif met and posted pictures with on his official twitter handle @PakPMO.In Bangladesh, where Beach met the country’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, a day after meeting the Pakistani PM (on Jan 29), Trump’s close associate promised Dhaka of bringing in huge FDIs in oil and gas exploration businesses and investments in aerospace, defence and real estate.Controversy is not new to Trump Jr and his association with his buddy Beach, a Texas hedge fund manager. In 2018, The Guardian wrote how Trump Jr’s hunting buddy had helped raise millions of dollars in the 2016 campaign funding for Donald Trump. This led him to gain access to Trump’s top administration officials, including the National Security Council officials “to push a plan that could curb US sanctions in Venezuela and open up business for US companies in the oil-rich nation”.Beach scouting for businesses in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Turkey brings in a similar concern that was raised when the Trump aide was seeking withdrawal of sanctions for Venezuela. In both cases, there was scant regard for national security concerns when it offered lucrative deals to Trump & Co in return. It is a well-known fact that Beach’s father, Gary, was convicted in a bankruptcy fraud.When Pakistan was busy conspiring the Pahalgam terror attack, Beach was signing a deal in Istanbul (on Apr 17) with a Turkish group Tera Holding for a joint venture to be set up in Dubai on oil and mining. In all three countries he was feted as Trump’s point person who meant business. While in Pakistan he noted the Islamic country had rare earth reserves of more than $50 trillion; to Turkey, he offered to turn the country into the next factory of the world, replacing China.On May 15, TOI had reported how Donald Trump’s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between India and Pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture in which the family of the US President has 60% stake.The deal was signed between the hastily-launched Pakistan Crypto Council, which appointed early last month Changzpeng Zhao(CZ), the founder of Binance, world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, as its advisor with the ambitious objective of making Islamabad South Asia’s crypto capital.Though the Crypto Council was barely days old, World Liberty Financial sent its heavy guns , including Zachary Witkoff son of Trump’s golf buddy Steve, to Islamabad where they were feted by Sharif and, more crucially, army chief general Asim Munir who just days later “cleared” the mass killing in Pahalgam of tourists who were segregated on the basis of their faith.World Liberty Financial’s stakeholders include Trump's two sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr who, along with their brother-in law, Jared Kushner, have been scouring different parts for lucrative business deals and have attracted allegations of leveraging their links to the White House.","US President Donald Trump’s interest in Pakistan seems to go deeper than just the cryptocurrency venture his aides have been found pushing for recently with Islamabad for his family firm.

She was in Pakistan before the Pahalgam attack , and the investigation is ongoing to establish any possible linkages,” he told reporters.Police said she had travelled twice to Pakistan and was in touch with other Indian influencers as well as Pakistan Information Officers (PIOs). During questioning, she reportedly admitted to meeting a Pakistani officer, Ahsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi in 2023.

GANDHINAGAR: Operation Sindoor dismantled terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan and exposed Islamabad’s longstanding denial of harbouring terrorism, Union home minister Amit Shah said Sunday in Ahmedabad. “As our indigenously developed BrahMos (supersonic cruise missile) destroyed Pakistan’s airbases, its air defence system — borrowed from China — remained unused,” he said.Shah said armed forces penetrated 100km into Pakistani territory in response to Pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives. The operation, he said, obliterated terrorist hubs in both Pakistan and PoK. “Our air force carried out precise attacks on locations previously considered impregnable. Operation Sindoor will be written in golden letters when the history of border security is recorded,” he said.Shah contrasted the mission with earlier surgical and airstrikes, saying those were confined to POK, whereas Operation Sindoor targeted deep Pakistani territory. He said Pakistan was exposed globally when Indian missiles took out terrorists whom Pakistan claimed did not exist on its soil. “Terrorists were eliminated, and the next day senior officers of Pakistani army attended their funerals and offered prayers — revealing the direct link between Pakistan, its army, and terrorism,” Shah said.Shah credited Modi’s “strong political will”, along with military precision and intelligence accuracy, for the operation’s success. Shah said govt had sent a clear message to Pakistan: terrorism and trade cannot coexist: “Modiji made it clear that Indus and blood will not flow together.”","Shah said armed forces penetrated 100km into Pakistani territory in response to Pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives.

CRPF DG: Operation Blackforest marks ‘beginning of end of Naxalism’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crpf-dg-operation-blackforest-marks-beginning-of-end-of-naxalism/articleshow/121254833.cms,"File photo

BIJAPUR: As CRPF DG G P Singh puts it succinctly, the 21-day “largest-ever” anti-Naxal operation in the Karregattalu Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border was “the beginning of the end of Left-Wing extremism”.Ahead of the March 31, 2026 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah to eliminate Naxalism from the country, security forces have their task cut out — keep up the pressure on Maoists by continuing to overwhelm them with sustained operations across the regions where they still operate, albeit in segregated groups with an eroded arsenal; corner them so that they are left with just two options: surrender or get neutralised; and block all avenues for the Maoists to regroup and re-enter areas now free from their hold, while also offering the locals benefits of govt’s flagship schemes in the secure bubble created by CRPF’s forward operating bases there.Operation Blackforest — which showcased exemplary coordination among central and state security forces, culminating in the elimination of 31 Maoists and segregating their strongest formations into disjointed, dislocated units — shall serve as a template for more intel-based actions in the days and months to come, as per sources. The follow-up operations will possibly be on a smaller scale, since the Maoists are now hiding in smaller groups, scattered across pockets of Indravati national park area, west Bastar, south Bastar, Telangana and a small portion of few other states.“Anti-Naxal operations are currently under way in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Maharashtra as part of a multi-front offensive to wipe out the vestiges of Maoist setups there. Already, 5-6 appeals have been made by CPI(Maoist) requesting a ceasefire and dialogue, indicating their desperation,” a senior Chhattisgarh Police official told TOI.A senior central govt functionary, however, said stopping operations may not be an option while the top CPI(Maoist) leadership is still in hiding. “Let them come out and surrender their arms. We cannot talk to a ‘faceless’ group,” said the officer.Surrenders have already peaked this year, with 718 Maoists having joined the mainstream in the first four months as against 928 throughout 2024. “As the pressure grows with more anti-Naxal operations, more surrenders will follow; there is already growing disenchantment within as the top Maoist leadership remains silent and safely ensconced even as the senior Maoists and cadres are getting killed,” said the functionary.Sources said that though only 31 bodies of Maoists killed in Operation Blackforest were recovered, the forces’ own estimate points to 40-45 fatalities. “At least two dead whose bodies could not be retrieved, were very senior Maoist cadres,” said a senior CRPF officer involved in the operation.The officer told TOI that intel-based, anti-Maoist operations will continue even during the monsoon, as the forces are now placed on either side of the Indravati river. “Earlier, a swollen Indravati river and rainwater channels during monsoon would cut off access to the interior Maoist dens; now, the forces can embark on operations from the nearest FOB,” he said.With good technical intelligence, the Maoist hideouts are no longer ‘dark spots’. The forces are confident that the smaller and scattered groups of Maoists/PLGA will be located and neutralised. “The morale of the forces is high and Operation Blackforest has conditioned us physically and mentally to corner Maoists in their core area,” said a second CRPF officer.“It is possible that Left-Wing extremism will be eliminated a few months earlier than the March 2026 deadline,” the officer said but warned that the Maoists may resort to desperate attacks like killing civilians on the pretext of being “informers” and targeting security forces with IEDs improvised to inflict maximum casualty.","The 21-day ‘largest-ever’ anti-Naxal operation in the Karregattalu Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border was ‘the beginning of the end of Left-Wing extremism’ The follow-up operations will possibly be on a smaller scale, since the Maoists are now hiding in smaller groups.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121254829,imgsize-71018,width-400,resizemode-4/Its-beginning-of-end-of-Naxalism-says-CRPF-DG-after-Op-Blackforest.jpg"

The anger was like molten lava. There was only one thought in mind - this time, we will teach such a lesson that their generations will remember. It wasn't an act of revenge, it was justice.

This was in response to a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir ’s Pahalgam last month, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists.Following India’s strike, Pakistan retaliated with shelling across the Line of Control and Jammu and Kashmir, along with attempted drone attacks along the border.After Pakistan's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and reportedly destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase.

Didn’t ask Congress for names for foreign outreach: Govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/didnt-ask-congress-for-names-for-foreign-outreach-govt/articleshow/121255131.cms,"Union minister Kiren Rijiju

Didn’t go by Congress’s internal dynamics: Rijiju

NEW DELHI: The govt has dismissed Congress’s charge that it asked the opposition party to nominate four MPs for all-party delegations going abroad for anti-terror outreach , only to reject three of them.Leader of opposition in LS Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge were informed about the delegations only as a matter of courtesy, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said in his first formal response to Congress’s charge.In an exclusive conversation with TOI, Rijiju also said asking parties to recommend their nominees had never been the practice. “We let them know as a matter of sheer courtesy,” he said.Seven delegations of MPs are headed to different parts of the world to sensitise global opinion on Pakistan’s continuing use of terrorism. Four Congress MPs are part of the teams; Kerala MP Shashi Tharoor heads one of the delegations.Asked about Congress’s criticism of the choices from its ranks, Rijiju maintained that the govt went by who would be more suitable for the delegations’ mission. “We are surprised by the opposition to the nomination of their members like Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari. The two have been essential voices from their side in any debate on foreign policy and matters related to national security . And it is not even a year since they recommended Tharoor to head the standing committee on external affairs,” the minister said.Responding to the suggestion implied in Congress’s criticism that Tharoor and Tewari were picked to taunt the party leadership, Rijiju said, “This is an insinuation. We did not go by a party’s internal dynamics and the insecurity and jealousies that come with that. We also chose Salman Khurshid and Amar Singh, their MP from Punjab. What do you have to say about those?”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had criticised the govt for settling on the names of Tharoor and Tewari at the expense of Rahul Gandhi’s recommendations. “This proves the complete insincerity of the Modi govt and shows the cheap political games it always played on national issues,” he had said.Congress believes Tharoor, formerly with the United Nations and also minister of state for external affairs, was chosen because he took a different line from the party on Operation Sindoor . His statement last week that he was proud of the operation came just when Congress had announced its plan to sharpen the charge that US President Donald Trump had brokered the ceasefire with Pakistan. When told that his views were at odds with Congress’s official line, the Thiruvananthapuram MP had said he was “speaking as a proud Indian”. Few were surprised when Rahul left him off the list that included Gaurav Gogoi, Anand Sharma, Raja Warring and Syed Naseer Hussain. The govt only accepted Sharma, former commerce minister.BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya had defended the decision saying that three supporters of Hussain were arrested for shouting “Pakistan Zindabad” to celebrate his election to Rajya Sabha. Malviya had also questioned Congress’s choice of Gogoi, saying the Congress deputy leader in LS had spent 15 days in Pakistan, while his wife was involved with an NGO focused on Pakistan.",Seven delegations of MPs are headed to different parts of the world to sensitise global opinion on Pakistan’s continuing use of terrorism.

The ugly Sarma vs Gogoi fight



NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi , alleging that he had visited Pakistan on ""ISI's invitation"" and worked closely with the establishment. Responding to the allegation, Gogoi hit back, calling the chief minister a ""troll.""Speaking to reporters, Sarma claimed, ""Gaurav Gogoi visited Pakistan on an invitation of the ISI. For the first time, I am saying this. We have documents of the same. He did not go for tourism purposes. He went there definitely for taking training.""Sarma added that Gogoi, who is the deputy leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, travelled on a direct invitation from the Pakistan government, calling the visit ""dangerous.""""He was (working) closely with the Pakistan establishment. When does the Home Department send an invitation? It is only to impart training,"" Sarma asserted.""An invitation from the foreign affairs (department) or any university is altogether a different thing. This was not from the foreign affairs or cultural departments. He went there on a direct invitation from the home department of Pakistan,"" he added.The CM further claimed that the government has solid proof of Gogoi’s visit and said that there’s no way he can deny or escape from it.""All his paths are closed. We have seen the evidence. Only we need time till September to get the papers. We have to submit a notice and then the embassy will provide us with the documents. September 10 is final and please do not ask about this again till that time,"" Sarma noted.Responding to the Assam CM's remarks, Gaurav Gogoi called them ""absurd"". In a series of posts on X, Gogoi reflected on the chief minister's mental state and said he has been targeted with baseless claims for years.In one post he said, ""I am worried about the health of the chief minister of Assam. For some reason best known to him I have been on his radar since my entry into Assam. He has made many baseless remarks about me in the past 13 years. The most recent one borders on insanity and the absurd. It is often said that when there is something bothering at home, it reflects in the mental state of the person. We will ensure that after 2026 he gets to have some rest.""In a separate post he wrote, ""The script that the chief minister is following is worse than a B grade film. It is said to cover up one lie a person has to say countless lies. That is exactly what the chief minister is doing.""""He is not giving out any facts and simply behaving like a IT cell troll. A Chief Minister should not be a troll. If he has any facts supporting his most recent allegation he should put out in public domain. The farce cannot be hidden for too long,"" he added.Earlier, Sarma had posted a series of pointed questions on X regarding the MP’s alleged visit to Pakistan and his family's ties to a Pakistan-based NGO. Without naming Gogoi directly, Sarma had asked whether the Congress leader had visited Pakistan for 15 consecutive days and demanded clarification on the purpose of the trip.“Questions for the Hon’ble Member of Parliament from the Congress Party : 1. Did you visit Pakistan for a continuous period of 15 days? If so, could you kindly clarify the purpose of your visit?” Sarma had said in his post. ""If so, may we ask why a Pakistan-based organisation is paying a salary for activities conducted in India?"" Sarma had questioned.Responding to the CM, Gogoi had hit back, asking if Sarma would resign in case he fails to prove his allegations. ""Questions for the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam: 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Waiting for the SIT report to be submitted,"" Gogoi wrote on X.The exchange of words didn't stop at Gogoi's questions as Sarma responded to the Congress leader, saying ""sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan"".""I would like to clarify that neither I nor my son and daughter have ever visited Pakistan. Furthermore, my wife and our entire family would never even think of accepting any salary or financial support from Pakistan. All members of my family, including my wife, son, and daughter, are Indian citizens. None of my children has ever surrendered or renounced Indian citizenship. Now, it is your turn to answer. In the coming days, sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan. Wait for 10th September 2025,"" the Assam CM wrote in a reply to Gogoi.Gogoi again repeated his questions in response to the Assam CM's assertions. ""None of the questions answered. I will repeat. 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Wait for 2026,"" the Congress MP wrote.Sarma further alleged that the MP’s wife ""continues to receive a salary from a Pakistan-based NGO while residing and working in India."" In another claim, Sarma said that only Gogoi in his family holds Indian citizenship, while his two children have surrendered theirs.""The father of the children who is an MP surrendered their citizenship. It is not the children, who are innocent, but their father who surrendered it. I wonder how the children will react when they grow up and realise that they are not a citizen of a country where their grandfather was the chief minister of a state for 15 years,"" Sarma said.

Poll Do you agree with the arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad for his social media comments? No, it was an infringement on free speech Yes, it was justified

NEW DELHI: An associate professor from a private university was arrested on Sunday for a social media post related to Operation Sindoor . The arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad , who teaches at Ashoka University , was based on a complaint filed by a BJP Yuva Morcha leader, news agency PTI reported.""Ali Khan Mahmudabad has been arrested from Delhi,"" Ajeet Singh, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Rai police station, was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI. He confirmed that the arrest is linked to remarks made about Operation Sindoor.According to, the student newspaper of Ashoka University, the associate professor was taken from his residence in Delhi on Sunday morning and is currently being held at the Rai police station in Haryana.The Haryana state commission for women had earlier issued a notice to Mahmudabad regarding his comments on Operation Sindoor. The notice, dated May 12, said that the Commission had taken suo motu cognisance of the ""public statements/remarks"" made by him ""on or about May 7."" Mahmudabad heads the political science department at Ashoka University in Sonipat.On May 8, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, head of the political science department at Ashoka University, posted on social media pointing out what he saw as irony in the praise from right-wing commentators for Colonel Sofia Qureshi. Qureshi had represented the Army during media briefings on India’s military strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.""Perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynchings, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens,"" he had written.Mahmudabad also said the appearance of Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh at press briefings was significant, but added that ""optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy.""The professor added in his facebook post, ""For me the press conference was just a fleeting glimpse- an illusion and allusion perhaps- to an India that defied the logic on which Pakistan was built. As I said, the grassroots reality that common Muslims face is different from what the government tried to show but at the same time the press conference shows that an India, united it its diversity, is not completely dead as an idea.""He later said the women’s commission had ""completely misunderstood"" his comments and that its notice did not show how his posts were ""contrary to the right of or laws for women.""Mahmudabad said, ""If anything, my entire comments were about safeguarding the lives of both citizens and soldiers. Furthermore, there is nothing remotely misogynistic about my comments that could be construed as anti-women.""On May 7, Armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This action came in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed.",The arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad was based on a complaint filed by a BJP Yuva Morcha leader.

IMF to Pakistan

IMF lists 11 new riders for Pakistan to avail loan

NEW DELHI: Days after clearing fresh assistance despite India’s strong opposition, International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged that heightened tension with its neighbour could increase the “enterprise risk” for Pakistan’s agreed reforms, while also cautioning about “reputational risk” due to a perception of fund diversion.Setting out 11 new structural benchmarks for reforms under the bailout scheme, the multi-lateral agency warned “an intensification of political or social tensions” could also impact policy and reform implementation, in what was probably a reference to internal conflicts in Pakistan.India’s concern, however, has more to do with the way Pakistan is being provided assistance despite its strong links with terror, as pointed out by Rajnath Singh last week. He had sounded an alert about possible diversion of funds by Pakistan govt to rebuild terror bases destroyed by Indian forces, and called for a rethink of the IMF assistance.In the midst of Operation Sindoor , at the IMF board meeting on May 9, India had red-flagged disbursement of $1 billion loan to Pakistan, along with fresh assistance of $1.4 billion in the name of climate resilience, but the US and European countries backed the proposal and approved it.Reputational risks could also come from any perceived lack of even handed or if there was a perceived misuse of Fund disbursements. As mitigants, the Pakistani authorities have reiterated their strong commitment to the programme, which is designed to help restore economic stability, build resilience through stronger reserve buffers, and advance reforms to create stronger and inclusive growth,” the IMF documents noted.Amid strong criticism from India, it said, “Careful Fund (IMF) communication will be essential to underscore the Fund’s neutral role and avoid misperceptions about its lending activities.”Some of the international ratings agencies have also cautioned against an adverse impact on Pakistan of long-drawn tensions with India and the ceasefire is seen to have provided some relief to its fragile economy. The IMF documents sought to underline that the assistance to Pakistan has been given as it met the loan conditionalities.While reiterating three structural benchmarks for the 37-month programme, which started last Sept, the global body added 11 new parameters including parliamentary approval for FY26 budget in line with its prescriptions, tax reforms and a governance diagnostic assessment and phaseout of tax benefits for SEZs and industrial parks.Besides, it has underlined the need to move ahead with power and gas pricing reforms and phaseout of restrictions on automobile imports.",IMF lists 11 new riders for Pakistan to avail loan under bailout scheme.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin has written to his counterparts in seven non-BJP governed states and a UT, urging a united legal fight against the Presidential reference to the Supreme Court on the power of governors.The letter was sent on May 17 to CMs of West Bengal, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab and J&K to oppose the reference sought by the President in the apex court. “We must evolve a coordinated legal strategy before the court and present a united front to preserve and protect the basic structure of the Constitution,” he wrote.The letter was in response to President Droupadi Murmu invoking Article 143 of the Constitution to seek SC’s opinion on 14 legal questions. While the reference does not name any specific case, Stalin said the move was an attempt to dilute the SC’s ruling in State of Tamil Nadu vs governor of TN case. “This historic judgment, obtained by my govt, is not just a victory for Tamil Nadu but for all states,” Stalin wrote. “It prevents the obstruction of democratically enacted state legislations by governors who are unelected appointees of the Union govt,” he said. The judgment had laid down a timeline for governors to grant assent to state Bills.Stalin said the Centre ’s attempt to revisit this ruling via the court’s advisory jurisdiction is an “effort to unsettle the judgment” and warned that the move could erode the federal structure enshrined in the Constitution. He said it was the BJP govt which advised the President to seek a reference before the SC, which “pointed to the sinister intent” of BJP.“BJP is attempting to unsettle this judgment, which can be invoked as a precedent by other states when faced with an obstinate governor,” Stalin wrote, adding he was hopeful of an immediate and personal intervention of the eight CMs on the issue.","Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin has written to his counterparts in seven non-BJP governed states and a UT.

KOLHAPUR: Eight people died early Sunday when a fire swept through a textile factory in Maharashtra’s Solapur district. Among the dead were 1.5-year-old child Yusuf Mansuri and his 87-year-old grandfather Usman Mansuri , owner and founder of the factory that produced bath and hand towels.The blaze broke out between 3.30am and 4am at Central Textile Company in Akkalkot Road MIDC , likely triggered by an electrical short circuit. Victims included four members of the factory owner’s family and four from a worker’s family who lived at the site.Rescue efforts were hampered by a religious structure erected near the main entrance by the owner’s family. Firefighters accessed the building using ladders and breached a 20-foot back wall to enter. Three people were pulled out alive, but thick smoke and flames stalled further rescues. Three firefighters, including the chief fire officer, suffered burns on their palms and faces. They continued efforts through the morning and afternoon. Around 8am, bodies of Mehtab Bagwan (51), Hina Bagwan (35), and Salman Bagwan (18) were found. By 3pm, remains of Usman, Anas Mansuri (24), Shika Mansuri (24), Yusuf, and Ayesha Bagwan (45) were also found. While the Mansuris were related to the owner, the Bagwans were from the worker’s family. A distant relative identified the Mansuri family’s remains. No immediate family members survived.SDO Sadashiv Paddune said the factory spanned roughly 10,000 to 12,000 sqft. Residents reported hearing a loud sound before flames erupted. The fire raged for six to seven hours, with recovery efforts lasting over 12 hours. Property losses, including machinery and raw material, are estimated at Rs 1 crore.","The blaze broke out between 3.30am and 4am at Central Textile Company in Akkalkot Road MIDC.

NEW DELHI: Indian govt’s retaliatory move to restrict import of ready-made garments (RMG) from Bangladesh via the land route is expected to increase logistics costs and transit time for the products which account for around a third of shipments from India’s neighbour in the east.While it takes only two-three days for apparel produced in Bangladesh to move through land borders, now the transit time is going to be longer, depending on how long it takes for ships to sail to Kolkata and Nhava Sheva (Mumbai),, and clear customs before taking the land route to reach Indian warehouses.“The decision can hit Bangladesh apparel exports to India in multiple ways, particularly when a substantial proportion of apparel import into India is through land ports, 76% from Petrapole land port alone,” said Mithileshwar Thakur, secretary general of Apparel Export Promotion Council , whose members are rivals as well as exporters from Bangladesh.Several Indian companies had set up units across the border to take advantage of the lower cost of production, including lower wages and subsidised power, and tariff advantage that Bangladesh enjoys due to its status as a least developed country, something that will change as it has now graduated to middle-income bracket. “Indian manufacturers pay a 5% GST on locally sourced fabric, while Bangladeshi firms import fabric duty-free from China and receive export incentives for sales to India, giving them an estimated 10%-15% price advantage,” said trade expert Ajay Srivastava.For Indian retailers , as well as global chains operating in the country, switching suppliers is not an easy decision given the massive cost advantage Bangladesh enjoys. Besides, it produces at a scale which few Indian manufacturers have and have refused to add capacity despite wide-spread assessment political uncertainty will hurt Dhaka’s industrial mainstay, readymade garments.“If I have a large order, I prefer Bangladesh because one producer can meet my requirement, and on time,” the CEO of an Indian retailer said.India’s retaliation follows a series of restrictions imposed by Bangladesh, including a ban on Indian yarn imports, and import bans on dozens of Indian goods, including paper, tobacco, fish and powdered milk. “Adding to the friction, Dhaka introduced a transit fee of Taka 1.8 (Rs 1.25) per tonne per km on Indian goods moving through its territory. ,” said Srivastava.

The blaze began due to an electrical short-circuit on the ground floor, which contained motor pumps, defunct bicycles, and various waste material, contributing to the flames.

NEW DELHI: Abu Saifullah , a high-ranking Lashkar-e-Taiba operative and key recruiter, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Pakistan’s Sindh province early on Sunday, dealing a significant blow to the terror outfit, already reeling from the aftermath of Operation Sindoor Saifullah had been overseeing the group’s operations in Nepal, and was a key plotter in multiple terrorist attacks in India in the early 2000s, including one on RSS headquarters in Nagpur in 2006, the 2008 strike on a CRPF camp in UP’s Rampur and the attack on IISc in Bengaluru in 2005.Saifullah’s signature tactic of deploying jihadis disguised in Army fatigues or police uniforms was a distinctive feature in all three attacks, a source said.Of late, Saifullah had been asked by ISI to restrict his movements and was also provided security cover. “However, today, he had stepped out of his house in the city of Matli when he was gunned down at a nearby intersection by unidentified armed assailants on a bike,” Pak police told the local press.Saifullah was a confidante of LeT’s launch commander Azam Cheema aka Babaji, sources said. Originally named Razaullah Nizamani, he was rechristened Abu Saifullah while being dispatched for terrorist activities in Kashmir. Upon his return, Lashkar’s top brass gave him the title ‘Ghazi’, a highly sought after label by jihadis. He was since known as Ghazi Abu Saifullah.Saifullah had nine aliases, including that of Vinod Kumar, and was in-charge of LeT’s Nepal module for a long time. “He was responsible for recruitment of cadres providing financial and logistics support and facilitating movement of LeT operatives across the Indo-Nepal border. He used the alias of Vinod while operating in Nepal,” a dossier on him says.He returned to Pakistan after carrying out jihadi activities in India and started working with LeT’s chief accountant Yaqub and started fundraising for Jamaat-ud-Dawah and Lashkar. Gradually, he started overseeing recruitment at the launchpads as well, sources said.He had settled in Balochistan with his wife. Of late, he had been working closely with Hamas functionaries and fundraising for Gaza and Palestine.On June 1, 2006, three terrorists—Afzal Ahmad Butt, Abu Al Kalam Alad and Usman Habib—were killed while attempting to attack the RSS headquarters in Nagpur.The attack on a CRPF camp in Rampur on Jan 1, 2008, had resulted in the death of seven jawans of the paramilitary forces and a civilian.The attack on Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru took place on Dec 28, 2005.

DGCA tells flying schools to maintain updated sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-tells-flying-schools-to-maintain-updated-sites/articleshow/121254861.cms,"Generative AI

NEW DELHI: Aspiring commercial pilots in India will now be able to make an informed choice for a flying training organisation (FTO) to learn the ropes.In a major reform, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Friday directed all flying schools in country to “maintain a dedicated website” with updated information on several parameters. These include, among other things, minimum and maximum time taken to complete 200 hours of flying; number of aircraft, instructors, designated examiners, availability of ground school and simulators.Apart from clearing DGCA exams and medical tests, completing 200 flying hours is a key requirement to earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL) in India. However, the long time it usually takes to do so due to multiple factors like availability of planes and instructors — apart from other concerns like safety and quality of training at many schools — sends a large number of aspiring Indians pilots abroad every year for CPL training.As reported by TOI on March 23, 2025, DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai decided to bring in transparency on FTOs. He sought to do so by requiring them to put information in public domain, based on which students choose them. The aim is to make them competitive, safer and student-friendly. Setting that plan in motion, DGCA wrote to all flying schools in country Friday. “FTOs advised to maintain a dedicated website… it must be updated regularly. Specified information must be prominently displayed and kept current,” DGCA’s letter states.",Aspiring commercial pilots in India will now be able to make an informed choice for a flying training organisation (FTO) to learn the ropes.

BHUBANESWAR: A 21-year-old YouTuber from Puri is being investigated on suspicion of collaborating with Haryana travel blogger Jyoti Malhotra, who was arrested Saturday for allegedly spying for Pakistan. The unnamed woman came under the scanner after it emerged that she had travelled to Kartarpur Corridor, a visa-free border crossing leading to Gurdwara Sri Darbar Sahib , shortly after Jyoti’s visit to Jagannath Temple in Puri on Sept 21 last year.“Haryana Police and other security agencies are in touch with us. We have questioned the YouTuber and shared details with them,” Puri SP Vinit Agrawal said.The content creator’s parents said they were confident she was innocent, but would cooperate with security agencies as “India comes first and our daughter second”. Police sources said Jyoti, who stayed for three days in Puri, met her fellow YouTuber during the trip. The Puri woman said her friendship with Jyoti started online around eight months ago after the duo bonded over their shared love of travel vlogging.“Had I known her alleged anti-national activities , I would not have struck a friendship with her. I am ready to face questioning by any agency,” she was quoted as telling interrogators. SP Agrawal said investigators hadn’t found any incriminating detail about Jyoti’s Odisha visit and her interactions with the Puri vlogger.The woman’s father said his daughter and Jyoti were “merely” friends. “My daughter has no involvement in anti-national activities and was unaware of Jyoti’s alleged espionage. Since she loves travelling, she made a pilgrimage to Kartarpur with another friend (not Jyoti) three months ago. She received official permission to visit the place,” he said.","A 21-year-old YouTuber from Puri is being investigated on suspicion of collaborating with Haryana travel blogger Jyoti Malhotra.

"HC cites wife's adultery, sets aside lower court order granting her maintenance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-cites-wifes-adultery-sets-aside-lower-court-order-granting-her-maintenance/articleshow/121254846.cms,"Representative image

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh high court (HC), citing a woman’s adulterous conduct, ruled against her plea for maintenance from her estranged husband.Justice Arvind Kumar Verma gave the ruling while hearing two criminal revision petitions challenging a Raipur family court order to the husband to pay Rs 4,000 monthly maintenance to his wife. Both the parties had challenged the decision — the husband sought complete annulment while the wife demanded it to be increased to Rs 20,000.The husband’s counsel argued the wife was not eligible for maintenance as she was in an adulterous relationship with his younger brother. This was established through a divorce decree granted by the family court on Sept 8, 2023, the counsel said.Family court overlooked this crucial evidence & disregarded CrPC section 125(4), which explicitly disallows maintenance for a wife living in adultery or leaving her marital home without a valid reason, the counsel said.The wife’s counsel refuted the adultery claim, arguing that any past extramarital affair was not a ‘continuous act’. The counsel stressed that “living in adultery” necessitates an ongoing illicit relationship, which they claimed was not the case as the wife was then living with her brother and sister-in-law. They argued that Rs 4,000 in maintenance was not enough, considering the wife’s lack of independent income and the husband’s alleged multiple revenue sources.HC observed that the divorce decree, granted on the grounds of the wife’s adultery, constituted legal proof of her disqualification under section 125(4) CrPC.HC allowed the husband’s revision petition and set aside the family court’s maintenance order. The wife’s petition seeking enhancement of maintenance was dismissed.","Justice Arvind Kumar Verma gave the ruling while hearing two criminal revision petitions challenging a Raipur family court order to the husband to pay Rs 4,000 monthly maintenance to his wife.

Policy soon for easy liquidation of cooperatives: Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/policy-soon-for-easy-liquidation-of-cooperatives-amit-shah/articleshow/121254839.cms,"Union home minister Amit Shah

GANDHINAGAR: Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah announced Sunday that Centre will introduce soon a new policy for speedy liquidation of defunct primary agricultural credit societies ( PACS ) and registration of new ones.He outlined a target to establish two lakh new PACS by 2029, with 22 designated business activities aimed at ensuring financial stability and long-term viability. “The work of connecting 22 different types of businesses with PACS was done by Union govt and I am sure arrangements have been made to ensure not a single registered PACS becomes financially sick,” he added. He was speaking at a “Sahakari Sammelan” held at Science City in Ahmedabad to mark International Year of Cooperatives . Over 4,000 delegates representing 800 cooperative institutions attended the event.PACS provide short-term and medium-term loans to farmers for agricultural activities, operating at village level. They promote financial inclusion, offer affordable credit, and support rural economic development by reducing dependence on informal moneylenders.Among the business avenues encouraged for PACS are cooperative-owned manufacturing units for products such as ice cream, paneer, and other cheese. Shah highlighted a plan to promote a circular economy in the dairy sector by forming cooperatives to process skin, bones, and horns of deceased livestock.The Union minister said India’s cooperative movement , born during the freedom struggle, had faltered in several regions but remained strong in Gujarat. “It is the responsibility of cooperative leaders in Gujarat to make the growth of the movement symmetric,” he said.Shah also reviewed progress of “cooperation among cooperatives” pilot project, initially launched in Banaskantha and Panchmahal districts and now expanded statewide. He reported that 60% of the project has been completed and that deposits in cooperative banks have risen by Rs 11,000 crore.“All members of cooperatives, dairies, agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs), and PACS should have accounts in cooperative banks,” he said.","Amit Shah outlined a target to establish two lakh new PACS by 2029.

"For those falsely accused of conversion, fear doesn’t end with an acquittal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-those-falsely-accused-of-conversion-fear-doesnt-end-with-an-acquittal/articleshow/121254835.cms,"FAITH OR FORCE? A protest against the anti-conversion law. Eleven states have such laws, but there has been little by way of assessing their impact

Religious conversions have always been a fraught issue in India. Even as the Supreme Court is set to hear pleas challenging anti-conversion laws , the process has already become punishment for some. Not only have they been forced to spend time and resources defending themselves in conversion cases but continue to live in fear even after being acquitted.Two years ago, one sweltering Sunday morning in June, 35-year-old Sonu Saroj’s life turned upside down. The bike mechanic, who lives in Kodra village in UP’s Rae Bareilly, was conducting a Christian prayer meeting in a makeshift shed with several relatives and neighbours when about 35-40 people armed with sticks and claiming to be from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad attacked the group. “They just kept hitting us,” Saroj recalls. Some of them also ransacked his house. His wife sustained head injuries and fainted while his bleeding nephew and he were dragged to the police station.“We kept pleading with the police that we were the victims not the culprits, but no one listened to us,” he says. He was later booked under the UP anti-conversion law or the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021 (an amended, more stringent version of the 2020 ordinance). It took multiple visits and witness accounts following which Saroj was cleared of all charges by a local court in Sept 2024. Though free at least, Saroj is too scared to hold prayer gatherings.Eleven states, including Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, UP and Karnataka, have anti-conversion laws and several other states are planning to have them. In both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where such laws already exist, the administration has announced more stringent versions with MP even planning to introduce death penalty as punishment. Yet, there has been little by way of assessing the impact of these legislations.An estimated 835 cases were registered in UP with 1,682 arrested between Nov 2020 and July 2024 under the anti-conversion law. Just days after the anti-conversion law was passed in UP in Nov 2020, the first person to be booked was Muzaffarnagar resident Nadeem, accused of “trapping” a married woman and converting her. A case of ‘love jihad’ was filed by her husband who had employed Nadeem for work.It later emerged that her husband was riled up by the fact that his wife sought shelter at Nadeem’s house after a fight between the couple. “It was a domestic dispute that was turned into a fake conversion case against me,” Nadeem says. “I had no support, and no one believed me. I was humiliated, called names. It took me over a year to get out of that mess,” Nadeem says. He was acquitted by the Allahabad high court in Jan 2021. “Aaj bhi jail ke baare mein soch ke rooh kamp jaati hai (Just the thought of prison sends shivers down my spine even today),” says the 29-year-old.In Chhattisgarh’s Mokhpal village, it took over a dozen Christian residents, who were beaten and their belongings destroyed, seven years to overthrow conversion allegations. Dantewada resident Sangeeta Kartami and her husband were part of a group who would gather to pray every Sunday at Mokhpal, 32 km from her home. On Oct 15, 2017, Kartami remembers the group had finished their prayers and most people had already left when a large mob attacked them with sticks. “I was hit on the head with a lathi and suddenly felt blood pouring out. I don’t remember much after that,” she says.Her husband Dev Chandra was hauled off to the Dantewada police station. Like Rae Bareilly’s Saroj, Kartami found then that they had been charged under the anti-conversion law. So began the seven-year journey.Looking back at why they were targeted, Kartami says there is a prevalence of superstition and black magic in their community. “My husband, a govt school teacher, was not doing well. But in 2003, he accepted Christianity and started progressing both in his work and personal life. After that, he was frequently accused of converting people even when he was sharing a word of comfort or advice,” she says.The same year as the Dantewada couple, Maharashtra resident Prabhakar Sule, 47, who lives in Jalgaon district, was booked in an anti-conversion case. He was visiting MP’s Khandwa for a prayer meeting when the group was attacked. “My wife and I were dragged to the police station like criminals. My children, who live in hostels, had no idea of our whereabouts for three days,” he says.Sule’s case was registered in Khandwa, 120 km away from his home. For seven years, the couple had to travel for court appearances before they were cleared in 2024. “Earlier, I was scared at the sight of khaki but now I don’t feel that dread anymore. The worst has already happened,” he says.","Eleven states, including Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, UP and Karnataka, have anti- conversion laws.

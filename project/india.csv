‘Desperate attempt’: Suvendu Adhikari sends legal notice to Mamata Banerjee; threatens defamation case over 'baseless' corruption allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desperate-attempt-suvendu-adhikari-sends-legal-notice-to-mamata-banerjee-threatens-defamation-case-over-baseless-corruption-allegations/articleshow/126447091.cms,"'Agar Himmat Hay Toh...': Mamata Banerjee Explodes After ED Raids I-PAC, Challenges HM Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Friday sent a legal notice to chief minister Mamata Banerjee after she made allegation against him and Union home minister Amit Shah over coal smuggling case.Adhikari demanded Mamata to prove the allegations made by her within 72 hours, adding that failure to do so would compel him to initiate appropriate civil and criminal proceedings for defamation.In a social media post on X, Adhikari said that chief minister's allegations were made in a desperate attempt to divert attention from the ongoing investigation by Enforcement Directorate.""Today, CM Mamata Banerjee, in a desperate attempt to divert attention from an ongoing ED investigation, made absolutely baseless defamatory allegations against me, linking me to an 'alleged' coal scam alongside the Hon'ble Union Home Minister. These reckless statements, laced with personal insults, were made publicly without any shred of evidence. Such unsubstantiated claims not only tarnished my reputation but also undermine the dignity of public discourse,"" Adhikari said.""Today, through my Advocate, I have served a Legal Notice demanding that she provide all purported evidence within 72 hours. If she fails to do so, I will pursue appropriate Civil and Criminal actions for Defamation,"" he added.This comes after Mamata alleged that Amit Shah and Suvendu Adhikari were involved in the alleged coal scam and claimed that money from the scam was routed to Amit Shah through Adhikari.The chief minister made these remarks while addressing a public gathering amid protests against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raid in Kolkata's I-PAC office on Thursday.In the notice, the leader of opposition termed the chief minister's statements as ""reckless, baseless, and wholly unsubstantiated,"" accusing her of making defamatory allegations without producing any evidence.""It has come to the knowledge of my client that on 08.01.2026 and again on 09.01.2026, you have made reckless, baseless, and wholly unsubstantiated allegations against my client by publicly insinuating that my client, along with the Union Home Minister of India, is involved in an alleged coal scam. You have further claimed that you are in possession of evidence in support of such allegations,"" the notice read.""On the contrary, my client states that such statements appear to be part of a calculated and sinister design to divert public attention from serious issues concerning you, your family members, and your political party, which are presently engaging public scrutiny...,"" it added.This comes after Mamata, while addressing a gathering, said, ""You know who is sitting in the Election Commission. He was the Cooperation Department Secretary of Amit Shah. I have no issues with that. If Gyanesh Kumar is vanishing votes, why will I stay quiet? If the voter's rights are snatched, I will snatch your rights.""""TMC MPs have been dragged mercilessly when they were protesting in Delhi. All the agencies have been grabbed. I challenge them that they came to power in Haryana and Bihar forcefully. In one more state, they come to power forcefully. Now they are trying to do this in Bengal. Who gets the coal scam's money? Amit Shah gets it. The money goes through Suvendu Adhikari. The money goes through BJP leader Jagannath Chattopadhyay to Suvendu Adhikari. Suvendu Adhikari sends it to Amit Shah,"" she added.Meanwhile, the Bhartiya Janata Party Mahila Morcha on Friday held a protest march from Rabindra Sarovar to Deshapriya Park against Mamata over her recent alleged interference in a raid conducted by the Enforcement Directorate on Kolkata's I-PAC office on Thursday.",West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari sent a legal notice to chief minister Mamata Banerjee.

RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

MUMBAI: The rupee weakened on Friday due to dollar demand from maturing offshore positions and corporate hedging. It closed at 90.16 per dollar, 14 paise down from its previous close. Falling equities added to the pressure. Elevated dollar demand weighed intraday, though sporadic dollar sales near the lows capped losses and kept sentiment cautious.“The rupee weakened, pressured by weakness in domestic equity markets and continued foreign investor selling. Volatility in the dollar index, driven by key US economic data, has further weighed on the currency,” said Jateen Trivedi of LKP Securities.","The rupee closed at 90.16 per dollar, 14 paise down from its previous close.

Debut debacle: It’s raining startup IPOs but stock prices are in slump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/debut-debacle-its-raining-startup-ipos-but-stock-prices-are-in-slump/articleshow/126446165.cms,".

MUMBAI: Even as startups are increasingly rushing to Dalal Street, buoyed by a booming primary market, many of the large, listed companies are trading below their IPO offer price, raising concerns over the long-term value they can generate for investors.Stock prices of close to 10 startups including Swiggy, FirstCry, Paytm, Ola Electric and Delhivery are trading below their offer price, data sourced from the exchanges and Prime Database showed (see graphic) . While market volatility and a broader correction have somewhat had a bearing, a bigger overhang has been the tepid growth of the companies which failed to keep pace with the expectations of the street, said analysts tracking the space.“The realisation (on part of investors) that performance is not meeting expectations is resulting in disappointment and value correction,” said Nikunj Doshi, of Bay Capital. For many startups, acquisitions have been the way of reporting topline growth but whether they are getting reflected in the bottom line remains to be seen, said Doshi.Since 2021, over 30 startups have debuted on the exchanges, ditching larger private fundraises as regulatory easing and higher valuations in public markets made it smoother for firms to go for an IPO.Following a clutch of billiondollar startup listings floated by players such as Lenskart, Groww and Meesho last year, PhonePe, Zepto, Oyo and Flipkart, among others are gearing up for a debut in 2026.To be fair, most of the recently listed startups are trading above their offer price, but analysts said that the performance of digital companies should be weighed after six months of listing. “These companies are largely funded by VC, PE/HNI investors whose lock in expires after six months of listing and the floodgates of supply open. Some startups saw correction in their prices after six months,” said Doshi. A lock-in expiry is the time when restrictions on selling share ends, allowing shareholders to sell their stakes, increasing supply in secondary market which can be difficult to absorb.Public market valuations for tech-led businesses have meaningfully reset from the peak cycle. For instance, in the case of high-quality SaaS companies, which were earlier trading at mid-teens revenue multiples, current market benchmarks are materially lower, reflecting both multiple compression and a moderation in growth rate versus earlier expectations, said Mehekka Oberoi, fund manager at IIFL Fintech Fund. The next batch of startups may have to list at lower valuations compared to their last private fundings.","Stock prices of close to 10 startups including Swiggy, FirstCry, Paytm, Ola Electric and Delhivery are trading below their offer price.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami recommended Friday a CBI inquiry into the ""mystery VIP"" connected with the 2022 murder of a 19-year-old receptionist at a Rishikesh resort owned by a BJP functionary's son, reports Kautilya Singh.The decision came following days of protests by several civic groups and opposition Congress on the issue, as well as two days after the chief minister met the victim's parents, who had handed him a letter seeking a CBI probe under the supervision of a Supreme Court judge. In the letter, the girl's father said his daughter was murdered because of a ""VIP"" whose identity remains unknown.A day later, the parents had reiterated their demand, adding they ""won't rest"" till they ""find out about the VIP"".Announcing the decision, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, ""From the very beginning, our aim has been to ensure justice in a fair, transparent and sensitive manner, and that commitment will continue. We had assured the victim's parents that the line of probe they suggested would be followed.""Last month, audio and video clips allegedly released by Haridwar-based actor Urmila Sanawar circulated in which former BJP MLA Suresh Rathore can purportedly be heard telling her about a ""VIP"", who he alleged was BJP national general secretary Dushyant Gautam.State Congress chief Ganesh Godiyal said, ""By recommending a CBI probe, govt has accepted there were faults in the initial probe.

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

'I cannot hear anything': Judge said, leading to adjournment

KOLKATA: Aftershocks of the showdown between Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee over raids on Trinamool-linked political consultancy I-PAC jolted Calcutta high court Friday, prompting Justice Suvra Ghosh to postpone hearing petitions filed by either side till Jan 14 on grounds of ""enormous disturbance and commotion"" in the courtroom.The judge, seemingly annoyed at her repeated pleas for ""order"" being ignored by lawyers and apprentices seeking to outshout each other, walked out of the courtroom after quickly announcing the forced adjournment.Justice Ghosh specified in her order that she would have heard both petitions as scheduled had a large gathering of lawyers and others not entered the courtroom and caused a ruckus. ""Several requests made by the court to maintain decorum and dignity fell on deaf ears. The environment in the courtroom is not conducive to commence/continue with the hearing,"" she said.Enforcement Directorate, the first mover in the legal battle over Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's alleged interference in the probe against I-PAC, immediately approached acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul for an urgent hearing. The plea was turned down. Acting CJ Paul told the agency's counsel Dhiraj Trivedi that there was no justification in pushing for an urgent hearing after the judge assigned to take up its petition had fixed a date.The face-off between ED and Mamata started Thursday afternoon after she drove to the Loudon Street residence of I-PAC director Pratik Jain when the agency was searching the premises for evidence linked to an investigation in a 2020 money laundering case. The CM next went to I-PAC's office in Salt Lake's Sector V, staying put for almost four hours and allegedly taking away sheaves of documents and storage devices that she claimed contained TMC's election strategy.Besides Mamata, ED's petition accuses DGP Rajeev Kumar and Kolkata Police commissioner Manoj Varma of ""theft of digital devices and other evidence, and wrongful restraint and confinement of central govt officers"". Mamata's petition against ED alleges that the central agency was doing BJP's bidding and targeting I-PAC addresses to ""snatch"" Trinamool-specific and other data pertaining to the upcoming assembly elections.Friday's hearing was scheduled for 2.30pm, but the crowd in court no. 5 started to swell after the lunch break ended at 2pm. ED counsel Trivedi and Trinamool's Kalyan Banerjee complained that they were finding it impossible to reach the bench to argue their cases. ""Anyone not associated with the case, please leave,"" Justice Ghosh pleaded.After 15 minutes of chaos, HC officials and a Kolkata Police officer posted outside the courtroom managed to clear a section of the crowd, but the commotion refused to die down.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

ED raids I-PAC-linked locations; Mamata alleges political vendetta

NEW DELHI: Several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, including MPs Mahua Moitra and Derek O’Brien, were detained by Delhi police on Friday while protesting outside Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence and office.The protest was staged against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids conducted at the office of the political consultancy firm I-PAC in Kolkata on Thursday.TMC MPs gathered with placards reading “Bengal rejects Modi-Shah’s dirty politics”, highlighting their opposition to the ED action, which they termed politically motivated and aimed at intimidating the party ahead of the West Bengal Assembly elections.Speaking to the media during the protest, Mahua Moitra said, “Yesterday, entire India, Bengal witnessed how ED was misused by the Home Ministry. The ED was sent to steal our party's political, strategic information. Mamata Banerjee is a lioness, she protected our party's properties.”TMC MP Kirti Azad added, “They are acting undemocratically; even the raid was illegal. They loot and accuse us of scams. They took away our strategy and candidate lists. BJP’s internal survey shows they won’t get more than 25 seats. But Mamata Banerjee will secure a massive mandate as CM and go on to become the Prime Minister.”The protest comes ahead of a planned march in Delhi led by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Banerjee will lead the march from Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand to Hazra More at 2 pm to protest the ED raids, news agency PTI reported.The raids at I-PAC offices targeted two locations in Kolkata on Thursday. Apart from providing political consultancy to TMC, I-PAC manages the party’s IT and media operations, making the action sensitive for the party’s electoral preparations.Banerjee visited the I-PAC premises during the ongoing search, accusing the central agency of attempting to seize internal documents, hard disks, and digital data linked to the party’s election strategy.The TMC has described the ED action as politically motivated harassment, intensifying the standoff between the ruling party in West Bengal and the Union government ahead of the assembly elections.On Thursday, ED conducted searches at multiple locations, including the residence of I-PAC chief Pratik Jain.Reacting sharply to the raids, CM Banerjee accused the Centre of pursuing a political vendetta and misusing central agencies ahead of elections. She alleged that party documents, hard disks and sensitive data were being seized under the guise of an investigation.Questioning the role of the ED and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Banerjee said, “Is it the duty of the ED, Amit Shah to collect the party's hard disk, candidate list?... The nasty, naughty Home Minister who cannot protect the country and is taking away all my party documents. What will be the result if I raid the BJP party office?”She also linked the agency action to the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise in West Bengal, alleging that voter names were being deleted ahead of the polls.“On one side, they are deleting the names of all the voters by carrying out the SIR in West Bengal...Because of the elections, they are collecting all the information about my party,” she said. Banerjee further dared the BJP to fight the TMC politically if it wanted to win Bengal.Banerjee visited I-PAC’s Salt Lake office during the searches, asserting that the Trinamool Congress is a registered political party that pays income tax and cannot be “bulldozed using money and muscle power”.The BJP hit back at the chief minister, accusing her of interfering in a central agency probe. Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari termed Banerjee’s visit to Pratik Jain’s residence during the ED raid as “unconstitutional” and alleged it amounted to direct interference in the investigation.Adhikari further said the ED should take action against the chief minister, claiming her presence along with that of the Kolkata police commissioner, was improper while the search was underway.Officials said the ED raids were conducted at 15 locations in connection with a fake government job scam, allegedly run by an organised gang that duped people by promising employment.",Several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders detained by Delhi police on Friday.

JAIPUR: One person died and at least 15 were injured when a speeding luxury car mowed down several people by the roadside near Kharbas Circle off Vande Matram Road in Mansarowar Friday night. Confirming the fatality, DCP (South) Rajarshi Raj Varma said the number of those injured in the accident could rise.Eyewitnesses said the red luxury car first rammed into Kharbas Circle and lost control before ploughing into food carts and shacks lining the road. People were having dinner and snacks at makeshift roadside eateries selling tea and other items when they were rammed into by the car.""The car came at very high speed, struck the circle, lost control and flew straight into people milling by the roadside. There was a huge hue and cry, with several people writhing in pain,"" said Vijay Choudhary, an eyewitness.Another eyewitness said the accident at around 9.20pm left people with no time to react, as the car bore down on them within seconds. ""Some were crushed under the wheels of the car, others were tossed to the other side of the road; it was complete mayhem,"" said another person.Eyewitnesses said the three people travelling in the car were pulled out and beaten up by members of the public.Muhana police station SHO Bhupendra Singh, one of the first officers to reach the spot, said the occupants of the luxury car had to be rescued from the angry crowd. ""People were scattered all over the place; the car must have been driven at very high speed,"" he said.The impact was so severe that steel cabins selling tea were twisted out of shape, with overturned carts and debris strewn across the road. Parts of the luxury car, broken pull-carts and food items were left scattered on the road.Police said the car appeared to be registered out of state in the name of a trust. Investigations remain ongoing.Incidentally, the first responders at the scene were three members of a special team of Jaipur police, who were in the area looking for a wanted suspect. In the melee that ensued after the crash, the suspect managed to flee, police said.","Luxury car ploughs into people by roadside in Mansarowar, Jaipur.

India-US trade figures



US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet, claiming that it was due to PM Modi not calling Trump. Speaking at the All-In Podcast, hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Lutnick said, ""Let's be clear, it's his deal. He's the closer. He does the deal. So I said, you got to have Modi. It's all set up. You have to have Modi...they were uncomfortable doing it.""""So Modi didn't call,"" he claimed.This statement comes after US President Donald Trump, on Thursday, approved a bill that can impose at least 500% tariffs for countries buying Russian oil, aiming to ""punish them."" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil.In February, leaders from both countries directed officials to begin negotiations, setting an initial goal of completing the first phase by autumn 2025. However the deal still remains stalled with India's trade with Russia remaining a major flashpoint.Back in August, US imposed additional tariffs on Indian imports to the country alleging that New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil was fueling Moscow's 'war machine' in Ukraine.Since then total tariffs on Indian goods stand at 50%, including 25% of additional tariffs and 25% of Trump's reciprocal tariffs.Since then, two nations have held many rounds of trade talks with the meeting back from December 10 to December 12, when US officials visited New Delhi. India and the US are engaged in parallel negotiations, aiming to develop a framework trade deal to address tariff issues, and focus on a comprehensive trade agreement.The proposed agreement aims to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 from the current $191 billion.The US remained India’s largest trading partner for the fourth consecutive year in 2024–25, with bilateral trade standing at $131.84 billion, of which $86.5 billion came from Indian exports. The American market accounts for roughly 18% of India’s total goods exports, 6.22% of its imports, and 10.73% of overall merchandise trade.Exporters have highlighted the need to finalise the agreement, noting that India’s merchandise exports to the US fell for a second straight month in October, declining 8.58% to $6.3 billion, largely due to the steep tariffs imposed by Washington.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Friday offered its first response to the ongoing controversy surrounding Bangladesh’s request to play its T20 World Cup matches outside India. The BCCI top brass reviewed operations at its Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru and also discussed plans to streamline India U-19 and India A tours going forward, board secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.Following the meeting, Saikia was asked about Bangladesh approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) to seek a shift of its T20 World Cup games out of India after the BCCI instructed IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman from its roster amid the prevailing relations between the two countries.Saikia responded: ""The meeting was about CoE and other cricketing matters. It's not our domain to talk about that (as the ICC has the final say on Bangladesh's participation in the T20 World Cup).""The meeting, held in Mumbai, was also attended by BCCI president Mithun Manhas, vice-president Rajeev Shukla and head of cricket at the CoE VVS Laxman. Several key technical positions at the CoE, which became fully operational in April last year, remain vacant, including the roles of head of education and head of sports science.""We assessed the vacancies at CoE and decided to go ahead with the recruitment process soon. There is an acute shortage of technical personnel worldwide, but we are trying to fill the positions at the earliest,"" Saikia said.Reviewing the operations at the CoE and outlining the way forward, Saikia added: ""We thought it was an appropriate time to review the preparations and activities of CoE.""We are hosting matches on the three grounds there (including the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy). We also talked about how the A tours need to be scheduled going forward.""In certain situations, the A side and senior team are touring together at the same time. We need to ensure that there is no overlap. An A tour is an important supply line of cricketers,"" said the cricketer-turned-lawyer from Assam.",Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj.

After 5th August 2019...’ Army Chief Counters Mehbooba’s Charge Against Centre Over J&K Situation

SRINAGAR: Former J&K chief minister and PDP Mehbooba Mufti on Friday described the National Medical Commission’s order withdrawing permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi to run an MBBS course as one with far-reaching consequences, warning that it could embolden “communal forces” across the country to exclude Kashmiri Muslim students from educational institutions.Mehbooba also questioned the role of J&K’s elected govt, stating that just hours before the NMC announced its decision, CM Omar Abdullah had publicly said the medical college should be shut. “Was there some understanding or discussion going on that whatever he said happened? The chief minister should have stood up against the decision to close the college,” she said, addressing a presser at PDP headquarters.She alleged that the decision was taken solely under pressure to remove Kashmiri Muslims from the medical institution. “The larger question is that Kashmiri Muslim students didn’t get space in their own state. If this is their fate in J&K, how will they be treated in other parts of the country?” she said.The NMC on Tuesday withdrew its Letter of Permission to start the MBBS course at SMVDIME with 50 seats for the 2025-26 academic year, citing major deficiencies in faculty strength, clinical material and infrastructure. It said students admitted during counselling would be accommodated in other govt medical colleges.Many political parties have questioned this, asking if the minimum standards were not met, how was the permission granted just four months ago, on Sept 8, 2025?Omar had on Thursday reacted strongly, saying people across the country fought to get medical colleges while those in Jammu were celebrating the shutting down of one after protests on religious lines. He said Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, which was running SMVDIME, should be asked why the NMC withdrew permission. “Who is the chancellor of the university? You should ask him too,” he told reporters.The chancellor of the university is LG Manoj Sinha.The controversy erupted in Nov last year after 42 of the 50 seats went to Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, while only seven Hindu students from Jammu made the list.This led to protests by the Jammu-based Shri MataVaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella group of about 60 religious and civil society groups, which argued that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students.BJP later backed the agitation, with party leaders making representations to LG Sinha, who heads the shrine board. They sought a review of the admission policy, arguing that “faith” should be the admission criteria in a college run on the donation of Hindus.","Mehbooba Mufti says decision could embolden 'communal forces' to exclude Kashmiri Muslim students from educational institutions.

It said that the attempts to dismiss such incidents as ""personal or political disputes"" only ""emboldened the perpetrators"".The remarks came as the reported cases of communal violence in December 2025 rose to 51, including 10 murders, according to Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC).“We have repeatedly addressed this issue in earlier briefings and continue to see a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities, their homes, and businesses by extremists in Bangladesh,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""These communal incidents must be dealt with swiftly and firmly. Attempts to dismiss them as personal or political disputes only embolden perpetrators and deepen fear and insecurity among minorities,"" he added.Earlier this week, a 25-year-old Hindu man was killed in northwestern Bangladesh after leaping into a canal while fleeing a mob that had accused him of theft, marking the latest episode of violence against the minority community.Meanwhile, police detained former madrasa teacher Yasin Arafat, the main suspect in the murder of Hindu worker Dipu Chandra Das on December 18.Bangladesh’s Hindu community has faced a wave of attacks on minorities following the December killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi.Among the victims was 40-year-old grocery shop owner Moni Chakraborty, who was hacked to death by unidentified assailants at Charsindhur Bazar in Palash Upazila on the night of January 5. The same day, Rana Pratap Bairagi, 38, an ice factory owner and acting editor of the Narail-based newspaper, was shot dead in the head by unknown attackers in Jessore district.In another incident, 50-year-old Khokon Chandra Das was viciously assaulted, hacked and set ablaze while returning home after shutting his shop on December 31. He succumbed to his injuries at a hospital on January 3.","MEA: Attempts to dismiss such incidents as ""personal or political disputes"" only ""emboldened the perpetrators"" The remarks came as the reported cases of communal violence in December 2025 rose to 51, including 10 murders, according to Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126435496,imgsize-1350764,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
70 posts of faculty members lie vacant at Safdarjung hospital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-posts-of-faculty-members-lie-vacant-at-safdarjung-hospitals/articleshow/126443210.cms,".

NEW DELHI: One of the country's largest central govt hospitals is functioning with a significant shortage of teaching faculty, potentially straining patient care and medical education.An RTI reply from Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital administration on Dec 27, 2025, shows that 70 out of the 398 sanctioned teaching posts are vacant.While department-wise data show while 365 faculty members are currently in position - 346 are occupied by regular faculty members and 19 by contractual faculty - 37 are posted in excess in some departments, leaving the 70 posts vacant elsewhere due to uneven faculty distribution.This has resulted in persistent staffing gaps in several critical departments as well as internal imbalances, rather than uniform faculty deployment.Among the core clinical disciplines facing acute shortages, clinical haematology has nine vacancies out of 11 sanctioned posts, while neurology is short of eight faculty members. Cardiology, a high-burden tertiary-care service, has seven vacancies out of 12 posts, and neurosurgery is functioning with five vacant posts.Anaesthesia, central to surgical services, has six vacancies.There are also gaps in departments linked to cancer care and advanced diagnostics. Medical oncology has two sanctioned posts but none currently in position, while nuclear medicine and urology have three and four vacancies, respectively. There are similar shortages in pathology, physiology, pulmonary medicine, endocrinology and forensic medicine, according to the RTI reply.Responding to the RTI findings, Sakshi Chhugh, public relations officer, VMMC & Safdarjung Hospital, said the hospital has a sanctioned strength of 398 teaching posts, of which 345 are presently occupied by regular faculty and 18 by contractual faculty. She said interviews for the remaining 35 posts had already been conducted, and appointments would be finalised in due course as per prescribed recruitment procedures.""The hospital continues to ensure that academic activities, teaching programmes and patient care services remain uninterrupted,"" Chhugh said.Health experts warn that sustained faculty shortages in teaching hospitals can translate into longer waiting times, heavier clinician workload and reduced teaching and supervision for medical students, with direct implications for service delivery at high-volume centres like Safdarjung.","One of the country's largest central govt hospitals is functioning with a significant shortage of teaching faculty.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs, with actor Sharmila Tagore appearing as one of the applicants through her counsel.The top court sharply pushed back against the submissions made on Tagore’s behalf, saying such arguments were “completely removed from reality.""Appearing for Tagore, counsel told the court that there cannot be a “one size fits all” solution when it comes to stray dogs on the streets. It said the issue must be looked at through science and psychology, adding that while the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules may not be perfect, they need to be reviewed, not discarded.The counsel said the law already recognises a difference between normal street dogs and aggressive dogs and argued that some aggressive dogs can improve after treatment and behavioural care, though it accepted that aggression can return in some cases. Such dogs, he said, must be clearly identified by designated committees.When the Counsel cited example of a long-standing stray dog at AIIMS, the court said any dog living on the streets is likely to carry ticks and warned that allowing such animals inside hospitals could have “disastrous consequences”. The judges told the counsel not to romanticise the presence of dogs in sensitive public spaces.""Was she being taken to the hospital theatre also? Any dog that’s in the streets is bound to have ticks.And a dog with ticks in a hospital will have disastrous consequences. Do you understand? We’ll let you know the reality of what is being argued. You (the dog lover’s side) are completely removed from reality. Don’t try to glorify these dogs in the hospitals,"" the bench said.Suggestions like colour-coded collars to identify dogs with a history of biting were also raised by Tagore's counsel, citing examples from other countries. The court questioned the comparison and asked lawyers to remain realistic, pointing to differences in population size.The Supreme Court was hearing petitions seeking modification of its earlier directions in the stray dog matter.",Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs.

Stray dogs: NGO asks SC to involve experts

NEW DELHI: As animal rights activists submitted that stray dogs need not be removed from premises of public institutions like hospitals and colleges as they are not a threat to humans and that both can live peacefully, Supreme Court on Friday said the picture projected by them in favour of the canines is different from ground realities.Seeking rollback of SC's order to make these premises free of strays, a lawyer told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria that recently a picture showing a dog walking along with monks across the US went viral while, in another recent case, a dog came to the rescue of a toddler.The bench, however, said cases of dog bites give a different picture. ""We will tell you the reality at the end of the arguments,"" the bench said.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for NGO 'All Creatures Great and Small', urged the court to involve domain experts, as was done in the Aravali case.The obligation of the court to enforce rights is in the absence of legislation. The court will be building a new edifice if you enter into that territory,"" Singhvi told the bench.""While our amicus is great, the concept of amici are basically law advisers.They are not domain experts. The court must have domain experts along with the amicus. In the recent Aravali judgment, the reconsideration was because that committee had 90% bureaucrats - generalists, not domain experts. Reconsideration was done because the domain experts had to come in. It will improve the quality of court orders,"" Singhvi said.SC has said it would give a hearing to whoever files an application in the matter. Over the past three days, the hearing has spanned for six-and-half-hours and the court has heard the views of 20 individuals and NGOs. It will resume on Tuesday.","Supreme Court on Friday said the picture projected by them in favour of the canines is different from ground realities.

The unsung heroes of espionage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-unsung-heroes-of-espionage/articleshow/126436503.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. As Operation Absolute Resolve, which captured the Venezuelan President in a 30-minute manoeuvre, stunned, my thoughts turned to something else. Without well planted spies in Venezuela, this would have never been possible for the US. Spying is as ancient as the first kingdom that feared its neighbour. Egyptian scouts moved like wraiths through enemy camps. Sun Tzu, the 500 BCE philosopher, writes in his book ‘Art of War’, ‘Empires rise and fall on whispered intelligence. Whether the object is to crush an army, storm a city, or assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the aides-de-camp, servants, and doorkeepers through espionage.” Nearly 2000 years ago, Thiruvalluvar gazed into the heart of warfare and saw the same truth. In Kural 585, he captures the essence of the perfect spy in verses that shimmer with ancient wisdom: ""Kadaa Uruvodu Kannanjanjaadhu Yaandhum Ugaamai Valladhe Otru."" Of unsuspected disguise and all-unfearing eyes, who lets No secret out, are trusty spies. The sequences in the recent Bollywood spy movie Dhurandhar awakened a deep reverence for those valiant knights who work in darkness and shadows, unnamed and uncredited, who die without gun salutes or state honours. Saraswathy Rajamani was sixteen when fire entered her soul. Netaji's call to the Indian National Army rang through her privileged world, and with five other girls, she joined his army. They became spies in British households, dressed as boys, taking menial jobs that rendered them invisible. They served tea while empires schemed. And they listened. Every scrap of intelligence flowed back to INA headquarters. Each girl carried a gun and an instruction: if caught, end your life. When one was arrested but was unable to kill herself, Saraswathy walked into a military barracks as herself, a teenage girl. She drugged the officer on duty and vanished with her captured friend as police bullets tore into her legs. Not every tale is as dramatic. Kashmir Singh went to Pakistan on a mission that swallowed him whole. Caught by their intelligence service, he spent 35 years in their prisons—17 of them chained to a post in a lightless cell. Ravindra Kaushik achieved what intelligence agencies dream of—he became a deep cover agent planted within the Pakistani army itself. RAW trained him and sent him across the border where he rose through enemy ranks to the position of major. Until the mask slipped and he was caught, tortured and sentenced to death—erased as if he had never existed. There are legends that slip through the cracks of classified files too. Ajit Doval, now our National Security Advisor, once crossed into China to negotiate with the Mizoram Liberation Army chief. And then there is Sehmat. We don't know her real name. Perhaps we never will. Harinder Sikka's novel Calling Sehmat brought to life in the Bollywood movie Raazi , tells the tale of a 19-year-old girl asked by her dying father to become a bride and a weapon simultaneously. She married into a Pakistani military family, and during the 1971 war, passed intelligence so critical it saved INS Vikrant, the aircraft carrier, from destruction. But such salvation demands sacrifice measured in souls. She killed a servant who grew suspicious, and her brother-in-law who asked too many questions. She returned to India carrying her Pakistani husband's child—a son who would grow up to serve in the Indian Army. These are the invisible warriors Thiruvalluvar honoured. We may never know them. But we breathe free because they chose to suffocate in darkness.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

The row involves land in what used to be ‘Hathroi village’ in official records

JAIPUR: Supreme Court has reopened proceedings in a Rs 400-crore land dispute between Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) and the family of former royal and deputy CM Diya Kumari, setting aside a Rajasthan high court order that allowed a 2011 trial court decree in favour of the princely estate to ""stand without examination on merit"".The bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Vishwanathan held that there was no justification in the high court declining to consider JDA's appeal on technical grounds. The judges directed the HC bench to decide JDA's first appeal on merit within four weeks and submit a compliance report.The dispute involves land in what used to be ""Hathroi village"" in official records before becoming part of central Jaipur's urban sprawl, including prime real estate, schools, hospitals and other civic infrastructure.JDA pegs the value of the land parcel, mentioned in revenue records as ""Siwai chak"" (uncultivable govt land), at Rs 400 crore. The petition says the civic administration took possession of the land in the 1990s, challenging the erstwhile royal family's claim that it was registered as private property under the 1949 Covenant linked to Jaipur's accession to the Indian Union.JDA insists the land was never listed as the former royal family's private property in the covenant schedule, and that swathes of land were lawfully acquired between 1993 and 1995 after paying compensation.In 2005, the royal family filed a civil suit, seeking declaration of ownership. On Nov 24, 2011, the trial court decreed the suit in their favour, declaring them owners. The court set aside revenue entries in favour of the state and restrained JDA from interfering with possession.JDA filed its first appeal in 2012. It was dismissed in Nov 2023, before being restored just over a year later.On Sept 15 last year, HC declined to intervene in the dispute, leaving the trial court decree intact without appellate scrutiny. JDA approached Supreme Court on Dec 10, arguing that public land was lost on technical grounds despite issues involving public title, completed acquisitions, settled revenue records and a constitutional bar under Article 363.","The row involves land in what used to be ‘Hathroi village’ in official records.

MEA Calls For Firm Action As India Flags Disturbing Pattern Of Attacks On Minorities In Bangladesh

NEW DELHI: Slamming the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt over the relentless attacks on minorities - including Hindus - and their properties in Bangladesh, and for watering down the incidents, India on Friday said attempts to whitewash the communal intent behind the crimes and attribute these to ""personal rivalries and political differences"" only ""emboldens the perpetrators"".Seven Hindu men have been killed in Bangladesh since Dec 18 - the day garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was lynched and his body hanged from a tree and set ablaze in Mymensingh, a killing that India described as ""horrendous"" and ""barbaric"". Of the seven, three, including a journalist, were killed this week.""We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists. Such communal incidents need to be dealt with swiftly and firmly,"" ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in his weekly briefing.The others killed in violence against Hindus were Amrit Mandal (Dec 24); factory security guard Bajendra Biswas (Dec 29); businessman Khokon Chandra Das (Dec 31); journalist Rana Pratap and businessman Moni Chakraborty (Monday); and Mithun Sarkar (Tuesday).In a briefing following the lynching of Mandal, who Dhaka said was a ""listed criminal"", Jaiswal on Dec 26 said over 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities, including cases of killings, arson, and land grab, had been documented by independent sources during the tenure of the interim govt and these incidents could not be brushed aside as mere media exaggeration or dismissed as political violence.The Yunus-led administration has repeatedly dismissed India's concerns as propaganda by Indian media.The internal situation deteriorated in Bangladesh after the death of radical leader and India-baiter Sharif Osman Hadi on Dec 18, a prominent face of the 2024 anti-govt protests that led to then PM Sheikh Hasina abdicating and fleeing to India.","Seven Hindu men have been killed in Bangladesh since Dec 18 - the day garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was lynched.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: TMC alleged on Friday ED was targeting I-PAC's current chief Pratik Jain, not its founder Prashant Kishor , in its coal scam-linked probe and that the move was linked to the latter's role in ""helping BJP"" in Nov 2025 Bihar elections ""This ED complaint dates back to 2020. Who was at the helm of I-PAC then? It was Prashant Kishor. Then why is Pratik Jain being targeted by ED and not Kishor? The answer is simple. Jain is now helping TMC with its party strategy. And Kishor, with his Jan Suraaj party in Bihar, divided opposition votes, which helped BJP,"" Trinamool spokesperson Arup Chakraborty said.Chakraborty claimed ED's raids on I-PAC betrayed its real motives. ""ED's complaint refers to events that took place in Goa, when Kishor was leading I-PAC. The cat is now out of the bag.

KOLKATA: A day after a tense standoff with an ED team during its raid at I-PAC office in Kolkata on Thursday, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee lodged on Friday two FIRs against ""unidentified"" ED officials for ""theft, criminal trespass, criminal intimidation and tampering with electronic data"" and led a 6km-long protest march in Kolkata, ending it with a speech and thundering that ""an injured tiger is more dangerous than a healthy one"".By all accounts, it's the first time that a chief minister has lodged FIRs against a central probe agency, at least unheard of in West Bengal that is currently headed for assembly elections.While addressing a rally at the end of the two-hour march from Jadavpur to Hazra crossing, Banerjee said, ""What I did was in the capacity of TMC chairperson. I did nothing wrong. If you come to kill me, I have every right to defend myself. Why did you come like a thief? You came to steal information.""Banerjee emailed a complaint against ED to Shakespeare Sarani police station on Thursday night, which led to registration of the first FIR on Friday. The FIR was drawn up under BNS sections 303, 332 and 3(5), along with section 66 of IT Act.

The money reaches Suvendu Adhikari via Jagannath and then goes to Shah through Adhikari... You are lucky I have not released any pen drives yet. If you cross limits, I will expose you. I maintain courtesy up to a point, but there is a limit. I know many things, but I keep silent for the sake of the country. If I speak, there will be uproar worldwide,"" she said.","West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee lodged two FIRs against ""unidentified"" ED officials for ""theft, criminal trespass, criminal intimidation and tampering with electronic data"" She led a 6km-long protest march in Kolkata, ending it with a speech and thundering that ""an injured tiger is more dangerous than a healthy one"" By all accounts, it's the first time that a chief minister has lodged FIRs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126445751,imgsize-696096,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-88.jpg"

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

KOLKATA: Alleging violation of 'right to privacy', TMC, in its petition against ED before Calcutta HC, said the search and seizure at the office of its political strategist I-PAC and the residence of the firm's director came after party chief Mamata Banerjee threatened to go to Supreme Court against the chaotic implementation of SIR process, report Subrata Chattoraj and Srishti Lakhotia.The petition stated under the pretext of investigation, ED ""unlawfully"" gained access to and control over TMC's electoral roll management, campaign planning, and political strategy, with the intent to disrupt election process.""The entire action is out of political vendetta and to scuttle the democratic process of free and fair upcoming elections,"" it stated.The party sought a direction to ED to return ""confidential and sensitive"" documents seized during the searches, which, according to it, included ""political documents relating to campaign strategy, internal assessments, research inputs, organisational coordination, and electoral roll-related data used for electioneering purposes"" in the forthcoming Bengal assembly polls.It claimed that these materials had no ""nexus"" with any scheduled offence or alleged proceeds of crime, and did not fall within the scope of the probe under PMLA. ""Such targeted seizure amounts to an impermissible intrusion into TMC's right to privacy under Article 21 and its constitutional right to participate meaningfully in the democratic process under Article 19.""The petition stated I-PAC, a professional political consulting organisation that provides strategic, research, communications and on-ground campaign support to political parties and their members across India, has been associated with TMC for 6 years, providing end-to-end campaign support. It is ""intrinsically"" linked with the party in maintaining ""crucial, private, confidential and sensitive data"", including that of the upcoming election, it said.ED's action, TMC said, was in ""transgression of its powers and authority"" under PMLA. It called the search ""a calculative and well planned action to disturb the political atmosphere and scenario in the state"".","TMC says ED ""unlawfully"" gained access to and control over TMC's electoral roll management, campaign planning, and political strategy. Party chief Mamata Banerjee threatened to go to Supreme Court against the chaotic implementation of SIR process.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126445725,imgsize-395701,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-87.jpg"

Op Sindoor Continued After May 10 as Every Decision Had Long-Term Implications, Says Army Chief

NEW DELHI: Releasing a book on Operation Sindoor , Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday said the India-Pakistan conflict did not end with the May 10 ceasefire understanding but “continued for a long time.”The book, ""Operation Sindoor: The Untold Story of India’s Deep Strikes Inside Pakistan"", has been authored by former army officer KJS Dhillon, a veteran.“You may be thinking that on May 10, the war finished; no, because it continued for a long time, with many decisions still to be taken. Beyond that, of course, it will be difficult for me to share here,” General Dwivedi said at the launch event, according to PTI.""India announced its resolve with a new normal, with outstanding clarity in strategic guidance, with a whole-of-nation approach for execution,"" he asserted in his address.The army chief also noted how, throughout the conflict, the force ""moved something like a rhythmic wave.""""When I say rhythmic wave, in these 88 hours, it was not possible for you to come for the planning, pass the orders... so, everybody was synergised, and everybody knew his orders,"" he explained.Hours after the ceasefire took effect on May 10, Pakistan had sent drones into Indian border states — a move it repeated the next night.On his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly emphasised that Operation Sindoor has only been “paused.”It was launched on May 7 in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , in which Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians. Under it, the Indian forces struck multiple terror infrastructures across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in what the government described as “focused, measured and non-escalatory” action.Pakistan retaliated with offensives, prompting Indian counter-strikes, and the conflict dragged on for nearly four days. On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which India accepted.","Op Sindoor Continued After May 10 as Every Decision Had Long-Term Implications, Says Army Chief.

The discovery of ignorance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-discovery-of-ignorance/articleshow/123717836.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and

love

and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

“Aridhoaru Ariyaamai Kandatraal Kaamam

The more men learn, the more their ignorance they detect; so is passion—that discovers more of her undiscovered secrets at every union.

Book of Love

The genius of Thiruvalluvar lies not only in the wisdom of his words but in his craft. Nowhere is this more visible than in—the Book of Love. With just two principal characters—the man and his beloved—he scripts a complete play of 25 chapters and 250 couplets.Apart from the two, there are only faint shadows of other figures; the thozhi, friend of the lady, paangan, friend of the lad, and the foster mother of the lady. It remains a two-character play, where Valluvar carefully scripts the entire arc of a relationship; intimate yet vast, narrow in frame but infinite in resonance.The lover celebrates her beauty while she longs for eternal companionship. There are moments of bliss, episodes of quarrels, reconciliations, separations, and the yearning to be reunited. In every line, the elixir of love binds them together.And what is the play about? Nothing less than life itself. Love is the pinnacle of human happiness, a universal experience that transcends cultures and centuries. The drama of love has not changed — couples quarrel, break up, reconcile, and rush back into each other’s arms. Perhaps the Gods themselves must be weary of watching the same scenes replay endlessly. Yet when these emotions are woven with the grandeur of poetry, they appear fresh.What elevates this poetic drama is not just its theme but the devices Valluvar employs. He uses soliloquy, dramatic irony, metaphors, and similes to breathe life into his characters. The result is more than poetry—it is theatre, staged not in grand halls but in the hearts of those who read it.What makes Valluvar’s poetry radiant are also some unexpected allegories and parables that almost jolt you. Couplet 1110, is an example:At first glance, this seems misplaced. Such a thought could have belonged in the chapters on learning () or wisdom (). Indeed, it describes a universal truth: the more one discovers, the more one realises how little one knows. Newton’s confession: “I feel like a boy playing on the seashore, finding pebbles, while the great ocean of truth lies undiscovered before me” is a perfect echo of this.Galileo, on the night of January 7, 1610, peering at Jupiter through his telescope, must have felt this same shock—that the universe is infinitely larger than one can fathom. Ramanujan, writing his first theorem, must have sensed that numbers conceal an inexhaustible world. In knowledge, every discovery reveals the immensity of what remains.Why then does Valluvar speak of this in the? Because love too is an endless quest. The lover, like the seeker, realises that every new glimpse of his beloved opens yet another hidden dimension of her being. The journey of desire is also like an endless path where every door opened leads to another. Knowledge and love, science and passion—all the different quests merge in the recognition that the greatest truths are inexhaustible.Perhaps the only certainty is that Valluvar himself was in love. For only one who has truly loved could have dared to compare the boundless mysteries of the universe with the inexhaustible depth of a beloved.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

When will the changes in GST rates come into force?

Will e-way bills have to be cancelled and generated afresh on goods in transit when new rates take effect?

What is the reason for the 40% rate on 'other non-alcoholic beverages'?

What is the reason for revising the GST rate only on specified varieties of Indian bread?

Why has rate of carbonated beverages of fruit drink or carbonated beverages with fruit juice increased?

Why is there a different tax treatment between paneer and other cheese?

What will be rate of GST on services of admission to sporting events other than sporting events like IPL?





In what the government on Wednesday called a Diwali gift, the GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that daily-use items like hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, soap, toothbrushes, and shaving cream will now attract just 5% GST, down from 18%. GST on individual health and life insurance has been scrapped entirely.

All Indian breads have been exempted even though only a few goods have been mentioned as examples.These goods attracted compensation cess in addition to GST. Since it has been decided to end compensation cess levy, the tax has been increased to maintain pre rate rationalisation level of tax.Prior to rate rationalisation, paneer sold in other than pre-packaged and labelled form already attracted nil rate. The changes have been made only for paneer supplied in pre-packaged and labelled form. Paneer is an Indian cottage cheese. This is mostly produced in the small scale sector. The measure is intended to promote Indian cottage cheese.Admission to other sporting events, including recognised sporting events, where the ticket price is not more than Rs 500 continues to be exempt, and if the ticket price is more than Rs 500, it continues to be taxed at the standard rate of 18%.","GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors.

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

New Delhi Locks Eyes With Trump After ‘Lost India’ Dig; Blasts Peter Navarro | Tariff War

NEW DELHI: Senior White House adviser Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of profiteering from Russian oil and imposing tariffs that he says cost Americans their jobs.In a post on X on Friday, Navarro wrote: “FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins”His remarks came in response to a Washington Post article that said Washington’s harsh language toward New Delhi was worsening ties.Navarro has repeatedly targeted India for its refusal to halt trade with Moscow, calling the conflict “Modi’s war,” branding the country “Kremlin’s laundromat,” and alleging it was profiting from the war.Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, he had claimed: “India is helping feed the Russian war machine. I mean Modi's war, because the road to peace runs, in part, through New Delhi.”The ministry of external affairs (MEA) rejected his comments. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Navarro, and obviously, we reject them.”He added, “We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to, and we hope that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests.”Earlier on Friday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that President Donald Trump and his trade team were “disappointed” with India’s continued imports of Russian crude oil but expressed hope for “positive developments.”Trump himself has repeatedly described India as America’s “most tariffed partner,” calling the trade relationship a “totally one-sided disaster.” He argues that while India exports large volumes of goods to the US, its high tariffs restrict American companies from accessing the Indian market. A US appeals court recently ruled that several of Trump’s tariff measures were “illegal.”",White House trade advisor Peter Navarro renewed his attack on India on Friday.

No Comments: India Reacts To Trump’s Shocking Claim Of Losing India To China After Modi-Xi Bonhomie

Poll Do you agree with Peter Navarro's remarks about India profiting from Russian crude oil? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: India on Friday strongly rejected Peter Navarro's ""Brahmins profiting from Russian crude"" remark, calling the statement inaccurate and misleading.Navarro, trade advisor to US President Donald Trump , made an obtuse remark claiming that New Delhi has been ""indirectly funding"" Russia’s war in Ukraine through discounted oil purchases, and that Brahmins are ""profiting at the expense of Indians"".""We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Mr. (Peter) Navarro and obviously, we reject them"", said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.He further said: ""Talks between both countries is going on and we are committed to strengthening our partnership.""During an interview with a pro-Republican Fox News, Navarro said, ""Look, Modi's a great leader. I don't understand why he's getting into bed with Putin and Xi Jinping when he's the biggest democracy in the world. So I would just simply say to the Indian people: please, understand what's going on here. You've got Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people. We need that to stop. Yeah, and we'll be watching that closely.""Navarro's statement ignited backlash not only from BJP but also from the opposition in India. Congress leader Pawan Khera criticised Navarro's ""Brahmin"" remark to justify US tariffs on India, and called it ""baseless."" Speaking to ANI, Pawan Khera said, ""America should not make baseless statements like this.""BJP MP Dinesh Sharma slammed Navarro for his 'Brahmin' remarks and said that the statement is factually wrong, culturally insensitive, and out of context in terms of India's economic decisions. This is pertinent to mention that it is the BJP's first reaction to the remarks.The floor seems to have fallen out of the dwindling India–US relationship under Trump, who has accused New Delhi of ""fueling"" Russia’s war in Ukraine.On Friday, Trump took a dig at the recently concluded China-hosted SCO summit by sharing a photo of PM Modi with Chinese president Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!"" he said in a post.Trump’s decision to impose 50 per cent tariffs on India has sparked criticism even in the US political circles, particularly after an appeals court deemed the duties unlawful.","Peter Navarro, trade advisor to US President Donald Trump, made an obtuse remark claiming that New Delhi has been ""indirectly funding"" Russia’s war in Ukraine through discounted oil purchases.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

(May be updated)

With a single cryptic post, US President Donald Trump on Friday signaled a tectonic shift in global alignments, taking America deeper into an isolationist and antagonistic stance by clubbing India, Russia, and China together as allies. The post also appeared to publicly cede to China a leadership position adversarial to the US.""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!"" Trump posted first thing on the morning on Friday, sending shock waves across the world, including in the US strategic community that did not anticipate such a stark and public indication of a geopolitical realigment.There was much for analysts to unpack in the 20-word post by America's mercurial President, who often takes to social media to troll and taunt adversaries and sometimes even allies.First, there was the sense of resignation and acknowledgement that he, with his MAGA vision for US, has lost India and Russia (mentioned in that order), countries he implicitly seemed to expect to be aligned with Washington. Then the negative characterisation of China as a ""deepest, darkest"" entity, which seemed to suggest that he now regarded it as a conspiratorial and primary adversary.Calling the US President's evolving stance arguably ""the greatest own goal in modern foreign policy,"" CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria said Trump's tariffs and rhetoric had caused many of the world’s pivotal states are to move away from the US toward China. The Trump post seemed to concede it was a self-goal.It is rare for Trump to admit any loss, in keeping with the core principles of his book Art of the Deal, which emphasizes never conceding defeat and claiming victory even in the face of setbacks. The sense of resignation, unless it is read as a negotiating tactic or sarcasm, was unreal and un-Trumplike.Indeed, the post surprised even Trump surrogates, who held their counsel for now as they tried to figure out the President's motive for such a cryptic but provocative post. Some of Trump's cabinet principals and the non-partisan bureaucracy have been quietly working to keep the India ties on an even keel, given the time and energy both sides have expended on the construct that it will be the most consequential and ""defining relationship of the 21st century. "" Even some MAGA megaphones read more sarcasm than any drastic realignment in the post. The NYPost read it as nothing more than a ""snarky takedown"" of Russia and India ""cozying"" up to China.Absent any immediate elaboration about the post from the administration, trolls and agent provocateurs on social media had a field day, from taunting the US President with his signature ""Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" to gibing if he had taken his morning medication.India partisans ridiculed him for his recent embrace of Pakistan, attributing it to his family's business interest in cryptocurrency that is reported to have netted $5 billion through a firm wooed by Islamabad. ""Actually you are left with Pakistan. Rest entire world has abandoned you already,"" gibed one post, while another wished Trump ""a happy future with jihadis"" for ""forgetting 9/11 and where Osama bin Laden was found. ""MAGA xenophobes too jumped into the fray, one of them suggesting ""it is time we put the Indian people in camps and mass deport them."" Trump's increasingly antagonistic stance towards India has unleashed a torrent of racial abuse and slurs on the far right.","US President Donald Trump on Friday signaled a tectonic shift in global alignments.

Infant mortality rate posts 1-pt decline

NEW DELHI: Highlighting that Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year and stays well below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, the latest Sample Registration System (SRS) Statistical report 2023 shows TFR for rural India for the first time touched 2.1 - the replacement rate, where one generation replaces itself, leading to population stability.Rates above replacement rate 2.1 suggest population growth, and the rates below that level indicate a declining population and a potential ageing population. Nationally, India's TFR touched replacement level in 2019 and was at 2.0 since 2020. TFR represents the average number of children born to a woman during her reproductive years.As per SRS report, Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) for 2023 is estimated at 0.9, which means that on average, each woman in India is having one daughter who survives to reproductive age and has children of her own. Rural GRR (1.0) was slightly higher than urban GRR (0.7), which suggests that women in rural areas are having more daughters than women in urban areas.GRR is a refined measure of fertility that accounts for future mothers and measures the average number of female children a woman is expected to give birth during her entire reproductive span conforming to the age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) for a given year, if there is no mortality.GRR values for major states/UTs range from 0.6 in Delhi, Bengal and TN to 1.3 in Bihar.TFR for rural areas was 2.2 in 2022 and 1.6 for urban. Going by TFR for 2023, at present, a rural woman would have about one child more than an urban woman having a TFR of 1.5 on an average.As far as states go, Bihar had highest TFR among bigger states/UTs at 2.8, followed by UP (2.6), MP (2.4) and and Rajasthan (2.3). Delhi records the lowest TFR at 1.2, followed by TN and Bengal at 1.3 each.Maharashtra stands at 1.4, while Andhra, J&K, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, and Telangana each have a TFR of 1.5. TFR in urban areas was generally lower than in rural areas across all major states/UTs in India, except Kerala and TN.\The SRSReport 2023 shows that infant mortality rate (IMR) registered a one-point decline from 26 per 1,000 live births in 2022 at the national level. Among bigger states, maximum IMR was observed at 37 each in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, & minimum at five in Kerala and three in Manipur. However, the report noted that despite this decline, one in every 40 infants at the national level die within one year of life — one in every 36 infants in rural areas and one in every 56 infants in urban areas. The report highlighted that the decline in IMR from 32 in 2018 to 25 in 2023, marks a decline of seven points over past five years and an annual average decline of about 1.4 points. The corresponding decline in rural IMR has been eight points (36 in 2018 to 28 in 2023) against a decline of five points in urban IMR (23 in 2018 to 18 in 2023). IMR for both genders have shown a decline during 2018-23. With regard to Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), in 2023, the country saw a decline of one point (29 in 2023 against 30 in 2022). There has been a decline of one point in female U5MR and no changes has been observed in male U5MR during the corresponding period.","India's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year.

In the video, Pawar rebuked the IPS officer, sternly asking her to stop action against illegal excavation of murrum soil, widely used in road construction. The officer initially failed to recognise his voice, prompting Pawar to switch to a video call and identify himself.The incident sparked sharp political reactions. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut accused Pawar of shielding ""thieves"" and questioned his right to remain in office. ""He is scolding her to provide protection to the thieves of his party… Ministers should be ashamed,"" Raut alleged, adding that illegal soil mining robs the state exchequer.The NCP defended Pawar, saying the video had been selectively leaked and that his intent was not to halt the police crackdown but to defuse tensions with local workers.","Ajit Pawar issued a clarification after a video surfaced showing him reprimanding a woman IPS officer over action against illegal soil excavation in Solapur.

Boundary Dispute With China Will Remain India’s Biggest Test: CDS Sounds Caution Amid Thaw in Ties

Poll Do you agree with India's decision to use air power against terrorist camps in Pakistan? Yes, it was necessary. No, other methods should have been used.

NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Anil Chauhan explained why India chose to go beyond drones and loitering munitions during Operation Sindoor , saying lethal action against Pakistan-bred terrorists required air power.CDS Chauhan said precision strikes had been carried out against terrorists holed up in Pakistan even after the attacks in Uri and Pulwama, and therefore, India already had ""enhanced precision strike capabilities"".He said it was decided that destroying terrorist camps in Bahawalpur and Muridke required air power, as this would help achieve the political objective -- possibly a reference to reaffirming India’s stand of zero tolerance against terrorism.Speaking at an event in Gorakhpur, CDS Chauhan said: India and Pakistan learned different lessons after the Balakot operation. India focused on long-range precision strike weapons and post-strike damage assessment, and Pakistan might have focused on its air defence...During the surgical strikes after the 2016 Uri terror attack, the Indian Army entered Pakistan by land and destroyed the terrorist camps. We conducted airstrikes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region after Pulwama attack.""He further said: ""After the Pahalgam terror attack happened, we already had enhanced precision strike capabilities. When we discussed with the political leadership, it was decided that by only using drones and loitering munitions, we will not be able to achieve the political objectives. To destroy terrorist camps in Bahawalpur and Muridke , it was necessary to use air power"".CDS Chuahan said that political leadership ""gave a clear direction with a clear message to destroy the terrorist camps, and retaliate only if we are attacked"".""During Operation Sindoor, the political leadership provided a clear direction with a clear message to destroy the terrorist camps, and retaliate only if we are attacked. During Operation Sindoor, we were given full operational freedom, including planning and selection of targets,"" the CDS was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.On May 7, India retaliated for a Pakistan-backed terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.Indian forces, acting against crossborder terrorism, destroyed multiple terror infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) and Pakistan, including the hotbeds like Bahalwalpur and Muridke.As the tension escalated, the Indian forces stepped up the retaliation -- bombing the Rahim Yar Khan Pakistani Air Force (PAF) base in Pakistan's southern Punjab region and Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi.",Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Anil Chauhan explains why India chose to go beyond drones and loitering munitions during Operation Sindoor.

The bench allowed an appeal filed by Union govt, holding that a renunciation certificate from Pakistan is indispensable and cannot be replaced by other documents.""The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not recognise dual citizenship,"" the court said. ""An individual can be treated as an Indian citizen only if recognised exclusively by the Indian state, without competing claims from any other country.""The case dates back to 2008 when the women's father Muhamed Maroof returned to India from Pakistan with govt permission.

His daughters were born in Pakistan and later shifted with the family to Thalassery.The sisters applied for Indian citizenship, producing an NoC from Pakistan high commission instead of a renunciation certificate. They said under Pakistan's citizenship law, renunciation papers can only be issued after turning 21, and by then they had already surrendered their Pakistani passports.The single bench accepted this plea.The division bench disagreed, ruling that both minors and adults must formally renounce foreign citizenship to qualify.

Is this the respect you show to our orders?” the bench remarked on September4, questioning the municipal body’s repeated inaction despite earlier directions.“It is very difficult to restrain ourselves but is this the way you behave? Is there any ego issue that you say the archaeology department will do?"" the bench added.The court examined a report by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who visited the site as court commissioner and flagged non-compliance with previous orders.Finding a communication gap between the court and MCD, the bench summoned the MCD commissioner to appear the same day.""We find that there is too much of a communication gap between the court and the MCD. We would thus like the commissioner of the MCD to be personally present in the court at 3 pm so that whatever order the Court passes is in his presence so that it is taken in the right spirit,"" the bench said.The judges also expressed frustration over repeated delays. ""We have been constrained to pass this order as we have been giving sufficient leverage and latitude to the MCD to come clean by showing its bonafide but we find that our hopes have been dashed by the conduct and the stand taken by the MCD,” the court observed.When the commissioner appeared, he admitted there had been a communication gap regarding the cemented portion and assured the court it would be removed.The top court has now directed the MCD commissioner to hold officers accountable and submit an action plan to fix the lapses. It also ordered that a senior officer be deputed to monitor the monument daily, with details shared with the court commissioner.Posting the matter for September 18, the bench also asked the MCD to file a report identifying officials responsible for disobeying orders and the action taken against them.The case stems from a plea filed by Defence Colony resident Rajeev Suri, who sought to have the Gumti declared a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. The Delhi High Court had dismissed his plea in 2019, following which he approached the Supreme Court.The apex court has since been issuing directions to ensure removal of encroachments, illegal occupation, and beautification of the heritage site.","Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti directed the MCD commissioner to fix responsibility on officers and submit an action plan to address lapses.

Floods submerge 87 BSF border outposts; fencing damaged along 110 km stretch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/floods-submerge-87-bsf-border-outposts-fencing-damaged-along-110-km-stretch/articleshow/123723265.cms,"AP photo

NEW DELHI: Swollen rivers spanning both the Jammu and Punjab frontiers have submerged around 87 border outposts manned by BSF and damaged border fencing in stretches running a length of 110 km, sources told TOI on Wednesday.BSF officials, however, stressed that there is no letup in border vigil despite the floods, which have affected Pakistan’s border areas equally or more. The force personnel have in fact stepped up surveillance with drones and aids like searchlights and night vision devices to detect and bust any attempts at infiltration from across Pakistan. The BSF ‘seema praharis’ are now conducting regular riverine patrols on boats and have positioned themselves in the depth areas (some distance inside the international border) or on higher ground to detect and foil any attempts by Pakistani terrorists to sneak across the international border, taking advantage of the floods.Sources said BSF is already repairing the damaged forward defence posts or high-mound posts to ensure that its personnel are safe and can keep an eye on any illegal border crossings.An officer said the flood-affected areas along the international border/LoC in Jammu division include Samba, Jammu, Akhnoor and R S Pora; while the Punjab division covers Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur, Fazilka and a few parts of other districts.The swollen rivers causing havoc in Jammu include Badi and Chhoti Tawi and Chenab. In Punjab, the Ravi and Sutlej rivers have inundated the BSF outposts as well as the fence.Sources told TOI that the fencing is currently under water in a 20 km IB stretch in Jammu frontier and a 67 km stretch in Punjab frontier. “The actual extent of damage to the fence will be known only after the water recedes. As per the current assessment, fencing is partially damaged in certain stretches and fully washed away in others,” an officer told TOI.The officer added: “Drones have been pressed to watch over infiltration attempts and foil them in real time. BSF personnel have stepped back a little to the depth areas in view of the floods. They are ensuring tight vigil and using force multipliers and technical surveillance and aids like searchlights and night vision devices to deny the terrorists the slightest chance of crossing over”.","Swollen rivers spanning both the Jammu and Punjab frontiers have submerged around 87 border outposts manned by BSF.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions, a development that comes close on the heels of his meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.“You cannot talk to India or China in that way,” Putting said, addressing the media after attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit and a military parade in Beijing. “The colonial era is now over. They have to realise they can’t use these terms in speaking with partners.”The Russian President accused the Trump administration of using economic pressure as a tool to undermine two of Asia’s biggest powers. He also mentioned that he debriefed Modi on the Alaska summit with Trump during his one-hour car drive with the Indian PM.Putin said the US tariff regime was an attempt to “weaken the leadership of these countries”.“You have countries like India with 1.5 billion people, China, powerful economies, but they also have their own domestic political mechanisms and laws,” he said. “When somebody tells you they are going to punish you, you have to think — how can the leadership of those big countries react?”Putin said that history weighs heavily on the political instincts of both nations.“They had difficult periods in their histories too, like colonialism, tax on their sovereignty during a prolonged period of time. If one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over. So that influences his behaviour.”Tensions will, however, eventually ease, according to the Russian President. “Ultimately, things will be sorted out, everything will take its place, and we will see normal political dialogue again,” he said.Meanwhile, Russia is stepping up fertiliser supplies to India this year and both sides will sign a pact for Arctic cooperation next year.",Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions.

In TN, root wilt disease and whitefly infestation wiped out 40% of yields in Krishnagiri and Tirunelveli.Kerala faced leaf rot disease in central and northern zones and mid-whorl yellowing in south, leading to abnormal nut fall and tree death. Rhinoceros beetles and red palm weevils added to the devastation.The festival season - Onam in Kerala, Ganesh Chaturthi nationwide - sent the market into a spiral. Copra, oil and fresh nut prices have soared as shortages deepen.Panaji market vendor Sulagna Gaunekar blamed high labour and transport costs. Tourism added pressure, with tender coconuts overharvested for quick profits, cutting into next year's yield. Goa's agriculture director Sandeep Fol Dessai cited a mix of pests, fungal infections and ""monkey menace"". He said as farmers migrated to cities, leaving plantations unattended, ""Monkeys destroyed crops.""Production for 2024-25 stood at 1,508 lakh nuts - far short of demand. Goa Horticulture Corporation rushed in 75,000 coconuts from Karnataka, selling at a subsidised Rs 40-45. They sold out in hours.Officials said the crisis was global. Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka also saw a drop in output. ""Price fluctuation had related factors - crop neglect and climate variation,"" said Coconut Development Board marketing director Deepthy Nair.Coconut oil prices reflected the strain - Rs 4,23,000 per metric tonne in India, nearly triple in two years, according to a Reuters report. Worldwide production flatlined at 3.67 million tonnes in 2024-25, the US agriculture dept reported.At beaches, markets and temples, coconuts now carry the weight of climate change, fungus, beetles, neglect and broken supply chains - all packed into a single hard shell. India remains the world's largest producer, with an estimated 15 million metric tonnes for 2024-25, according to Coconut Development Board. Karnataka leads with 28.5% of output, followed by Kerala, TN and Andhra Pradesh.","Once an easy indulgence, the humble coconut has turned into a luxury in much of India's south. Tender coconut sales collapsed in 2020-21 as supply chains froze, leading to over-mature nuts and a glut by 2022-23. Karnataka leads with 28.5% of output, followed by Kerala, TN and Andhra Pradesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123728253,imgsize-52720,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

PIL challenges minority quota in HC judge selection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pil-challenges-minority-quota-in-hc-judge-selection/articleshow/123726395.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court collegium system, under criticism for its opaqueness, faces an uncomfortable question as a new PIL challenged the quota for minority communities in the selection of persons for appointment as judges of the HCs on the ground that it ran counter to the cardinal constitutional principle of 'secularism'.Though the SC collegium - the CJI and two most senior judges - had in the past picked advocates from SCs, STs, OBCs and from minority communities and recommended their names for HC judgeship, the official revelation of religion and types of backwardness of persons recommended for HC judgeship nearly four months ago by the SC was cited by PIL petitioners - Hari Shankar Jain and Vishnu Shankar Jain - to question the constitutionality of such selection.""Constitution neither permits for making appointment to an office or post under the state based on the person's religion or nor allows a person's religion to be a ground for consideration in the process of selection. The Constitution does not make any distinction between majority and minority community in the appointments to any govt post,"" they said.The PIL referred to Union law minister's statement in Lok Sabha on Dec 2024 that govt has requested the chief justices of the HCs to send names of suitable candidates belonging to SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women to the SC collegium for considering them for appointment as HC judges to ensure social diversity in the appointment of judge.The PIL said such a request was unconstitutional as selections to constitutional posts cannot be based on a person's religion.On May 5, the SC collegium circulated a list containing 303 names of persons approved for appointment as HC judges between Nov 9, 2022 and Nov 10, 2024 and another 103 names from Nov 11, 2024 to Apr 16, 2025.The list identified those from the minority communities the backward classes, who had figured among the recommendations.Referring to the list of names made public by the SC regarding recommendations made from 2022 till 2025, the petitioner said as many as 24 appointments appear to have been made from minority communities based on their religion. In contrast, only 13 persons from SC/ST category were recommended for judgeship, it said, and alleged that injustice has been done to those belonging to Dalit and tribal communities.The PIL asked - ""Whether the SC Collegium acted unconstitutionally and illegally in conceding to the request of the central govt to consider names of persons belonging to minority communities?"" - and requested the SC on the judicial side to restrain govt from appointing the individuals, who have been recommended based on their religion, as HC judges.","The Supreme Court collegium system, under criticism for its opaqueness, faces an uncomfortable question.

S Jaishankar To Join BRICS Online Summit As Member Nations Unite Against Trump’s Tariff War

NEW DELHI: India will be represented in the Brics leaders' virtual summit that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will convene on Sept 8 by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, and not PM Narendra Modi. The leaders' meeting will discuss ways to deal with Trump's tariffs, along with efforts to boost multilateralism, and may be followed by a joint statement. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said Friday that Jaishankar will join the virtual summit.Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event, even as India prepares to assume the Brics presidency next year, suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit that was seen as a reassertion of India's strategic autonomy in the middle of a trade crisis with Washington.Launching into another rant against India for its participation in Brics, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick said Friday India should either support the dollar and the US, or be ready to pay a 50% tariff. Ironically, within Brics, India has always emphatically rejected the idea of de-dollarisation, maintaining it's not a part of its strategy.Modi's show of camaraderie with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the margins of SCO summit in Tianjin also vindicated the point many have made about Trump driving India into the arms of China with his trade policy.However, as MEA reiterated Friday, India sees its relationship with the US as important and will continue to pursue the substantive agenda that both countries have committed to, hoping that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests. India has stressed on the significance of mutual respect in the relationship, as senior Trump administration officials' launch frequently into anti-India tirades.While both Brazil and India have been slapped with 50% tariffs by the US president, in Brazil's case it's more about political vengeance than trade. Trump has targeted Brazil for the prosecution of his political ally, right-wing leader and former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchase of Russian crude. Brazil has so far not announced the names of other leaders who will join the meeting.","Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit.

Kashmir sees political fight over defacing of National Emblem in Hazratbal shrine & religious holiday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kashmir-sees-political-fight-over-defacing-of-national-emblem-in-hazratbal-shrine-religious-holiday/articleshow/123726256.cms,"SRINAGAR: Unidentified worshippers defaced the inauguration plaque bearing the National Emblem of India at Srinagar’s Hazratbal Shrine after Friday prayers, leading to J&K Waqf Board chairperson and BJP politician Darakhshan Andrabi blaming National Conference for “defacing the plaque and removing the emblem”.Politically, the Valley had already been tense since Friday morning after the LG-led J&K administration had drawn sharp criticism from politicians and religious clerics for failing to reschedule the Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi holiday to Saturday, in line with the lunar calendar. Instead, the LG-led administration observed a public holiday on account of Eid-e-Milad on Friday, a day earlier than the actual date of commencement of Eid-e-Milad, marking the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad.Andrabi responded from the shrine itself, holding a press conference on Friday evening where she said, “Those who broke the emblem at Hazratbal Dargah should be booked under the PSA. It is like a cloudburst that broke on me after I saw the emblem being broken.” She also asked police and waqf officials to bodily search the MLA if and when he visits the shrine “so that there are no currency notes in his pocket (because they bear the National Emblem).Otherwise, if he has, then that will be ‘makroh (disapproved of but not strictly forbidden)…’”.The plaque had been installed by the J&K Waqf Board to mark the reconstruction and redevelopment of the shrine, inaugurated on Sept 3. Andrabi had already faced muted criticism on social media for allowing the National Emblem-bearing plaque inside the shrine.NC chief spokesperson and party legislator Tanvir Sadiq said idol worship is strictly forbidden in Islam. “The foundation of our faith is Tawheed (Islamic monotheism). Placing a sculpted figure at the revered Hazratbal Dargah goes against this very belief. Sacred spaces must reflect only the purity of Tawheed, nothing else,” Sadiq said.NC MP from Srinagar Aga Ruhullah Mehdi said, “A sacred place that has stood for centuries needs no one’s nameplate for legitimacy. People were rightly offended by this dangerous attempt to play with religious sensitivities for self-glorification,"" Mehdi said. He said Hazratbal has seen reconstructions before, but never were such means used to claim credit. “Any talk of using PSA in this case only adds insult to injury. It is foolish, unacceptable, and an assault on people’s attachment to their beloved shrine.""PDP representative Iltija Mufti reacted sharply to Andrabi's statement, saying that “labelling Kashmiris as ‘terrorists’ just because they expressed their anger at something which hurt their religious sentiments, and asking police to slap them with PSA, reflects BJPs punitive and communal mindset.” She added: “The waqf board should certainly have been more mindful & sensitive. It seems that Muslims are being deliberately being provoked. ”J&K minister Sakina Itoo said it was unjust that Eid-e-Milad was not observed as a holiday on the correct date in J&K. “What does ‘subject to appearance of the Moon’ mean if it is not followed? Despite repeated requests from the elected govt to shift the holiday, no action has been taken,” she said. “This is playing with the emotions of the people,” she added.CM Omar Abdullah joined her, stating that “the calendar printed by the govt press is very clear — “Subject to the appearance of the Moon”. It means that the holiday is subject to change depending upon the Moon being sighted. The deliberate decision by the unelected govt to not shift the holiday is inconsiderate and designed to hurt the sentiments of the people.” Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also condemned the move.",Unidentified worshippers defaced the plaque bearing the National Emblem of India at Srinagar’s Hazratbal Shrine after Friday prayers.

THOOTHKUNDI: Amid concerns over the impact of a 50% US tariff on Indian products, shipping and ports minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Friday said that there has been no reduction in overall cargo shipments from India.“We are capable of handling any challenge. There has been no reduction in cargo handled by major ports in India so far,” he said, in response to a question. Minister said domestic consumption and India’s success in bilateral trade agreements with countries have opened new avenues for Indian products.Indian ports serve as the lifeline of the country’s international trade, handling nearly 85% of EXIM (Export-Import) cargo by volume and over 70% by value.Sonowal was interacting with reporters after inaugurating and laying foundation stone for multiple projects worth over Rs 350 crore at V O Chidambaranar Port, including the country's first port-based green hydrogen pilot project. The 10 Nm³/hr pilot facility will generate green hydrogen to power street lights and an electric vehicle charging station in the port colony. The port targets to achieve green port tag by this year end. The foundation stone laid on Friday for a pilot green methanol bunkering and refuelling facility of 750 m³ capacity is aligned with the proposed Coastal Green Shipping Corridor between Kandla and Tuticorin, the shipping ministry said.","Indian ports serve as the lifeline of the country’s international trade, handling nearly 85% of EXIM (Export-Import) cargo by volume and over 70% by value.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has flagged its concerns over the authenticity of data being fed into the Jal Jeevan Mission’s (JJM’s) Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), noting that the quality of uploaded information is essential to fill the visible gaps in the ambitious scheme of providing functional tap water connection to every rural household in the country.The panel -- standing committee on water resources headed by BJP Lok Sabha MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy -- in its report tabled in Parliament on Monday also noted the absence of annual assessment of the functionality of tap water connections in 2023.The annual assessment of functionality is vital to ensure long-term source and system sustainability and corrective measures by states/UTs based on its findings.“Being aware of the fact that actual veracity of uploaded information is essential for realising the actual ground situation and filling the visible gaps, the Committee reiterate its recommendation that the department (of drinking water and sanitation) makes sincere efforts to ensure the authenticity of the data being fed on the IMIS,” said the report.While the panel observed that the department has cited a number of steps being taken by it for water quality monitoring and surveillance, it noted that the govt “has not furnished specific reply” on ascertaining the veracity of the information uploaded by the states/UTs on JJM-IMIS.On the panel’s observation over the absence of annual assessment, the govt, in its reply, told the committee that the department has received the final report of the functionality assessment survey.It said the department’s approval of the report is in final stages and will be released and shared with states shortly for requisite course correction.Launched in Aug 2019, the JJM was meant to cover all 19.32 crore (approx) rural households in the country by 2024.

The horror of partition

Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to victims who suffered during India's 1947 Partition on the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, remembering the ""upheaval and pain endured by countless people"" after the unplanned partition.PM Modi said it's the day to honour the grit of people who faced ""unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh"".""India observes #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, remembering the upheaval and pain endured by countless people during that tragic chapter of our history. It is also a day to honour their grit...their ability to face unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh,"" PM Modi wrote on X.The PM further said: ""Many of those affected went on to rebuild their lives and achieve remarkable milestones. This day is also a reminder of our enduring responsibility to strengthen the bonds of harmony that hold our country together.""Union home minister Amit Shah said August 14 is the day to ""remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition"" and lashed out at the Congress party for dividing the nation -- calling it the dark chapter of history.""Today is a day to remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition. On this day, the Congress divided the nation, wounding the pride of Mother India. Partition unleashed violence, exploitation, and atrocities, forcing millions to leave their homes. I offer my heartfelt tributes to all those who endured this suffering. The nation can never forget the history and anguish of Partition. I also pay homage to those who lost their lives in this dark chapter of our history,"" Shah wrote on X.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said: ""Every Indian still carries a sense of compassion for those affected families. We remain fully committed to further strengthening social harmony in the country.""""I pay tribute to all those brothers and sisters who endured the horrific consequences of hatred and violence following India’s Partition in 1947, and who suffered the loss of lives and property,"" he wrote on X.External affairs minister S Jaishankar also said that the partition caused ""immense suffering and had far-reaching human and strategic consequences.""""On #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, we recall the resilience of those who endured this terrible tragedy. There are many lessons to be learnt from this painful chapter,"" the minister wrote on X.The Partition of India in 1947, which created the separate nations of India and Pakistan, was one of the most defining and traumatic events in South Asian history.Born out of political deadlock between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, and hastened by the British decision to leave, the division was drawn hastily along religious lines by the Radcliffe Commission.The result triggered one of the largest human migrations in history, with around 14–18 million people crossing borders -- Hindus and Sikhs moving to India, Muslims to Pakistan.The upheaval unleashed horrific communal violence, massacres, abductions, and sexual assaults, leaving more than a million dead and countless others scarred for life. Entire trains of refugees were attacked, villages were wiped out, and families were torn apart overnight.To ensure the memory of this tragedy endures, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021 declared August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day ().The day is marked with tributes to victims, exhibitions, archival displays, and public messages reflecting on the human cost of Partition, with leaders urging unity and a commitment to never let such divisions and bloodshed occur again.","PM Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to victims who suffered during India's 1947 Partition.

BLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bla-labelled-foreign-terrorist-org-as-trump-plans-to-develop-pakistans-huge-oil-reserves/articleshow/123293102.cms,"Despite being designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in 2019, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) surprisingly evaded being labelled as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) until now. However, the US state department's sudden interest in the rebel group, particularly its subsidiary Majeed Brigade, has raised eyebrows and sparked curiosity about possible motivations.The development comes close on the heels of US President Donald Trump announcing his plans to develop 'massive oil reserves' with Pakistan. The announcement attracted a response from Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch, who said that reserves of oil, natural gas, copper, lithium, uranium and rare earths were not located in actual Pakistan and belonged to ""Republic of Balochistan"". Baloch wrote an open letter to Trump warning him that he was misled about ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan by army chief Asim Munir.The visits to Pakistan by Gentry Beach, a close college friend of President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr, have also piqued curiosity, with the latter seeing a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals, oil and gas, and real estate. A recent deal that Pakistan negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the Trump family has a 60% stake, has also fuelled speculation.Though it had its roots founded in the 70s, the Majeed Brigade was a little-known entity until a decade ago. The brigade comprises fidayeen (suicide bombers) who have been fighting the Pakistan-China collaboration opposed to its freedom struggle. ""It was in the 1970s that Abdul Majeed Baloch carried out a failed assassination bid on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Pakistan PM who dismissed the National Awami Party's govt in Balochistan,"" recalled a source.However, it was in 2010-11 that the brigade was formally constituted in the memory of Abdul Majeed. Since then, the brigade has carried out numerous suicide attacks against Pakistani security forces and Chinese nationals working for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects in Balochistan and Sindh. The attacks have intensified since 2018. Their most lethal hit was on the Jaffar Express, in which BLA claimed it eliminated 214 Pak military personnel.","The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) surprisingly evaded being labelled as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) until now.

NEW DELHI: A bench headed by Justice J B Pardiwala, which had recently passed scathing remarks against a Allahabad high court judge for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil matter, was a portrait of restraint when it found itself dealing with a similar case on Wednesday.""This time I am not going to lose my cool,"" Justice Pardiwala said at the outset with a smile on his face.The case before it, in which an FIR was filed against a couple for not paying their dues to a seller, who lodged a complaint for recovery of the money, had been adjudicated by the Rajasthan high court . Granting anticipatory bail to the couple, the court said that litigants were forced to move the apex court for relief because proper law was not being applied by lower courts and high courts, which leads to unnecessary litigation and harassment of litigants. In this case, the couple had purchased plywood from a seller and paid Rs 3 lakh but then allegedly refused to pay the balance amount of Rs 12 lakh, making the seller file a case against them. tnnThe bench held that the problem of not following well-settled law was prevalent across the country and said a little application of mind by HCs would go a long way in curbing such litigation.Appearing against the couple, state govt questioned their conduct, as they had been on the run.The bench, however, said this could be because of the fear of police.The bench also disapproved of the stand of the public prosecutor before the HC, contending that it would not be possible to recover the money if bail was granted to the couple. ""According to the state, police machinery is required to be involved in the recovery of money. Why do you want police to be involved for recovery of money - to squeeze the remaining amount for the seller?"" it asked the advocate appearing for the state.",The bench held that the problem of not following well-settled law was prevalent across the country.

When and how to conduct SIR is Election Commission's exclusive domain: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-and-how-to-conduct-sir-is-ecs-exclusive-domain-supreme-court/articleshow/123292709.cms,"SC: Voter list can't be static, must be revised periodically

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court prima facie disagreed on Wednesday with the argument that the Election Commission had no authority to conduct an intensive revision of electoral rolls and observed that it was within the sole domain of the poll panel to decide when and how to conduct the exercise. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also said that the SIR being conducted in Bihar is voter friendly and not exclusionary.The bench's remark came when senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, excoriated EC for conducting an ""unconstitutional"" exercise at its whims and fancies to ""delete"" voters from the draft Bihar electoral rolls. This also led the justices to emphasise that election laws and rules leave it to the EC's discretion to devise the procedure for conducting SIR for any constituency.""It is the exclusive prerogative of EC to decide how and when to conduct special revision of electoral rolls,"" the bench said, adding that if there are irregularities or errors in the procedure of conducting SIR in Bihar, it would seek a response from EC and correct it, if needed.""EC has not undone the entire voter list. It has taken the 2003 voter list as a milestone and presumes pre-existence of voters,"" the bench said.It can't be argued that there is complete absence of power with EC to conduct special revision of electoral rolls. The law says it can be done constituency-wise and in such a manner as EC deems proper,"" the bench said.West Bengal, through senior advocates Sankaranarayanan and Kalyan Banerjee, raised the issue of SIR being conducted without mandatory consultation with state govt. The bench said the state's challenge to SIR can wait till the adjudication of the petition against the revision of Bihar's electoral rolls.Senior advocate A M Singhvi attempted to persuade the court to allow the 2003 list, with additions as of the last general elections, to be the electoral roll for the upcoming Bihar elections . ""No one is against SIR, if it is conducted in Dec 2025 and the exercise takes a year,"" he said.The bench disagreed. ""Instead of seven documents specified earlier for revision of electoral rolls, EC has expanded it to 11 documents. It shows the exercise is voter friendly and not exclusionary,"" said the justices.Singhvi said the documents, apart from Aadhaar, ration card and voter ID card, are available only with a minuscule percentage.Sankaranarayanan argued that the right to be included in an electoral roll is a constitutional right if a person did not suffer any of the specified disqualifications. The bench said, ""The voter list cannot be static. It must be revised periodically.""Advocate Prashant Bhushan said, ""I can give guarantee that not more than 25% of the over 7 crore people who submitted enumeration forms have not submitted any document supporting their nationality. Booth-level officers, as per whims and fancies, have not recommended a whopping 10% to 12% of people in... Darbhanga and Kaimur for inclusion in the voter list.""He said EC had put the draft voter list on its website after Aug 1 but removed it on Aug 4 after Rahul Gandhi held a press conference about ""voter manipulation"". SC said, ""We do not know of any such press conference.""Senior advocate Shadan Farasat said the names of 65 lakh deleted from the draft voter list must be restored. SC said, ""We cannot bring the dead back and make them vote."" Arguments will continue on Thursday.","Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also said that the SIR being conducted in Bihar is voter friendly and not exclusionary.

Consider converting Noida to a metropolitan council: SC to UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consider-converting-noida-to-a-metropolitan-council-sc-to-up/articleshow/123292648.cms,"Form citizen advisory board for Noida in 4 weeks: SC to UP government



NEW DELHI: Nearly half a century after New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) came into existence, Supreme Court on Wednesday asked UP government to consider replacing it with a metropolitan council for people-centric governance.The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority, finding, among other things, decision-making centralised in the hands of a few officers.Accepting SIT's recommendations, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered: ""In order to infuse transparency and fairness as well as a citizen-centric approach in the day-to-day functioning of Noida, we direct UP chief secretary to place the recommendation... before the council of ministers for an appropriate decision.""Till that decision is taken, the bench directed the chief secretary to post a chief vigilance officer, who should be an IPS officer or an officer on deputation from CAG, in Noida for a financial audit.According to SIT, Noida officers were involved in 20 cases of excess payment of compensation to landowners. Led by IPS officer SB Shiradkar, SIT also concluded that Noida's land allotment policies favour builders, and there was a lack of transparency and fairness in the development authority's overall functioning.It sought an inquiry into assets of officers and their relatives for a proper look at who benefited from excess compensation that Noida paid out.Commenting on the functioning of Noida, SIT said discretionary powers exercised by its officers in allotment of land is such that very soon, there will be no land available in Delhi's neighbouring city for future development purposes. It also flagged the lack of process to garner public view and conduct environment impact assessments for projects in Noida. SIT said residents often complain of delay and inadequate resolution of grievances, as Noida Authority acts reactively rather than proactively.The Justice Kant-led bench directed the chief secretary to set up a citizen advisory board for Noida in four weeks and banned giving effect to any project in Noida without environmental impact assessment and clearance from SC's green bench.In the 20 cases where excess compensation was paid to landowners because of alleged collusion of Noida officials who were identified by SIT, the bench constituted another SIT to conduct a probe into each of these officers and register FIRs on detection of a cognisable offence. It asked the authority to grant sanction for prosecution against delinquent officials within four weeks of SIT seeking it.""The SIT headed by a police officer not below the rank of commissioner of police will register preliminary enquiries (PEs) and proceed to inquire into the illustratively highlighted points (in the previous SIT report) and involve experts from forensic account department as well as economic offences wing. If the SIT, after preliminary enquiry, finds commission of cognizable offence, it would register FIRs,"" the bench said.The court asked this SIT to submit a probe status report but clarified that excess compensation paid to landowners would not be recovered.","The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority.

Poll Should players be compared to legends like Virat Kohli? Yes, it motivates them No, it adds unnecessary pressure

Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam , with modern-day great Virat Kohli . Speaking in an interview, Shehzad said that such comparisons are not only unfair but also add unnecessary pressure on players, which is visible in Babar’s current struggles.“When everything was going well, you were running campaigns comparing players. Now that the performances are not coming, you are saying ‘don’t compare two players’. Why not? Virat Kohli ’s comparison cannot be made with anyone in the world. He is a legend of this generation, a role model. You cannot compare him even with MS Dhoni . Dhoni may have been a great captain, but as a batter, cricketer, and athlete, Kohli stands alone. No one should be compared with anyone because it’s unfair and it adds extra pressure, which we are now seeing on Babar Azam,” Shehzad said.Babar’s dip in form has been a talking point for months. He has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal. Since 2023, no other cricketer has endured a longer drought without a century.Adding to that, since 2024, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan are the only two batters from full-member nations with a strike rate below 80.The struggles have coincided with a change in leadership. Babar is no longer Pakistan’s captain across formats, having stepped down earlier this year following criticism over results and his own performances. The recent ODI series against West Indies only intensified the scrutiny, as Pakistan suffered a 202-run loss to concede their first bilateral ODI series to the Caribbean side in 34 years.Shehzad’s remarks highlight the pressure top players face when placed on the same pedestal as legends, and why the weight of public comparisons can often prove damaging to form and confidence.","Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam, with modern-day great Virat Kohli.

The bottom line

As the US government considers replacing the traditional H-1B visa lottery with a wage-based selection system, international students and recent graduates across the country face growing uncertainty about their future career prospects. The proposed change aims to prioritize visa applicants with higher salaries, a shift that experts warn could create significant hurdles for fresh graduates and entry-level workers looking to start their careers in the United States.In this article, we break down what the wage-based H-1B proposal means, why it could disadvantage entry-level international students, and how students, universities, and employers are preparing to navigate this evolving landscape.Currently, the H-1B visa lottery system offers all qualified applicants an equal chance of selection, regardless of the salary offered by their employer. Each year, a capped number of H-1B visas are distributed randomly among registered candidates, providing a level playing field for new graduates and experienced professionals alike.The proposed wage-based system would fundamentally change this process by prioritizing applicants based on the wages offered in their job applications.Higher-paying jobs would be given preference in visa allocation, with the government’s stated goal of protecting American workers and ensuring that visas are awarded to roles contributing significantly to the US economy.While the wage-based model may sound like a fair way to attract top talent, it poses particular challenges for entry-level international students. Graduates starting their careers often accept lower salaries as they gain experience, especially in competitive fields or startups where budgets may be tight. Under the new system, these candidates could be pushed to the bottom of the selection queue or even excluded, regardless of their qualifications or potential.This change could disproportionately affect students from certain disciplines and non-STEM fields, where starting salaries tend to be lower. Even STEM graduates, who traditionally have stronger work visa prospects, may find their options limited if they begin their careers in roles that don’t meet the wage threshold.For international students, the new rules will likely increase pressure to negotiate higher salaries from the outset — a difficult task for recent graduates still building their professional skills and networks. For employers, especially smaller companies, startups, and non-profits, offering higher wages to entry-level hires may not always be feasible, potentially leading to fewer sponsorships for international talent.This combination of higher salary demands and limited employer flexibility risks discouraging companies from hiring international graduates altogether, which could shrink opportunities for many students hoping to stay and work in the US.As the H-1B route becomes more competitive, students will need to explore alternative visa pathways. Options include the O-1 visa, available for individuals with extraordinary ability in their fields, and employer-sponsored green cards, though both have stringent eligibility requirements and longer processing times.Additionally, many students rely on Optional Practical Training (OPT) and STEM OPT extensions to work legally in the US after graduation. While these provide valuable time to build experience and seek H-1B sponsorship, they are temporary solutions and do not guarantee a long-term stay.Some students may also consider opportunities in countries with more flexible immigration policies and clear post-study work rights, such as Canada, Australia, or parts of Europe.Recognising the looming challenges, many US universities are ramping up support for their international students. Career services and international student offices are organizing workshops focused on visa alternatives, salary negotiation skills, and sector-specific job search strategies.Student organisations and advocacy groups are also increasingly active, pushing for more equitable immigration policies and providing peer support to navigate the complex visa landscape. Partnerships with immigration lawyers and external experts aim to deliver timely, practical advice tailored to students’ evolving needs.To navigate this shifting terrain, international students should take several proactive steps:The proposed wage-based H-1B visa system represents a major shift in US immigration policy with the potential to significantly disadvantage entry-level international students. As salary considerations gain prominence, fresh graduates face an increasingly uphill battle to secure work visas and build careers in the US.While the policy is still under discussion, it is already influencing student decisions and employer hiring practices. The key to success will be adaptability, informed planning, and making the most of available resources and support networks.For international students hoping to stay and work in the US, staying ahead of these changes and preparing strategically will be critical in navigating a more competitive and salary-driven visa landscape.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now. Follow us here",The US government is considering replacing the traditional H-1B visa lottery with a wage-based selection system. The proposed change aims to prioritize visa applicants with higher salaries.

Orca ATTACK VIDEO: After Jessica Radcliffe, Kayaker’s Unexpected Sea Encounter Goes Viral

Actual orca attacks, genuine tragedies







A video that is now going viral on social media shows a marine trainer named Jessica Radcliffe allegedly being attacked and killed by an orca, sparking widespread concerns. The footage seems to capture a violent incident at a marine park during a live show.Fact-checking investigations have since confirmed that such an event never took place, and there are no official records, news reports, or credible sources confirming the existence of Jessica Radcliffe or the alleged attack.Experts quoted by IB Times say that the clip itself is AI-generated, highlighting how quickly misinformation can spread and the challenges faced while debunking false information once it gains momentum.The clip’s central claim is that Radcliffe was attacked by an Orca during a live show. However, fact-checkers from sources like Vocal Media found no trace of a person named Jessica Radcliffe in marine park employment records, credible news reports, or public databases.Official marine safety records showed no evidence of such an incident, reports IB Times.There are several versions of the video circulating on social media that are made in a way to amplify emotional response and improve traction.The hoax seems to draw on elements from actual incidents involving orcas and their trainers, reports IB Times.A 40-year-old trainer, Dawn Brancheau, died in 2010 after a killer whale, Tilikum, pulled her into the pool at SeaWorld, Orlando, reports CBS News.In a similar incident, Spanish trainer Alexis Martinez was also killed at a marine park located on Tenerife.What makes the video feel believable is the fact that real-life incidents involving orcas and their trainers have occurred. One of the most well-known cases is the death of senior SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was killed by an orca named Tilikum during a live performance in Orlando. This tragic event later became the focus of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which ignited widespread controversy over the ethics of keeping orcas in captivity.","A video that is now going viral on social media shows a marine trainer named Jessica Radcliffe allegedly being attacked and killed by an orca.

NEW DELHI: Two nine-year-old girls were allegedly gang-raped late last week by two men, a contractor and a caretaker, near an under-construction swimming pool on a private property in outer Delhi's Narela. Both men have been arrested.Police said the girls, who are neighbours, were lured to an area near the pool on some pretexts. Anil Kumar (37) and Munil Kumar (24), residents of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, respectively, were also said to have threatened the girls after the alleged assault.On Aug 8, the mother of one of the survivors filed a complaint, alleging that her daughter and another girl were sexually assaulted at a swimming pool in Narela. A case was registered under sections 70(2) (gang rape), 127 (wrongful confinement) and 351 (criminal intimidation) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and sections 6 and 10 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act at Narela police station.The statements of the survivors were recorded and they corroborated the complaint. Police arrested Anil and Munil after following the due procedure. Police didn't find their involvement in any previous criminal cases.An officer said a group of girls had found the gate to the pool area open and entered the premises to go for a swim. The two men noticed them and cunningly lured the two girls away from the pool and assaulted them, he added.According to police, it was confirmed that though the pool was not operational or ready for use, people frequently came to swim or bathe there without any charge or formal permission. ""The pool is located on a private property. One of the accused, Anil, is a contractor responsible for the property's maintenance while Munil serves as the caretaker. Both girls come from economically weak backgrounds,"" police said.According to Delhi Police data, 932 cases of rape and Pocso offences were registered till June this year compared to 1,040 such cases during the same period last year.

Here are top observations of Supreme Court order



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has uploaded the full order in suo motu case on the stray dog issue, in which a two-judge bench on Monday, August 11, directed that stray dogs in Delhi-NCR be relocated to shelters.In the judgment, uploaded on the apex court's website on Wednesday, the Court has included directions to ensure that the dogs are not ill-treated in shelter homes while saying that the judiciary bears the sole responsibility to ""possess the courage and strength"" to remind people of truths that they may not prefer to hear.Meanwhile, in a related development, a new three-judge bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria will hear the matter on Thursday.The directions to permanently relocate all strays from streets to shelters ""at the earliest"" were passed by a bench comprising Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice R Mahadevan on August 11.The bench passed a slew of directions while hearing a suo-motu case initiated on July 28 over stray-dog bites leading to rabies, particularly among children, in the national capital.""The judiciary must not assume or take on the colouration of the prevailing popular sentiments of the time, for its role is not to echo the passions of the moment but to uphold the enduring principles of justice, conscience and equity,"" the order said.""As the sentinel on the qui vive, a guardian of rights, the judiciary bears the solemn responsibility to possess the courage and the strength to remind the people of truths that they may not like or prefer not to hear,"" it added.The bench acknowledged the “genuine love and care” many people have for stray dogs and encouraged them to “come forward and become a part of this exercise,” taking responsibility for the care and upkeep of the animals in shelters or pounds.""In light of the concerns of the interveners, we urge all to adopt and give dogs a shelter in their homes. However, we do not ascribe to the virtue signalling of all those who share love and concern for the animals,"" the order noted.The court said it is mindful of and sensitive to the concept of coexistence, but stressed that coexistence should not mean one life existing at the cost of another.""As a court, our heart pains equally for everyone. We condemn those who, beneath the cloak of 'love and care' for the voiceless, pursue the warmth of self-congratulation. The directions given by us, as a court which functions for the welfare of the people, are both in the interest of humans as well as dogs. This is not personal,"" it added.""The exercise that we propose to undertake is not to be performed in a casual manner. The burning issue that we have embarked upon is not driven by a momentary impulse,"" the bench said.""On the contrary, it is only after the deepest of deliberations, and having reached the firm conclusion about the systematic failure of the concerned authorities over the past two decades to address an issue that strikes at the heart of public safety that we have decided to take the matter in our hands,"" it added.Noting the rising incidents of dog bites, the bench said this is not the time for resistance or hesitation stemming from complacency. It added that streets should not be places of vulnerability.""Among a bundle of concerns, we are at pains to take cognisance of the experiences of visually-impaired persons, young children, elderly persons, people from a humble background who are not able to afford even a day's meal, let alone the medical expenses. The visually-impaired persons are at the highest risk of dog bites as their primary support, their canes, are seen as threats by the dogs,"" it said.The bench also said there is no way one can identify or classify between a rabies-carrying dog and other dogs.""It is often said that 'no person is above the law'. However, of equal significance is the flip side of that maxim -- 'no person is below the law' either,"" it said.","The Supreme Court has uploaded the full order in suo motu case on the stray dog issue.

The crowd on the platform was laughing and mocking her. What do you call such behaviour?”The post tagged Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw , the Railway Ministry, and Railway Seva, urging authorities to improve crowd management during festival seasons. The user suggested measures such as restricting access at high-traffic stations and deploying security forces like the CRPF on peak travel days to prevent overcrowding and ensure passenger safety.“Every festival the surge at railway stations and people entering trains without tickets surges, the mob rules the trains. Why cant we have access control to railway stations at least during festival season and especially known stations which have massive crowds trying to get into trains,” the user added, highlighting the recurring disorder during peak travel periods and the lack of effective crowd management.The Railway Seva account responded to the post, expressing concern and requesting further details to investigate the incident.

PM Modi 's visit to New York, if it takes place, will come at a time when the US has bumped up tariffs on New Delhi to 50 per cent for purchasing Russian crude oil, which US President Donald Trump claimed has ""fueled"" Moscow's war with Ukraine.On August 6, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on most imports from India for buying Russian oil. Coming on top of the 25 per cent tariff he already announced, the additional tariff is set to bring the taxes on goods and products India exports to the US to 50 per cent if fully implemented.rump not only doubled down on tariffs but also announced a penalty on India for purchasing Russian military equipment.The executive order signed by Trump, citing threats to US national security because of India's purchase of oil from Russia, goes into effect on August 27, providing a three-week window of opportunity to negotiate an agreement.India responded strongly to Trump's move to impose an additional 25 per cent tariff. The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move unfortunate and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests.In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""However, amid the tariff row, a US trade delegation is expected to visit India before August 25.Meanwhile, Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska.""

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has welcomed an international court's ruling interpreting design criteria for new run-of-river hydropower projects on the Western Rivers (Chenab, Jhelum and Indus), to be built by India, saying it vindicates its position on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which India put in abeyance after the Pahalgam attack.India, however, has never recognised the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which reportedly ruled that India must ""let flow"" the waters of the Western Rivers for Pakistan's unrestricted use. India has instead focused on the neutral expert mechanism.""The specified exceptions for generation of hydro-electric plants must conform strictly to the requirements laid down in the treaty, rather than to what India might consider an 'ideal' or 'best practices' approach,"" Pakistan's foreign office said Monday.While India's official response is expected Wednesday, sources recalled it had earlier notified modification of IWT amid prolonged disputes over Kishanganga and Ratle projects in J&K. India never accepted World Bank's decision to simultaneously activate both neutral expert mechanism and, at Pakistan's insistence, Court of Arbitration on the same issues - the reason it sought reconsideration of the treaty's dispute resolution process.In Oct 2022, World Bank appointed both a neutral expert and a Court of Arbitration despite acknowledging India's concerns that concurrent proceedings posed practical and legal challenges.Following Monday's ruling, Pakistan reiterated its commitment to implementing IWT and urged India to resume functioning of the same. India maintains IWT will remain in abeyance until Pakistan takes action against cross-border terrorism.","Pakistan welcomes international court's ruling interpreting design criteria for new run-of-river hydropower projects on the Western Rivers.

"Adoption law frustrating, needs to be simplified: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adoption-law-frustrating-needs-to-be-simplified-supreme-court/articleshow/123292482.cms,"Average waiting period for adopting kids is 3.5 years



NEW DELHI: Noting that the present adoption law is too cumbersome and frustrating for adoptive parents, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the procedure needed to be streamlined and simplified to encourage childless couples to take the legal route to adopt rather than doing it illegally.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan, which was hearing a case on the menace of child trafficking in the country, said people take illegal routes to adopt children as the adoption process takes years. It said not having children is a social stigma and such parents ""want a child badly but the process is cumbersome"".The total number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2025-26 as of March 31, the highest in 11 years.However, for many prospective adoptive parents (PAPs), the process of adopting a child continues to be a challenge with an average of 3.5 years waiting period for those seeking infants and young children. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) dashboard shows there are over 36,616 PAPs across various categories registered to adopt while the number of children available for adoption is merely 2,756.""The present adoption process is taking too long.Parents want a child badly but the process is cumbersome and frustrating for them,"" SC said.It added the existing flaw in the system was reflected in a case that was decided by it a day before, in which four parents from Telangana had adopted children, but not as per the procedure laid down by law, and police thereafter took away custody. The court allowed the plea of the four adoptive parents and restored custody of the children - aged between a few months and three years - to them by invoking its extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution.In this case, the petitioners had adopted the children after they came to know that their biological parents were not willing to keep them. They did not involve the authority concerned in the process and took custody of the children without informing it. But state the police took away the children after it came to know about the adoption, and the children were handed over to the Child Welfare Project Director and Integrated Child Protection Services.","The total number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2025-26 as of March 31, the highest in 11 years.

So, Is It Bye-Bye America?

Three Things To Note For India

Just a year ago, it would perhaps have taken a big leap of faith for PM Narendra Modi to travel to China. The two countries’ relationship was still on ventilator. The border was relatively quiet, but disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh was still incomplete.Now, as Modi gets ready to visit Tianjin later this month, it seems the most unambivalent thing to do, grounded in a realistic understanding of global uncertainties and the need to reinforce its multialignment.It helps, of course, that the agreement Modi reached with President Xi Jinping on the margins of the Brics summit in Oct — that disputes and differences would not be allowed to disturb border peace — has remained unimpaired. While India’s official announcement is awaited, Modi’s visit is all but certain; so is Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s to India next week for talks with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar Granted, Modi’s visit is for a multilateral event: the summit meeting of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), a 10-member security-oriented Eurasian grouping dominated by China and Russia, seen as a potential counterweight to Nato. Modi’s last visit to China, in 2018, was also for the SCO summit.Given the state of its ties with China and Pakistan, India is a bit of an outlier in the group, as it doesn’t join others in endorsing initiatives like the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).In 2023, it also backed out of an economic roadmap as it seemed more aligned with Chinese interests. More recently, India also refused to sign on to a joint statement condemning Israel’s attack on Iran.However, India acknowledges SCO’s role in combating terrorism, particularly in Afghanistan, promoting connectivity that doesn’t undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity, and facilitating its own ties with Central Asia. Modi has used the SCO Heads of State Council meeting, the highest decision-making body of the organisation, to draw attention to cross-border terrorism, without naming Pakistan.SCO has also had an important role to play in bringing India and China together. Russia may not have actively mediated between India and China, but it has nudged both sides to use the forum to engage with each other after 2020’s Galwan clash.The Moscow Consensus, within three months of Galwan — on the margins of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in the Russian capital — to ease tensions is a case in point. President Xi Jinping in 2023 also participated in the SCO summit Modi hosted virtually under India’s presidency.However, Modi has also skipped SCO summit meetings. He missed one in Kazakhstan last year. If Modi is travelling to China, it’s because he understands the salience Xi has attached to the Tianjin summit under China’s presidency, prioritising it over Brics this year, and the need to normalise a relationship that he believes is important not just for India and China, but the entire world. Support from China will also be crucial for India’s Brics presidency next year.Trump’s foreign policy has wrongfooted India but, to be fair to the Indian govt, India and China started to rebuild ties long before the US president sent the world careening towards an apocalyptic trade war. In fact, the agreement to end the military standoff in eastern Ladakh happened even before the US presidential elections.By visiting China, Modi is signalling that India is ready to have a sound working relationship with Beijing — as long as border peace and tranquillity is not disturbed. When NSA Doval visited China last Dec, both sides agreed to maintain peace on the ground so that “issues on the border do not hold back the normal development of bilateral relations”.India has not allowed China’s military cooperation with Pakistan — even after Operation Sindoor — to ruin the Sino-Indian thaw, and Beijing was muted in its criticism of India’s first joint patrolling of the South China Sea with the Philippines, suggesting a readiness from both sides to take a long view of the relationship. Modi’s bilateral meeting with Xi, which might see important announcements (such as the resumption of direct flights), is an opportunity for both sides to rebuild trust for a mutually beneficial partnership in areas like trade, investment and emerging technologies, in which China is a global leader.India will expect China to reciprocate by addressing some of its trade restrictions related to manpower and equipment that impact Indian manufacturing, and deliver on the promise to import more to reduce the $100 billion trade deficit. India will also be mindful of China’s efforts to undercut its influence in the neighbourhood and the larger Indo-Pacific. China will expect, as ambassador Xu Feihong toldrecently, a transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for its companies.The dragon-elephant tango may have just started but, in these circumstances, it will remain accident-prone. The way the relationship has peaked and troughed from the initial Modi years to the Doklam crisis, and again from the excitement over the informal summits to the Galwan despair, serves as an important lesson. The answer probably lies in Modi’s recent remark, quickly endorsed by Beijing, that competition should not be allowed to turn into conflict.Not really. Modi has, in the past, attended several SCO summits where he has met Xi — and all it has signified is India’s strategic autonomy. His upcoming visit to China is drawing more attention because of the state of India’s ties with the US.India and the US seemed set to embark on a new phase in the relationship, based on robust and next-generation defence and technology collaborations, along with stronger energy ties, when Trump dropped his tariff bomb, doubling the levy on India for its oil imports from Russia.But it will probably take more than one individual, even if he’s the US president, to do any structural damage to a relationship successive American presidents have called one of the most defining partnerships of the 21st century.Amid calls for India to take on the Trump administration, the govt itself has chosen to avoid confrontation. Trump is known to take maximalist positions ahead of trade agreements, and India is still willing to negotiate. India’s statement that the relationship has weathered such challenges in the past has been received well by the US State Department. The visit to China registers India’s position against Western unilateralism, but India is not giving up on America yet. A possible return of peace in Ukraine can also wipe out half of India’s tariff woes.There are three things India will guard against, though. The first is whether Trump, chasing a watershed trade deal with China, will remain as committed to the Indo-Pacific as he was during his previous term, when he revived Quad. The tariff issue has cast a shadow on the upcoming Quad summit India has to host in early Nov. If Trump doesn’t come, there will be questions raised about the US’s long-standing policy of dealing with India as a country that can ensure a sustainable balance of power in the region. India’s efforts to restore ties with China help it hedge against this eventuality.Second is the strong counterterrorism cooperation that will likely be diluted by Trump’s remarkable turnaround on Pakistan — from accusing it of hoodwinking US presidents on the issue of terrorism to treating it as a lodestar in the fight against the menace. Re-hyphenating India with Pakistan can potentially cause irreparable damage to relations with India.Third is the impending H-1B overhaul, and the likely impact on Indian professionals in the IT and healthcare sectors. This is sure to ignite another diplomatic firestorm, damaging people-to-people contacts and what India sees as a mutually beneficial economic and technology partnership.All three are issues that will test India’s resolve and push the limits of Indian diplomacy.",PM Narendra Modi is set to visit Tianjin later this month for the SCO summit meeting.

NEW DELHI: ED has arrested Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.The arrest followed a police case registered in Mohali, with the probe agency conducting raids on Tuesday and Wednesday at multiple locations in Delhi and Mumbai, ED said in a press release.The agency said it found that Virk, who acted in movies and claims to be a cosmetologist, was in regular touch with Angarai Natarajan Sethuraman, a former director of Reliance Capital, which was part of the Anil Ambani group.The ED statement alleged Virk had been communicating with Sethuraman regarding illegal liaising work. It added that this was also confirmed during searches at the residence of Sethuraman, who was a prominent member of the business group's corporate affairs team in Delhi.When contacted, Sethuraman said, ""These allegations are entirely baseless"" and that he had no connection or involvement with Virk or any transactions related to her.In a release, ED said, ""Besides, diversion of funds for personal benefit has been unearthed during course of search. In 2018, public money of Rs 18 crore approx belonging to Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd was disbursed to Sethuraman by flouting prudent lending norms.The funds were lent under terms that allowed deferment of principal as well as interest, with multiple waivers granted & no due diligence conducted. Besides, home loan of Rs 22 crore was provided by Reliance Capital Limited by violating the prudential norms. Large part of these loans are seen to have been eventually siphoned off and remained unpaid.""Sethuraman said that the home loan he received from Reliance Capital was granted following due process and was secured by the property offered as collateral.Following her arrest, Virk was produced before a special court here on Wednesday, which remanded her to ED custody till Aug 14. Virk's arrest came after searches conducted by the agency in Delhi and Mumbai on her premises and those of her close associates,She is accused of impersonating officers of law enforcement agencies, duping individuals, and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud against complainant Jasneet Kaur, under the pretext of investment in a film project. The main accused in the fraud, Amit Gupta alias Nageshwar Gupta, was declared a proclaimed offender in Oct 2024.The agency claimed during its searches, it seized ""incriminating documents"" and records, and statements of key persons and associates, including Farrukh Ali, were recorded. ED said its current searches were part of an ongoing investigation into charges against Virk and her associates, who are alleged to have ""exerted undue influence through misrepresentation and defrauded individuals by soliciting money under false promises"".""Virk has acquired immovable property in her name by making false promises and cheating. She claims to be owner of hyboocare.com, a website purportedly selling FDA-approved beauty products. However, the products listed on the site have been found to be non-existent,"" the agency said. It added that its probe revealed that the website floated by Virk lacked basics, such as user registration options. Scrutiny of the website uncovered minimal social media engagement, an inactive WhatsApp contact number, and absence of transparent organisational details, all of which reinforce suspicion of non-genuine commercial activity, ED said.","Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod to a strict Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which provides for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment and fine of up to Rs 10 lakh for ""forced conversion"". The govt is likely to table the bill in the House, where they have a strong majority, for approval during the three-day monsoon session of assembly commencing on Aug 19.At present, the maximum jail term for such an offence is 10 years and the highest fine is Rs 50,000. The new bill proposes to raise the jail term to 14 years, and, in some cases, to 20 years which may even extend to life imprisonment. Arrests can be made without a warrant and the DM can seize properties acquired through crimes related to conversion.CM Pushkar Singh Dhami told TOI on Wednesday hours after the cabinet decision: ""Uttarakhand is Devbhoomi (the land of Gods) and a place where holy saints through the ages came and meditated. In the last few years, there have been instances of demographic changes under the guise of illegal conversions. The proposed amendment is a major step on our part to ensure that the social fabric of the Himalayan state is not changed.Therefore, we have come up with stringent measures to check the illegal practice.""According to the cabinet's proposal, ""Whoever receives funds from foreign or (other) entities concerning unlawful religious conversion shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than seven years and which may extend up to 14 years, and shall also be liable to a fine not less than Rs 10 lakh."" It further states, ""Whoever, with the intent to convert, instils fear for life or property, assaults or uses force, promises marriage or incites or conspires for such conversion, or traffics a minor woman or person or otherwise sells them, or attempts or conspires for this purpose, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 20 years and which may extend to life imprisonment, meaning imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life, and shall also be liable to a fine. ""As per the new provisions, concealing religion for marriage is a crime, and offenders could face three to 10 years in prison and a fine of Rs 3 lakh. On ""mass conversion"", the document says it will attract imprisonment of not less than seven years and up to 14 years, and shall be liable to a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh.Concerning ""a minor, woman or a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, or a disabled or mentally challenged person"", the punishment shall be imprisonment not less than five years, which may extend up to 14 years and liable to a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh. For general cases, the jail term would range from three years to 10 years and a fine of Rs 50,000.All offences under the new provisions shall be cognizable and non-bailable and triable by a sessions court. Arrests can be made without a warrant and bail will only be granted if the court is convinced the accused is not guilty and will not repeat the offence. As per the proposal, if any property is acquired through crimes related to conversion, the DM can seize it.The provision mentions: ""If the DM has reason to believe that any property in possession of a person, whether movable or immovable, was acquired as a result of an offence under this Act, they may order the seizure of such property, regardless of whether a court has taken cognisance of such offence.""Provisions of the Indian Civil Protection Code shall apply to every such seizure, with necessary modifications. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Code, the district magistrate may appoint an administrator for any property seized under subsection (1) and the administrator shall have all powers to manage it in the best interest of such property. The district magistrate may arrange for police assistance for the proper and effective management of such property by the administrator. ""The amendment has also redefined ""inducement"", which now means and includes offering any of the following: ""Any gift, gratification, easy money, or material benefit in cash or kind. Employment, free education in a school or college run by a religious institution, or a promise to marry or a better lifestyle, divine displeasure or otherwise. Portraying the practices, rituals and ceremonies of one religion in a harmful manner concerning another religion, or glorifying one religion against another.

Bid that bagged the 12 Earth Observation satellites PPP Project quoted Rs 0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bid-that-bagged-the-12-earth-observation-satellites-ppp-project-quoted-rs-0/articleshow/123291019.cms,"BENGALURU: In what’s unprecedented, the L1 quotation (lowest bid) by the consortium that won the 12 Earth Observation satellites project being implemented as a PPP by IN-SPACe, is Rs 0 (zero rupees). The consortium comprising Pixxel, PierSight, SatSure and Dhruva, which will bear the financial cost of the project, will invest more than Rs 1,2000 crore in the next four-five years.Confirming this, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka told TOI in a one-on-one interaction: “Obviously this was a competitive bid and each of the bidders would have evaluated the value of giving the opportunity to build this constellation. In the judgment of the winning bidder, they decided that even if they don’t get any money from the govt, it is important for them to get this opportunity to develop it and therefore they see a good financial opportunity in this constellation. ”Terming it a very big endorsement of how the private sector sees the future of space economy in India, he said: “...for a consortium to come forward and commit to invest more than Rs 1,200 crores of their own money with a full expectation, obviously, that they will more than recover their investment over a period of time.So I think it’s very, very positive news that the winning bidder has bid only zero.”As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the constellation of 12 satellites will feature a mix of sub-metre very high-resolution, wide-swath multispectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and hyperspectral satellites, enabling applications such as precision agriculture, water quality monitoring, land-use mapping, environmental compliance, disaster assessment, maritime operations, national security and infrastructure development.The project will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). “We have a time limit of 90 days for signing the agreement starting yesterday. Hopefully we sign much before that. As per the RFP, the lead player must have at least 26% ownership and each consortium member at least 10%. It will be a legal entity formed with well-defined roles for each of the four members.”SatSure CEO Prateep Basu said: “SatSure will be contributing two satellites in this consortium, with its novel optical and multi-spectral wide swath imager developed by its subsidiary KaleidEO. We’ll be commercialising our novel payload that provides high coverage at sub-meter spatial resolution. I believe this is a milestone not just for India’s space story, but for how EO technology can deliver meaningful, measurable value to users across different industries. ”PierSight will be producing at least two, if not three SAR satellites, while the remaining will be hyperspectral satellites from Pixxel’s stable. “SAR makes the constellation operational 24/7 in all weather conditions. Our role is to deliver radar‐first, analysis‐ready products with low latency, so agencies and enterprises get alerts and evidence, not just raw data,” PierSight CEO Gaurav Seth, said.Dhruva Space CEO Sanjay Nekkanti said the project reflects growing confidence in India’s private space tech sector. The company plans to leverage its upcoming spacecraft manufacturing facility in Telangana to scale production and offer turnkey ground station infrastructure. In partnership with consortium members, Dhruva aims to build an end-to-end, sovereign EO ecosystem.Goenka said IN-SPACe was very happy with the outcome, and added that when they started, the agency didn’t know whether there will be enough interest in the private sector to take on a project of this nature, because this is one of the largest investments made by the private sector in the space sector.“...Finally, to have three people qualify for the commercial bid, each wanting the project very, very badly, gives us confidence that there is tremendous optimism about the space sector opportunities in the private sector… It is a validation of the whole space sector reform,” he said.","In what’s unprecedented, the L1 quotation (lowest bid) by the consortium that won the 12 Earth Observation satellites project is Rs 0.

At the time, the couple reportedly held 87.6% shares in the firm.The accused allegedly sought a loan of Rs 75 crore at 12% interest but later persuaded him to route the funds as an ""investment"" to avoid higher taxation, while assuring monthly returns and repayment of principal. Kothari claims he transferred Rs 31.9 crore in April 2015 under a share subscription agreement, followed by another Rs 28.53 crore under a supplementary agreement in Sept 2015. The FIR says despite providing a personal guarantee in April 2016, Shetty resigned as director in Sept 2016.

"In a 1st in India, Goa to negotiate lower prices for life-saving therapies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-india-goa-to-negotiate-lower-prices-for-life-saving-therapies/articleshow/123290874.cms,"Representative image

PANAJI: In a move aimed at giving people greater access to high-cost medical treatment for cancer and rare diseases, Goa rolled out an innovative pricing policy for life-saving therapies.Under the policy, the state govt will procure drugs, medical equipment, and diagnostics from pharmaceutical firms at a lower negotiated price from the listed price, enabling budget allocation to cater to more patients or support a longer duration for therapies.Vishwajit Rane, health minister, said on Wednesday the govt is the first in the country to adopt this policy framework, which enables confidential pricing agreements between govt and pharmaceutical innovators. The rollout is likely to begin with lung cancer treatment.Innovative therapies for diseases like cancer, rare genetic disorders, and autoimmune conditions can cost upwards of Rs 50 lakh per year, making them difficult for most patients, he said.""Goa's adoption of this pricing policy is a vital and timely step to advance health equity in the state. This value-based approach to pricing will improve access for patients and marks a new era focusing on helping more patients,"" Rane said.This new innovation will prove beneficial to Goa, which is in the upper quartile of the list of highest cancer incidence rates in the country. The state sees around 1,500 new cancer patients every year, which is set to increase by 5% each year, with the most common cancer being breast cancer, accounting for over 300 annual cases, followed by oral cavity cancer, which accounts for 20-25% of all cancers.The healthcare system must be better equipped to handle the growing burden of cancers and rare disease cases, Rane said.A committee chaired by the additional or joint secretary of health and comprising the dean of GMC, director of health services, and pharmacy heads will be constituted to recommend appropriate pricing for approval by govt. The committee will also be empowered to negotiate with firms to secure the best rate for patented drugs and equipment after signing agreements.","State govt will procure drugs, medical equipment, and diagnostics from pharmaceutical firms at a lower negotiated price.

Lab-grown rabies antibodies show promise as safe alternative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lab-grown-rabies-antibodies-show-promise-as-safe-alternative/articleshow/123290787.cms,"MUMBAI: India's public hospitals and dispensaries may soon have a safer, more affordable option for preventing rabies after a suspected rabid dog bite: one already in use in private clinics since 2017 and by BMC since 2019. A post-marketing clinical trial involving more than 4,000 participants, conducted and funded by a pharmaceutical company and recently published in The Lancet, could now pave the way for its large-scale public use. For decades, the life-saving protocol has been the same across public or private health set ups: wash the wound, inject a dose of rabies immunoglobulin if the bite is severe, and follow with multiple doses of anti-rabies vaccine. The possible shift lies in the kind of immunoglobulin used. The relatively new lab-made candidate could replace the animal and human derived versions in use since the 1970s.An immunoglobulin is a concentrated solution of antibodies, injected directly into and around the bite, that offers immediate but short-term protection against the virus, effectively buying time until the vaccine takes full effect. The earliest ones in use were derived either from rabies-vaccinated horses (Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin - ERIG) or human donated plasma (Human Rabies Immunoglobulin - HRIG). In 2016, Serum Institute of India (SII) received permission to make immunoglobulin which has monoclonal (lab-made,RmAb) antibodies.""Most private facilities at least in Mumbai have phased out the use of the horse-derived one. While it has been proven safe at large, there are risks associated; it can cause mild allergic reactions or in rare cases a serious adverse event,"" said Dr Trupti Gilada, city-based infectious disease specialist. The private facilities have moved on to either the human derived or lab-made ones. ""Both, human derived one and the lab-made one have high efficacy. The former has risk of infection transmission, though rare. The ones made in labs are safer and more easily available due to ease of largescale production,"" said Dr Mandar Kubal, another infectious disease specialist.A survey by ICMR published in July on the availability of anti-rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin in health facilities found that, of the 534 facilities surveyed across 15 states and 60 districts -- 467 in the public sector -- 78% still used horse derived immunoglobulin. But even that was out of stock for most apart from a small 20.3% of those surveyed. While BMC uses the lab-made alternative, it is no stranger to shortages; at the moment it is short of rabies vaccine shots.A doctor from one of the four BMC-run medical college hospitals, said, ""Mumbai has a heavy burden of dog bite cases and early on BMC decided to move on from animal derived ones due to risks associated. We either use generic human derived immunoglobulin or largely lab-made alternatives."" But this lab-made alternative is still to make its way into National Guidelines for Rabies Prophylaxis. The ICMR survey states, ""RmAb presents as a promising alternative to both HRIG and ERIG. Compared to ERIG, RmAb offers the potential scope for large-scale production with standardised quality, elimination of animal use in the manufacturing, & reduced risk of adverse events.""It is cheaper compared to HRIG. Studies have shown that RmAbs are safe for human use, but... [there is] a need for larger clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance to assess the safety and efficacy of RmAbs in the Indian setting."" The Serum Institute-funded post marketing trial of its lab-made product compared with horse-derived immunoglobulin found to be equally effective in preventing rabies, with slightly higher average antibody levels on day 14.","India's public hospitals and dispensaries may soon have a safer, more affordable option for preventing rabies after a suspected rabid dog bite.

Parliamentary panel slams 'perpetual tolling' on national highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliamentary-panel-slams-perpetual-tolling-on-national-highways/articleshow/123290670.cms,"NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel looking into the levy of user fees or toll charges on National Highways (NHs) has raised concerns over the current practice of ""perpetual tolling"" even after project costs are recovered and a 3% annual escalation, irrespective of the highway quality, traffic volume, or user affordability.While recommending rationalisation and substantial reduction in toll charges on such stretches, its report has also mooted a ""tariff authority"" for toll fixation. The Public Accounts Committee headed by Congress MP K C Venugopal said, ""Any continuation of tolls beyond this point should be permitted only if clearly justified and approved by the proposed independent oversight authority"". It said the road transport ministry can establish the authority on the lines of the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) in the civil aviation sector, to ensure transparency and fairness in toll fixation, collection, and regulation. The report added that the authority should be mandated to review and determine the periodicity of toll revisions based on certain parameters.In response to the PAC's observation that there is no institutional mechanism to independently evaluate whether toll charges are justified in relation to actual operation and maintenance costs or future service requirements, the ministry said it has initiated a study with NITI Aayog to revise the user fees determination framework, including base rates, inflation indexing, and concession structures.As per the report, the ministry told PAC that it has requested NITI Aayog to carry out a study in association with IITs and IIMs.The panel has also sought review of all existing contracts and publicly funded toll plazas allowing tolling beyond the cost recovery period, to safeguard user interest and uphold the principle of equity. It said that while higher toll charges are justified during the period of concession agreement, their collection after that needs to be justified.","A parliamentary panel looking into the levy of user fees or toll charges on National Highways has raised concerns over the current practice of ""perpetual tolling"" The Public Accounts Committee headed by Congress MP K C Venugopal said, ""Any continuation of tolls beyond this point should be permitted only if clearly justified and approved""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123290686,imgsize-813993,width-400,resizemode-4/123290686.jpg"

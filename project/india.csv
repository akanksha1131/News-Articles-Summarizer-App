Ginza Vualzong, the organisation's secretary of information and publicity, clarified that a recent appeal to residents of Kangpokpi to cooperate with central security forces was only meant to ensure no fingers were pointed at them for anything untoward occurring on that stretch.KZC said the appeal shouldn't be interpreted as a call for unrestricted movement across buffer zones separating Meitei and Kuki-Zo territories, the two communities involved in the ethnic conflict that flared up in April 2023.Vualzong said it was solely the Union govt's responsibility to keep NH-2 safe for traffic by deploying ""neutral"" central forces.The response came soon after the MHA hailed what it termed a ""significant decision"" by KZC to reopen the highway.The ministry's statement mentioned that the breakthrough was the outcome of a series of meetings in Delhi with the Kuki leadership over the past few days to get them to lift the blockade.On MHA stressing on ""free movement"" of civilian and goods traffic on NH-2, the Kuki leadership said it the community wasn't accountable beyond cooperating with forces deployed for security. ""It's not duty of the local public or KZC to guarantee security. The ministry of home affairs has assured us that adequate central forces will be deployed,"" the council said. Running through a swathe of Kangpokpi, NH-2 is a corridor for fuel, food and medical supplies. Any disruption, real or perceived, has a cascading effect on Meitei-majority Imphal Valley.Since the outbreak of ethnic violence, the highway has become a symbol of the fractured relationship between the Meitei and Kuki communities.KZC expressed surprise at the noise over NH-2, saying the highway hadn't witnessed any trouble in recent months.

Rampal, of Satlok Ashram in Barwala, Hisar in Haryana, has been in jail for over a decade since his arrest.The division bench of justices Gurvinder Singh Gill and Deepinder Singh Nalwa ordered, ""The applicant (Rampal) is directed not to promote any kind of 'mob mentality' and avoid participating in congregations where there is any kind of tendency amongst 'disciples' or participants to cause a breach in peace, law, and order"".

In what the government on Wednesday called a Diwali gift, the GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors.

All Indian breads have been exempted even though only a few goods have been mentioned as examples.These goods attracted compensation cess in addition to GST.

The changes have been made only for paneer supplied in pre-packaged and labelled form. Paneer is an Indian cottage cheese. This is mostly produced in the small scale sector. The measure is intended to promote Indian cottage cheese.Admission to other sporting events, including recognised sporting events, where the ticket price is not more than Rs 500 continues to be exempt, and if the ticket price is more than Rs 500, it continues to be taxed at the standard rate of 18%.","GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors.

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

The Staff Selection Commission ( SSC ) has announced major changes for the upcoming Combined Graduate Level (CGL) exam in September 2025. In an exclusive interview with Navbharat Times (NBT), SSC Chairman S. Gopalakrishnan said that candidates faced many problems in earlier exams, such as computer glitches, non-working devices, Aadhaar verification delays, and far-off exam centres.To solve these issues and make the process smoother, SSC has introduced new measures. These include conducting the exam in a single shift, improving centre allocation, introducing a fair scoring system, and making Aadhaar verification mandatory. The reforms aim to make the exam more transparent, convenient, and fair for all candidates across India.SSC has decided to hold the CGL exam in one single shift instead of multiple shifts. This ensures that all candidates get the same exam experience and reduces problems caused by different question papers in different shifts.Many candidates in previous exams had to travel long distances to reach their centres. Now, SSC will allot exam centres within a 100 km radius of the candidate’s address.Currently, 80% of candidates get nearby centres, and SSC plans to increase this to over 90% in future exams.Moreover, SSC has also introduced a shift-wise normalisation system to ensure fair scoring. This method adjusts marks if question papers in different shifts have varying difficulty levels, so no candidate is at a disadvantage.SSC has divided responsibilities among four vendors:SSC itself will directly supervise question paper creation to maintain quality and consistency.","The Staff Selection Commission ( SSC) has announced major changes for the upcoming Combined Graduate Level (CGL) exam in September 2025.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions, a development that comes close on the heels of his meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.“You cannot talk to India or China in that way,” Putting said, addressing the media after attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit and a military parade in Beijing. “The colonial era is now over.

If one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over. So that influences his behaviour.”Tensions will, however, eventually ease, according to the Russian President. “Ultimately, things will be sorted out, everything will take its place, and we will see normal political dialogue again,” he said.Meanwhile, Russia is stepping up fertiliser supplies to India this year and both sides will sign a pact for Arctic cooperation next year.",Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions.

""No one can forget how the Congress government had increased your monthly budget... They used to levy a 21% tax even on toffees for children. If Modi had done this, they would have pulled my hair out. ""The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led NDA government has been in power at the Center since 2014.""Without timely changes, we cannot give our country its rightful place in today's global situation. I had said from the Red Fort on 15 August this time that it is crucial to undertake next-generation reforms to make India self-reliant.I had also promised the countrymen that there would be a double blast of happiness before this Diwali and Chhath Puja,"" PM Modi said while interacting with National Awardee Teachers.""GST 2.0 is a double dose of support and growth for the nation.

Massive Chaos in Bengal Assembly: BJP and TMC Trade 'Chor' Jibes, Mamata Speech Triggers Ruckus

NEW DELHI: The West Bengal Assembly on Thursday witnessed uproar as MLAs of the ruling TMC and opposition BJP raised slogans, disrupting a discussion on a government resolution concerning alleged atrocities against Bengali migrants.The disruption began when chief minister Mamata Banerjee was about to speak on the resolution. BJP legislators raised slogans and questioned the suspension of Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari on September 2, leading to strong protests from the treasury benches.Addressing the House, Banerjee accused the BJP of being against Bangla-speaking people.""I condemn BJP for their persecution of Bengalis. A time will soon come when not a single BJP MLA will remain in Bengal. The people themselves will ensure it. BJP will face inevitable defeat, for no party that wages linguistic terror against Bengalis can ever win Bengal,"" she said.She also called the BJP a party of ""vote chor"".""BJP is a party of vote-chors, corrupt to the core, persecutors of Bengalis, and masters of deception. BJP is a national disgrace, and I condemn them in the strongest terms,"" Banerjee said.The chief minister further accused the BJP of blocking a discussion on alleged attacks on Bengali migrant workers in BJP-ruled states.""Why is the BJP against discussion on the attacks on Bengali migrants? It is because these incidents are taking place in states ruled by the party. They want to suppress the truth,"" she claimed.Amid continuous sloganeering, Banerjee asked, ""Why is the BJP not allowing me to speak in this House?""She added, ""We are not against Hindi or any other language, but the BJP is clearly anti-Bengali. Their attitude shows a colonial and dictatorial mindset. They want to turn West Bengal into their colony.""As the protests continued, Speaker Biman Banerjee suspended BJP chief whip Shankar Ghosh for the rest of the day for creating disorder. When Ghosh refused to leave, assembly marshals were called in and he was dragged out of the House.Later, BJP MLAs Agnimitra Paul, Mihir Goswami, Bankim Ghosh and Ashok Dinda were subsequently suspended as the ruckus intensified.BJP legislators alleged that water bottles were thrown at them from the treasury benches during the commotion.Marshals remained on guard inside the House to prevent any physical clash between the two sides.Banerjee criticised the conduct of BJP legislators, saying they were trying to derail a discussion on the situation of Bengali migrants.Intensifying her criticism, the Bengal CM also alleged that the BJP’s ""ideological ancestors"" had betrayed the country during the freedom movement.""The BJP is a party of dictators. Their ancestors did not fight for India’s Independence; they betrayed the country,"" she said.As the exchanges grew heated, some MLAs from the treasury benches moved towards the opposition benches, prompting marshals to step in. The uproar forced Banerjee to briefly pause her speech.She further alleged that the BJP-led Union government had ""sold the prestige"" of India before foreign powers, claiming that the Centre was ""at times begging before the United States, and at times before China.""Meanwhile, replying to CM Mamata Banerjee's address in the House, West Bengal LoP and BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari, ""She abused the Modi community...Mamata Banerjee will have to go.

June phone call that changed the tone: Report



Operation Sindoor and the ceasefire claim



Tariff tantrums: From trade tariffs to a 50% wall





Tianjin optics: Putin’s limousine and Xi’s warm handshake



Oil at the centre of geopolitics



The China Plus One dilemma



Hedging, not aligning



A sinking boat or a reset ahead?



NEW DELHI: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood beside Donald Trump at Houston’s Howdy Modi event in 2019, it was more than just a diaspora spectacle. It was the visible embodiment of a strategic bet -- that personal chemistry between leaders could fast-track an alignment between the world’s largest democracy and its oldest.That narrative survived Trump’s turbulent first term and carried into his second, when PM Modi returned to Washington on 13 February 2025 for an official working visit that produced warm optics and a joint statement.But from there on, relations between the White House and Lok Kalyan Marg followed a deteriorating trajectory. The so-called ""ceasefire"" episode during Operation Sindoor, followed by Trump’s boastful claims of brokering a ceasefire in South Asia, dented trust. The rupture deepened with Washington’s tariff barrage on Indian exports and energy imports. What began as a handshake friendship risked descending into a transactional cold shoulder.By late summer 2025, Delhi and Washington were left to manage what diplomats called “the sinking boat of trade.” The tariff chapter is expected to hit Indian businesses hard, and Donald Trump’s demands for visible loyalty irritated policymakers in New Delhi.However, after the RIC (Russia–India–China) display at Tianjin during the SCO summit on 1 September 2025, there were signs that Trump’s tariff tantrums were moderating -- a signal that both capitals may still be looking for a revival, even as Delhi hedges with Moscow and Beijing.The first major rupture came on 17 June 2025, in a phone call between PM Modi and Trump. According to a report by The New York Times, Trump repeatedly claimed credit for de-escalating a flare-up between India and Pakistan -- a claim PM Modi did not endorse. Trump allegedly asked PM Modi to “acknowledge” his role publicly and even floated the idea of support for a Nobel Peace Prize. PM Modi’s refusal hardened Trump’s mood.The phone call was never officially confirmed in detail, but Indian officials hinted that “unnecessary self-congratulation” had strained the dialogue. For analysts, it marked the point where the personal rapport between the two leaders began to fray.The backdrop to that phone call was Operation Sindoor, India’s limited but high-visibility military action along the western frontier in early June 2025. New Delhi framed the operation as a targeted counter-terror response, but Trump publicly suggested the US had pressured both India and Pakistan into restraint -- an assertion dismissed in Delhi as exaggerated.Trump’s claim of having “secured a ceasefire” created domestic political unease for PM Modi. Critics accused him of allowing India’s sovereignty to be undermined by Washington’s narrative. While Indian officials tried to downplay the rhetoric, the perception that Trump was using South Asia for self-promotion lingered.Dr Ashok Sharma, Visiting Fellow at the University of New South Wales Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy, speaking to Times of India, noted that “Donald Trump, in his first term, was not as blunt in his dealings with India, but in his current tenure he appears far more unpredictable and has moved away from the traditional Republican stance on New Delhi. Some experts even describe this shift as a ‘reverse Nixon’ move against India. ”What followed was harsher and measurable: tariffs. On 27 August 2025, Washington slapped Indian goods with up to 50% tariffs, citing unfair trade practices and New Delhi’s refusal to scale back Russian oil imports. The move stunned Indian exporters and undercut years of lobbying by US businesses who had invested in India as a “China Plus One” base.Indian officials called the decision “unjustified,” pointing out that India’s trade surplus with the US was far smaller than China’s and that Indian companies were still major buyers of American goods. More sensitive still was Washington’s explicit linking of tariffs to India’s Russian crude purchases. New Delhi defended its buying spree as an energy security necessity.The tariffs threatened a chilling effect: Industries ranging from textiles and pharmaceuticals to steel and IT services saw immediate cost spikes. Analysts warned that the penalties risked unravelling one of the few bipartisan achievements in US foreign policy -- strengthening ties with India to balance China.As Sharma explained, “Trump’s bluntness stems from India’s recent resistance to Washington’s attempts to dictate terms, seen in the Operation Sindoor episode and the ongoing tariff disputes. His aggressive posture has now expanded into a broader offensive against Brics nations, signalling a recalibration of US foreign policy priorities.”The SCO summit in Tianjin on September 1 provided the clearest demonstration of how Delhi was recalibrating. PM Modi held bilateral meetings with both Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, emphasising long-term ties and regional cooperation.The images that dominated television screens back home in India were not of a wary handshake with Xi, but of PM Modi riding with Putin in his Aurus limousine after the summit -- a gesture of camaraderie choreographed for the cameras.Indian officials framed the meetings as pragmatic diplomacy. But the symbolism was unavoidable; after weeks of bruising tariffs from Washington, New Delhi was visibly embracing Moscow and engaging China in a multilateral setting.Energy has been the unspoken driver of this shift. Since 2022, when sanctions pushed Russian crude out of Western markets, India and China have emerged as Moscow’s top buyers. By mid-2025, discounted Russian oil accounted for nearly 40% of India’s crude imports. That cushion allowed Delhi to contain domestic inflation and keep refineries humming.For Washington, those purchases looked like undermining sanctions. For Delhi, they were a non-negotiable necessity. “We will buy where our people’s needs are met,” India’s petroleum minister told reporters in August 2025. The clash of perspectives turned energy into a wedge -- one that Russia and China exploited to court India more closely.For global business, the fallout has been stark. The “China Plus One” strategy -- moving some production away from China into other markets like India, Vietnam or Mexico took a hit as US tariffs made Indian exports less competitive. Companies that had invested in India expecting favourable access to the US market suddenly faced higher costs and uncertainty.Some Indian economists warned that the tariff shock could slow manufacturing growth just as India was positioning itself as a global alternative to Chinese supply chains. “If the US is unpredictable on tariffs, investors will think twice,” said one Mumbai-based economist.Sharma underlined that “foreign policy always depends on reliability as much as interests, and by tightening trade while demanding alignment, Washington exposed its unpredictability. For Indian policymakers, the message was clear: overreliance on the US carried risks. By alienating India, Washington achieved the opposite of its aim, nudging New Delhi and Beijing toward dialogue.”Despite the warmth in Tianjin, India’s strategy is not a wholesale pivot to Russia and China. Security tensions with Beijing remain unresolved after the 2020 Galwan clashes, and mistrust along the Line of Actual Control lingers. Defence cooperation with the US from intelligence sharing to the Quad partnership continues in parallel.What has changed is India’s willingness to publicly hedge. In September 2025, that hedge was displayed in three acts: Trump’s June 17 call; Washington’s 27 August tariffs; and PM Modi’s 1 September SCO appearances. Together they showed how quickly personal frictions and trade measures can spill into the strategic domain.The story of PM Modi and Trump in 2025 is not just about two personalities falling out. It is a case study in how transactionalism can undermine strategic trust. What began as the much-touted “bromance” of Houston now looks like a fragile arrangement tested by ego, tariffs and oil.Whether Delhi and Washington can patch the “sinking boat of trade” remains to be seen. With signs that Trump’s tariff fury is easing after Tianjin, there may be space for a reset. But the episode has left its mark; India is more willing than before to be seen with Moscow and Beijing, and Washington has learned that economic coercion can backfire in Asia’s most important swing state.","Relations between India and the U.S. have deteriorated in recent years. The first major rupture came on 17 June 2025, in a phone call between PM Modi and Trump. The rupture deepened with Washington’s tariff barrage on Indian exports and energy imports. However, after the RIC (Russia–India–China) display at Tianjin during the SCO summit on 1 September 2025, there were signs that Trump's tariffs were moderating.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123703793,imgsize-1214542,width-400,resizemode-4/qw-79.jpg"

Infant mortality rate posts 1-pt decline

NEW DELHI: Highlighting that Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year and stays well below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, the latest Sample Registration System (SRS) Statistical report 2023 shows TFR for rural India for the first time touched 2.1 - the replacement rate, where one generation replaces itself, leading to population stability.Rates above replacement rate 2.1 suggest population growth, and the rates below that level indicate a declining population and a potential ageing population. Nationally, India's TFR touched replacement level in 2019 and was at 2.0 since 2020. TFR represents the average number of children born to a woman during her reproductive years.As per SRS report, Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) for 2023 is estimated at 0.9, which means that on average, each woman in India is having one daughter who survives to reproductive age and has children of her own. Rural GRR (1.0) was slightly higher than urban GRR (0.7), which suggests that women in rural areas are having more daughters than women in urban areas.GRR is a refined measure of fertility that accounts for future mothers and measures the average number of female children a woman is expected to give birth during her entire reproductive span conforming to the age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) for a given year, if there is no mortality.GRR values for major states/UTs range from 0.6 in Delhi, Bengal and TN to 1.3 in Bihar.TFR for rural areas was 2.2 in 2022 and 1.6 for urban. Going by TFR for 2023, at present, a rural woman would have about one child more than an urban woman having a TFR of 1.5 on an average.As far as states go, Bihar had highest TFR among bigger states/UTs at 2.8, followed by UP (2.6), MP (2.4) and and Rajasthan (2.3). Delhi records the lowest TFR at 1.2, followed by TN and Bengal at 1.3 each.Maharashtra stands at 1.4, while Andhra, J&K, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, and Telangana each have a TFR of 1.5. TFR in urban areas was generally lower than in rural areas across all major states/UTs in India, except Kerala and TN.\The SRSReport 2023 shows that infant mortality rate (IMR) registered a one-point decline from 26 per 1,000 live births in 2022 at the national level. Among bigger states, maximum IMR was observed at 37 each in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, & minimum at five in Kerala and three in Manipur. However, the report noted that despite this decline, one in every 40 infants at the national level die within one year of life — one in every 36 infants in rural areas and one in every 56 infants in urban areas. The report highlighted that the decline in IMR from 32 in 2018 to 25 in 2023, marks a decline of seven points over past five years and an annual average decline of about 1.4 points. The corresponding decline in rural IMR has been eight points (36 in 2018 to 28 in 2023) against a decline of five points in urban IMR (23 in 2018 to 18 in 2023). IMR for both genders have shown a decline during 2018-23. With regard to Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), in 2023, the country saw a decline of one point (29 in 2023 against 30 in 2022). There has been a decline of one point in female U5MR and no changes has been observed in male U5MR during the corresponding period.","India's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year.

NEW DELHI: Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) hopes to finally deliver the first two `improved’ Tejas Mark-1A fighters to the IAF next month after a long delay, but it will be contingent on the single-engine indigenous jet completing its weapon firing trials.The firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs, which will also demonstrate proper integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system of the Tejas Mark-1A fighter, are scheduled later this month. “Software modifications have been made after a previous test failed,” a source at the defence PSU said.The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, as well as weapons and radar integration issues are the main reasons behind the excruciatingly slow pace of production of the Tejas Mark-1A jets.“GE has delivered two engines so far. It has promised to deliver 10 more engines by March next year, and then 20 every year thereafter,” the source said.The IAF is keeping its fingers crossed. The force has so far got only 38 of the first 40 Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010.It is yet to get the first Tejas Mark-1A jet of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021. All the 83 jets, incidentally, were to be delivered in the Feb 2024-Feb 2028 timeframe. The PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved the acquisition of another 97 of the jets for Rs 66,500 crore on Aug 19, as was then reported by TOI.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh has publicly criticised HAL for the delays, noting that IAF was “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.The IAF will go down to its lowest-ever figure of 29 fighter squadrons after retirement of the 36 old MiG-21s still in service on Sept 26. This when the force is authorized 42.5 combat squadrons to tackle the twin challenge from China and Pakistan.","The firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles and laser- guided bombs are scheduled later this month.

Supreme Court to probe green norms violation in Himalayan region,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-probe-green-norms-violation-in-himalayan-region/articleshow/123706489.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday decided to investigate allegations made through a PIL that flagrant violation of environmental norms in developmental and road projects in the fragile Himalayan region is causing cloudbursts, torrential rains, flash floods and landslides in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, and Punjab.Advocate Akash Vashishtha, appearing on behalf of petitioner Anamika Rana, drew the attention of a bench of Chief Justice Bhushan R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran to the havoc caused by unusually heavy rains in the hill states as well as the inundation of vast swathes in Punjab, and sought formation of an SIT to find ways and means to preserve the delicate ecology of the Himalayan region after ascertaining the causes of such natural disasters.The bench issued notices to MHA, MoEF&CC and Jal Shakti, as well as NDMA, NHAI, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, J&K and Punjab and asked them to file responses within two weeks.CJI Gavai recorded court's concerns about rampant illegal felling of trees in the upper reaches of Himalayas. ""We have taken note of seriousness of the situation. Videos of flash floods show large numbers of logs being swept down and is a prima facie indicator of illegal cutting down of trees in the hills,"" he said.Turning to solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was present in the courtroom for another case, the CJI told the law officer to take note of the serious problem and illegal felling of trees. Mehta said he would get in touch with the secretary in MoEF&CC and request him to discuss the issue with environment secretaries of the states concerned.""We have interfered with nature so much that it is now giving back,"" Mehta said. The CJI agreed and said time has come to take drastic steps to preserve whatever we have and strictly adhere to the path of sustainable development.Rana, in her PIL, alleged that failure of environmental authorities to preserve the pristine ecology of the Himalayan region, flagrant violation of the hill road construction code, and encroachment of water channels and water bodies constitute the cocktail of reasons for the vicissitudes of nature to wreak havoc through unprecedented rains.The petitioner sought ""formation of a SIT involving experts to find out the reasons for these disasters, determine responsibilities of officials, suggest measures to help protect the ecology of Himalayan States"" and keep their population safe from disasters.","Supreme Court decides to investigate allegations made through a PIL.

The ""Axis of Upheaval""

A 'Multipolar' world?

Trump’s provocative response

A single photograph from the recently concluded Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit has become the focal point of intense debate across US media. The image, showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin laughing and exchanging pleasantries, has been hailed as a symbol of a rapidly shifting global order, one that some are now calling a ""new world order"" dominated by Asia.Captured in Tianjin, the photograph depicts three of the most powerful figures in the world today standing shoulder to shoulder, sending a clear message about the growing unity among countries that have faced increasing tensions with the United States.The image, taken during the summit's final moments, has sparked significant commentary from US political analysts, with some expressing alarm over the growing influence of a multi-polar world and the decline of American dominance.US political commentator Van Jones, speaking on CNN, did not mince words when analyzing the significance of the image. “That image of Xi Jinping with Putin, with Modi, with the leader of Iran, and the leader of North Korea, should send a chill down the spine of every American,” he said. Jones warned that the photograph marked a pivotal moment in global relations, suggesting that the traditional US-centric order was under threat.“We’re going to look back on today historically as a very big deal,” Jones continued, adding that the formation of this grouping signified that ""the West is now in a box."" He argued that the US is now ""on the bad end of the triangle"" as global powers realign themselves, particularly those who have found themselves on the receiving end of US tariffs and foreign policy pressures.Jones's reaction echoes a broader anxiety within the US media regarding the rise of non-Western powers, and the perceived collapse of traditional alliances that have long underpinned US influence. In the wake of the photograph's circulation, many commentators in Washington warned that this increasingly multipolar world could leave America increasingly isolated.The timing of the summit, and the leaders’ visible camaraderie, has fueled concerns among US analysts about the formation of a bloc of countries that could challenge American dominance.The Washington Post was quick to label the gathering as the first formal meeting of an ""anti-American axis of upheaval,"" with the leaders of Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia at the helm. This grouping, the paper argued, represents a new coalition of powers that is actively resisting US influence in global affairs.The New York Times also took note of the significance of the photograph, suggesting that the bond between Xi and Putin, both of whom have long been at odds with Washington, was now central to a broader challenge to the US-led world order.The article highlighted that PM Modi’s presence underscored India’s growing diplomatic pivot toward these countries, even in the face of unresolved border disputes with China.As US media dissected the photograph, many commentators, including Jones, drew attention to what they saw as the emergence of a new “multipolar” world.The idea of a multipolar world suggests a global order with multiple power centers, challenging the traditional dominance of the United States and its allies. At the SCO summit, President Xi emphasized the need for countries to reject Cold War thinking, warning against rival power blocs and bullying.Xi's call for a more just and balanced global governance system struck a chord with those critical of US hegemony. The Chinese president's message resonated with many at the summit, who viewed it as a direct rebuke to the West's attempts to impose its values on other regions. “We need to reject the law of the jungle, where the strong prey on the weak,” Xi stated, signaling a firm stance against what he and others see as Western coercion.For many in the US, these remarks reinforced the notion that Washington’s influence was waning. The growing cooperation between China, Russia, and India, despite their differences, has been interpreted as a direct response to what they view as America's increasingly unilateral approach to global affairs.The US reaction to the SCO summit was not limited to political analysts and commentators. US President Donald Trump, never shy about expressing his views on global affairs, took to his social media platform Truth Social to comment on the summit's outcome. Trump’s post, which sarcastically wished President Xi and his counterparts a “great and lasting day of celebration,” reflected his deep concern about the growing solidarity between these leaders.""Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,"" Trump wrote, reflecting his view that the gathering represented a collective challenge to US interests.","A single photograph from the recently concluded Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit has become the focal point of intense debate across US media. The image, showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin laughing and exchanging pleasantries, has been hailed as a symbol of a rapidly shifting global order. Some commentators have expressed alarm over the growing influence of a multi-polar world and the decline of American dominance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123705983,width-400,resizemode-4/photos-show-modi-putin-and-xi-in-a-huddle.jpg"
AIIMS finds Lady Hardinge panel wrongly disqualified disabled candidates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aiims-finds-lady-hardinge-panel-wrongly-disqualified-disabled-candidates/articleshow/123676736.cms,"Representative photo

AIIMS experts have found that senior doctors of Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) wrongly certified two hearing impaired NEET-qualified students as ineligible for reservation for persons with disabilities (PWD). Despite their Unique Disability ID stating that the percentage of disability of the two candidates was 63% and 50%, the three-member LHMC board certified them as 14% and 2% respectively.An AIIMS board was constituted on the Delhi High Court’s direction after the two students filed against the certification. After conducting a battery of tests, the AIIMS experts certified the two candidates’ disability level as 66.5% and 43.13%. This incident has raised questions about other candidates who might have been disqualified by the same board, but who could not afford to approach the court.Based on the AIIMS report, the court ordered that the two candidates be allowed to participate in the second round of counselling for MBBS admission. Wrong certification by the LHMC doctors led to them missing the first round of counselling.Disability rights activists have demanded an enquiry into the certification process in LHMC and against the doctors who wrongly certified the students.The LHMC medical board consisted of Prof Dr A Chakravati and assistant professors Dr Pallika Kumar and Dr Raman Kumar.Unique disability ID, issued by designated health authorities, was launched as asingle document of identification and verification of the disabled for availing various benefits in future. Only those whose disability level is 40% or above are eligible for the 5% disability quota seats in MBBS admission.“Much uproar is raised over fake disability certificates, but who questions the doctors on three-member medical boards who arbitrarily assign percentages? With clearly gazetted assessment guidelines in place, how can 50-60% suddenly shrink to 2% or 14%? These are not mere mistakes, but grave blunders that crush students’ careers and amount to medical negligence,” said Dr Satendra Singh, a founder member of Doctors with Disabilities: Agents of Change, India’s largest network of health professionals with disabilities. Dr Singh demanded that accountability be fixed for this negligence.The candidates were evaluated clinically and audiologically through five different tests. The first two (Pure Tone Audiometry and Speech audiometry) are subjective hearing tests as response depends upon the cooperation of the patients.However, the next three (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry or BERA/ABR, otoacoustic emission and impedance audiometry) are objective hearing test that do not require the cooperation of the patient and therefore are being utilized with an increased frequency for detecting malingering or to determine if a candidate is feigning a higher level of hearing loss. BERA, which is the test that provides clinching evidence, is available in most physiology and ENT departments in Delhi hospitals."," AIIMS experts found that senior doctors of Lady Hardinge Medical College wrongly certified two hearing impaired NEET-qualified students as ineligible for reservation for persons with disabilities (PWD) Despite their Unique Disability ID stating that the percentage of disability of the two candidates was 63% and 50%, the three-member LHMC board certified them as 14% and 2% respectively.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123676742,imgsize-52044,width-400,resizemode-4/disability.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Rain-battered north India just experienced its wettest two-week period in at least the past 14 years, available IMD records since 2012 reveal. From Aug 22 to Sept 4, the region logged nearly 3x of normal rainfall, triggering extreme weather fury in nearly all parts of the region - including cloudbursts on the Vaishno Devi route in J&K, worst-in-decades floods in Punjab, the third highest recorded levels of the Yamuna in Delhi and widespread landslides in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.North India recorded 205.3mm of rain in these 14 days against a normal of 73.1mm, accounting for 35% of the region's usual quota for the entire four-month monsoon season. The intense spell has put the region on course to registering its wettest monsoon in 37 years since 1988.North India, a region meteorologically known as northwest India, has received 691.7mm of rain in the monsoon season (since June 1) so far, nearly 37% higher than normal. Even if the region gets normal rainfall for rest of the season, which ends on Sept 30, the total is likely to cross 750mm. That will put this season's rainfall as second-highest in north India in last 50 years, behind 813.5mm recorded in 1988 and ahead of 737mm logged in 1994.During the past two weeks of weather fury, the region's total monsoon rainfall surplus climbed steeply from 11.6% on Aug 22 to nearly 37% on Thursday. Across a large region such as north India, the mean daily rainfall to sustain such high levels for two weeks is rare. So, what caused this prolonged spell of intense rain?""This period saw a rare instance of back-to-back spells of two-system interactions, that is, a 'western disturbance' bringing moist wind flows from regions close to the Mediterranean Sea converging with monsoon winds from the east.The first such interaction took place from Aug 23 to 27, and then another one began on Aug 29 and is expected to last till Friday,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD chief.Such interactions are known to unleash very heavy rainfall and cloudbursts in the western Himalayan states, the most devastating example being Kedarnath deluge in June 2013. While such two-system convergences are uncommon in the peak monsoon period of July-Aug, back-to-back occurrences are extremely rare.Except for east UP, the two-week spell caused extreme rain in all sub-divisions of northwest India. Punjab was most heavily impacted, logging 388% surplus rain in the first week and 454% in the second. In the past week ending Sept 3, the subdivision of Haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh recorded 325% excess rainfall, Himachal Pradesh 314%, west Rajasthan 285%, J&K 240% and Uttarakhand 190%.","North India recorded 205.3mm of rain in these 14 days against a normal of 73.1mm.

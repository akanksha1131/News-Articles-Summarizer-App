Joke row: Kunal Kamra moves Bombay HC seeking to quash FIR over 'traitor' jibe at Eknath Shinde,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/joke-row-kunal-kamra-moves-bombay-hc-seeking-to-quash-fir-over-traitor-jibe-at-eknath-shinde/articleshow/120051658.cms,"NEW DELHI: Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra has approached the Bombay high court seeking to quash an FIR filed against him.The case is related to his remarks referring to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde as a 'traitor' during a recent performance.The remark sparked a row after the stand-up show went live, leading Shiv Sena workers to vandalise Mumbai’s Habitat Studio, where Kamra had performed the set.Kamra filed a quashing petition before the Bombay HC against the FIR registered at Khar police station over his show. Senior counsel Navroz Seervai is expected to mention the matter for urgent hearing and seek interim relief against any coercive action by the police.His plea claims the complaints against him violate his fundamental rights to freedom of speech and expression, the right to practise any profession or trade, and the right to life and liberty guaranteed under the Constitution of India.The petition, filed through advocate Meenaz Kakalia, is likely to be heard by a bench headed by Justice Sarang Kotwal on April 21.Last month, Kamra was granted interim transit anticipatory bail by the Madras high court in connection with the case. He is a permanent resident of Tamil Nadu. The comedian has not responded to three summons issued by the Mumbai police for questioning.During a performance, Kamra had taunted Shinde—without naming him—by using a modified version of a Hindi song from the film Dil To Pagal Hai, in which he referred to him as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). He also joked about Shinde's rebellion against former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Following a complaint by Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel, Mumbai police registered the FIR under sections 353(1)(b) (statements conducing to public mischief) and 356(2) (defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.","Kunal Kamra has approached the Bombay high court seeking to quash an FIR filed against him.

‘Domestic guests account for upto 80% of our guests now; seeing rapid growth:’ Hyatt India MD Sunjae Sharma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/domestic-guests-account-for-upto-80-of-our-guests-now-seeing-rapid-growth-hyatt-india-md-sunjae-sharma/articleshow/120051604.cms,"Sunjae Sharma, Hyatt (India & Southwest Asia) MD

NEW DELHI: Domestic travellers continue to remain the backbone for hotels in India. American hospitality major Hyatt Hotels is planning says its domestic to foreign guest ratio now goes as high as 80 to 20, as opposed to 65 to 35 in pre-Covid times. While foreign inbound is yet to return to 2019 levels in India and more people who used to holiday within the country from mid 2020 for about 2.5 years are now going abroad, domestic travel continues to remain very strong.“Our domestic to international ratio is now 70-80 to 20-30. Covid is behind is and we are seeing a double digit growth year over year in India since then. This growth is essentially fuelled by India’s young population, improved connectivity, opening of new airports, creating new destinations and a booming economy. The growth for luxury and experiential stays is rising very rapidly here. And Tier II & III cities are proving to be the engines for growth,” Sunjae Sharma, Hyatt (India & Southwest Asia) MD, told TOI.Riding high on the India success story, the American hospitality major is planning to bring its “inclusive” brands to India — Ziva and Zilara — where guests pay for everything like all meals and other services upfront and not on a piecemeal basis for services made use of. This is likely to be 20%-30% more expensive than the current average luxury tariff of Rs 20,000-30,000.Hyatt currently has over 10,000 rooms in India across 50 properties. “We will open seven this year in places like Ghaziabad, Kasauli, Kochi, Bhopal, Vithalapur and Jaipur. These destinations reflect a strategic mix of business, religious, and leisure travel, aligning with the preferences of domestic and international travellers. Hyatt will have 100 properties in India within five years,” Sharma said.""2024 marked a watershed year for Hyatt in India, with unprecedented growth and successful signing of 21 new properties across diverse markets. This momentum propels us forward, and we're committed to continued innovation and excellence in the region. We are excited to build on this momentum with even more aggressive expansion plans, reflecting our confidence in the region’s potential and our commitment to being a leader in the hospitality industry in India. The region’s travel ecosystem is evolving at a fast pace, with a growing emphasis on unique experiences, wellness, and luxury. Hyatt is well-positioned to meet these demands, and we are excited to introduce new brands and experiences that will redefine hospitality in India,” he said.","American hospitality major Hyatt Hotels is planning says its domestic to foreign guest ratio now goes as high as 80 to 20, as opposed to 65 to 35 in pre-Covid times.

NEW DELHI: A musical performance featuring the RSS ""gana geetham"" (prayer song) at a temple in Kottukkal, managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), has ignited row, with the opposition Congress demanding strict action against those involved.The song was performed by a professional music troupe during a gana mela (musical fest) held in the early hours of Sunday as part of temple festivities . According to PTI, the police said there were also allegations that RSS flags had been erected on the temple premises in connection with the event.Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan called the incident “a matter of grave concern,” citing a high court directive that bars political activity on temple grounds.He urged the TDB to act swiftly and firmly, stating, “Temples belong to devotees. Politicising religious spaces reflects a narrow-minded approach.”Kadakkal police confirmed receiving a complaint from a member of the temple’s advisory committee but said no case had yet been registered.The controversy follows a recent incident in the same police jurisdiction where ""revolutionary songs"" praising the CPM were reportedly performed during another temple festival, further fuelling debate over political influence in religious spaces.","A musical performance featuring the RSS ""gana geetham"" (prayer song) at a temple in Kottukkal has ignited row.

MEERUT: UP Power Corporation (UPPC) has dismissed a contractual lineman for allegedly waving the Palestinian flag after offering namaz on Eid in the Gagalheri police station area of UP's Saharanpur district.The action came after Saqib Khan , 35, a resident of Kailashpuri village in Saharanpur, posted a photograph of himself holding the Palestinian flag on social media.Police summoned Khan for questioning on the same day and interrogated him for two hours before releasing him without any charges. However, local right-wing groups warned of public demonstrations if action was not taken. TOI attempted to reach Khan for a response, but he was unavailable.UPPC's Baliakheri sub-divisional officer Shishir Kumar Chahi said, ""Khan was posted at the Kailashpur power substation under the Baliakheri electricity distribution division. As soon as the matter came to our notice, his services were terminated immediately. We examined the conduct of other employees as well, but Khan alone was found involved in this anti-national activity.""Another contractual lineman in Meerut, who requested anonymity, said most contracts outline clear terms - ""employees must follow a code of conduct, avoid any anti-national activity, and stay away from corruption or criminal involvement. If these conditions are breached, employers have the right to terminate the contract without delay"".He added, ""The set of rules remains more or less the same in every contract. However, the terms and conditions may vary depending on the company that holds the tender to manage contractual employees. In case of termination, the lineman can challenge the decision in court.""UPPC executive engineer Sanjeev Kumar wrote to the private company that hired Khan, directing them to terminate his services with immediate effect, based on documents accessed by TOI. In his letter, Kumar said Saqib was found involved in ""anti-national activities"" by waving the Palestinian flag and sharing the image online.Saharanpur (city) SP Vyom Bindal said, ""The matter is under investigation and appropriate action will be taken based on the findings of the probe.

RAMESWARAM: PM Modi took a swipe at Tamil Nadu's governing DMK over the contentious language issue on Sunday, questioning why politicians from the state sign official letters in English. ""Tamil is a language of pride. I am surprised ... no one signs their name in Tamil,"" he said, urging them to do so.Addressing allegations from DMK-led state govt about insufficient central funds, Modi countered that BJP-led Centre had allocated three times more money to Tamil Nadu than the previous UPA administration, in which DMK was a coalition partner. ""Yet, some people have developed a habit of complaining without reason. They keep crying about issues,"" he said.Modi made the remarks while inaugurating the Pamban vertical lift railway bridge and a series of infrastructure projects worth Rs 8,000 crore across Tamil Nadu.Modi stressed his govt's commitment to Tamil Nadu's development, citing a sharp increase in railway budget allocations for the state - from Rs 900 crore before 2014 to over Rs 6,000 crore this year.Modi also flagged off a new train service between Rameswaram and Tambaram in Chennai.The comments on language come amid DMK govt's opposition to the Centre's three-language policy under NE, which it claims is a move to impose Hindi on the state. Tamil Nadu has historically resisted policies perceived as favouring Hindi over regional languages.Modi countered these concerns, saying: ""I urge everyone to at least sign their names in Tamil to honour this glorious heritage."" He reiterated the Centre's commitment to promoting Tamil globally and urged state govt to introduce medical education in the Tamil language. Modi's visit to Tamil Nadu was his first since beginning his third term as PM. CM MK Stalin did not attend, citing prior engagements in the Nilgiris.Highlighting the Centre's investments in Tamil Nadu's infrastructure, Modi said 77 railway stations, including Rameswaram, are undergoing modernisation. He said 4,000km of roads have been constructed in the state with central assistance since 2014, leading to job creation across multiple sectors.The PM also listed welfare initiatives supported by Centre, saying 12 lakh pucca houses have been built under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, more than 1 crore households have gained access to piped drinking water, and over one crore treatments have been provided under Ayushman Bharat Yojana. ""These initiatives have resulted in savings of around Rs 8,000 crore for Tamil Nadu's families,"" he said.On the recurring issue of Tamil fishermen being detained by Sri Lanka, Modi said Centre had secured the release of 3,700 fishermen over the past decade, including more than 600 in the past year alone, some of whom were facing the death sentence.","PM Modi takes a swipe at Tamil Nadu's governing DMK over the contentious language issue.

NEW DELHI: India plans to commission its strategic new naval base for nuclear submarines and other warships in coastal Andhra Pradesh next year, with an eye on China's ever-expanding naval forays into the Indian Ocean Region. India is also progressively upgrading the Karwar base in Karnataka on the western seaboard.The strategic base located near the small coastal village of Rambilli, about 50km south from the Eastern Naval Command headquarters at Visakhapatnam on the eastern seaboard, has underground pens and a network of tunnels to house nuclear submarines.This will enable the submarines to quietly slip into the Bay of Bengal without detection from spy satellites and quickly head towards the critical Malacca Strait and beyond on deterrent patrols.""The first phase of the Rambilli base under Project Varsha is almost complete. After commissioning in 2026, it can be expanded and upgraded in phases, much like what is under way at the Karwar base under Project Seabird,"" a source said.It has taken well over a decade for the construction of the nuclear submarine base to reach this stage after overcoming major technological, environmental and other challenges.The source said, ""The inner harbour is ready. Work on the outer harbour, with the requisite breakwaters and jetties, is in progress."" Concurrently, India this year will also commission its third nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), INS Aridhaman , with a displacement of 7,000-tonne, to add more teeth to the underwater leg of the country's nuclear triad.Slightly bigger than the first two operational SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, INS Aridhaman will be able to carry more K-4 missiles with a strike range of 3,500km.While a fourth submarine is also under construction under the secretive over ₹90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project, there is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones, as reported by TOI earlier. In Oct last year, the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security also approved the construction of two 9,800-tonne nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) for ₹40,000 crore.The eventual plan is for six SSNs, which are armed with non-nuclear missiles and other weapons for conventional warfare. On the West coast, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday inaugurated additional operational, repair and logistic facilities worth over 2,000 crore under Project Seabird at the Karwar naval base, which provides the Navy with both strategic depth and operational flexibility, especially against Pakistan.Already the home base for over a dozen frontline warships, the completion of the ongoing Phase-IIA of Project Seabird will enable Karwar to berth 32 major warships and submarines as well as 23 yard-craft. A dual-use naval air station, a full-fledged naval dockyard, four covered dry berths and logistics for ships and aircraft are also part of this phase of construction.After Phase-IIB, currently in the planning stage, the Karwar base spread over a 25-km expanse will be capable of basing 50 warships and submarines as well as 40 auxiliary craft, which will also go a long way in decongesting the Mumbai harbour.",India plans to commission its strategic new naval base for nuclear submarines and other warships in coastal Andhra Pradesh next year.

For 25 years, the popular eatery on Varanasi-Lucknow highway had been a must-stop for lovers of rich, meaty delicacies.But as Maha Kumbh approached, owner Sanjeev Jaiswal found himself watching potential customers hesitate at the threshold. ""We have been popular for our non-veg food. ""We have always kept the kitchens and utensils separate,"" he said. ""Yet, in the months before Kumbh, I noticed people turning away. It was a tough call, but a necessary one.""A week before the sacred gathering began, a fresh sign with green letters on a white background flickered to life below the original signboard - this one bearing the words: PURE VEG . The move proved to be nothing short of a masterstroke. Through the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims eager for a meal that aligned with their spiritual journey.The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, rejuvenated by grand temple projects, has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself. Two phrases - 'PURE VEG' or 'Shudh Shakahari' - now dominate the signage of eateries in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj.""It's not that people have suddenly abandoned non-vegetarian food,"" said Shankar Shastri, a tourist from Maharashtra. ""But when they come to pay obeisance to Baba Kashi Vishwanath, they choose to go vegetarian. Even the assurance of separate utensils doesn't convince them otherwise.""The shift wasn't merely a passing trend. The winds of change first began stirring in Dec 2021, with rejuvenation of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. They gathered force with consecration of Ram Lalla's idol in Ayodhya in Jan 2024 and completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. The rise of this spiritual triangle reshaped not just the flow of pilgrims but the very nature of food market in the region.""Emergence of Kashi-Ayodhya-Vindhya circuit as a major pilgrimage route between 2022 and 2024 changed everything,"" said Gokul Sharma, president of Banaras Hotels' Association. ""Pilgrims now make up over 80% of the total visitors, and prefer pure vegetarian food.""The impact was felt at every level of food industry. Hotels, even those that traditionally catered to international tourists, noticed a stark shift in demand. ""Among domestic tourists, veg-to-non-veg ratio, which was once evenly split, is now 80:20,"" said Rajiv Rai, general manager of a well-known Varanasi hotel.In Ayodhya, the transformation was more absolute. Eateries that once offered a mix of cuisines transitioned entirely to vegetarian menus ahead of consecration of Ram Lalla's idol. Even global chains adapted - Domino's, for instance, serves only vegetarian food in the town.The shift extended to larger commercial spaces as well. Atul Singh, owner of Ayodhya's Mall of Avadh, recalled how the food court once had non-vegetarian options. ""We served non-veg food before, but we decided to go fully vegetarian,"" he said.Vishal, owner of the newly built Hotel Maan Awadh, initially hired a chef from New Delhi known for his meat dishes. ""But I had to replace him with a pure vegetarian chef later,"" he said.Nowhere was the change more dramatic than in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. ""During Kumbh, almost 80-85% of hotels and restaurants turned vegetarian,"" said Harjinder Singh, president of Prayagraj Hotels and Restaurants Welfare Association. The city, which has around 400 restaurants and 280 hotels - not counting roadside eateries - saw an overwhelming shift towards vegetarianism.As the tides of pilgrims receded, so did the absoluteness of change in some places. In Prayagraj, many eateries that had turned exclusively vegetarian during Kumbh have since reverted. ""There was no demand for non-vegetarian food, so we adapted,"" said Raju Jaiswal, owner of a restaurant in city. ""But now that things are back to normal, we serve both options again.""Still, the broader transformation of the region's food culture remains undeniable. The power of faith is rewriting menus, reshaping businesses, and illuminating cities and roads with the unmistakable glow of three simple letters: VEG.","The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself.

MADURAI/T'PURAM: CPM politburo member Mariam Alexander Baby was appointed Sunday as the party's new general secretary, becoming only the second from Kerala to hold the position after the state's first CM EMS Namboodiripad. Baby, 71, succeeded the late Sitaram Yechury at CPM's 24th congress in Madurai.Former general secretary Prakash Karat , who briefly served as interim coordinator following Yechury's passing in Sept 2024, has been dropped from the politburo along with his wife Brinda Karat, Tripura ex-CM Manik Sarkar, Surjya Kanta Mishra, Subhashini Ali and G Ramakrishnan. But, sources said, the Karats and Manik Sarkar will serve as special invitees to the central committee in an advisory role.The party's central committee and congress approved the politburo's recommendation for Baby's appointment. But, his elevation faced resistance from the party's Bengal and Maharashtra units, which had proposed All India Kisan Sabha national president Ashok Dhawale for the post.Kerala members rallied behind Baby after five of the politburo's 16 members opposed his appointment, sources said.Baby downplayed reports of internal opposition to his appointment, stressing that his nomination had broad support. ""Mohammed Salim (Bengal CPM state secretary) proposed my name and Ashok Dhawale seconded it,"" he said. According to sources, Prakash Karat endorsed Baby for the role.Kollam-born Baby began his political journey through student activism in Kerala and later became national presidents of SFI and DYFI. He served as a Rajya Sabha MP (1986-1998) and as Kerala's minister for education and culture (2006-2011). In 2012, he was elected to CPM's politburo, becoming its first Christian member.Political allies welcomed Baby's appointment, with Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin extending his congratulations.

Amit Shah to pay tribute at Raigad amid Aurangzeb legacy row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-to-pay-tribute-at-raigad-amid-aurangzeb-legacy-row/articleshow/120047637.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the political storm surrounding debates over Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's legacy, Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah is set to visit the historic Raigad Fort on April 12 to pay homage to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on his death anniversary.The timing of the visit is significant, as recent weeks have witnessed heated political exchanges and public discourse over historical narratives, especially regarding figures like Aurangzeb. Shah's tribute at Raigad is being viewed as a strong symbolic gesture, reaffirming the central government's alignment with the legacy of Shivaji Maharaj, often portrayed as a national hero who valiantly resisted Mughal expansion.Raigad Fort, once the capital of the Maratha Empire under Shivaji Maharaj, stands as a powerful reminder of a golden era marked by valor, governance, and visionary leadership. Every stone of this hilltop fortress echoes stories of strategic brilliance and resilience. The fort not only served as the administrative nerve cntre of the Maratha Empire but also as a monument to Shivaji Maharaj's enduring legacy of swarajya (self-rule).Political observers suggest that Shah's visit is also aimed at energising the party's base in Maharashtra, a state with deep-rooted reverence for Shivaji Maharaj. With elections on the horizon, invoking Shivaji's legacy may serve both cultural and political objectives.As the political narrative intensifies, the visit to Raigad could further polarise opinions on historical interpretations - a strategy that has often played out on India's complex political chessboard.The visit is expected to draw significant public attention and participation, with state BJP functionaries and local dignitaries likely to accompany the Union minister during the ceremonial tribute.","Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah is set to visit the historic Raigad Fort on April 12 to pay homage to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

It can only issue detention orders like a civil court, Calcutta high court held in its recent order.""Law does not authorise the forum to issue a warrant of arrest for enforcement of its order under the Code of Criminal Procedure,"" Justice Suvra Ghosh said Wednesday while quashing the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum's arrest warrant issued against a Hooghly automobile company branch manager.Justice Ghosh referred to a judgment of a coordinate bench of Calcutta high court according to which, in an execution application, the commission can issue a warrant for detention of the judgment debtor in civil prison as per the Code of Civil Procedure. According to Section 71 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, Justice Ghosh interpreted that an order granting performance of an agreement is executable under the Code of Civil Procedure and may be executed by putting the debtor in civil prison or by attachment of his sale and property, or both.In 2013, a man purchased a tractor from an automobile showroom in Hooghly. Of the total cost of Rs 7.78 lakh, the buyer paid Rs 10,000 in advance. He then paid Rs 5.30 lakh by taking loan from a finance company. A sum of Rs 2.18 lakh remained due. It was agreed that the vehicle's registration certificate would be handed over once he paid the due amount.The man later paid Rs 1.93 lakh and only Rs 25,716 remained due. But since he failed to pay the monthly instalments, the finance company took possession of the vehicle in 2015, and sold it off to another individual.The buyer lodged a complaint before the consumer forum in 2018, which directed the automobile seller to hand over the registration certificate and release the tractor after receiving the Rs 25,716 due within 30 days. The buyer filed an execution case, and a warrant of arrest was issued against the branch manager on Dec 19, 2019.It was the branch manager's case that he had no idea of the ongoing case as he was not made a party to either of the proceedings and only came to know when the arrest warrant was issued. The legal issue before the Calcutta high court was to decide if the consumer forum had the authority to issue an arrest warrant against him in the execution proceeding.","A consumer forum cannot issue an arrest warrant like a criminal court.

Work generated under NREGS in ’24-25 less than ’23-24 numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/work-generated-under-nregs-in-24-25-less-than-23-24-numbers/articleshow/120044817.cms,"In the financial year 2024-25, the MGNREGA job scheme generated over 288 crore persondays of work, less than 2023-24 but still above pre-pandemic levels. Experts suggest that the reduced budget allocation may have played a role in controlling work demand despite signs of rural distress improvement.

NEW DELHI: The work generated under flagship job scheme MGNREGA in the last financial year was less than 2023-24, but still above the pre-pandemic level that is viewed as the reference point for normal demand for distress labour.In 2024-25, the job scheme recorded just over 288 crore persondays of work, and the figure on March 31 will be revised upwards with the updating of the data by April-end. Still, it will be much below the 312 crore persondays generated in 2023-24.However, the work under the job scheme in the previous two years is much above the 265 crore persondays generated in 2019-20, the year before the Covid pandemic.In 2020-21, a halt to economic activities in the wake of the pandemic and a nationwide lockdown sent the rural populace to MGNREGS work sites in hordes, and the demand for work went through the roof. The work generated that year recorded an all-time high of around 389 crore persondays. The return of migrant workers back to their home states was another reason for high work demand under the scheme.While the demand for work under the job scheme has come down since, it is still to reach the normal levels before the burst of the pandemic. The higher work demand has been widely viewed as a sign of rural distress , as traditional employment centres took time to return to their full capacity.The fall in work generated in 2024-25 as compared to 2023-24 can be seen as further improvement in rural distress, as govt has repeatedly claimed in recent months.But experts working on the scheme argue that depressed budget has played a role in controlling the demand for work. The rural development ministry has kept the budget for MGNREGS at around Rs 86,000-89,000 crore over the last two years. While the scheme is demand-driven and govt is bound to provide funds to meet the expenditure incurred above the initial budgetary allocation, it is argued that lower budget in the initial announcement results in state govts and district officials taking a cue and depressing the demand through delays - a reason why non-governmental experts advocate higher allocations in the budget without waiting for ""revised estimates"".In 2025-26, the allocation of Rs 86,000 would be much lesser as the ministry has a deficit of around Rs 29,000 crore from 2024-25, a small part of which could be the liability of states.","The work generated under flagship job scheme MGNREGA in the last financial year was less than 2023-24, but still above pre-pandemic levels.

While the transaction volume is estimated to be in crores, the amount has not been disclosed yet.Police have arrested 21 people, including 19 from Srinagar, in connection with the scam, Hussain said Sunday.A mule account is a third-party bank account used to move money obtained through illegal means. Cybercriminals recruit people — often through social media platforms like Facebook and Telegram — to open these accounts, which remain active for just a day or two. During this time, illicit funds are deposited before the accounts are quickly closed, Hussain said.“These mule accounts have become a primary channel for laundering money obtained through cyber fraud,” the SSP said. “They are opened on a commission basis and used to obscure financial trails.”Many of the accounts belong to people, shell companies, or enterprises but are controlled remotely by fraudsters operating outside J&K or even overseas, according to police. Once the accounts are active, funds are rapidly transferred to other accounts or converted into cryptocurrency to complicate tracking.Four FIRs have been filed to investigate the use of mule accounts and most cases are emerging from Srinagar and Jammu, Hussain said.“We are going to question everyone who opened such accounts. They will be asked who directed them to open these accounts,” he said, ruling out the possibility that people were unaware their names were being used. “These accounts require signatures and official documents of the account holders.”The investigation into mule accounts has uncovered cases where Indians were lured abroad under false job offers.Eleven Kashmiris, including a woman, were among more than 600 Indians rescued from scam call centres in Myanmar’s Myawaddy region in March. They were airlifted from Mae Sot airport in northwest Thailand, bordering Myanmar.“These young people applied for jobs through advertisements on Facebook and Telegram. They submitted resumes, went through interviews, and were sent tickets to fly to the Myanmar,” Hussain said. “However, some of these companies were run by cybercriminals who trapped and exploited them to run scams.”The cybercrime syndicates lure foreign workers, particularly targeting those with IT skills, with fake job offers and lucrative salaries. Once they arrive in Myanmar, their passports are confiscated and they are held captive in heavily guarded compounds, where they’re coerced into executing online scams. Many face physical abuse and psychological intimidation.","A mule account is a third-party bank account used to move money obtained through illegal means.

Kolkata Police react

NEW DELHI: The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday alleged Hindu devotees carrying saffron flags were ""savagely attacked"" in Kolkata’s Park Circus area while returning from a Ram Navami procession . The Kolkata Police, however, denied that any such procession took place.“As the Ram Navami procession returned, Hindu devotees were savagely attacked in Kolkata’s Park Circus Seven Point area. Stones rained down on vehicles just for carrying saffron flags. Windshields shattered. Chaos unleashed,” West Bengal BJP president and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said in a post on X. He called it “targeted violence” and accused the police of remaining “silent” and “spineless” in the face of the attack.Majumdar directly blamed chief minister Mamata Banerjee for the incident, alleging the police were “paralyzed” by her “politics of appeasement.” He further added that the “system is shaken” by the display of “united Bengali Hindus” during Ram Navami, and warned that next year’s procession would be “bigger.”Responding to the allegations, Kolkata Police issued a statement saying, “No permission was taken for any procession at Park Circus, and no such procession was taken out.”The police acknowledged receiving information about damage to a vehicle and said they intervened promptly to restore order. “A case is being registered to investigate the matter. The public is advised not to heed any rumours,” the statement added.","The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday alleged Hindu devotees carrying saffron flags were ""savagely attacked"" The Kolkata Police, however, denied that any such procession took place. “No permission was taken for any procession at Park Circus, and no such procession was taken out,” police said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120043164,imgsize-645612,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-1.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi while inaugurating the new Pamban rail sea-bridge in Tamil Nadu ’s Rameswaram on Sunday spoke about the Gujarat link to the old bridge and its replacement.“A hundred years ago, the old Pamban bridge was built by a man born in Gujarat. Today, after 100 years, the new Pamban bridge has been inaugurated by someone born in Gujarat,” he said, which received huge applause from public.Sources said the construction of the old Pamban bridge, inaugurated in 1914, involved Gujarat-based contractor Karoji Kutz. The project on the Palk Strait utilised 2,000 tonnes of steel and involved 200 workers. During the construction of the old bridge, now abandoned, materials were lost due to a severe cyclone and high waves. Even cholera impacted the labour force.The decision to build the bridge was taken by the British during a meeting at Dhanushkodi in TN in Nov 1908. The bridge was completed in Dec 1913 and was inaugurated on Feb 25, 1914, by Lord John Sinclair, the first Baron Pentland, who was the governor of Madras from 1912 to 1919.The bridge had provision to allow ships to pass beneath it. The Pamban rail bridge was the sole link between Mandapam and Rameswaram for decades until a parallel road bridge was built in 1988.","The decision to build the bridge was taken by the British during a meeting at Dhanushkodi in TN in Nov 1908.

In a grand consistory held in the Vatican Saturday, 51-year-old Keralite priest George Jacob Koovakad was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Francis . Koovakad will be remembered in history as the first priest to be directly elevated as a cardinal from India. The other cardinals from India were bishops/archbishops before being elevated to this exalted post in the Church. The ceremony, held at St Peter's Basilica and attended by clergy and dignitaries from around the world, witnessed the induction of 21 new cardinals.Hailing from the Archdiocese of Changanassery , Koovakad's appointment brings the total number of Indian cardinals to six, further strengthening the country's representation in the Vatican.Koovakad, who has been organising the Pope's international travels since 2020, shares a good relationship with him, and on Sept 2 last year, Pope Francis video-called his grandmother, Sosamma Antony, 95, after her health deteriorated following Covid. Koovakad, who held the title of monsignor, was recently declared the titular archbishop of Nisibis in Turkey.Earlier, Koovakad said: ""...This is God's will which I never expected. When I was sent here (in 2006), I was told by my respected seniors, that if it's to learn the Bible, that can be done in Kerala itself, but since you are being sent to the Vatican it's being done to learn things deeply.""Cardinal George Alencherry, major archbishop emeritus of the Syro-Malabar Church , expressed his delight at the elevation of another Indian to the cardinalate.""It is a matter of immense pride for India that Archbishop George Koovakad will be created as a Cardinal by Pope Francis,"" PM Modi posted on X.Born on August 11, 1974, Koovakad was ordained as a priest on July 24, 2004.

PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-why-you-should-apply-for-new-pan-card-with-qr-code-top-5-benefits-explained/articleshow/115888220.cms,"Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards those without QR codes should apply for PAN 2.0. (AI image)

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Also Read | PAN 2.0 for free! How to get PAN Card with QR code with address update online; step-by-step guide Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""","Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

Fadnavis accused the elected members of the opposition of insulting the voters who had chosen them by refusing to take their oaths as MLAs.""The voters have voted for these members of the opposition to represent them in the assembly. By refusing to take oath as the members of legislative assembly, these elected representatives have insulted the voters across the state who have voted for them,"" Fadnavis told reporters.The boycott was led by the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance , which includes prominent opposition parties like Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP led by Sharad Pawar.The leaders of these parties, including Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray , voiced their concerns regarding the fairness of the recent elections.Thackeray accused the Election Commission of allowing ""misuse of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs)"" during the state assembly elections.Speaking to the media, Thackeray said, ""We have decided that our winning MLAs will not take the oath today to protest the misuse of EVMs. If this was truly the mandate of the people, there would have been celebrations across the state, but no such celebrations have taken place.""He continued, saying, ""Democracy is being murdered by the use of EVMs. This election result is not the will of the public; it is the result of the EVM and the Election Commission.""In response to the opposition's claims, Maharashtra deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar dismissed the allegations as baseless. ""There is no point in making such allegations here. If the opposition has concerns, they should approach the Election Commission.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday detailed how India has been walking the talk by engaging directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, transparently carrying messages between the two sides.He outlined India’s proactive diplomatic efforts in addressing global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war and tensions in the Gulf and Mediterranean regions and expressed hope for identifying ""common threads"" that could pave the way for meaningful negotiations when the time is right.Speaking at the Doha Forum, Jaishankar said, ""(We are trying to) find common threads which can be picked up at some point of time when the circumstances are right for it to be developed.""When asked about India's role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Jaishankar said, ""The general sort of needle is moving more towards the reality of a negotiation than the continuation of the war,"" he said.Jaishankar stressed that the war has had widespread repercussions on developing nations, including rising fuel costs, food, inflation, and fertilizers.He said that India is articulating the sentiments and interests of the Global South — 125 countries affected by this war. ""And, in the last few weeks and months, I've even seen this sentiment expressed by major European leaders, who are actually telling us, please keep engaging Russia and engaging Ukraine. So we do think that things are moving somewhere in that direction,” he added.He underscored the need for more innovative and participatory diplomacy to address the world’s pressing challenges.Reflecting on the broader conflict landscape, he cited ongoing tensions in the Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Mediterranean, mentioning Israel-Iran hostilities and the disruption of shipping routes impacting Asia.Jaishankar said that diplomats must recognize the messy realities of the world and step forward. He also said the era of the 60s and the 70s when the UN Security Council or a few Western powers managed conflicts is ""behind us,"" adding that all countries need to step forward.Jaishankar spoke on other key issues, including speculation around the Brics currency and recent remarks by US President-elect Donald Trump threatening tariffs on Brics countries. “India has never advocated de-dollarization, and there is no proposal for a Brics currency at the moment. Countries within Brics hold varied positions on this matter,” he said.On questions about the emergence of an anti-Western axis involving Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, Jaishankar said, “Countries align and diverge based on interests. The global reality is far more complex than sweeping generalizations,”Jaishankar’s remarks came as part of the 22nd edition of the Doha Forum, a global platform that fosters dialogue on critical challenges and drives innovative, action-oriented solutions.Themed “The Innovation Imperative,” the forum emphasises diplomacy, dialogue, and diversity as tools to address interconnected global challenges.","S Jaishankar outlined India’s proactive diplomatic efforts in addressing global conflicts.

Deepak Kumar , 24, arrived in Moga, Punjab, on the day of his wedding only to find the venue he had been promised didn’t exist, and his bride, Manpreet Kaur , was nowhere to be found.According to a PTI report, Kumar, who had worked as a laborer in Dubai, had been communicating with Kaur on Instagram for three years. Although they had never met in person, the two had grown close through the social media platform, sharing countless conversations and pictures. Their families, too, had agreed on the wedding arrangements over the phone, and everything seemed set for the big day.On the morning of the wedding, Deepak, along with his family and 150 guests, traveled from their village, Mandiali in Jalandhar, to the wedding location in Moga. The bride's family had given clear instructions about the venue, ""Rose Garden Palace.""But upon arriving in Moga, the groom couldn’t find the venue and was told that someone would escort them to the venue. Hours passed with no one showing up.By 5 pm, still no one had arrived, and after questioning locals, they were left shocked to learn that there was no such place as ""Rose Garden Palace"" in Moga.Deepak and his family attempted to contact Kaur, but her phone was switched off, and they were left stranded in the middle of the town. Deepak, who had spent months planning this day, had already made significant investments: taxis for the guests, catering arrangements, and even a videographer for the ceremony.In his complaint to the police, Deepak recounted how he had transferred Rs 50,000 to Kaur earlier in the course of their arrangements. His father, Prem Chand, added that everything, including the wedding venue and guest lists, had been arranged through phone calls. Kaur’s family, who lived in Moga, had been the ones to suggest the venue and had assured them of the wedding's smooth execution.After numerous attempts to reach Kaur and her family, Deepak and his family filed a police complaint.Assistant Sub-Inspector Harjinder Singh, investigating the case, confirmed the complaint had been lodged and that the police were looking into the matter.","Deepak Kumar, 24, arrived in Moga, Punjab, on the day of his wedding only to find the venue he had been promised didn’t exist.

But I believe that I can manage this even from here,"" Mamata Banerjee said in an interview.Mamata's suggestion to rejig the opposition apparently may not go well with the Congress, which is currently the bloc's de facto leader and the largest party among its allies with 99 MPs in Lok Sabha.TMC MP Kirti Azad claimed Mamata Banerjee was better to lead the INDIA bloc she took on the BJP heads on in the state polls. Azad said the West Bengal CM has the ""perfect record against BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi"".""Mamata Banerjee has a perfect record. Whenever Narendra Modi has faced defeat, it has always been in West Bengal. Even in the recent by-elections, where the BJP had one seat and we had five, Mamata Didi hit a six and threw Narendra Modi out of the West Bengal boundary. Every time he comes to Bengal intending to insult, his vote count increases, and she, a very senior leader, continues to clearly express her views,"" Azad said.Another TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee said that the whole alliance failed to meet expectations in the absence of a leader.""Today, if we genuinely want to fight against the BJP and Narendra Modi, the INDIA alliance must be stronger. To achieve that, one decisive leader is necessary. The key question now is: who will that leader be?"" Banerjee said, hinting at Mamata Banerjee as a potential contender to challenge the BJP and PM Modi.Conversely, the Congress lost the Haryana polls, which it considered a low-hanging fruit. Haryana election results swung wildly from a perceived Congress sweep to a winning show by BJP, which beat strong anti-incumbency.BJP secured 48 seats, eight more than its 2019 result, achieving a comfortable majority in the 90-member assembly. The party also surpassed its 2014 score. The Congress claimed 37 seats, increasing its vote share by 11 percentage, but losing the state.While the electoral battle was primarily a Mahayuti versus Maha Vikas Aghadi contest, it was the head-to-head fights between BJP and Congress in 75 constituencies that shaped the larger outcome. BJP steamrolled Congress in 65 seats of these, leaving with a mere 10.Reacting to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee's statement, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said that they also want her to be a major partner of the INDIA bloc, adding that they will soon go to talk to Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata.""We know this opinion of Mamata ji. We also want her to be a major partner of the INDIA alliance. Whether it is Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal or Shiv Sena, we are all together. We will soon go to talk to Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata,"" Sanjay Raut said addressing a press conference.NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar also backed Mamata for leading the alliance, saying ""she has that capability"".""Yes certainly (she is capable of leading the alliance), she is a prominent leader of this nation... she has that capability.. the elected leaders she sent in the parliament are responsible, dutiful and well aware people... therefore she has the right to say so,"" Sharad Pawar said.Bharamati MP Supriya Sule, who is also Sharad Pawar's daughter, said that her party would be happy if Mamata Banerjee took more responsibility.""Mamata Banerjee is absolutely an integral part of the INDIA alliance. In a vibrant democracy, the opposition has a big role and responsibility, so if she wants to take more responsibility, we will be very happy,"" Supriya Sule told news agency ANI.The Bengal CM's remark suggests that the Congress party , which was beaming with confidence after its enhanced Lok Sabha polls performance, is in the crosshairs of its allies after the humiliating drubbing in Maharashtra and Haryana polls.However, the Congress party has outrightly dismissed the possibility of change in INDIA bloc leadership as a ""good joke"".""That's a good joke,"" Manikam Tagore quipped when asked about Mamata's remarks.The party also questioned the TMC supremo's ability to function as a national leader, given her role as the head of a regional party.""When the TMC won in West Bengal, they tried to expand their network across the country... They struggled a lot. To what extent they succeeded is clear from the fact that someone who couldn't expand her party beyond Bengal—how can she fight on a national level? How can she lead?"" said Congress leader Udit Raj.Amid rumours of a rift in the INDIA bloc after the TMC kept away from the protest on the Adani issue held in Parliament complex by the Congress and other opposition parties, TMC leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O'Brien said: ""Opposition parties are united in their strategy to corner the BJP in Parliament, but they have different tactics.""The TMC has maintained since the beginning of the session that they want Parliament to function and have kept away from the Congress' demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into allegations of bribery against industrialist Gautam Adani. Apart from TMC, Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (SP) also refrained from joining protests over the Adani issue in Lok Sabha.Another TMC leader, who did not want to be named, told the news agency PTI that the party has been supporting other opposition parties on different issues, like the Samajwadi Party on the Sambhal issue, and the Aam Aadmi Party on the law and order situation in Delhi.In a more intense move, the Samajwadi Party declared on Saturday to quit the opposition MVA in Maharahtra over Shiv Sena (UBT)'s stand on the Babri mosque demolition""An advertisement was given by Shiv Sena (UBT) in a newspaper congratulating those who demolished Babri masjid. His (Uddhav Thackeray) aide has also posted on X hailing the demolition of the mosque,"" , Maharashtra SP chief Abu Azmi said told news agency PTI.""We are quitting the MVA. I am speaking to (Samajwadi Party president) Akhilesh Singh Yadav,"" he added.",Mamata Banerjee says she is ready to lead the opposition bloc from Bengal if asked to do so.

Police have described the accused as ""remorseless"" and possibly a ""psychopath,"" as per reports from news agency PTI.The incident occurred on Friday afternoon at Dhamora Government High School. According to investigators, the student followed Saxena, 55, into the washroom and shot him in the head with a locally-made pistol. The teenager then calmly walked into the principal's office, took his scooter keys, and fled the scene along with a classmate. He was apprehended hours later near the Uttar Pradesh border, still armed with the weapon.Police revealed that the alleged shooter had a history of disciplinary issues and had frequently been admonished by Saxena for his behaviour. ""The accused claims he killed the principal because he often scolded him and told him not to indulge in 'goondaism' at school,"" an investigator said to PTI. Despite the gravity of the act, the boy has shown no remorse. ""He appears to have a psychopathic tendency,"" the official added.Saxena, who had been the principal of the school for five years, was described by his colleagues as a kind and dedicated educator who often went beyond the call of duty for his students. Teachers were left in shock as there were no known disputes that could have led to such an extreme act.Superintendent of Police Agam Jain stated that the boy had skipped school on Friday and was spotted by Saxena near the gate, leading to yet another warning. Shortly thereafter, the student allegedly committed the crime. The classmate who fled with him on the scooter has been detained for questioning, with authorities seeking to determine his role in the incident.The firearm used in the killing has been traced back to a man from the accused's village, who had since moved to Raipur and died two months ago. Police are verifying the details and investigating how the minor obtained the weapon.","A 17-year-old Class 12 student allegedly shot his school principal, Surendra Kumar Saxena, at point-blank range.

Fluorescent strips on UP stray cattle to curb crashes at night,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fluorescent-strips-on-up-stray-cattle-to-curb-crashes-at-night/articleshow/116087334.cms,"The scheme launched last month has helped save lives, officials said, though their claims are yet to be backed by data

PILIBHIT: The night is its own predator on UP's highways as it snakes through hiding unseen dangers: speeding trucks, sudden turns, and then, out of nowhere, the dark silhouette of a stray bull, standing still as if daring fate itself. These highways, essential veins of transit, have become ready stages for nocturnal collisions, where cattle and humans lose their lives to a moment's invisibility.Last month, UP launched a deceptively simple solution. It taped fluorescent reflective strips around necks and horns of stray cattle. These strips, glowing under a vehicle's headlights, are meant to save lives in the dark. And they have, said officials, though the claims are yet to be backed by data.In Pilibhit, where the initiative began, the task of turning bovines into beacons has proven both bold and fraught, with challenges as daunting as the creatures it seeks to protect.On three major highways - Bareilly-Haridwar NH-74, Pilibhit-Basti NH-730, and Bhind-Lipulekh NH-731 - workers tagged 450 stray bulls with reflective tapes. The initiative, costing Rs 400 per cow or bull, is aimed at making animals visible, particularly those with black coats that blend into the night. ""It's an ambitious project,"" said assistant regional transport officer Virendra Singh, who is spearheading the effort. Villagers played a crucial role, not only supporting the initiative but funding much of its cost.Yet, the effort was anything but smooth. Field teams lacked protective equipment or tranquilisation tools, exposing them to life-threatening attacks from the very animals they were trying to save. ""Our personnel succeeded only because of the active support of local villagers,"" Singh admitted. ""But without proper safety measures, we cannot extend the initiative further.""Pilibhit's reflective tape initiative had an earlier inspiration, though. In 2016, NGO Neki Ki Deevar launched a similar effort, tagging 350-odd stray bulls and cows with reflective tapes in Puranpur before extending it to Sitapur and Kheri. However, escalating dangers & logistical shortfalls forced the project to soon halt.","Pilibhit, Uttar Pradesh, launched scheme last month to tag stray bulls with reflective tapes.

Whenever INDIA bloc meeting takes place, our senior leaders will together take a decision,"" Chaturvedi said.However, Congress has questioned the TMC supremo's ability to function as a national leader, given her role as the head of a regional party. ""When the TMC won in West Bengal, they tried to expand their network across the country... They struggled a lot. To what extent they succeeded is clear from the fact that someone who couldn't expand her party beyond Bengal—how can she fight on a national level? How can she lead?"" Congress leader Udit Raj said on SaturdayMeanwhile, the BJP latched on to the internal discord within the alliance to single out the Congress and Rahul Gandhi 's leadership. The BJP hit out at the bloc, describing it as nothing more than a group of parties united solely in opposition to PM Modi, with no other common agenda.“This is a power struggle between people who do not match with each other. The alliance and Congress have completely succumbed under the weight of Rahul Gandhi. Congress and Rahul Gandhi are nothing more than a liability. The sole purpose of the INDI block is to ensure political placement and protect a corrupt clan,” said BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari on Saturday.The responses come after Mamata Banerjee on Friday said she was ready to lead the opposition if asked. “I formed the INDIA bloc; now it is up to those leading the front to manage it. If they can’t run the show, what can I do?” Banerjee said during a television interview. ""I am not leading that front,"" she added. When asked if she would accept leading the opposition front against the BJP-led NDA government, she responded, “If given the opportunity, I would ensure its smooth functioning.”Over the past week, TMC MPs like Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad have urged Congress and other INDIA bloc allies to set aside their egos and recognise Mamata Banerjee as the leader of the opposition alliance . They touted her consistent record of defeating BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in West Bengal.Despite being members of the INDIA bloc, the relationship between the TMC and Congress has often seen rough patches. From the TMC contesting Lok Sabha elections independently to disagreeing on seat sharing, the differences between the two parties have come up often, and have intensified after Congress's losses in Haryana and Maharashtra.",West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed her willingness to take up responsibility as the leader of the INDIA bloc. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said that they also want her to be a major partner of the alliance.

HYDERABAD: At just 22 years old, Mohammad Khaleel Ghori has lived a life marked by incredible transitions, heartbreak, and rediscovery in a world often divided by religion and identity. Over the past decade, he has lived through three distinct identities - Khaleel, Altaf, and Abhinav Singh - each shaped by different circumstances.Born and raised in Hyderabad, he vanished from his home at the age of 12, sparking a journey that would see him adopt new identities, religions, and families over the next decade.Khaleel's disappearance in 2014 began innocuously enough. ""It was a day before the Samagra Kutumba Survey. We sent Khaleel with his cousin to photocopy our documents,"" recalled his mother Sara. ""He sent the papers back, saying he'd return later. Hours turned into days, and days into years, but he never came back.""Sara spent the next decade searching for her son. ""I'm happy he is finally back,"" she said.Khaleel remembers little from his early years in Hyderabad. ""Before boarding a train to Delhi, I vaguely remember living with a man who told me my name was Altaf and that I had no family. That stayed with me, and I lived by it for the last 10 years,"" he said Saturday. He eventually landed in a shelter home in Ghaziabad, assuming the name Altaf.Three years ago, he was adopted by a Hindu family from Kanpur, who named him Abhinav Singh. ""Outside school, I didn't have many friends (in my adopted home). I spent my time studying or helping my mother with chores. I'm my sister's stressbuster. Whenever she was in a bad mood or stressed about her preparations to become a govt teacher, I entertained her with my playful antics,"" Khaleel said.""I will miss my (adopted) sister the most,"" he said. Khaleel's return to his biological family was triggered when his adoptive parents tried to get him an Aadhaar card . His original Aadhaar details surfaced when his biometrics were entered, leading Hyderabad police to track him down.On December 1, Khaleel met his biological mother and brother for the first time in a decade. ""I was taken to meet two people I had never met before. I was told they were my biological mother and brother. I couldn't recognise them, but they had all the proof - childhood photos, school records, even my Aadhaar card,"" he said.Khaleel now faces complex challenges, including navigating conflicting identity documents. His educational records list him as Abhinav Singh, while his original documents identify him as Khaleel, creating hurdles in continuing his education.“We don’t know what to do now. His records show him as Abhinav, with his adoptive family ’s details — father’s name, mother’s name, and address. He scored well in class 10 and 11 — 83% and 70% — but we might have to re-enrol him in class 10,” said Aqeel, his brother. To complicate matters further, Kanpur records list him as a 16-year-old, while his actual age is 22.Neuropsychiatrist Charan Teja Koganti from KIMS Hospital in Hyderabad suggested that Khaleel might be experiencing dissociative amnesia . “When someone goes through trauma or neglect, the brain blocks out all important people or events. They even forget their identity. They form a new identity, either by themselves or given by someone else.”","Mohammad Khaleel Ghori has lived a life marked by incredible transitions, heartbreak, and rediscovery.

NEW DELHI: Amid multiple suits being filed across country by Hindus seeking claim over religious places of Muslims alleging that they were earlier temples but converted to mosques during Mughal era and the lower court entertaining such pleas allegedly in violation of Places of Worship Act , SC will hear pleas challenging validity of the law which barred any litigation to change the character of a religious place from what it was at the time of Independence.A three-judge bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan will hear a batch of petitions seeking quashing of the law on Dec 12.A five-judge bench, while pronouncing the Ayodhya verdict , had approved the law and held that Places of Worship Act 'imposes a non-derogable obligation towards enforcing our commitment to secularism"" and it is a legislative instrument designed to protect secular features of Indian polity, which is one of the basic features of the Constitution. The verdict, reportedly penned by Justice D Y Chandrachud, said in no uncertain terms that historical wrongs cannot be remedied by people taking the law in their own hands and Parliament has mandated in no uncertain terms that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress present and future.""This court cannot entertain claims that stem from actions of Mughal rulers against Hindu places of worship in a court of law today. For any person who seeks solace or recourse against actions of any number of ancient rulers, the law is not the answer. Our history is replete with actions that have been judged to be morally incorrect and even today are liable to trigger vociferous ideological debate. However, adoption of the Constitution marks a watershed moment where we, the people of India, departed from determination of rights and liabilities on the basis of our ideology, religion, colour of skin, or the century when our ancestors arrived at these lands, and submitted to the rule of law,"" the verdict said.Months after the Ayodhya verdict, petitions were filed in SC challenging validity of the law on grounds of being ""arbitrary and unreasonable and infringing the fundamental right to practice religion"". The petitioners included BJP's Ashwini Upadhyay, Subramanian Swamy and other Hindu organisations seeking to open litigation routes for ownership claims over disputed sites like those at Kashi and Mathura.During hearing on disputes involving Gyanvapi mosque, a bench headed by Justice Chandrachud observed that ascertaining the religious character of a place of worship was not barred under Places of Worship Act which emboldened others to seek court-mandated surveys like, most recently in Sambhal and Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti's shrine in Ajmer.",Supreme Court to hear pleas challenging validity of Places of Worship Act.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad HC has directed the respondent Hindu side to file its reply within three weeks in response to a petition filed by management committee of Jaunpur's Atala mosque, challenging a local court order.The court had directed registration of a suit which claimed the mosque was originally an ancient Hindu temple ( Atala Devi temple ). Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal in his order directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder affidavit within a week after the plaintiffs in the suit, Swaraj Vahini Association (SVA) and Santosh Kumar Mishra, file their reply.SVA and Mishra filed the suit before Jaunpur court seeking a declaration that the disputed property was Atala Devi temple and followers of Sanatan religion had the right to worship there. They also demanded handing over of the disputed property to the Hindu side and a mandatory injunction to restrain non-Hindus from entering the property.Further, the plaintiffs had also sought permission to sue under Order 1 Rule 8 CPC in a representative capacity. This prayer was allowed in May by the impugned order, and the same was upheld by the district judge in an order in Aug. Both the orders were challenged in the petition before HC.The mosque management committee pleaded before HC that the plea was defective, as the plaintiff, a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, was not a juristic person and thus was not competent to file the suit in a representative capacity.","Allahabad HC has directed the respondent Hindu side to file its reply within three weeks in response to a petition.

Maoists kill Bijapur woman in front of kin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maoists-kill-bijapur-woman-in-front-of-kin/articleshow/116088388.cms,"Representative image

RAIPUR: Maoists have murdered a mother of three in Bijapur, accusing her of working as a police informer. She was a relative of the village sarpanch and was threatened by Maoists twice in the past, say police.The victim, 45-year-old anganwadi worker Laxmi Padam , was strangled in front of her family Friday night barely 1km from a CRPF camp. Laxmi is the 63rd civilian to be murdered by Maoists in Bastar division this year. It's also the first time in over six years in Bastar that a woman was killed on this pretext. Laxmi was with her family in Timapur village in Basaguda region when 10 Maoists, in PLGA uniform, barged in, dragged her out and thrashed her. Her sons and mother tried to save her, but they were brutally thrashed and forced to watch Laxmi being choked to death. The Maoists dumped her body on the porch and walked back into the jungle.Family members and villagers informed police and a team arrived to take the body for autopsy. Police found a handwritten Maoist leaflet where ‘Madded area committee’ said they killed Laxmi because of her “proximity with police and because she acted as police informer”. A search operation has been launched in the area to trace the assailants.","Laxmi Padam is the 63rd civilian to be murdered by Maoists in Bastar division this year.

US counters BJP's allegations that it's working against India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-counters-bjps-allegations-that-its-working-against-india/articleshow/116088247.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The US responded to BJP's claims that the State Department and ""deep state"" were working to destabilise India by targeting PM Narendra Modi and industrialist Gautam Adani , saying it's ""disappointing that the ruling party in India would make these kinds of accusations"".BJP had alleged that the US deep state worked with investigative journalism platform OCCRP (Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project) and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi to target India's interests. The allegations followed a report by a French newspaper that claimed to expose ""hidden links"" between OCCRP and the US government and the media organisation's funding by billionaire philanthropist George Soros. Congress leaders have protested the allegations in Parliament.OCCRP has also dismissed the accusations. ""A free and independent press is an essential component of any democracy, enabling informed and constructive debate and holding those in power accountable,"" a US embassy spokesperson said here Saturday.US govt works with independent organisations on programming that supports ""professional development and capacity-building training for journalists"" but this does not influence their editorial policy or direction, the spokesperson said, adding that US has long been a champion of media freedom around the world.B JP referred to a French media report and said it revealed that OCCRP is funded by the US State Department’s USAID, along with other “deep state figures” like George Soros and the Rockefeller Foundation. OCCRP refuted the report calling it “simply wrong”.In its response, it said, “OCCRP has no limits on its journalism and no donor influences our reporting. The story, co-written by a disgruntled former member of our network, was unable to cite a single instance of inaccuracy or influence in our work and relied instead on insinuation and implication.”","BJP had alleged that the US deep state worked with investigative journalism platform OCCRP (Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project) and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi to target India's interests.

NEW DELHI: A day after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed her willingness to lead the INDIA Alliance if asked to do so, the Congress' silence was conspicuous as its top leadership chose to steer clear of making any official statement on her remarks. However, party sources said that the Congress leadership sees no reason to respond to what they see as ""mere posturing"" by Banerjee to project herself as a national leader amid challenges faced by her within her own party the All India Trinamool Congress on her home turf.Her remarks on the INDIA Alliance, are seen as her way of sending out a message to her own party and impressing upon them that she wields influence beyond Bengal. The political grapevine is abuzz that there are differences brewing between the West Bengal CM and her nephew and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee which have the potential to escalate going forward, sources said.On how they perceive the impact of Banerjee's remarks on the leadership of the Congress within the INDIA Alliance, sources said that at this stage the issue of leadership is not a concern as the role of the alliance and its leadership will be most critical only ahead of the next Lok Sabha when they will need to step up the fight against the ruling BJP led NDA. ""In the interim the parties within the alliance will be moving forward with their politics and discussions on seat sharing in various assembly polls and there are bound to be some disagreements too,"" sources said when asked about the Congress party 's equation with ally Samajwadi Party which too abstained from joining the Adani protest in Parliament.As far as the future course of action goes, sources said that the Alliance members will be coming together strongly on issues for now like the protests in Parliament and EVMs among other things.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed her willingness to lead the INDIA Alliance if asked to do so.

NEW DELHI: Political confrontation on BJP's allegation about Congress's links with US-based currency manipulator and hedge fund operator George Soros looks unlikely to abate soon with the party in power rejecting the demand for an apology.""I stand by what I said because I spoke on the basis of facts they have not been able to dispute. In fact, I could not get to ask all the 10 questions I had planned to and will exercise my right to defend myself under Rule 357 to produce my entire chargesheet, should they insist on apology,"" said Nishikant Dubey, BJP member who levelled the charge in Lok Sabha on Thursday and doubled it down on Friday to rile the opposition party further with his ""Congress ka haath, Soros ke Saath"" jibe.Citing the claims made by French media outlet Mediapart, BJP, in both Houses, said on Thursday that Soros, through his proxies like the Open Society Foundation , Human Rights Watch, and Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), has consistently timed his ""false propaganda"" to coincide with Parliament sessions in India, which were then used by Congress leaders, with Rahul Gandhi taking the lead.Importantly, despite US embassy's protests against the saffron party's attempt to establish a link between the investigative journalism project and the State Department, BJP stuck to its charge that OCCRP was a project of the US department. ""It is a matter of fact. It is for them to figure out whether those behind the false propaganda against India exceeded their brief as part of a deep state operation,"" said Dubey as he made light of US embassy's complaint against BJP's statement.BJP's charge is based on Mediapart's claims that OCCRP derived a substantial part of its funding from the US and other western countries like the UK, France, Switzerland and Sweden. US's share alone stood at 53%, though OCCRP's Drew Sullian puts it at 46%. More importantly, it was created by US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. In fact, it owes its creation to David Hodkinson, formerly of US army who was deployed in 25 countries. A reservist now, he works for the US Director of National Intelligence as a colonel (retd).Mediapart, relying on the statements of Sullivan, summed up OCCRP's position vis-a-vis the US govt as of ""structural dependency"", since it is constrained from doing stories on US matters because of ""conflict of interest"" and because it is governed by the US Foreign Services Act that its activities is ""aligned with and advance US foreign policy of economic sanctions"". In an 2023 email to the OCCRP staff, Sullvan explained that the group will not do stories on the US because all of its budget was paid for by Washington and the Open Society Foundation of Soros.BJP's annoyance with Soros, who has made no secret of his dislike for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has included him in the list of targets, which also include US President-elect Donald Trump, is not new. It has also accused him of working in league with Congress.But it is Mediapart's disclosure about OCCRP, whose claims regarding Pegasus spyware, efficacy of anti-Covid vaccines developed in India, and currency manipulation by Adani Group, were seized upon by Congress and others to disrupt proceedings of Parliament, being backed by a US govt agency and Soros, appears to have encouraged the saffron strategists to turn their grievance into a full-scale campaign.Beginning Thursday, there has been a flood of posts on X, where party officials and supporters shared snippets of information, claiming that Congress, through its leaders like Rahul Gandhi, was in cahoots with Soros to push an agenda to undermine and defame the Modi government.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey rile the opposition party further with his ""Congress ka haath, Soros ke Saath"" jibe.

Kerala regulator warns herbal drug maker for misleading ad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-regulator-warns-herbal-drug-maker-for-misleading-ad/articleshow/119236705.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: The Ayush drug licensing authority in Kerala has warned a drug company for not complying with Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act meant to prevent misleading advertisements. Kerala drug controller (Ayurveda) issued a warning to Pankajakasthuri Herbals India Pvt Ltd for publishing an ad without submitting it to the licensing authority for approval as stipulated by the rule.In January 2025, Pankajakasthuri advertised tablets and an oil for leg pain and reduced mobility featuring a former woman panchayat member, saying that it worked for her. “The wordings of the ad are misleading. Pain in the legs could be due to any reason or conditions such as varicose vein, deep vein thrombosis, inflammations or any infection. Patients with leg pain could be misled that the advertised drug can be used for any purpose,” said Dr Babu KV, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist who complained to the drug controller and asked if the ad had been submitted for approval before being issued.In response to Dr Babu’s RTI query, the drug controller’s office confirmed that the company had not submitted the ad for approval and added that a warning against engaging in such illegal activities in future was issued to the company. Dr Babu said that a mere warning was not a sufficient deterrent and sought exemplary punishment citing a violation despite the restoration of Rule 170 being widely reported.Though Rule 170 was inserted into the Drugs and Cosmetics Act in December 2018, it was stayed by the Mumbai high court in February 2019 on a petition filed by ayurvedic drug manufacturers. In May 2023, the Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani Drugs Technical Advisory Board (ASUDTAB) of the central Ayush ministry recommended the omission of Rule 170 and a notification dated July 1, 2024, was issued omitting it. However, on August 27, 2024 the Supreme Court stayed the July 2024 notification and restored Rule 170 saying that “till further order passed rule 170 shall remain on statute book and in force”.Under Rule 170, advertisement of ayurvedic, siddha and unani drugs have to be cleared by the licensing authority of the state where the manufacturer of the medicine is located or where the corporate office is located, in case the manufacturing is happening in more than one state. It was brought in through an amendment to the rules after consultations with ASUDTAB in response to an increasing number of misleading advertisements of Ayush products.",Kerala drug controller (Ayurveda) issued a warning to Pankajakasthuri Herbals India Pvt Ltd.

MUMBAI: Two years ago, jockey Nirmal Jodha was fighting for his life. On Sunday, he was fighting for the finish line. He won both races.The 43-year-old, who battled third-stage colon cancer and dropped to just 27 kg during treatment, made a stunning comeback at Mahalaxmi Racecourse , guiding no-hoper Absolute Gorgeous past the winning post at The Star Shine Trophy .""Though I have ridden around 300 winners in my 25-year career in the saddle, this one was the sweetest of them all,"" Jodha told TOI.In Jan 2023, Jodha was diagnosed with third-stage colon cancer. ""I had been experiencing digestive discomfort for some time, and a routine clinic visit revealed an ulcer in my large intestine,"" he recalled. A biopsy confirmed it was third-stage colon cancer. ""I was completely blank. My first thought was - what will happen to my widowed mother, my wife and my three-year-old son? How will they survive if I die?""Jockeys’ Association of India and fellow riders helped him get in touch with Dr Mehli Nazir, who advised immediate admission to Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune. There, Dr Gajanan Kanitkar performed surgery in Feb 2023.What followed was a gruelling battle — aggressive chemotherapy and radiation in the months ahead brought his weight down to just 27 kg. Fortunately, his years as a jockey had trained him to handle a strict diet. A jockey’s typical weight ranges between 47kg and 55kg.Trainer Adhirajsingh Jodha, Nirmal’s employer and one of the leading names at Royal Western India Turf Club, played a crucial role in his comeback. “I asked him to keep coming to the stables just to get him out of the house and take his mind off things,” Adhirajsingh said. “At first, he just hung around, but soon, he asked for work.” By early last year, Nirmal was back at the stables. “He was so thin and weak that I only let him trot my horses — to help him regain confidence, ” Adhirajsingh said. But by the end of the Pune season in Oct, Nirmal had progressed to cantering horses.Early this Mumbai season — which runs from mid-Nov to mid-April — he secured a few rides that strengthened his resolve. Trainer P S Chouhan then entrusted him with Absolute Gorgeous. “I told him to take a good jump and do his best in the homestretch,” Chouhan said. Nirmal did not disappoint. While he’s back in the saddle, his medical journey isn’t over. “I have to go for periodic checkups to monitor for recurrence,” he said. “I’ll be on medication for the next five years.”","Two years ago, jockey Nirmal Jodha was fighting for his life.

Indian Army: CCS clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ccs-clears-mega-deal-for-big-indigenous-artillery-guns/articleshow/119234281.cms,"CCS clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns

NEW DELHI: Big indigenous guns are finally booming. The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Wednesday cleared the around Rs 7,000 crore deal to acquire advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) for the Army , in a major boost for home-grown capability to manufacture such heavy-duty howitzers .The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army, with the contract expected to be inked next week, top sources told TOI.Designed and developed by DRDO , the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS will be produced by Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems . Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns after it emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%.TOI was the first to report that the ATAGS deal would be inked within this fiscal after clearance from the CCS. The orders for ATAGS are likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns.India, incidentally, has also secured a couple of export orders for the ATAGs, which officers say have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.With ATAGS having an “all-electric drive technology” to ensure maintenance-free reliable operations over longer periods of time, India will be able to export the guns in large numbers in the years ahead, an officer said.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army.

Child's teary silence can't aid rapist's defence: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/childs-teary-silence-cant-aid-rapists-defence-supreme-court/articleshow/119233933.cms,"Can't equate girl's silence to that of adult prosecutrix: SC

NEW DELHI: Reversing the acquittal of a person in a 40-year-old rape case, Supreme Court said the silence of a little girl with tears rolling down her cheeks when asked about the incident in the trial court during cross-examination cannot be an indicator of innocence of the accused.Slamming the insensitivity of the Rajasthan HC judge for acquitting the accused, who was 21 when convicted and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment by the trial court in 1987 for raping the minor, SC also criticised HC for naming the rape survivor.HC took 26 years to decide the appeal of the convict and acquitted him through a six-page judgment. The Rajasthan govt's appeal, filed in 2013, was finally decided by an SC bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sanjay Karol after 12 years, indicative of the trend that while trial courts decide cases expeditiously, it is the constitutional courts where appeals linger for decades.The trial judge had recorded the child rape survivor had not deposed anything about the commission of the offence during cross-examination and when repeatedly asked, ""she shed tears in silence"".HC had taken this as one of the grounds to acquit the convict.Writing the judgment, Justice Karol said, ""This, in our view, cannot be used as a factor in favour of the accused. The tears of 'V' (minor girl) have to be understood for what they are worth. This silence cannot accrue to the benefit of the accused. The silence here is that of a child. It cannot be equated with the silence of a fully realised adult prosecutrix...""""V has not turned hostile. Trauma has engulfed her in silence. It would be unfair to burden her young shoulders with the weight of the entire prosecution. A child traumatised at a tender age by this ghastly imposition upon her must be relieved of being the basis on which her offender can be put behind bars,"" Justice Karol said and proceeded to cull out other relevant evidence, medical and circumstantial, which unequivocally pointed to the guilt of the accused, Chhatra.The medical evidence pointed to the ghastly way Chhatra sexually assaulted the girl. After examining other evidence on the case records, Justices Nath and Karol allowed the appeal, set aside the HC judgment and upheld the conviction and sentence awarded to Chatra by trial court.Chhatra, who was 22 years of age when he was convicted by the trial court in 1987, would now be over 60 years and SC directed him to surrender before the authorities concerned within four weeks to serve the sentence.","HC took 26 years to decide the appeal of the convict and acquitted him through a six-page judgment.

Brace for detours as Dwarka Expressway section closed for 44 days for repairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/44-day-closure-for-dwarka-expressway-section/articleshow/119176696.cms,"The closure will affect commuters from several sectors, causing congestion and delays. NHAI aims to ensure long-term durability with this work, amidst concerns over the expressway's frequent repairs.

GURGAON: Commuters using Dwarka Expressway will brace for disruptions as entry from the elevated service road at Daulatabad Chowk towards Delhi will remain closed for 44 days as NHAI has decided to replace an expansion joint.The highway authorities put up barriers at the entry of the connecting flyover of the main carriageway on Tuesday. It will be closed till April 30. The closure is expected to impact those travelling from Sector 99 to 106 and adjoining areas of Dhankot, Basai and Kherki Majra, who will now need to take the surface road and merge onto the main expressway after Bijwasan toll plaza.According to NHAI, an accident in Jan damaged the expansion joint, prompting immediate but temporary repairs. ""However, upon further assessment, it was required to replace expansion joints to ensure long-term durability of the structure. The work will be completed in 44 days,"" said an NHAI official.The highways authorities also maintained that ""all other traffic movements will remain unaffected"" on the expressway, but daily commuters anticipate congestion and delays, especially during peak hours.The surface road, already burdened by traffic from Old Railway Road, Daultabad Road and New Palam Vihar Extension, will carry a higher volume of vehicles, slowing movement.NHAI data indicated that Dwarka Expressway sees one lakh PCU daily. The elevated road's closure is likely to increase travel time for those heading towards Delhi from the city.""The elevated road was a major time-saver, and now traffic will pile up on surface roads. The alternative routes, like Najafgarh Road, are already in poor condition, making things worse. NHAI must ensure quality checks to prevent such recurring issues, especially after investing Rs 9,000 crore on this project,"" said Abhishek Vatsa, a resident of Sector 102, who takes the expressway daily.TOI last month reported that the expressway's city section had undergone several patchworks since its inaugural last year. Though NHAI called it ""routine maintenance"", many commuters raised concerns about the expressway's frequent repair work within such a short span.""It is worrying that different sections of the expressway have been closed for repairs multiple times within a year. We hope NHAI fixes these flaws permanently instead of carrying out just patch repairs,"" said Dhananjay Jha, president of Suncity Avenue RWA.In Dec, expansion joints on the elevated portion were reported damaged near Yashobhoomi on the Delhi section, prompting the highways authority to replace them. Although the Delhi section opened to traffic in March last year, most stretches remain under construction which is expected to finish by Aug this year. In July 2024, just four months after opening, a 70m stretch near Sector 102 developed minor cracks, raising further doubts about the expressway's construction quality. The corridor, built at a cost of Rs 9,000 crore, was envisioned as a high-speed link between Delhi and Gurgaon, serving as a critical route for travellers to Dwarka, IGI Airport, South Delhi and West Delhi.The 19km Haryana section of the 8-lane Dwarka Expressway includes two stretches — one 10.2km portion from Delhi-Haryana Border to Basai rail overbridge and another 8.7km section to Kherki Daula from there.The project, which now shows signs of wear and tear, was executed reduce congestion on NH-8 and offer better connectivity between Gurgaon and Delhi.","The highway authorities put up barriers at the entry of the connecting flyover of the main carriageway on Tuesday.

However, no SSLC exam that begins Friday has been scheduled for Saturday. A schools' association said they would go ahead with exams for lower classes on that day in the interest of students.While a cab drivers' association said they won't ply Saturday, road transport corporation employees said they will take a call in a day or two. Some autorickshaw drivers said they will participate in the bandh.Vatal Nagaraj, leader of pro-Kannada organisations that have called the bandh, said the protest is against the Greater Bengaluru Governance Bill and the atmosphere created in Belagavi region by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, where an NWKRTC bus conductor was attacked recently for not speaking in Marathi to a passenger.However, the Kannada Rakshana Vedike faction headed by TA Narayana Gowda said it will stay away from the protest.

So, we are not extending our support to the bandh,"" Gowda explained.But Vatal Nagaraj said: ""We are disappointed with Bengaluru being divided into four to seven parts. We are not going to cancel the bandh. We have support from over 2,000 Kannada activists.

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication. Upadhyay added, ""In a situation like this, employees outside the country would be stuck for several monthsbefore they can return to the US."" Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, ""If travel is unavoidable, visa applicants and their employers should also try to have contingency plans in case of delayed stamping such as continuing work from their home country.""","US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday hit back at Pakistan for labelling PM Modi's remark on the bilateral issues with Islamabad ""misleading and one-sided"".The external affairs ministry said the world knows that the real issue is Pakistan’s ""active promotion and sponsorship of cross-border terrorism "" and that Islamabad should ""vacate Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation"".In an interview with with American podcaster Lex Fridman, PM Modi on Sunday said that “every attempt to foster peace with Pakistan was met with hostility and betrayal” and that he hoped that “wisdom would prevail on the leadership in Islamabad to improve bilateral ties.”Also read: ‘We chose peace, they chose proxy war’: PM Modi on India-Pakistan relations on podcast with Lex Fridman Fridman asked the Prime Minister about the tense conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations and whether he saw a path to friendship and peace.PM Modi responded by recalling India’s partition in 1947, describing it as a painful and bloody chapter in history. He explained that despite India's acceptance of partition, Pakistan did not choose peaceful coexistence.""After getting their own way, we expected them to live and let live, and yet, they chose not to foster a harmonious coexistence.

NEW DELHI: India and China should be partners contributing to each other's success and a cooperative ""pas de deux"" between the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for the two countries, Beijing said while welcoming PM Modi's ""positive"" remarks in a podcast in which he had endorsed signs of a rapprochement in ties since Oct last year.In the interaction with Lex Fridman, Modi had also strongly backed Donald Trump's policies and the US president even shared the podcast on his social media platform, Truth Social.Modi had said on Sunday that the border situation with China was normalising since his meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan in Oct and trust would return in the relationship ""slowly but surely"". Seeking a cooperative relationship, he also said it was natural for India and China to have differences, and the focus should be on ensuring that these don't turn into disputes.Building upon PM Modi's remarks, the Chinese foreign ministry said that Sino-Indian ties were characterised by mutual learning and friendly exchanges for over 2,000 years."" China appreciated PM Modi's recent positive statements. The successful meeting between President Xi and PM Modi in Kazan last Oct provided strategic guidance for the improvement and development of bilateral ties. Both sides have earnestly followed through on the important common understandings of our leaders, strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels, and achieved a series of positive outcomes,"" a ministry spokesperson said, responding to a question at a media briefing.The official added China stood ready to work with India to implement the understandings that both leaders had reached in their meeting. Asserting that China's ties with India contributed to the progress of civilisations and humanity, the official also said the two largest developing countries had a shared task to achieve ""development and revitalisation, and should understand and support each other, and help each other succeed"".""This serves the fundamental interests of over 2.8 billion people in the two countries, meets the common aspiration of regional countries, follows the historical trend of the Global South growing stronger, and is conducive to world peace, stability, development and prosperity,"" the official said.India and China had reached an agreement in Oct last year to complete the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh and effectively end the nearly-five-year-old military stand-off.Modi said in his podcast that efforts were on to ensure the pre-2020 situation.""China stands ready to work with India to implement the important common understandings between the two leaders, take the 75th anniversary of China-India diplomatic relations as an opportunity, promote exchange and cooperation in various fields and at all levels, and advance China-India relations on the track of sound and stable development,"" the official said.","India and China should be partners contributing to each other's success, says China.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face."" Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi, Tharoor admitted that India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace and has a Prime Minister ""who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow"".Tharoor, who had previously called for India to condemn Russia’s aggression, said during a session, ""I am still wiping the egg off my face because I was one of the few in Parliament who criticised India’s position in February 2022.""The Thiruvananthapuram MP explained that his criticism was based on the violation of the UN Charter and Ukraine’s sovereignty. However, three years later, he now recognises that India’s balanced approach has allowed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky within weeks of each other.""All of those principles had been violated by one party and we should have condemned it. Well, three years later it does look like I am the one with the egg on my face because clearly the policy has meant that India has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine (Zelenskyy) and the president in Moscow (Putin) two weeks apart and be accepted in both places,"" he said according to news agency PTI.With the caveat that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the government as he is in the opposition, Tharoor suggested that India might be open to sending peacekeepers if there was an agreed peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine.He noted that Russia has ruled out NATO peacekeepers, making non-European forces more viable. ""As an Indian parliamentarian, I don’t think there would be strong resistance to the idea,"" he said, citing India's extensive history in peacekeeping missions.Tharoor recalled how, in 2003, India’s Parliament firmly rejected sending troops to Iraq after the US-led invasion. However, he stated, “I don’t see that happening for Ukraine.”India has participated in over 49 UN peacekeeping missions, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to global stability.","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face"" The Thiruvananthapuram MP said India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace.

NEW DELHI: The brutal murder of Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput has sent shockwaves through Meerut, with his grieving family demanding the death penalty for his wife, Muskan Rastogi , and her alleged lover, Sahil Shukla. Saurabh’s mother, Renu Devi, accused Muskan of killing her husband, locking his body in a room, and then going on a trip as if nothing had happened.Saurabh had been missing since March 4. The horrific crime was exposed when laborers hired to move a heavy drum from the couple’s rented house struggled with its weight. When one of them questioned Muskan about its contents, she casually said it was ""house junk."" However, as they attempted to shift it, the lid accidentally opened, releasing a foul smell. Suspecting something sinister, the laborers immediately informed the police.According to Saurabh’s mother, even their young daughter might have been aware of the crime. “Neighbors told us that she (their daughter) was saying, ‘Papa has been kept in the drum.’ She might have seen something, or else why would a child say such a thing?” Renu Devi said.Police investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil allegedly stabbed Saurabh to death, chopped up his body, and sealed the remains in a drum filled with cement to hide the crime. Muskan’s landlord had reportedly asked the couple to vacate the rented house, which is when she and Sahil attempted to shift the body.After the body was discovered, Muskan fled to her mother’s house, allegedly to inform them of what had happened. However, Saurabh’s mother claims Muskan’s family already knew about the murder. “She (Muskan) reached her mother’s house, and her mother met a lawyer before they went to court. They were trying to cover things up, but the police caught them,” Renu Devi said.Police arrested Muskan and Sahil on Tuesday and presented them before the court on Wednesday. They have been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.Meanwhile, Saurabh’s family is devastated, claiming he sacrificed everything for Muskan, only to be betrayed in the most gruesome manner. “Saurabh left his job and family for Muskan, but she took his life,” his parents said.Renu Devi recalled how Saurabh had distanced himself from his family after marrying Muskan. “I tolerated everything for the happiness of my son and daughter-in-law. Now, she has killed my son.”The grieving mother, overwhelmed with grief, demanded strict punishment. “They all (Muskan’s family) should be hanged along with that boy (Sahil),” she said.Meanwhile, Muskan’s own parents have disowned her, expressing deep remorse over her actions. “It would have been better if she was never born,” her mother, Kavita Rastogi, told reporters.Her father, Pramod Rastogi, called for the harshest punishment. “Muskan has lost the right to live. Such a person does not deserve to be alive. She fell in love with Sahil and got addicted to drugs. He destroyed her. She lost 10 kg because of drug use. But that does not justify this crime,” he said.Pramod and Kavita said that they fully support Saurabh’s family’s demand for justice. They confirmed that Muskan had been living separately from her in-laws since her marriage in 2016 due to ongoing disputes.","Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput was stabbed to death.

NEW DELHI: Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones, following an earlier clash in the Mahal area that had already escalated tensions in the city, according to reports.The unrest intensified after rumours circulated about the burning of a religious book, triggering widespread stone-pelting, vandalism, and arson.Mahal and Hansapuri were the worst-affected areas, with vehicles torched and shops damaged by unidentified attackers. The violence erupted just two kilometres from the RSS headquarters, heightening security concerns.To control the situation, Nagpur Police imposed prohibitory measures under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and enforced Section 144, which bans large gatherings. A curfew has been imposed in several areas. The police are reviewing CCTV footage to identify others involved.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen sustained serious injuries during the violence, while a constable remains in critical condition in the hospital.Mobs set fire to two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces faced challenges in controlling the situation. In response, police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the ministry of home affairs (MHA) sought a report on the unrest.Nagpur gears up for PM Modi's expected visit amid unrestAs Nagpur deals with recent violence, the city is preparing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's expected visit on March 30. This will be his first public appearance alongside RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat since starting his third term.Nagpur Police Commissioner Ravinder Singal assured residents that the situation is now under control and urged them not to believe in rumours. ""We have imposed Section 144, and everyone has been told not to step out unnecessarily or take the law into their own hands. Do not believe rumors. Except for this area, the entire city is peaceful,"" he said.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called for peace, highlighting Nagpur's history of communal harmony. ""Nagpur is a peaceful city where people share in each other's joys and sorrows. Do not believe any rumors,"" he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera attacked the BJP-led state government, blaming it for failing to maintain law and order and accusing political parties of fuelling tensions.""If the VHP and Bajrang Dal organized a protest demanding the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb, did the government make no arrangements to maintain law and order?"" he questioned.From opposition bloc, Sena UBT's Sanjay Raut also reflected on the incident, saying, ""There is no reason for violence to occur in Nagpur. It is where RSS is headquartered. It is also Devendra ji's constituency. Who can have the courage to spread violence there? This is a new pattern to scare Hindus, make their own people attack them, and then incite and involve them in riots.""Security forces are conducting searches to arrest those responsible for the violence. Authorities have asked people to remain calm, avoid unnecessary travel, and not spread misinformation. The situation is being closely monitored to prevent further disturbances.The unrest also sparked a political row in the Maharashtra Assembly . State Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal compared CM to Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, calling him a cruel ruler. His remarks led to an uproar in the ongoing Budget session, with Mahayuti leaders demanding legal action against him.The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal held a demonstration in Nagpur on Monday, demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's grave in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Right-wing activists gathered at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Mahal area, chanting slogans and burning an effigy of Aurangzeb.This controversy over Aurangzeb has also been fuelled by the newly released Vicky Kaushal-starrer film Chhava , which portrays the conflict between Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Sambhaji and Aurangzeb after Chhatrapati Shivaji's death.The issue ties into a larger historical shift, as Aurangabad was officially renamed Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in June 2022 to honor Sambhaji Bhosale, the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.","Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones.

Assembly elections in Kerala due next year

NEW DELHI: Is Congress MP Shashi Tharoor trying to cock a snook at the party leadership or is the Thiruvananthapuram MP trying to convey a message to party leadership? Tharoor's praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi - two times in the space of two days - has indeed left the Congress and Rahul Gandhi in an embarrassing spot with the BJP quick to take pot shots at the grand-old-party and its leadership.On Tuesday, Tharoor had said that the country has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow - two weeks apart and be accepted in both places. He followed this up a day later by reiterating PM Modi's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Speaking on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue, Tharoor today said, ""PM Modi has taken a consistent position that the solution to this conflict has to come through diplomacy. In fact, you may remember his statement in Samarkand in front of President Putin, where he said this is not an era of war and that solutions have been found peacefully. We do seem to be at the beginning of a peace process of some sort.""As expected, the BJP was jubilant and quick to target the Congress leadership. ""The knives would be out in the Congress after Tharoor's remarks, which would likely leave leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi ""red-faced"","" said BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya. The BJP leader later took another swipe and said: ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters ... old ones are turning into his fans."" Another BJP leader Sambit Patra said: ""Shashi Tharoor understands diplomacy, he had been in the UN for a very long time. He has appreciated PM Modi's stand in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Other leaders of Congress should also learn from Shashi Tharoor instead of Speaking against PM Modi and the nation every time ... Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi should come forward and appreciate Shashi Tharoor's stand.""Rahul has been a vocal and perhaps one of the fiercest critics of Prime Minister Modi. The Congress has missed no opportunity to slam the policies of BJP-led NDA government. However, on the Ukraine war front, the former Congress president had in 2023 admitted that the opposition bloc understood India's relations with Russia and had then said that he would, by and large, agree with the country's position on the ongoing war in Ukraine.When asked about his changed stand on the Russia-Ukraine war issue, Tharoor justified his position and said that he has made his opinion as a ""Bharatheeyan"" and he doesn't see any politics in that. But the Congress is unlikely to buy this argument.It was in February this year that Shashi Tharoor had surprised his party with an out-of-turn praise for PM Modi's US trip and his thumbs up to entrepreneurial growth in Kerala under the LDF government. Reports then claimed that Tharoor felt sidelined in the state Congress, despite winning his Lok Sabha seat four times in a row.Tharoor's remarks evoked strong reactions from the Congress which got into damage control mode. The Congress top brass met leaders from Kerala in Delhi for a brainstorming session. At the meeting, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge laid stress on discipline and a stern warning was given to the state leaders that strong action will be taken against those making comments that go against the party's interests.Later, the Congress claimed that all was ""okay"" in Kerala unit. Rahul Gandhi posted a picture from the Kerala leaders' interaction with the media after the meeting and said on Facebook: ""They stand as one, united by the light of purpose ahead."" His post was accompanied by the hashtag, ""Team Kerala"".The fact that Tharoor's latest round of ""PM praise"" comes despite this unity exercise and party's ""stern warning"" should indeed worry the Congress.Kerala goes to polls next year. It will be a high-stakes battle for the Congress, which failed to oust the LDF government in 2021. The CPM won 62 of the 140 seats in the assembly leaving behind the Congress, which could manage only 21.The Congress in the state has a history of internal factionalism. Ahead of the elections next year, Tharoor perhaps wants a greater say in the party's affairs in the state which the state Congress leaders may be resisting. Tharoor is no pushover in politics. His remarks in praise of PM Modi may perhaps be a message to the party leadership to ensure that he gets his rightful due in the state unit. It will be interesting to see how the Congress leadership finds the right balance between the state leaders. The grand-old-party would not want let factionalism adversely impact its poll prospects in the state.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice in the space of two days. The BJP was quick to take pot shots at the grand-old-party and its leadership. Kerala goes to polls next year, which will be a high-stakes battle for the Congress.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119218723,imgsize-29308,width-400,resizemode-4/119218723.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave, which is located in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.Fadnavis's remark came amid growing demand from a certain section to remove the Mughal emperor's grave.""It is unfortunate that the government has to take responsibility for the protection of Aurangzeb's grave, despite his history of persecution. However, I assure you, if any attempt is made to glorify his legacy through '', it will not succeed,"" Fadnavis said at an event that he attended to inaugurate a temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Thane district and lauded the Maratha king for fighting for '' and the country.""We are able to worship our gods freely today because of Shivaji Maharaj's efforts. He fought for Swarajya, for God, for our country, and our religion,"" Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Earlier, BJP's Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale, who is also the descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, advocated for the removal of the Mughal king's tomb situated in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.Responding to Bhosale's request, Fadnavis clarified that despite sharing similar sentiments, actions must conform to legal procedures due to the site's protected status, which was established during the previous Congress administration.Fadnavis said, ""We all also want the same thing, but you need to do it within the framework of the law, because it is a protected site. The site was put under ASI's (Archaeological Survey of India) protection during the Congress regime some years back.""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protects historical tombs under the AMASR Act, 1958, ensuring their preservation. If a tomb is declared a protected monument, no construction is allowed within 100 meters, and activities in the 200-meter regulated area need approval. The ASI oversees conservation and prevents alterations or damage.Section 19(1) of the Act clearly states that no person, including government authorities, can destroy, remove, alter, or deface a protected monument without official permission.Further strengthening these protections, the AMASR (Amendment) Act, 2010, imposes strict penalties and imprisonment for unauthorised construction, alteration, or destruction of a protected monument. This means that even a state government cannot make changes to an ASI-protected tomb.Violating these rules leads to legal action, fines, or imprisonment. Unauthorized encroachments are removed, and restoration must maintain the tomb’s original character.Aurangzeb was the sixth ruler of the Mughal Empire, reigning from 1658 to 1707. He was the son of Emperor Shah Jahan and is known for expanding the Mughal Empire to its greatest territorial extent, covering almost the entire Indian subcontinent.Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb followed a more orthodox Islamic rule, enforcing religious policies that included the reintroduction of the jizya tax on non-Muslims and restrictions on certain cultural practices.Aurangzeb and Sambhaji Maharaj were fierce adversaries in the late 17th century. Sambhaji, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji, was the second ruler of the Maratha Empire, while Aurangzeb was the Mughal emperor who sought to crush the Marathas and expand Mughal rule in the Deccan. Their rivalry intensified after Sambhaji ascended the throne in 1681 and continued his father’s resistance against Mughal domination.In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured Sambhaji near Sangameshwar through treachery. He was brutally tortured for refusing to convert to Islam and executed in an inhumane manner.His martyrdom made him a symbol of Maratha defiance, strengthening the Maratha resistance against Mughal rule. Sambhaji’s death fueled the eventual decline of Mughal power in the Deccan.","Devendra Fadnavis said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave.

India to step on the gas for indigenous 5th gen fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-step-on-the-gas-for-indigenous-5th-gen-fighter/articleshow/119090404.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, with a top-level committee now working to evolve a clear-cut strategy and production-cum-business model for the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).The committee chaired by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, which includes IAF vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and top officials from DRDO and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), is slated to submit its report next month.This comes at a time when Pakistan is looking to acquire at least 40 J-35A stealth fifth-generation jets from China, which is now brandishing even sixth-generation prototypes.China has already deployed its fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 jets at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.Faced with this, coupled with the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas jets by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a source told TOI that the committee's aim is to ""devise how best to get AMCA from the drawing board into the air by shrinking timelines and improving efficiency, including a good workable production-cum-business model with much greater private sector participation"".The committee will also consider the plan for indigenous development of a 110 kilonewton thrust-class engine to power the 25-tonne AMCA with foreign technology collaboration. Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

SC: Obligatory for promoter, appt owner to form association

NEW DELHI: In an important decision which will allow homebuyers to take charge of their societies even if the project has not been completed, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has held that once the Apartment Owners Association gets registered, management of the complex's common areas and facilities has to be transferred from the promoter to the association.A bench headed by chairperson of NCLAT Justice Ashok Bhushan said a real estate company has no right to resist handing over of maintenance to the association.The tribunal passed the order on a plea by the homebuyers' association of Supernova housing project in Noida, being developed by Supertech Ltd, that management of the complex be handed over to it. The bench directed the company to hand over the charge within seven days.Advocate Govind Jee, appearing for the homebuyers, told the tribunal that Supernova apartment owners had formed an association which was registered under Uttar Pradesh Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership and Maintenance) Act and they should be allowed to take over management which was being looked after by a company called YG Estates. The homebuyers approached the tribunal as the project is under insolvency.Supertech argued that as per law, an association could be formed only when at least 33% of homebuyers had taken possession of their flats. In Supernova's case, only 27% of the total project has received occupancy certificate from Noida. There are 2,165 units in the project.The bench, also comprising members Barun Mitra and Arun Baroka, said it was a statutory obligation for the promoter and apartment owners to form an association.Rejecting the company's plea that 33% of apartments have to be handed over before an association is formed and that the present association was not a valid one, the tribunal said, ""We are of the view that the association having been registered and the registration of association still being valid it is not open for YG Estates to contend that registration of the association is not in accordance with the law. The issue with regard to non-fulfilment of the necessary conditions for registration of the association cannot be allowed to be raised in these proceedings nor can it be examined in these applications. When the association has been registered, it has to be presumed that registration was made after compliance of all necessary requirements.""As the parties raised questions on clearing the dues, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal directed them to appear before the Interim Resolution Professional and arrive at a settlement.""We are of the view that in these proceedings, the issues pertaining to outstanding of YG Estates or any amount accepted by YG Estates cannot be gone into or decided. We are of the view that such issues can be raised before the Interim Resolution Process who is overall in-charge of all projects and management. It is for the Interim Resolution Process to take a call and take necessary steps for settlement of accounts between the parties,"" it said.","National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has held that once the Apartment Owners Association gets registered, management of the complex's common areas and facilities has to be transferred to the association.

SC orders direct bank transfer of payout in road accident cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-orders-direct-bank-transfer-of-payout-in-road-accident-cases/articleshow/119233240.cms,"NEW DELHI: As an average of more than five lakh people die or get injured in road accidents every year and corresponding number of compensation claims get filed before tribunals, Supreme Court has ordered cutting down of delay in payment of recompense money to the kin or injured through direct bank transfer (DBT) method.In general, insurance companies, where the compensation amount claimed by the kin or injured is not disputed, deposit the money before motor accident claims tribunal (MACT), which delays the amount reaching the relatives of the dead or the injured as in many cases they remain unaware of such deposits made by the insurer. Enhancing the compensation payable from Rs 12 lakh, determined by HC, to Rs 36.8 lakh in a 2014 accident claim case, a bench of J K Maheshwari and Rajesh Bindal said “a direction can always be issued to transfer the amount into the bank account(s) of the claimant(s) with intimation to the tribunal.”SC said MACTs can ask the claimants at the initial stage to furnish their bank accounts and direct the insurer to directly transfer the undisputed amount to their accounts. It said that the same DBT method can be adopted by the insurers when the tribunal makes the final award on the claims. The bench passed this order considering the large number of deaths and injuries caused by road accidents in the last five years. For the year 2018, road accident deaths were 1.5 lakh, and 4.6 lakh were injured; 2019 — 1.5 lakh deaths and 4.4 lakh injuries; 2020 — 1.3 lakh deaths and 3.4 injuries; 2021 — 1.5 lakh deaths and 3.8 lakh injuries; 2022 – 1.6 lakh deaths and 4.4 lakh injuries. Mentioning that India has done wonders in popularising digital payments, the bench said the courts and insurance companies can adopt the same for direct transfer of money to claimants instead of making them wait for months to get compensation.","Supreme Court has ordered cutting down of delay in payment of recompense money to the kin or injured through direct bank transfer (DBT) method.

NEW DELHI: One of the global leaders in the semiconductor industry , which is also looking to ramp up its presence in the Indo-Pacific, the Netherlands wants to integrate its defence industry with India with collaboration in dual use technologies like drones, AI and semiconductors. Dutch defence minister Ruben Brekelmans told TOI in an exclusive interview that the 2 countries are looking to upgrade their ties to the level of a strategic partnership and it’s important to have a strong defence and security pillar to base it on.Brekelmans said that the Netherlands, one of the principal backers of Kyiv in Europe, seeks robust security guarantees for Ukraine to blunt Russia’s “imperial ambitions” and to prevent a return to the 19th century.“Both have strong maritime sectors and there’s more we could do on this. There are also some dual-use technologies , for example in drones, AI, semiconductors where there’s a lot of innovation in the Netherlands, also in India. It’d be interesting to look for synergies. India very often doesn’t just have knowledge but also the scale to produce in large numbers. That’s what we need right now. We need to ramp up our defence industries and if there’s also capacity from the Indian side, it can be important,’’ said the minister, before his meeting with counterpart Rajnath Singh this week. The Netherlands had imposed restrictions on the export of chip equipment in 2023, apparently under pressure from the Biden administration that wanted to curb supplies to China.Asked about the Indo-Pacific, where the Netherlands was one of the first European countries to have its own policy, Brekelmans said the Dutch intend to have maritime exercise every 2 years in the region. “So, we often have one of our frigates visiting multiple countries, India being one of the important ones of course. We also do air exercises, with our F-35s, to show indeed that we share the same values and principles. We have more people to people contacts with India and others, more military attaches to strengthen cooperation,’’ he said.On the threat to the transatlantic alliance from US President Donald Trump’s policies, Brekelmans said he had heard from his counterpart Pete Hegseth that Nato is more relevant today than ever and backed Trump’s call for Europe to spend more on defence. He, however, said the policy of reciprocal tariffs would hurt all.“There can be some tactical moves by the US to push allies and friends to do certain things and that’s fine. But it’s important that we remain close friends at the strategic level. It’s positive that the US has stressed multiple times that Nato is important. If there are some strategic decisions made by the US, for example to promote focus on Asia, it’s always better to do that together than make any unilateral move,’’ he said.With the Netherlands having committed military aid worth 10 billion euros to Ukraine, Brekelmans said there must be enough military power to ensure any peace deal is durable. “A peace deal should not lay the ground for future Russian aggression. Not just in Ukraine, but also other parts of Europe. It’s also important to have credible deterrence at other Nato borders. We have had 80 years of peace and we want another 80 years of the same,’’ said the minister.","Netherlands wants to integrate its defence industry with India with collaboration in dual use technologies like drones, AI and semiconductors.

NEW DELHI: Bearing the brunt of China’s aggressive expansionist tactics in the South China Sea , the Philippines now wants India to join the relatively new `Squad’ strategic alliance it has forged with the US, Australia and Japan to counter such threats in the crucial Indo-Pacific region .Pointing to China’s “illegal, coercive and disruptive Grey Zone” tactics to claim territory and build militarised artificial islands in the South China Sea region, Philippines chief of staff of armed forces General Romeo S Brawner said countries like India and South Korea should also be `included’ in the Squad.China was clearly the big dragon in the room when top military officers of the `Quad’ (India, US, Australia and Japan) and the Philippines got together to discuss maritime security challenges in the Indo-Pacific during the Raisina Dialogue here on Wednesday.“The three artificial islands created by China give it effective control over the South China Sea. They have built a 2.7-km runway, with air defence and other missile systems, on Mischief Reef…Moving forward, it is our belief that they will take full control of the South China Sea,” Gen Brawner said.China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms. Japan, on its part, is doubling its defence spending to improve its current war-fighting capabilities and prepare for the future, said Japanese chief of joint staff Gen Yoshihide Yoshida.US Indo-Pacific Command chief Admiral Samuel Paparo, who also dwelt upon the prospect of China forcibly intervening in Taiwan, in turn, said all countries that believe matters should not be “settled by force” should build and maintain a strong deterrence posture.China, with the world’s largest Navy of 370 warships and submarines, now of course also deploys seven to eight naval vessels on a permanent basis in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), including dual-purpose research or spy ships to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India believed it was its responsibility to ensure IOR remains peaceful and stable, with unhindered passage of trade. “A Navy that does not deploy does not deter. So, we have been deploying far and wide…We are quite capable of maintaining MDA (maritime domain awareness) in the IOR. We are aware of who is doing what, where and how,” he said.India is “keeping a close watch” on dual-purpose and other naval vessels operating in the IOR, sharing intelligence, building bilateral, trilateral and multilateral partnerships, and helping island nations build capacity, Admiral Tripathi added.Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed, sitting in the audience, asked whether the new Trump administration can be trusted to remain steadfast about its partners in the Indo-Pacific. The consensus, by and large, was that while the US may rollback from Europe, the Indo-Pacific would remain on the top of Trump’s radar screen.“We foresee an increase in support to the Indo-Pacific,” Gen Brawner said. Admiral Paparo added that the Trump administration had reiterated its commitment to the Indo-Pacific and its partners there. One of the first meetings of the new administration was of the foreign ministers of the Quad, he added.","China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms. China, with the world’s largest Navy of 370 warships and submarines, now of course also deploys seven to eight naval vessels on a permanent basis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119232081,imgsize-40220,width-400,resizemode-4/119232081.jpg"

BATHINDA/PATIALA: Punjab Police on Wednesday detained fasting farmer activist Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha head Sarvan Singh Pandher as well as other prominent agitators in Mohali when they were returning after attending a meeting with a central govt delegation in Chandigarh and also evicted protesting farmers from the Shambhu and Khanauri borders.The evictions began despite assurances from Punjab ministers about the AAP govt having no plans to disturb farm protesters or the two protest sites at Shambhu and Khanauri. By late Wednesday evening, the two sites had been cleared of protesters. More than 250 protesters were detained from Khanauri, some from Mohali, and 110 from Shambhu, a senior Punjab Police officer said, adding that they were shifted to a marriage hall. Wednesday's meeting was the seventh round of talks between the two sides since February 2024 and discussions centred on the main demand for a law guaranteeing MSP for crops.After Wednesday's talks, central ministers have decided to appoint a joint secretary to engage with various stakeholders to delve deeper into the contentious issue of MSP. The next round of meetings is scheduled for May 4.Joint secretary Purna Chand Kishan will be engaging with agriculture experts and farm activists. The development comes after farmers presented compelling data from reputable agencies like Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Crisil, and RBI.The data highlighted the financial implications of providing MSP. The farmers were proceeding to the Shambhu border from Chandigarh, from where Dallewal and other agitators accompanying him were to head to Khanauri. However, they were picked up right after crossing into Punjab, in Jagatpura area of Mohali. Dallewal was detained in his ambulance, and others with their vehicles after some resistance from the farmers. Pandher was picked up from his vehicle even though he tried to get away.The farmers were apprehending some kind of action given the heavy police deployment at both protest sites, but they expected it at Shambhu and Khanauri. Punjab police rounded up a few hundred farmers at the Khanauri interstate border late Wednesday evening. The turbans of several farmers were tossed during minor scuffles as they were being put into buses by authorities to clear the protest site.BKU Ekta Sidhupur leader Kulwant Singh claimed that all the belongings and tractor trailers parked on the highway were left behind as police didn’t give them time, especially to elderly farmers, to vacate. BKU Ekta Sidhupur farmer Deepu, who is close to Dallewal, said police forcibly rounded up over 150 farmers in a matter of minutes. Sangrur SSP Sartaj Singh Chahal said the operation was carried out peacefully and police did not engage in any clash with farmers. However, the farmers claimed that police used force to round them up at Khanauri.","Punjab Police detained fasting farmer activist Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha head Sarvan Singh Pandher.

The chairman said he would give his ruling in the matter on Thursday.Gokhale took on the home ministry and Shah alleging that central agencies like CBI and NIA were being controlled and used to attack govts in opposition-governed states and people who disagreed with BJP dispensation at Centre. RS chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar repeatedly intervened, asking Gokhale to withdraw some of his remarks which the latter refused to do, leading the chair to call for deletion of what it termed ""unparliamentary"" expressions.""MHA feels that the Union govt is the sole representative of the republic and the states don't mean anything. MHA has become a force for battling against states and any person who tries to disagree with the Union govt,"" Gokhale said.

He went on to assert that Gokhale was misleading the House by giving wrong information and said not all CBI cases the TMC member referred to were corruption cases. ""Many of them were related to poll violence registered at the instance of Supreme Court and HC.

PATNA/KOLKATA: A 13-year-old teen who doesn't talk much but lets his bat do all the talking was snapped by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore after an intense bidding at the IPL auction, making him the youngest player to play the world's biggest cricket league.On Monday evening, at faraway Jeddah, the young Bihar prodigy's name, Vaibhav Suryavanshi , was engraved on the annals of Indian Premier League (IPL) when he became the youngest player ever at the age of 13 years and 243 days to land an IPL contract.Vaibhav entered the 2025 IPL mega auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakh as the youngest ever to be listed in the 16-year history of the league. The southpaw was finally bought by the Royals, who outbid intense fight from Delhi Capitals to get the talented teenager with a staggering price.""He is a kind of player who has come on earth to play cricket and go back. He settles for nothing else,"" said Bihar Ranji coach Pramod Kumar.Kumar, under whose watchful eyes Vaibhav is honing his cricketing skills, said the young southpaw is curious to learn various aspects of the game and has a sharp mind.""He can hardly talk. But ask him about cricket and he can go on day and night. He never takes any rest on the ground. Even during lunch or tea break, he is with me for fielding practice or knocking away or stretching with a senior player,"" he said.Records came hand-in-hand with Vaibhav as he recently made headlines after becoming the youngest international centurion in the 170-year history of competitive cricket at 13 years and 188 days in September this year.The opener scored a 62-ball 104, studded with 14 hits to the fence and four towering sixes, in the 1st youth test for India Under-19 against Australia Under-19 in Chennai.Vaibhav reached the three-figure mark in just 58 balls, which made him the fastest Indian youth test centurion, too, and the second-fastest in the world.Hailing from Samastipur, Bihar, he was the youngest debutant in Ranji Trophy history when he played against Mumbai at just 12 years and 284 days. With this feat, the rookie broke records held for years by the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar.""He has always been getting attention from the crowd where he went to play Ranji trophy for being the youngest player and his enthusiasm on the ground,"" the coach says, adding he has no fear of fast bowling despite being the youngest in the team.Sanjeev Suryavanshi, a small farmer in Tajpur, Samastipur, and a part-time journalist with Hindi daily, was on cloud nine when his son Vaibhav called up from Dubai, where he is playing Asia Cup U-19 championship. His first match will be against Pakistan on November 30.""Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Delhi Capitals (DC) both had called him up for trial in Nagpur and Delhi. In Nagpur, he was asked to score 17 runs in one over. He hit three huge sixes in first three balls itself, making him a strong contender for RR team. He performed excellently in DC trials also. That's why DC was also interested in buying my son,"" the proud father said, while talking to TOI.Sanjeev recently sold his one kattha of land in Tajpur for the better future of his son's dream.Vaibhav is also the fourth youngest in the country to make first-class debut and the second youngest from Bihar when he played against Mumbai in Patna on January 6.Vaibhav played for Bihar in the 2023 edition of the Cooch Behar Trophy . In one of the matches against Jharkhand, he scored 151 runs off 128 balls with the help of 22 fours and three sixes. In the same match, he also scored 76. He also played in a quadrangular series involving India U-19 A, India U-19 B, England U-19 and Bangladesh U-19. He got scores of 53, 74, 0, 41 and 0 in the tournament. So far he has played 5 first-class games.Suryavanshi's meteoric rise in the last couple of years is more incredible in the backdrop of the controversy-ravaged Bihar cricket , which has made more news for wrong reasons ever since coming back into BCCI domestic fold from oblivion ahead of the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy.","Bihar prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi, 13, becomes youngest player to play in IPL.

World Chess Championship: Gukesh gets early wakeup call as Ding Liren takes exciting win in Game 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-gukesh-gets-early-wakeup-call-as-ding-liren-takes-exciting-win-in-game-1/articleshow/115686808.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren during game one of the WCC on Monday. (Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15. But 12 moves later, Ding had the clock advantage (29 mins in hand for 28 moves to Gukesh's 24). And finally, it led to Gukesh needing to make seven moves in 45 seconds to reach the 40-move mark.1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nce2 Nc6 7.c3 a5 8.Nf3 a4 9.Be3 Be7 10.g4 Qa5 11.Bg2 a3 12.b3 cxd4 13.b4 Qc7 14.Nexd4 Nb6 15.0-0 Nc4 16.Bf2 Bd7 17.Qe2 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb2 19.Qe3 Rc8 20.Rac1 Qc4 21.f5 Qd3 22.Qe1 Bg5 23.Rc2 Rc4 24.h4 Bf4 25.Qb1 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Qxc3 27.fxe6 fxe6 28.Ne2 Qxe5 29.Nxf4 Qxf4 30.Qc2 Qc4 31.Qd2 0-0 32.Bd4 Nd3 33.Qe3 Rxf1+ 34.Bxf1 e5 35.Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36.Bg2 Bf5 37.Bg3 Be4 38.Kh2 h6 39.Bh3 Qd1 40.Bd6 Qc2+ 41.Kg3 Qxa2 42.Be6+ Kh8 white resigned.","Reigning world champion Ding Liren gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore. Having previously contributed to RCB's impressive 2021 season, Hazlewood is set to lead their pace attack once again. His proven skills in generating bounce and movement will significantly enhance RCB's fast-bowling department.Ishan Kishan will be turning up for a new franchise in the IPL as the youngster was sold to SRH for Rs 11.25 crore, which is 26% less than Rs 15.25 crore MI paid to buy him in the 2022 auction.

Outgoing Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde on Wednesday said he would not be an obstacle to govt formation and would accept any decision taken by PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah as ""final"", thus potentially clearing the way for the return of BJP 's Devendra Fadnavis as the boss of Mantralaya in what would mark the capping stone on BJP's astounding performance under him.""I called PM Modi and Amit Shah on Tuesday and told them that your call as head of NDA and Mahayuti is final for us, just as it is final for BJP,"" Shinde said, adding, ""Our Shiv Sena will fully support BJP's decision to name the next Maharashtra CM. There is no speed-breaker from our side."" The remarks were seen as tantamount to giving the BJP brass a free hand in picking the leader of the Mahayuti coalition.Addressing a press conference in Thane, Shinde said, ""I spoke with Modiji and Amit bhai on Tuesday and conveyed to them to not consider me as an obstacle while deciding the next Maharashtra CM. They gave us the opportunity to lead the state and helped us while we were in office. They are the senior-most leaders in the NDA and Mahayuti and their decision will be considered final for us. I told them Shiv Sena will wholeheartedly support their decision even if they choose a BJP candidate or anyone else from the Mahayuti."" Eknath Shinde was flanked by some of his MLAs, including Pratap Sarnaik and Dada Bhuse during a press conference in Thane, where he said he had told PM Modi and Amit Shah to take a final call on next CM. ""I am saying this openly, I am not holding anything back. I told PM Modi not to bring it to his mind that there is any issue in forming govt because of me. The decision you take is final for BJP, as it is final for us,"" Shinde said.Although the caretaker CM did not categorically state that he was conceding the CM's post to BJP nor said that he was staking claim to the top post, there has scarcely been any doubt about BJP cashing in on its fantastic poll returns to restore Fadnavis to the office he held between 2014-2019 and had looked set to retain until coalition partner Uddhav Thackeray dramatically broke away from the BJP-Sena coalition to forge the MVA combine comprising Congress and NCP.Asked if he was disappointed that he would not get a second term, Shinde said, ""There is no such thing. You must remember BJP supported my tenure as CM."" Asked who the deputy CMs would be in the new cabinet, he said, ""There is a meeting in Delhi tomorrow with Amit bhai (Shah) and all related decisions will be taken there."" Shinde said the power-sharing formula would be concluded after a meeting between him, Fadnavis and NCP's Ajit Pawar in New Delhi on Thursday.Reacting to Shinde's announcement, Fadnavis said, ""We have always been together. There are no differences in the Mahayuti. Even before the elections, I had said all decisions will be taken together. Today, Eknath Shinde has cleared all doubts. Soon, we shall sit with our leaders and take a decision.""It was not clear whether Shinde would agree to be deputy CM under Fadnavis. BJP, on its part, is expected to urge him to join Fadnavis govt by citing the need to project unity.In case he declines, there were indications of Sena nominating one of its three senior functionaries - Dada Bhuse, Sabhuraj Desai or Sanjay Shirsat.",Outgoing Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde on Wednesday said he would not be an obstacle to govt formation and would accept any decision taken by PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah.

The Dargah Khwaja Saheb committee, a statutory body constituted by the minority affairs ministry, is the third respondent in the case.Advocate Yogesh Suroliya, one of Hindu Sena's three counsels, said the legal team submitted to the court a copy of former judicial officer and academician Har Bilas Sarda's 1911 book 'Ajmer: Historical and Descriptive', which purportedly mentions that remnants from a ""pre-existing"" Shiva temple at the site were used in building the dargah. ""We informed the court that there were continuous religious rituals at the temple till it was razed,"" fellow advocate Ram Swaroop Bishnoi said.Vijay Sharma, the third counsel, sought a survey by ASI of the premises to verify the petitioner's contention that the dome of the dargah contains ""pieces of the temple"" and that ""there is evidence of the presence of a sanctum sanctorum in the basement"".The lawsuit is similar to the Gyanvapi case , involving multiple Hindu plaintiffs who contend that the mosque in UP's Varanasi was built over the remains of a destroyed temple. ASI hasalready conducted a court-ordered survey there. The Krishna Janmabhoomi litigation in Mathura is another one, pertaining to a dispute over the ownership of the land where the Shahi Idgah now stands.In the Ajmer dargah case, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta filed the petition in Sept but the initial hearing on the merit of the lawsuit was delayed because of a jurisdictional wrangle. The district and sessions judge then transferred the suit to the munsif court (west).The hearing was further delayed by the designated court asking for the petition in English to be translated into Hindi and submitted along with evidence and an affidavit.""The 38 pages of the lawsuit contain as many points of reference to show that aShiva temple pre-existed where the dargah is located,"" an advocate said. ""As in the Gyanvapi case, the Places of Worship Act, 1991, cannot be invoked to negate this suit.""Syed Sarwar Chishty, secretary of the Anjuman Moinia Fakhria, a body representing the dargah's hereditary caretakers, dismissed the Hindu side's arguments about the existence of a Shiva temple at the site of the Sufi shrine as baseless. ""These frivolous assertions are aimed at harming the country's communal harmony. The dargah is one of the most revered places for Muslims after Mecca and Medina. Such actions deeply hurt the sentiments of devotees worldwide,"" he said in a video-recorded statement.","A court in Rajasthan’s Ajmer issued notices Wednesday to the Union ministry of minority affairs and ASI on a lawsuit filed by a Hindu organisation laying claim to the site of the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.

Jadhav said they had intercourse after the man promised to marry her. Khare's wife had lodged extortion complaints against Jadhav.

NEW DELHI: India is learnt to have tested a nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), designed for a strike range of 3,500-km, from the newly commissioned nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat on Wednesday, reports Rajat Pandit.There was, however, no official word on the missile test that took place off Visakhapatnam in the Bay of Bengal in the morning. Sources said it was the solid-fuelled K-4 missile that was tested from the 6,000-tonne INS Arighaat. The K-4 has so far only been tested from submersible pontoons over the last several years.A detailed analysis of Wednesday's test results will show whether the missile firing was actually a success and met the laid down trial objectives and parameters, the sources added.A few days ago, India had issued a public area warning and notice to airmen (NOTAM) for an intermediate range missile test over a 3,490-km flight corridor in the Bay of Bengal between Nov 27 and 30.INS Arighaat, the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), was commissioned on Aug 29. The submarine can carry K-4 missiles, unlike her forerunner INS Arihant armed only with 750-km range K-15 missiles.India plans to induct the third SSBN, with a displacement of 7,000-tonne, as INS Aridhaman early next year.","There was, however, no official word on the missile test that took place off Visakhapatnam in the Bay of Bengal in the morning.

We don’t want one issue to disrupt Parliament. We must hold this government accountable for its multiple failures,” Dastidar said“We will take on the BJP, but our approach to doing so can be strategically different,” she added.The development comes in the wake of the TMC skipping an INDIA bloc meeting on Monday, where the alliance decided to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the Adani Group issues. The TMC also missed an opposition meeting on Wednesday aimed at discussing key matters for the ongoing session.Central funding issues, including the halting of Mngrega funds for West Bengal, remain the TMC's top priority, alongside concerns over price rise, unemployment, and fertilizer shortages, according to party sources cited by PTI.Despite being members of the INDIA bloc, the relationship between the TMC and Congress has often seen rough patches. From the TMC contesting Lok Sabha elections independently to disagreeing on seat sharing, the differences between the two parties have come up often, particularly after Congress's losses in Haryana and Maharashtra.After Congress’s unexpected defeat in Haryana in October, rift is at the forefront with several INDIA bloc partners, including AAP and Shiv Sena (UBT), hitting out at the party for ""arrogance"" and not keeping regional allies in the loop. ""Congress could not capitalise despite a favorable situation,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) had said after election results.""The biggest lesson here is to avoid overconfidence in elections,"" Arvind Kejriwal had said hitting out at Congress.Similarly, following Congress’s disappointing performance in Maharashtra, the TMC called for introspection and even suggested Mamata Banerjee as a potential leader for the INDIA bloc.""The Congress has failed to achieve the desired result either in Haryana or in Maharashtra.

Conversion for benefits 'undermines reservation policy'



'Fraud on the Constitution'



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that religious conversions undertaken purely to avail reservation benefits without genuine belief amount to a ""fraud on the Constitution."" The verdict, delivered by a bench comprising Justices Pankaj Mithal and R Mahadevan on Tuesday, upheld a Madras high court decision denying a scheduled caste (SC) certificate to a woman who converted to Christianity but later claimed to be a Hindu to avail quota benefits for securing employment.The case was filed by C Selvarani, who was born to a Hindu father and a Christian mother, and baptised as a Christian shortly after birth. Selvarani applied for an upper-division clerk position in Puducherry in 2015, seeking an SC certificate on the basis of her father's Valluvan caste, which is classified under scheduled castes.However, evidence presented to the court indicated that she regularly practiced Christianity and attended church services, sabotaging her claim of identifying as a Hindu.Justice Mahadevan, writing the 21-page verdict for the bench, pointed out that conversion to a religion must be inspired by its principles and tenets.""However, if the purpose of conversion is largely to derive the benefits of reservation but not with any actual belief in the other religion, the same cannot be permitted, as the extension of benefits of reservation to people with such ulterior motives will only defeat the social ethos of the policy of reservation,"" he noted.The top court highlighted that individuals who convert to Christianity lose their caste identity and must provide substantial evidence of reconversion and acceptance by their original caste community to reclaim SC status. In Selvarani's case, the bench found no credible proof of reconversion to Hinduism, such as public declarations, ceremonies, or documentation. On the contrary, her continued adherence to Christian practices invalidated her claim.The bench ruled that Selvarani’s claim to identify as a Hindu solely to access SC reservation benefits while actively practicing Christianity was untenable. The court held that granting her SC status would violate the spirit of reservation policies aimed at uplifting marginalised communities and ""would go against the very object of reservation and would amount to fraud on the Constitution"".""One converts to a different religion when genuinely inspired by its principles. Conversion purely for reservation benefits, devoid of belief, is impermissible,"" the bench added.The apex court also dismissed Selvarani's argument that her caste identity was merely in ""eclipse"" during her conversion to Christianity and would automatically resume upon reconversion to Hinduism.The judgment mentioned that such resumption requires clear and verifiable evidence of reconversion, which was absent in her case.""As the factum of reconversion is disputed, there must be more than a mere claim. The conversion had not happened by any ceremony or through 'Arya Samaj'. No public declaration was effected. There is nothing on record to show that she or her family has reconverted to Hinduism and on the contrary, there is a factual finding that the appellant still professes Christianity,"" it said.","Supreme Court rules that religious conversions undertaken purely to avail reservation benefits without genuine belief amount to a ""fraud on the Constitution"" The verdict was delivered by a bench comprising Justices Pankaj Mithal and R Mahadevan on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: After protests by opposition members on the panel, the Joint Parliamentary Committee scrutinising the Waqf (Amendment) Bill passed a resolution seeking extension of time for presentation of its report till the last day of the budget session next year.JPC chairperson and BJP member Jagdambika Pal will move a motion in LS on Thursday as per the business listed for the day to seek approval of the House for the extension.The JPC decided to move the resolution after a slugfest at Wednesday's meeting of the committee where opposition members stormed out alleging that its proceedings had become a ""mockery"". They, however, returned to attend the meeting after an hour amid indications that the chairperson would seek an extension in its term.Though the deferment marked a win for the opposition, it may also have helped push the likely debate and passage on the controversial bill closer to voting for Delhi polls likely to be scheduled in Feb.The budget session will be held from Feb 1. Thanks to the postponement, the two Houses may get to debate the bill just days ahead of the polls in Delhi, where properties handed over to the Waqf Board are set to be a key poll issue.BJP has said that the Congress-led UPA amended the Waqf Act in 2013 as part of its appeasement politics. In his celebratory speech on Nov 23 after the Maharashtra win, PM Narendra Modi had claimed that before Congress rule ended in 2014, the party handed over several properties near Delhi to the Waqf Board.""In its hunger for power, the Congress family has destroyed the Constitution's secular values,"" Modi had said, adding that Congress formed laws to promote appeasement politics and the Waqf Board was an example of it.Earlier in the day, Gaurav Gogoi of Congress, A Raja of DMK, Sanjay Singh of AAP and Kalyan Banerjee of TMC protested the conduct of Pal, alleging that he was keen to wrap up its proceedings by the Nov 29 deadline without completing due process.On Monday, which was the first day of winter session of Parliament, opposition MPs in JPC had met LS Speaker Om Birla and submitted a memorandum seeking extension of the deadline for the committee to submit its report.The bill seeks to amend the Waqf Act, 1995, to ensure more accountability and transparency in the functioning of Waqf Boards and also has provisions for mandatory inclusion of women in these bodies.","The Joint Parliamentary Committee scrutinising the Waqf (Amendment) Bill passed a resolution seeking extension of time for presentation of its report.

In our 'Cheetah State' Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno National Park, female cheetah Neerva has given birth to cubs. I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the forest workers involved in the conservation of the Cheetah Project.""Forest officials revealed that the cubs were found after a team monitoring Neerva’s movements detected that she had strayed away from her den. Upon inspection, the team found the mutilated remains of the cubs. “After checking all possible locations inside the boma, no further cubs were found,” the official stated. The cause of death remains unclear, as the carcasses of the cubs were sent for forensic analysis.Confusion had earlier surrounded the number of cubs Neerva had given birth to, as chief minister Yadav initially announced that four cubs had been born but later deleted the post, awaiting confirmation from the forest department.Neerva herself remains in good health, and all other adult cheetahs and 12 surviving cubs are reported to be in healthy condition. The investigation into the cubs' deaths is ongoing, with the forest department waiting for lab results to determine the exact cause of their demise.The birth of the cubs marked a significant moment in India's Cheetah Reintroduction Project, which began in 2022. Cheetahs, once extinct in India, were brought from Namibia and South Africa under the project. Despite facing challenges, including the deaths of eight adult cheetahs, the project has seen breeding success, with 17 cubs born and 12 surviving. This brings the current cheetah population in Kuno National Park to 24, signaling progress in restoring the species to India.(With inputs from agencies)","Two cubs born to cheetah Neerva at Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno National Park were found dead on Wednesday.

'Will abide by BJP decision': Has Eknath Shinde set the stage for 'Maha' role reversal with Fadnavis?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-abide-by-bjp-decision-has-eknath-shinde-set-the-stage-for-maha-role-reversal-with-fadnavis/articleshow/115740969.cms,"NEW DELHI: Has the stage been set for reversal of roles between BJP 's Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena's Eknath Shinde in Maharashtra? Well, caretaker chief minister Shinde on Wednesday dropped enough hints about a change of guard in Mahayuti even though he did not say that in as many words. Shinde on Wednesday addressed a press conference to announce that ""he is not an obstacle in formation of new government"" and he will ""abide by the decision of Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah on the CM pick.""""You (PM Modi) are the head of our family. The way people of BJP accept your decision, we will also accept your decision in the same way. I made a phone call to PM Modi and HM Amit Shah yesterday and told them that there will be no problem in forming the government because of me,"" Shinde said.Shinde's remarks come amid strong posturing and a concerted campaign by his party Shiv Sena for continuity in Mahayuti's leadership citing the Bihar model of Nitish Kumar. Shiv Sena leaders have demanded second term for Shinde crediting his governance for the coalition's massive win in the assembly elections.Devendra Fadnavis, who is likely to return as chief minister of the state - assuming the BJP top brass has no surprises up its sleeve, is already in the national capital ahead of a crucial meet of the Mahayuti allies with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday. When asked about the CM pick, Fadnavis said: ""The answer to this will be given soon. All senior members of the three parties of Mahayuti will together take decision on this. Shinde has cleared the apprehensions which some leaders had.""While Shinde asserted that he had no ambition for the chief minister's post, he did not miss to highlight his hard work and achievements of his short tenure.""My tenure was just 2.5 years, but I think the work done by my government is of 10 years. All the decisions taken by Mahayuti government were historic,"" Shinde said and added ""I worked tirelessly day and night as a common party worker for the development of Maharashtra. I did not take even a day's holiday.""The caretaker chief minister also spoke at length about his humble origins and claimed that for him the full form of CM was common man and not chief minister. ""I am a farmer's son and I come from a poor family. I have always remembered my humble origins so that I could work for every common man of the state. People who come from rich families can never understand the pain of the common man,"" Shinde said.He then went on to talk about the Ladaki Bahin Yojna, which many experts feel was a gamechanger, and said for him the tag of ""Ladka Bhai"" is more important than any other designation. Shinde also invoked Balasaheb Thackeray and thanked PM Modi and Amit Shah for making Balasaheb's dream of a Sainik CM in Maharashtra a reality.Shinde seems to have reconciled to the turn of events. The BJP has 132 MLAs in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly - this is just 12 short of the half way mark. What's more, Ajit Pawar 's NCP - the third ally of the Mahayuti, would perhaps be happier with BJP at the helm than Shinde Sena.Little wonder, Sena functionary Ramdas Kadam made a candid admission about Ajit Pawar factor when he said that because of NCP, Sena's bargaining power to claim the CM's post had reduced in the Mahayuti.In 2022, when Shinde did not expect the top post, the BJP surprised him. Now, when he feels that he has contributed to coalition's victory and deserves a second term, the numbers are not in his favour.Ajit Pawar has confirmed that the meeting of Mahayuti leaders tomorrow in the national capital is likely to endorse the continuation of the same model - chief minister with two deputies.""All three of us (Devendra Fadnavis, Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar) are coming to Delhi tomorrow. Further discussions will be held there. Discussions on the formation of the government with a CM and two deputy CMs will be held,"" Pawar said.",Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena's Eknath Shinde are likely to return as chief minister of Maharashtra. FadNavis is already in the national capital ahead of a crucial meet of Mahayuti allies with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115741537,imgsize-755722,width-400,resizemode-4/115741537.jpg"

They demanded an extension for more comprehensive discussions.Gogoi said after the walkout that Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had previously indicated that the committee might be granted an extension. However, he alleged that the chairman appeared to be under pressure from a senior government minister to push through the proceedings by the November 29 deadline.TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee also voiced his concerns, claiming that the chairman had failed to engage with opposition members or invite key witnesses.

NEW DELHI: The measure of hunger used in the Global Hunger Report-2024 index is ""flawed"" and doesn't reflect India's true position, govt told LS on Wednesday, while asserting it is making serious efforts to address the issue of malnutrition.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday disapproved of an order passed by a Delhi trial court asking the Enforcement Directorate director to instruct its counsel not to oppose the bail plea of an accused in a case where trial was delayed because of the agency and asked ED to place the order on record.The apex court called the order ""drastic"".The trial court passed the order earlier in the day while granting bail to an accused in the Delhi Waqf Board money laundering case in which AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan is the main accused.Within hours, additional solicitor general S V Raju brought the matter to the apex court's notice while it was hearing the bail plea of another accused in the same case.Raju told the bench that the presiding judge of the trial court had said in the open court that ""he would teach a lesson to ED"".Taking note of the direction given to the ED director not to oppose bail pleas, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said, ""This is very drastic.""The justices asked Raju to place on record the Delhi court's order and said they would examine it. As the money laundering case is pending in Supreme Court, the bench said it would take cognisance of the trial court's order.The Supreme Court has held in various rulings that delay in trial and long incarceration of accused persons could be ground to grant bail in money laundering cases. Accordingly, trial courts have started giving bail to accused which was earlier denied because of stringent bail conditions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.Earlier in the day, the trial court rejected Enforcement Directorate's contention that a lower court could not grant bail to an accused in the waqf board money laundering case on the ground of delay in trial and long incarceration. The court told the ED director to issue ""appropriate instructions"" to the special public prosecutors representing the agency. Special judge Jitendra Singh instructed ED not to oppose the bail plea where the delay in trial was due to the agency's conduct.The court then granted bail to Kausar Imam Siddiqui, stating that there was not even the remotest possibility of the trial concluding soon.Siddiqui had moved for bail citing long incarceration and also seeking parity with another accused who had got bail on the same grounds from the high court on Nov 13.The agency had opposed the bail to Siddiqui.Rejecting the ED's plea, the trial court said that it was bound to follow the apex court's ruling and it was its duty bound to protect and enforce constitutional rights.The court said the right to a speedy trial was one of the most important facets of Article 21, and it lay in the exclusive domain of trial courts. All courts, including the trial courts, are mandated to adhere to, protect and enforce constitutional rights and constitutionalism per se, the lower court said. ""In fact, duty is cast upon the trial court to see that the constitutional rights of individuals are not violated,"" the court said.The court also noted that Siddiqui was in judicial custody since Nov 24, 2023.Referring to the case of Manish Sisodia and various others, the court added that if a person accused under PMLA was incarcerated for too long without the remote possibility of trial concluding soon, he may be released on bail, even if the twin conditions in Section 45 (1) of the PMLA are not met.According to Section 45 of the PMLA, bail can be granted to an accused in a money laundering case only if twin conditions are satisfied.First, there should be prima facie satisfaction that the accused has not committed the offence. Second, that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.The allegation against Siddiqui is that he acted as a middleman on behalf of Amanatullah Khan for the purchase of property in Jamia Nagar in which the proceeds of crime were used.The judge added that the ED had an opportunity to admit its responsibility but had opted to oppose the bail with full vigour and vehemence, which was nothing short of defiance of the mandate of the Supreme Court.","A Delhi trial court asked the Enforcement Directorate director to instruct its counsel not to oppose the bail plea of an accused in a case where trial was delayed because of the agency.

NEW DELHI: Parliament failed to transact any significant business on the third day of the winter session on Wednesday due to protests and sloganeering by opposition members who demanded discussions on different issues, including allegations of irregularities against Adani Group and violence in Sambhal and Manipur, in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Both the Houses were adjourned once in the morning and later for the day amid continuing uproar.The Lower House could not transact any business except taking up one question during Question Hour amid the din and laying a few official papers and approving a couple of routine motions. At one point, opposition members trooped into the well of the LS raising slogans.The furore in the Upper House started after Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar rejected 18 notices under a rule to suspend scheduled business to take up issues. It first resulted in a brief adjournment.Only Congress members demanded a discussion under Rule 267 after suspension of House business, on setting up a joint parliamentary committee to probe allegations against Adani Group, while other opposition parties gave similar notices on different issues, including on violence in Manipur and UP's Sambhal. AAP MP Sanjay Singh wanted a discussion on rising crime in Delhi.Since the ruckus continued in the House after it reassembled at 11.30am, the Chairman adjourned the proceedings for the day, saying the ""House is not in order"".Meanwhile, in the business advisory committee, leader of Upper House, J P Nadda, and Dhankhar agreed to have a two-day special debate on the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution.",Both the Houses were adjourned once in the morning and later for the day amid continuing uproar.

ED raises issue of 'non-cooperation and delaying tactics' by accused during trials

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would direct persons accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to give an undertaking that they would not seek adjournments as a condition to grant them bail, in order to ensure they do not misuse the liberty by resorting to delaying tactics in trial proceedings by seeking repeated adjournments, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said a balance has to be maintained between the interests of the accused and the prosecuting agency and to prevent delay in trial which is itself a ground for granting bail.The order which will have a bearing on PMLA cases involving politicians and high-profile figures facing money laundering charges was welcomed by officials in the ED, which has complained that influential accused have been hindering trial by seeking repeated adjournments.The bench was hearing a bail plea of Zeeshan Haider, who is one of the accused in the Delhi Waqf money laundering case, which has AAP leader Amanatullah Khan as the main accused. Justices Oka and Masih directed Haider to first give personal undertaking that he would not seek any adjournment when the case is taken up by trial court for framing of charges and in subsequent proceedings.Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri, appearing for the accused, told the bench that his client had been in custody for more than a year and trial had not yet been initiated. Invoking the apex court's ruling that delay in trial and long incarceration could be a ground for granting bail in money laundering cases, he submitted that Haider should also be released on that ground.The bench indicated that it was in favour of granting him bail but said that he had to first give personal undertaking and had to file an affidavit stating on oath that he would not seek adjournment in trial proceedings. It posted the case for hearing to Dec 3 and directed him to file undertaking before it.As accused are now being granted bail more frequently after the apex court's various rulings, the ED has raised the issue of non-cooperation and delaying tactics by the accused in trial proceedings. Addressing the agency's concerns, the court said an undertaking by the accused could go a long way in ensuring speedy and timely completion of trial.Earlier, the court had expressed concern over the way in which the PMLA law is being implemented and made it clear that any high handedness in action against the accused in violation of the fundamental rights would not be allowed and reminded the agency that the accused also have right to liberty. ""They (ED officers) should remember that there is something called Article 21 in the country (which guarantees right to life and liberty),"" it had observed.The Rouse Avenue Court in Delhi had earlier granted bail to AAP MLA Khan, chairman of Delhi Waqf Board, in the money laundering case and declined to take cognisance of the ED's supplementary chargesheet, stating that the necessary sanction to prosecute him was not obtained.","The order will have a bearing on PMLA cases involving politicians and high- profile figures facing money laundering charges. The bench was hearing a bail plea of Zeeshan Haider, one of the accused in the Delhi Waqf money laundering case, which has AAP leader Amanatullah Khan as the main accused.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115746187,imgsize-1482284,width-400,resizemode-4/115746187.jpg"

'Radical group': Bangladesh mulls plea to ban Iskcon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/radical-group-bangladesh-mulls-plea-to-ban-iskcon/articleshow/115745154.cms,"DHAKA: A day after violence clashes in Chittagong, which saw groups of Muslims beating up Hindus protesting the arrest of Iskcon priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari , the Bangladesh govt aligned itself with the demand to take action against the group of devotees of Lord Krishna.""The concerns raised by a (Supreme Court) lawyer represent the sentiments of 180 million people of Bangladesh. This is a regrettable incident, a criminal offense, and the govt is treating it seriously, with plans for appropriate legal action,"" attorney general Md Asaduzzaman said on Wednesday when the high court asked him to spell out the govt's stand on SC lawyer Moniuzzaman's demand to ban Iskcon.However, the AG, representing the interim regime backed by Muhammad Yunus, stopped short of backing the lawyer's demand. ""We must consider the constitutional implications before taking any decision. That is why I believe it is premature. Let us see how the govt addresses this issue,"" the attorney general said.His statement in the court acquires significance in view of New Delhi's strong statement protesting the arrest of the Iskcon priest when those responsible for attacks on Hindus and other minorities were roaming free.The lawyer, who cited newspaper reports to dub Iskcon a radical fundamentalist organisation, got the backing of powerful student groups whose protests forced former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and take refuge in India.Student leaders Hasnat Abdullah and Sarjis Alam demanded an ""immediate ban"" on Iskcon, accusing the organization of creating unrest in the country. Describing the organization as ""extremist"", Abdullah accused Iskcon of involvement in the brutal killing of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif during a protest rally in Chittagong on Wednesday. ""We demand an immediate ban on Iskcon,"" he said.The rally organised in solidarity with the jailed Iskcon leader triggered violence which saw groups of Muslims joining forces with police to beat up Hindu protesters.Alam said ordinary Sanatanis in the country are peace-loving, but Iskcon, allegedly acting as an agent of the Hasina govt, is trying to destabilise the nation. ""We will not let that happen as long as we are alive,"" he said.Chinmoy Krishna, who emerged as the voice of protests against the systematic targeting of Hindus and other minorities post the regime change in Dhaka in August, has denied the charge of sedition slapped on him by authorities for allegedly bringing down Bangladesh's national flag and hoisting a saffron flag in its place.","Bangladesh govt aligns itself with demand to take action against group of devotees of Lord Krishna.

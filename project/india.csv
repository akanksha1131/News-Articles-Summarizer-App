"‘It was Indian military action’: Jaishankar denies US role in ceasefire with Pakistan, says 'draw your conclusions' on China link",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-was-indian-military-action-jaishankar-denies-us-role-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan-says-draw-you-conclusions-on-china-link/articleshow/121423798.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has firmly rejected claims that the United States played a decisive role in brokering the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan, asserting instead that it was India’s military response that forced Islamabad to halt hostilities. In an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jaishankar also raised concerns over Pakistan’s close defence ties with China, encouraging observers to ""draw your own conclusions.""“The cessation of firing was agreed between the military commanders of both sides through direct contact,” Jaishankar said. “The morning before, we effectively hit and incapacitated Pakistan's main airbases and air defence system. So who should I thank for the cessation of hostilities? I thank the Indian military because it was the Indian military action that made Pakistan say: We are ready to stop.”Pushing back against suggestions that the standoff during Operation Sindoor brought the nuclear-armed neighbours close to atomic conflict, Jaishankar called such claims baseless and alarmist.“Very, very far away. I’m frankly astonished by your question,” he said when asked how close the world was to nuclear war.“We had terrorist targets. Those were very measured, carefully considered and non-escalating steps. After that, the Pakistani military opened fire on us. We were able to show them that we could disable their air defence systems. Then the firing stopped at their request.”He criticised what he called the West’s persistent tendency to frame South Asian conflicts as potential nuclear flashpoints. “Anything that happens in South Asia is promptly linked to a nuclear crisis by the West,” he said, calling the narrative “disturbing” and warning that it inadvertently “encourages terrible activities like terrorism.”On Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism, Jaishankar said: “Anyone who is not blind can see that the terrorist organisations are openly operating from the cities and towns of Pakistan... In Pakistan, terrorism is a very open business. A business that is supported, financed, organised and used by the state. And by their military.”When asked about China's involvement in the India-Pakistan dynamic, Jaishankar pointed to Islamabad’s defence dependency on Beijing. “Many of the weapons systems that Pakistan has are of Chinese origin and the two countries are very close. You can draw your own conclusions from that,” he said.Jaishankar’s remarks were part of a wide-ranging conversation on India’s evolving foreign policy, its relationship with Germany and the European Union, and its longstanding strategic partnership with Russia. Defending New Delhi’s ties with Moscow, he criticised what he described as European double standards.“You sound as if you can do business with states that are different, but we cannot... My neighbour Pakistan has caused every conceivable problem under the sun... But doesn't Germany also do business with Pakistan?” he asked.On Europe’s changing approach to global affairs, Jaishankar said the continent was beginning to move away from the assumption that its concerns automatically translate into global priorities. “I see big changes in Europe and Europe’s thinking... that it feels it should be more independent and more resilient,” he said.He welcomed Germany’s increasing role in global security, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, and expressed hope for stronger India-Germany defence cooperation. However, he acknowledged that “the conditions are not yet perfect” and India continues to press for deeper technological collaboration.Regarding the long-pending India-EU Free Trade Agreement, Jaishankar struck an optimistic tone. “Prime Minister Modi and EU Commission President von der Leyen have made it clear that the project should be completed by the end of the year... The agreement has strategic importance.”He also expressed confidence in Germany’s growing engagement with the Indo-Pacific and its understanding of India’s concerns over China. “When I look at Germany ten years ago, I see an enormous evolution... I see much stronger prospects for our partnership,” he said.","S Jaishankar rejects claims that the United States played a decisive role in brokering the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

Pakistan was told of Operation Sindoor after May 7 strikes: EAM Jaishankar to parliament panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-was-told-of-operation-sindoor-after-may-7-strikes-eam-jaishankar-to-parliament-panel/articleshow/121423489.cms,"EAM on info-share row: Never used word 'before'

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar Monday termed LoP Rahul Gandhi 's charge that Pakistan was told of Operation Sindoor in advance ""utter misrepresentation of facts and events"" that amounted to questioning the version of the armed forces.Briefing members of Parliament's consultative panel on external affairs, Jaishankar cited press briefings to say that armed forces had clearly stated that Pakistan was informed about Op Sindoor only after nine terror bases had been destroyed; a reference to the press briefing by DGMO Lt General Rajiv Ghai, who had said Pakistan was informed after India had struck the targets.Some reports said Jaishankar had informed Pakistan about the strikes 30 minutes after they commenced but this could not be confirmed.Sources said Jaishankar dismissed talk of US ""interference"", saying the decision to halt military operations was made bilaterally following a request from Pakistan, and on a ""you shoot, we shoot; you stop, we stop"" understanding.Jaishankar also said govt had responded to the US's suggestion that it engage with Pakistan by making it clear that ""terror and talks cannot coexist"".Rahul Gandhi has alleged that Jaishankar said he informed Pakistan ahead of the Indian strikes on terror targets and this made him an informant of Pakistan. ""I never used the word 'before' while talking about information sharing with Pakistan,"" a source quoted the minister as telling members of the parliamentary committee.Jaishankar never personally spoke with Pakistani officials and emphasised that India's DGMO notified Pakistan about the strikes on terror camps only after they were executed. The minister asserted the importance of unity at this juncture and said the govt needed the support of all. He also told members to reach out to him for any clarifications and not go by the media, sources said.Sources confirmed that the DGMO was the only line of communication with Pakistan during the conflict.Jaishankar said India had made it plain that it was prepared to counter any escalation, in what appeared to be a reference to PM Narendra Modi's response to US vice president J D Vance when the latter called on the night of May 9 to convey Pakistan's preparation for a massive retaliation.He told members that developments were in the works as far as the Indus Waters Treaty issue was concerned and the govt would share that with the committee when things materialised.He was asked to take measures to address the concerns of Punjab where young lives are being lost to narcotics terrorism. He heard the concerns and assured members that these would be discussed and addressed.He also addressed the geopolitical alignments that surfaced during the standoff. ""Only Turkiye and Azerbaijan stood openly with Pakistan,"" he told the committee.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri presented details of Operation Sindoor to the MPs, while Jaishankar addressed their queries.","S Jaishankar calls Rahul Gandhi's charge that Pakistan was told of Operation Sindoor in advance ""utter misrepresentation of facts and events"" He tells members of Parliament's consultative panel on external affairs: ""I never used the word 'before' while talking about information sharing with Pakistan""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121423568,imgsize-431889,width-400,resizemode-4/121423568.jpg"

In an interview in Germany, during his three-nation trip to Europe last week, the minister also said anyone who is not blind can see that terrorist organisations are openly operating from the cities and towns of Pakistan.""That is no secret. The UN Security Council terror list is full of Pakistani names and places, and these are the very places we have targeted. So please don't think that something is only going on behind the scenes,"" he said.Jaishankar also said all the focus on the nuclear-weapon issue between India and Pakistan was only encouraging terrorism, adding that at no point was a nuclear level reached during the recent India-Pakistan military conflict. ""There is a narrative as if everything that happens in our part of the world leads directly to a nuclear problem. That disturbs me a lot because it encourages terrible activities like terrorism. If anything, much more is happening with the nuclear issue in your part of the world,"" said the minister, adding that India sent a clear signal to the terrorists through Operation Sindoor that there is a price to be paid for carrying out Pahalgam-like attacks.""The firing was then started by the Pakistani military. We fired back in self-defence and once the Pakistanis understood that they were taking a harmful course, we were able to stop firing. This situation has not changed for two weeks, that is the status,"" he said. Asked about the role played by the US in reaching the ""ceasefire"", Jaishankar said only the Indian military can be thanked for it. ""I thank the Indian military because it was the Indian military action that made Pakistan say: We are ready to stop,"" he said.Asked about the differences between India and Germany over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's ties with Moscow, the minister said relationships do not develop because one partner simply adopts the concerns of the other as their own. ""Relationships are built on finding common ground. For you in Europe, other concerns and worries are important than for me in Asia. When you think of conflict, you think of Ukraine. When I think of conflict, I think of Pakistan, terrorism, China and our borders. Our perspective cannot be the same,'' he said.","In Pakistan, terrorism is a very open business that is supported, financed, organised and used by the State and by the military, says foreign minister.

More strategy, less struggle

A balanced learner, A humble mind

Lessons beyond the classroom

Advice that breaks the mold



Eyes on the stars, feet on the ground

The academic world constantly flaunts “quantity” and the number of hours studied ostentatiously. But here’s a topper who stole the spotlight not only for his exceptional performance in the CBSE Class 10 board exams, but also for his not-so-followed study strategy. Meet Rudra Pratap Singh , a student of Stone Ridge International School, Rudrapur, who secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams. His secret to success? Consistency and smart work. Shattering all the age-old adages that equate long hours with high scores, Rudra said: “I studied for just two hours a day.”At first glance, Rudra’s story seems like one of prodigious intellect. But a deeper conversation reveals something more universal and profoundly human—a story of clarity, self-discipline, and purpose-driven learning, all while shouldering responsibilities that transcend far beyond textbooks.From training with NASA and ISRO under their Young Scientist and Citizen Science programmes to interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during government-led youth initiatives, Rudra’s resume reads like a page out of an adult professional’s LinkedIn profile.“I’ve worked with the Ministry of Youth Affairs for programmes like Viksit Bharat and Leaders Dialogue,” he said. He also holds certifications in astrophysics from IIT Kanpur and IIT Bhubaneswar, and serves as a Brand Ambassador for KIIT University, Russia.At such a young age, Singh has earmarked his name as the world record-holding author, certified by the World Record Committee (USA) as the youngest writer of juvenile fiction. He perceives this as part of a larger mission. “I’m advocating for youth welfare, teen upliftment, and mental health activism,” he says with the composure of someone twice his age.So what is the secret behind a teenager with international commitments and so many other feathers in his cap finding time to top the board exams?It isn’t something very typical, nor something entirely different, Rudra says—“just prioritisation and consistency.”He didn't believe in marathon study sessions. “Quality over quantity—I never went beyond two hours a day. But I made sure those two hours were fully focused. I broke large tasks into smaller ones and checked them off daily.”Rudra admits to feeling demotivated several times during the journey. “Sometimes I wondered if two hours were enough,” he said. “But then my inner voice reminded me—you’ve made a promise to yourself and to the people who believe in you. That belief became my fuel.”Rudra’s love for learning isn’t confined to math or science. “I’ve always loved social sciences,” he said. His interests in geopolitics and climate science saw him working with Oxford Academy and participating in the UN Climate Science Olympiad. He’s also been a member of the United Nations World Parliament.He allocated separate time for each subject. “I gave 45 minutes each to English, Hindi, and Social Science, and a bit more to Mathematics because solving problems requires practice,” Rudra says. He made sure he was gaining conceptual clarity in every subject.Like every success story, Rudra’s too has its cornerstone. “My family, my teachers, and the environment around me,” he says without a pause. “There were times when my parents believed in me more than I believed in myself.”He credits his online mentors at PhysicsWallah for helping him build strong conceptual clarity and appreciates the flexibility that digital learning offers. “When we study online, we must show our face to the teacher—not just out of respect, but to stay accountable to ourselves.”For someone his age, Rudra is remarkably self-aware. “Motivation is temporary, but when discipline becomes your motivation, it stays.”Rudra’s message to juniors is both enriching and grounded in experience. “People told me, ‘To top CBSE, you have to study more.’ I wanted to prove them wrong—that even with just two hours of focused study a day, it’s possible. And I did.”But here’s the catch: “It only works if you’re consistent, humble, and willing to learn from others. Don’t be overconfident. Learn from your mistakes—and better still, from others’.”He also doesn’t shy away from acknowledging the pressure that comes with expectations. “In some internal exams, I missed two or three questions. It shook me. But I adapted—reduced my time on social media, focused on weak spots, and reminded myself why I began.”Currently in Class 11, Rudra is focused on the PCM stream, but his ambitions are far broader than just cracking an entrance exam. Whether it’s working with ISRO again, continuing his writing, or influencing youth policies, Rudra sees learning as a lifelong journey, not a series of marksheets.And as he moves forward, the lesson he leaves behind is a compelling one—you don’t need long hours, you need deep intent.In an age where academic excellence is too often equated with burnout, Thakur Rudra Pratap Singh stands as proof that with purpose, even two hours a day is enough to chase the stars—and catch them.",Rudra Pratap Singh secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams.

'Delulu Land PM...': Pakistan Frames Its Fakery; Passes Off Chinese Drill Pic As India Strike

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army on Monday released a photo of the operations room from the night Operation Sindoor was under way against terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) on May 7.In the photo, top military brass, including Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi and Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, could be seen monitoring the operation.Under 'Operation Sindoor', the Indian Army targeted nine terror hideouts belonging to banned organisations Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and PoJK.The strategic operation involved striking four locations within Pakistan's territory, while other five targets were situated in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The military strikes were carried out two weeks after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives.'Operation Sindoor' was executed through coordinated efforts of the Army, Navy and Air Force, conducted from Indian territory. The defence ministry described the operation as ""focused, measured and non-escalatory"", deliberately avoiding Pakistani military installations.On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated that Operation Sindoor should not be treated as a one-off initiative and civil defence preparedness must be institutionalised by the states.During the Governing Council meeting of Niti Ayog, PM Modi said that the states must modernise their approach to civil preparedness. He also added that the recent mock drills have reignited our attention to civil defence states should institutionalize Civil Defence preparedness.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday chaired a meeting of the Consultative Committee of Parliament on External Affairs to discuss cross-border terrorism and the military strikes carried out under Operation Sindoor.The meeting addressed concerns raised by the opposition and shed light on diplomatic, military and international aspects of the operation.According to ANI sources, the panel was briefed that the government deliberately chose high-value terror targets early to deliver a strong message and expose the inability of Pakistani forces to protect the epicentres of terrorism. The strikes, officials said, had a major psychological impact on the Pakistani military. The EAM also highlighted India’s diplomatic strategy.Following Operation Sindoor, the Modi government deployed seven multi-party delegations across capitals to convey India’s zero-tolerance approach to terrorism. Most countries welcomed India’s action, with only Turkey, China, and Azerbaijan withholding support.","The Indian Army on Monday released a photo of the operations room from the night Operation Sindoor was under way against terrorist camps.

Else, the perpetrators will have to face consequences,"" Shah said.Condemning the Pahalgam terror attack as a cowardly act by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, Shah recalled Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s firm stance in Patna following the incident.""Pakistan forgot that 11 years ago, there was a Congress government, which has now changed. We responded to the Uri, Pulwana and Pahalgham strikes and struck terror bases,"" he said.Highlighting the swiftness of India’s counter-offensive, Shah noted that nine terror camps were taken out in just 22 minutes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. He added that India’s air defence system successfully intercepted all incoming Pakistani missiles and drones, preventing any damage to Indian territory.On May 9, the Indian armed forces neutralised Pakistan’s air defence system, Shah said.""Modiji has declared that there would be retaliation if the blood of innocent Indian civilians is shed.

NEW DELHI: In a temporary reprieve for Turkish aviation firm Celebi, the Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services at the city's international airport.The interim order was passed by Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan, who said that no conclusive steps should be taken on the tenders until Celebi’s petitions are heard after the court’s summer recess in June, reported news agency PTI.The legal dispute stems from the recent revocation of security clearance for Celebi Airport Services India, a subsidiary of Turkey-based Celebi, by India’s Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). The security clearance was rescinded earlier this month, citing national security concerns, prompting airports across the country to terminate contracts with Celebi’s Indian affiliates.The move followed diplomatic tensions after Turkey expressed support for Pakistan during India’s Operation Sindoor, a military offensive conducted in response to cross-border terrorism. In the aftermath, Celebi’s Indian operations, including those at key airports like Mumbai and Delhi, came under scrutiny.In Mumbai, Celebi Nas Airport Services India, which handles bridge and ground services, filed three separate petitions challenging both the BCAS's decision and MIAL’s termination of contracts. The company contended that the government’s actions were arbitrary and legally unsustainable. Celebi holds a 59 per cent stake in the joint venture operating at the Mumbai airport.The petitions request the high court to annul the BCAS’s order cancelling its security clearance and to reverse MIAL’s termination of key agreements, including the Bridge Mounted Equipment Service Agreement, Ground Handling Services contract, and the Concession Agreement. The firm also asked the court to suspend the tender process initiated by MIAL on May 17 for selecting a replacement agency.Meanwhile, two other group companies, Celebi Airport Services India and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India, have approached the Delhi high court seeking similar relief following cancellation of their airport contracts in the capital.","The Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services.

DGCA gives nod to Class 12 arts & commerce students becoming commercial pilots in India; seeks ministry approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-gives-nod-to-class-12-arts-commerce-students-becoming-commercial-pilots-in-india-seeks-ministry-approval/articleshow/121397712.cms,"Poll Should the DGCA further relax educational requirements for other aviation roles? Yes, it should promote inclusivity. No, maintain current standards.

NEW DELHI: In a major reform, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has given its nod to changing the educational requirements for becoming a commercial pilot in India by proposing to allow class 12 pass outs from arts and commerce streams to also pursue this course. And no longer limit commercial pilot licence (CPL) training to science students alone, as it has been for almost three decades now.The regulator has sent its recommendation to the Union aviation ministry, which after finalising the amendment, will send the same to the law ministry. That ministry is to notify changes in the current rules which, as of now, require a student to mandatorily have physics and maths in class 12 for CPL training. Once cleared, all class 12 pass outs — subject to clearing medical fitness and other tests — will be eligible to become commercial pilots in India.“The DGCA recommendation has been sent to the aviation ministry. Once they finalise it, this ministry will send in to the law ministry to notify the change. When that happens, the change will come into effect,” said a senior official. TOI had first reported the move to allow arts and commerce students to do CPL training in India on April 18, 2025.Since mid 1990s, CPL training in India is open only for science & maths students. Before that, 10th pass (matric) was the only educational requirement for doing CPL here. Senior captains say no country other than India has this requirement. They term it an archaic requirement that needs to go as the level of physics and maths knowledge required by pilots is imparted in junior classes itself. Over the last 30 years, many arts and commerce students were forced to give Class 12 exam for physics and maths from open school to be eligible for CPL training.Aware of the likely spurt in number of students opting for CPL training once this rule is amended, aviation authorities have already started work on improving flying schools in India. The long time for CPL flying along with questionable safety and training standards of many flying schools in India forces a large number of students to head abroad every year to pursue this expensive course.DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai on May 16 directed all flying schools in the country to “maintain a dedicated website for their organisation” which must have updated information regarding several parameters that include, among other things, the minimum and maximum time taken to complete 200 hours of flying; number of aircraft, instructors, designated examiners, availability of ground school & simulator. DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai wants to bring in transparency about flying training organisation (FTOs) so that the information being in public domain based on which students will choose them will make them competitive, safer and student-friendly.On their part, FTOs point out a number of things that DGCA must do to make flying training less painful in India. Becoming a pilot in India is anything but easy — right from training stage to eventually getting a job. Most student pilots come from middle-class families who have taken big loans to give wings to their children’s dreams.Senior pilots have a word of caution for all aspiring aviators. “Even after the expensive CPL traning and endorsement, getting a job can take a long time. If you are planning to become a pilot, the entire family must factor in the financial aspect and the time lag in getting a job after the entire training is complete. The reality is not as rosy as it seems for wannabe pilots.” they caution.","Since mid 1990s, CPL training in India is open only for science & maths students.

BHUBANESWAR: Odisha govt has decided to secure trademark rights for several words and phrases associated with Jagannath Temple in Puri.The decision comes in the wake of a recent controversy over the naming of a newly built temple in Bengal's Digha as 'Jagannath dham'. Odisha objected to the use of the word 'dham', arguing that 'Jagannath dham' refers exclusively to the Puri shrine - one of India's four sacred 'dhams' - and its use elsewhere diluted its religious and cultural significance.""The terms sought to be shielded include 'Jagannath dham', 'shree mandira', 'Purushottam kshetra', 'neelachal dham', 'bada danda', 'mahaprasad' and 'neela chakra',"" Arabinda Padhee, chief administrator of Shree Jagannath Temple Administration, said.The final list of words is being finalised.

""We support new Jagannath temples worldwide, provided they adhere to the main temple's traditions and culture,"" he said.","Odisha govt has decided to secure trademark rights for several words and phrases associated with Jagannath Temple in Puri.

On May 14, she left her son in a lodge near Hundermaan, a frontier Kargil village, and asked him to wait there till she returned.After villagers informed the police about the stranded boy, he was put in the care of the Kargil Child Welfare Committee.Punjab Police said that although Pakistan Rangers decided not to detain Sunita further, her statements had raised suspicion of a motive that goes beyond meeting an online acquaintance in Pakistan.While Sunita maintained she travelled to Pakistan only to meet the person she was seemingly besotted with, the former nurse couldn't explain how she dodged security amid India-Pakistan hostilities to cross the LoC undetected.Initial findings suggest she traversed unfamiliar mountainous terrain to meet two Pakistani contacts - a man named Zulfikar and the unidentified ""pastor"". Sources in Nagpur Police said that security agencies found in her phone messages hinting at ties that may extend beyond a personal relationship.When she was first stopped at Attari while trying to enter Pakistan in March, the authorities let her off thinking she had a mental health problem. This time, officials suggested, they had enough reason to invoke the stringent Official Secrets Act against her.Nagpur zonal DCP Niketan Kadam said a team from Kapil Nagar police station would bring Sunita back to the city for a thorough probe into her background and possible motive.Kargil Child Welfare Committee chairperson Niyaz Ali said that the Ladakh administration had given it permission to escort Sunita's son back to Nagpur.","Sunita Bholeshwar Jamgade had previously made two unsuccessful attempts to enter Pakistan through Attari.

Basavaraju's death due to 'betrayal' by some in core formations: Naxals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/basavarajus-death-due-to-betrayal-by-some-in-core-formations-naxals/articleshow/121422461.cms,"Cops deny Reds' claim Basavaraju was caught alive

NEW DELHI: CPI (Maoist) blamed the death of its chief Basavaraju on betrayal by some within its 'core' Naxal formations active in the Maad area, including the PLGA Company No. 7 that was tasked with his proximate security cover.The statement holding ""compromised elements within"" accountable for the killing of Basavaraju in Narayanpur, issued via its Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), came even as the Chhattisgarh Police conducted the last rites of the CPI(Maoist) general secretary and seven others on Monday in Narayanpur, citing the ""lack of any clear legal claimant"" to their bodies.CPI(Maoist) also admitted that 28, and not 27, ""comrades"" were killed in the operation, and pointed out mistakes in identification of two slain Maoists by police.TOI had exclusively reported on Monday that the Chhattisgarh Police was not keen to hand over Basavaraju's body to his kin or acquaintances for last rites in Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh, fearing that a public funeral would glorify the mastermind behind the killing of hundreds of civilians and security personnel.The bodies of the remaining 19 Maoists killed in the May 21 operation by the District Reserve Guard wing of the Chhattisgarh Police were, however, handed over to their family members.The DKSZC statement, dated May 25, and signed by 'Vikalp', blamed the ""compromised"" and ""surrendered"" leaders and cadre of units active in Maad for feeding the Chhattisgarh Police and intelligence agencies with constant updates on Basavaraju's movements over the past six months. ""The cadre from different units in the Maad area turned traitors and would share our secret messages with police. Operations based on their leaks were conducted in Jan and March to get to Basavaraju. Six more surrenders over the past one and half months, including by a top cadre in Basavaraju's security detail, made the job of police easier,"" it said.The CPI(Maoist) press note, while corroborating how DRG personnel cornered Basavaraju by breaching and neutralising his protection team, said the Maoist general secretary was captured alive and then killed, a claim rubbished by Bastar IG P Sundarraj. ""The lie is a face-saver. The statement literally certifies our precise and perfectly-timed strike, how 28 of the 35 Maoists engaged ended up neutralised, and how it were the Maoists who killed a DRG personnel in the 'first round of fire' and another in an IED blast after the operation had ended,"" he told TOI.","CPI (Maoist) blamed the death of its chief Basavaraju on betrayal by some within its 'core' Naxal formations active in the Maad area.

PRAYAGRAJ: Draped in white coats and wielding scalpels, two brothers with only school-level education carved out roles as surgeons in UP's Kaushambi, performing operations inside a self-run hospital where no licensed doctor was in sight. Their bravado ended in tragedy when a six-year-old boy died after they removed a surgical rod from his leg - a procedure they had no legal or medical right to attempt.Vikas Kumar, 26, and Vishesh Kumar, 25, were arrested Sunday evening after investigation into the March death of the child. The boy's father Ram Asre of Siriyawa Kala village had filed an FIR on March 16, accusing the duo of causing his son's death through reckless treatment in a facility masquerading as a hospital.Anmol Hospital operated for nearly four years on Charwa-Manauri road.The facility's registration was in the name of the brothers' elder sibling Sanjay Kumar, a farmer with no medical background. Health authorities sealed it in July last year, but the facility resumed operations.The boy had earlier undergone legitimate surgery at a different hospital after suffering a leg fracture. But when time came to remove the implanted rod, his family returned to the local facility - unaware it was run by two men with class 12 education who never went to medical school. The brothers allegedly promised to arrange for a qualified surgeon but chose instead to perform the operation themselves. When the boy's condition deteriorated, one of the imposters rushed him to another hospital, but he died.The brothers confessed during police interrogation that money motivated their decision to conduct the surgery without expert help.","Vikas Kumar, 26, and Vishesh Kumar, 25, were arrested Sunday evening after investigation into the March death of the child.

'It's an exciting time to be part of space exploration': Peggy Whitson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-an-exciting-time-to-be-part-of-space-exploration/articleshow/121421855.cms,"You’ve seen spaceflight evolve dramatically. How different is the landscape now?

How do you maintain physical & mental health during extended space missions?

You’ve conducted many spacewalks. What’s one challenge that truly caught you off guard?

You’ve broken barriers throughout your career. What your advice to aspiring astronauts, especially women?

What makes the Axiom-4 mission stand out?

As commander of Axiom-4 Mission (Ax-4), veteran astronaut Peggy Whitson is no stranger to firsts. She’s spent more days in space than any other American or woman—675 in total—and now, she’s leading the most research-intensive private space mission to the International Space Station (ISS) yet. But this mission carries a special significance for India too: it includes Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, one of four astronaut-designates for India’s upcoming Gaganyaan mission, as the pilot of the mission. In this exclusive interview to TOI, Whitson talks about adapting to life in orbit, the rise of commercial spaceflight, and why diversity and resilience will shape the future of space exploration.Excerpts:It’s changed a lot. When I started, spaceflight was almost entirely government-led. Now, companies like Axiom Space are transforming how we explore space. They’re not only accelerating innovation but also opening doors for more people and more science. We’re seeing a diverse range of crewmembers, new research angles, and fresh collaborations that weren’t possible before. Private missions have added a new dynamism—bringing in speed, flexibility, and global participation.It’s an exciting time to be involved in space exploration.Staying healthy in space is a top priority. We follow a strict exercise routine to counteract the effects of microgravity—things like muscle loss and bone density reduction. Nutrition is key, too. Mentally, staying sharp means staying connected with loved ones and keeping ourselves intellectually engaged. Whether it's science, reading, or crew activities, it’s about finding ways to stay focused and fulfilled. The ground team’s support and the camaraderie with fellow astronauts play a huge role. Teamwork and resilience are essential up here.During one spacewalk, we unexpectedly lost a thermal and micrometeoroid shield. Despite meticulous planning, space has its surprises. The shield drifted away, and we had to rely on the ground team’s rapid thinking to come up with a workaround. It really underscored the unpredictability of working in space—and the importance of trust, teamwork, and problem-solving under pressure.Don’t let obstacles hold you back. Space exploration demands resilience, curiosity, and a deep commitment to learning. Embrace challenges—they’re chances to grow. Find mentors, build your support network, and never stop asking questions. Your unique perspective is a strength. Believe in your ability to contribute meaningfully. If space is your dream, chase it with everything you've got.Ax-4 is setting a new benchmark. We're conducting more research studies than any private ISS mission before. It’s not just about science—it’s about international collaboration. This mission includes astronauts from multiple countries, all contributing to low-Earth orbit research. It’s laying the foundation for future operations aboard Axiom Station, our next big leap. And for countries like India, which have bold space ambitions, missions like this demonstrate how commercial partnerships can help achieve those goals faster.","Peggy Whitson is leading the most research-intensive private space mission to the International Space Station (ISS) yet.

The other accused include senior party netas from the state, including Lok Sabha MP K Radhakrishnan, who was interrogated last month.CPM has become the second party (or its district unit) to be made an accused after AAP. AAP was made an accused after its senior neta Manish Sisodia, while seeking Supreme Court relief, argued that since his party, that was alleged to have received bribes, had not been made an accused, he could not be booked under PMLA. In both the cases, ED has treated the parties (AAP and CPM) like a company defined under section 70 of PMLA and booked them for laundering money or receiving bribes.According to officials aware of the investigation, rather than the central unit of CPM, it is the local district units that have been named in the chargesheet, as they, through their secretaries, opened accounts to receive funds from the ""proceeds of crime"".ED in its investigation report said the CPM units in question maintained at least 25 undisclosed accounts with several cooperative societies in the name of area committees, with a total balance of Rs 1.7 crore and fixed deposits of Rs 64 lakh, as of Nov 30, 2023.Many of these bank accounts were not disclosed by the party. ""On perusal of the balance sheet, it was noticed that the 25 bank accounts of 17 area committees of CPM had not been disclosed.

Did you expect to be Odisha's first BJP CM? Did you feel the pressure of stepping into a space dominated by Naveen Patnaik for over two decades?



How has your first year in government been?



But it is said the BJD govt left state finances in good shape.



There have been sensitive issues with neighbouring states, including Jagannath Dham in Digha. How are you addressing them?



What's your vision for Odisha by end of your term in 2029?



Nearly a year after creating history and becoming the 1st BJP CM of Odisha, Mohan Charan Majhi spoke to Manash Pratim Gohain and Dipak Dash on the twin challenge of meeting high public expectations & redefining state’s development narrative. Excerpts:I didn't expect or think I'd become CM. Honestly, I just hoped to be a good minister. I've always worked with intention of serving people, with nationalism in my heart. I have been elected four times as an MLA. As party's chief whip, I consistently raised people's issues and questioned the Patnaik govt's policies. Perhaps that consistent public service brought me here.There was no real challenge when I took over. If you have willpower and a strong leader like PM Modi backing you, anything is possible. Yes, people only knew Naveen babu as CM for over 20 years. But governance isn't about occupying a chair. Biju babu, his father (a big leader), had to wait for 27 years to become CM for the second time. Winning repeatedly does not equal meaningful leadership. He (Naveen) didn't speak Odia, didn't meet MLAs or MPs, and didn't visit the CM grievance cell for 16 years.I go there every week. I meet people at 3 am if needed. That's the kind of accessible governance people want - not isolation and silence.We've fulfilled 11 major promises out of our '21' programmes in the manifesto. We launched the Subhadra Yojana on Sept 17, 2024, in the presence of PM Narendra Modi. We gave Rs 10,000 each to 25 lakh women that day. We have exceeded our five-year target of 1 crore beneficiaries in just a few months.We also launched CM-Kisan - adding Rs 4,000 to the Rs 6,000 given under the scheme. We provided Rs 800 as input assistance per quintal of paddy, raising the effective MSP to Rs 3,100.If they had the money, why didn't they use it for the people? Why did they not give money to women and farmers? The credit goes to Modi ji, who amended the MMDR Act - turning lease-based mining into auctions with premiums. That's why Odisha is earning more today.n Puri is the abode of Lord Jagannath and is the only Jagannath Dham. It is one of the Char Dhams, established since the time of Adi Shankaracharya. No one, including any political leader, can replicate or shift that faith.By 2029, Odisha will be among the top five industrialised states.",Mohan Charan Majhi is the 1st BJP CM of Odisha.

Snehashish is the elder brother of former Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly.The couple, along with three other tourists, were about 100m from the shore when a massive wave struck their speedboat, flipping it. Swift action by lifeguards prevented the adventure boat ride from turning tragic.While the incident took place on Saturday evening, the matter came to light on Monday when video footage emerged of the incident, prompting the Puri district administration to launch a probe.""I have been coming to Puri for 31 years, but never experienced anything like this. We owe our lives to the blessings of Lord Jagannath and Maa Chandi, and the brave lifeguards who rushed to our rescue,"" Snehasish said.Narrating their 20-minute ordeal, Arpita said, ""It is a second life for us. We are still in trauma. For those terrifying moments under the capsized boat, we had given up all hope.""She said the sea was rough and the waves were towering over them.""Even though it was a 10-seater boat, there were just four or five persons in it. Before boarding the speedboat, I had asked the operator whether it was safe to venture into the sea in such inclement weather. The greedy operator assured us it was safe,"" said Arpita, who intends to write to Odisha CM and Puri SP to strengthen safety measures.Lifeguard G Appa Rao said the tourists were lucky it was not dark and the incident happened close to the shoreline.Panchanan Reddy, another lifeguard, said at least 15 of them rushed to sea and pulled the tourists to safety.

For MVA, Shiv Sena (UBT) won 20, Congress 16, and NCP (SP) 10 seats.Though Thackeray's party won the maximum seats among the MVA partners, 18 of its candidates failed to secure the second position. Its candidate from Nandgaon in Nashik district, Ganesh Dhatrak, finished fourth. Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena's Suhas Kande won the seat. Even an independent, Rohan Borse, was ahead of Dhatrak, finishing third.Among the other seats, Sena (UBT)'s pick from Airoli, Manohar Madhavi, finished third. He was in a direct fight with BJP's Ganesh Naik, who emerged the winner. In Kalyan Rural, Thackeray's candidate, Subhash Bhoir, finished third against Sena's Rajesh More. MNS's Pramod Patil was the runner-up.Congress candidates finished third in Warora, Vasai, Solapur City Central, Aurangabad East, Amalner, and Achalpur.Five candidates of NCP (SP)were pushed to the third slot in Pandharpur, Morshi, Chandgad, Ashti, and Aheri.For Mahayuti, not a single BJP candidate finished third.

Even as BJP has made inroads among OBC voters in several states, it remains a challenge for the party in Jharkhand, where Kurmis are the biggest OBC constituent.Winning over the community was outsourced to AJSU's Sudesh Mahto, who lost from Silli on Ranchi's outskirts, signalling his waning popularity.While JLKM secured victory in only one out of the 71 seats it contested, its impact was felt across several constituencies, influencing the election outcome in favour of INDIA bloc parties. Jairam Mahato, popularly known as 'Tiger', polled 94,496 votes in Dumri, significantly outdistancing AJSU's Yashoda Devi, who received 35,890 votes.","JLKM and its Jairam Mahato, representing OBC Kurmi community, walked away with a sizeable chunk of traditional NDA voters.

Internet services suspended; citizens prohibited from buying or collecting stones



What led to clashes?



'Attack on India's democracy, rule of law': BJP condemns violent protests



'Well-planned conspiracy by UP CM Adityanath, BJP-RSS'



NEW DELHI: At least 3 people were dead and several others, including over 20 police personnel, were injured in Uttar Pradesh 's Sambhal after violent clashes erupted following a court-mandated survey of the Mughal-era Jama Masjid.The survey was ordered following a petition filed by senior advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain , claiming that the mosque was originally a temple.Sambhal district Magistrate issued a notification prohibiting any outsider, social oraganisation or public representative from entering the riot-torn district without the orders of the authorities.""The order number 942 / Judicial Assistant / Section-163 / 2024 dated 01.10.2024 issued by the undersigned has imposed a prohibitory order under Section 163 of the Indian Citizens Security Code, 2023 in district Sambhal, effective until November 30,"" the circular said.""No external person, other social organizations, or public representatives will be allowed to enter the district of Sambhal without permission from the competent authority. This order will be an integral part of the prohibitory order dated 01.10.2024 and will be enforced immediately. Violation of this order will be a punishable offense under Section 223 of the Indian Penal Code, 2023,"" it added.As a precaution, internet services across the district have been suspended for a day.In view of the violence, the district administration issued a notice prohibiting citizens from buying or collecting stones, soda bottles, or any flammable or explosive materials on their roofs. The notice, issued by local SDM, warns that strict action will be taken against anyone found violating this order. Additionally, instructions were given to the Municipal Corporation to confiscate any construction material lying on roads immediately.Around 20 people have been taken into custody following the alleged stone-pelting and clashes that erupted during a survey of a mosque in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal on Sunday morning, police said.The tension started on Sunday morning as a large group of people gathered near the mosque and started shouting slogans as the survey team began their work in the Shahi Jama Masjid.The protesters tried to torch vehicles and pelted stones at the police who used tear gas and batons to disperse the mob.""Gunshots were fired by the miscreants and some pellets struck our policemen. We are investigating where the shots were fired from, particularly in the Deepa Sarai area,"" an officer said.Tension has been brewing in Sambhal over the past few days after the Jama Masjid was surveyed last Tuesday on the orders of a local court following a petition that claimed that a Harihar temple stood at the site.""Some miscreants in the crowd threw stones at the police team. The police used minor force and tear gas to bring the situation under control,"" Superintendent of Police Krishna Kumar Vishnoi said.""We are in the process of registering an FIR in the incident. The accused will also be booked under the NSA,"" the police officer added.Petitioner Vishnu Shankar Jain had said the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) ordered the constitution of an ""Advocate Commission"" to survey the mosque. The court has said that a report should be filed after conducting a videography and photography survey through the commission, he had said.The Central and Uttar Pradesh governments, the mosque committee and the district magistrate of Sambhal have been made parties in the petition concerning the mosque, Jain.Uttar Pradesh minister Yogendra Upadhyay condemned the stone pelting at an ASI team surveying a Mughal-era mosque in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal and asserted that everyone has to live according to law and order under UP CM Yogi Adityanath 's governance.""I condemn this action. It is reprehensible to disobey the order given by the court. Failure to follow the court's order is a big crime... Under Yogi Adityanath's rule, everyone has to live according to law and order, despite their class or status in society,"" Upadhyay said.Union minister Giriraj Singh reacted to the stone pelting incident on the survey team and said that it was not just an assault on the government but an attack on India's democracy and rule of law.Singh criticised the community responsible for the attack, accusing them of showing distrust in the country's democratic institutions and emphasized that the nation will not tolerate such actions.""The attack that was carried out by a community in Sambhal and that too on the government machinery, this attack is not on the government machinery but on the democracy and law of India on which they do not trust. Now the country will not tolerate how this attack was carried out,"" Singh said,Meanwhile, Congress alleged that the Yogi Adityanath administration is squarely responsible for killing innocents and only the BJP-RSS is guilty of ""setting fire"" to the peace and harmony there.The opposition party said the videos of direct firing on the protesters in Sambhal depict the horrifying result of a ""well-planned conspiracy"" by Adityanath and the BJP-RSS.""In this entire matter, the BJP neither wanted the survey to proceed nor to stop it; its sole objective was to destroy harmony,"" Khera said.""No citizen in Uttar Pradesh is 'safe' under CM Adityanath, who gave the reprehensible slogan of 'Batenge toh Katenge'. This is evident by the highly deplorable incidents of Sambhal today,"" he added.Western Uttar Pradesh, which has been a symbol of goodwill and harmony for years, has today witnessed three people killed and many injured under a ""well-planned conspiracy"", the Congress leader said.""We say with full responsibility that the Adityanath administration is squarely responsible for killing innocents and only the BJP-RSS is guilty of setting fire to the peace and harmony of Sambhal. Modi-Yogi 'double assault' governments, which consider the minority community as second-class citizens, hurriedly got a petition filed in court,"" Khera said.It is public knowledge that the court ordered an immediate survey without hearing the other side, he said.""No action was taken against the rioters who accompanied the survey team. This makes it clear that after the by-elections in the state, the Yogi government has further intensified the politics of violence and hatred,"" he added.Khera said Rahul Gandhi has been continuously and stridently talked about 'Nafrat Ke Bazaar Mein Mohabbat Ki Dukaan' and in such a situation, an appeal is made to the people of Sambhal to recognise the politics of hatred, maintain mutual unity, amity and harmony, and take steps to protect their rights in a legal manner.","At least 3 dead and over 20 police personnel injured in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh.

""His blood sample has been collected to verify his claim,"" said an officer. Earlier on Saturday, the friends had taken an autorickshaw to a fifth friend's Andheri home.Jimmy told police: ""...We consumed some liquor and food"".

African footballers bring joy to cyclone-battered Bengal Mousuni Island,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/african-footballers-bring-joy-to-cyclone-battered-bengal-mousuni-island/articleshow/115641265.cms,"MOUSUNI ISLAND (SOUTH 24 PARGANAS): The afternoon sun hung low over the Khasmahal ground in southern Bengal's Mousuni, casting long shadows across the freshly chalked sidelines. Vendors moved through the crowd, balancing trays of puffed rice and tamarind water. On the pitch, the ball darted from foot to foot with the rhythm of a heartbeat. In the thick of it was Tinni Aziz from Niger.With a deft flick, he spun past a defender, his movements as fluid as the tides surrounding Mousuni, one of the remotest permanently inhabited islands of the Sundarbans delta , nearly 200km south of Kolkata, reports Sudipto Das.The crowd roared in unison as he sent a perfect through ball to Issiaka Kwasi from Ivory Coast, who weaved through two defenders with dazzling footwork before firing a low, curling shot into the corner of the net. The goalkeeper's dive came a second too late.The match wasn't just a game on this isolated island in the Bay of Bengal. It was a rare moment of joyful reprieve from the rising tides, eroding shores, and devastating cyclones.Mousuni recently came alive with the cheers of football fans as it hosted a three-day, nine-a-side football tournament featuring 33 players from African nations such as Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon, and Niger.Some have ventured into the hinterlands lately. One in every four players in the Mousuni tournament was from Africa, underscoring the rising prominence of ""khep"" football - local tournaments where players are paid per match. The event, which concluded Sunday, featured 16 teams competing for a prize pool of Rs 2 lakh.Mousuni, battered by cyclones like Bulbul (2019), Amphan (2020), and Yaas (2021), has faced severe challenges, including the destruction of its primary cash crop betel leaf and the relentless erosion of its coastline. Yet, the past two years have seen improved yields of paddy and betel leaf, allowing villagers to invest in organising the tournament.""Out of the 16 teams, 13 belong to Mousuni, and the others were from the mainland,"" said Saral Das, an organizer and farmer who owns 13.5 bighas of land. ""This year, Mousuni villagers have contributed substantial amounts of money to support the clubs,"" added Chayan Kumar Bhattacharya, another committee member.Both Tinni and Issiaka played for Jai Maa Vishalakhhi, a team managed by betel leaf farmer Sagar Maity. ""This year I hired three African players, including two strikers and a fullback,"" said Maity, whose team became one of the tournament's highlights.Bablu Mondal, a farmer from Kusumtala village, formed Naba Football Sangha (NFT) this year and spent Rs 2.5 lakh on his team, including hiring four African players.For Mousuni, where climate change is an everyday reality, football offered a brief but powerful escape for its residents - many of whom have faced displacement due to erosion, which has reduced the island's size to just 44sq km. While many younger villagers have migrated to other states for work, the event brought a welcome distraction and a sense of hope.","Mousuni is one of the remotest permanently inhabited islands of the Sundarbans delta.

Maharashtra election results: Momentum builds in BJP to make Devendra Fadnavis CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-election-results-momentum-builds-in-bjp-to-make-devendra-fadnavis-cm/articleshow/115636595.cms,"Also read:

MUMBAI: The 'Devendra Fadnavis or Eknath Shinde ' conundrum continues for Mahayuti on the question of who should be the new CM even as there are indications that BJP would not want to delay the return of Devendra Fadnavis to Varsha, the CM's official residence in Mumbai.Shinde would have been a shoo-in as CM had the poll results thrown up a modest majority for Mahayuti, but the scale of BJP's performance has transformed the party's outlook.It would like to leverage the numbers it has to anoint Fadnavis as CM as it believes he scripted the big win after playing second fiddle to Shinde for 2.5 years as dy CM.Though this will not please the Shinde-led Sena as the poll campaign was carried out under his leadership, BJP's brass is reportedly pushing for a change. It acknowledges Shinde's leadership, the success of his Ladki Bahin initiative and his persona as a man of action, but it believes the win has equally been that of Hindutva forces best articulated during campaigns by PM Modi, Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath Ajit Pawar 's NCP too is in favour of Fadnavis taking over as CM, sources said. They said RSS has its own view, pushing subtly for Fadnavis.Eknath Shinde is learnt to be reluctant to leave the CM office. Sources suggest Shinde's reluctance to step down is rooted in a strategic argument by him. He believes his continuation would be beneficial for Mahayuti alliance in the upcoming local body elections, including the crucial BMC elections.Shinde's argument is that his appeal among urban and Marathi voters could further consolidate the coalition's grip on state politics, ensuring a sweep in local polls. This perspective taps into the regional pride and grassroots connection that Shinde has cultivated, which could be advantageous for the party's broader political strategy.Sources said internal discussions within BJP circles are intense. On the one hand, the party recognises electoral advantage of having a neta like Shinde, who has proven his mettle in connecting with the populace. On the other, the leadership sees Fadnavis as a figure who can bring a fresh, dynamic approach to governance, realigning state politics with the national BJP narrative of development and efficiency.Party insiders say several rounds of meetings, including a top brass brainstorming until late Saturday night, took place, but the issue remained undecided. Sources added that the issue is unlikely to be resolved immediately.Fadnavis could not continue as CM in 2019 despite BJP and undivided Shiv Sena alliance's victory under his leadership, and later, he had to be content with deputy CM's office under Shinde.Fadnavis, known for his administrative acumen and political astuteness, has a history of steering Maharashtra through economic reforms and infrastructural developments. His tenure was marked by aggressive governance, which appealed to a segment of the voters who are now possibly looking for a return to his leadership style. However, the decision to replace Shinde is not straightforward.The incumbent Mahayuti alliance delivered a stunning performance in Maharashtra, winning 233 out of 288 seats and dealing a major blow to the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), reducing them to just 49 seats and leaving them unable to claim the post of opposition leader. The tenure of the current Maharashtra assembly ends on Tuesday.Meanwhile, all 57 Shiv Sena MLAs have been called to a hotel in Bandra to elect the legislature party leader. The meeting may take place on Monday. Sena functionaries said CM Shinde is likely to submit his resignation to the governor on Monday or Tuesday and then continue as caretaker CM till the new CM and cabinet take oath.","The incumbent Mahayuti alliance delivered a stunning performance in Maharashtra, winning 233 out of 288 seats and dealing a major blow to the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) The tenure of the current Maharashtra assembly ends on Tuesday.

'Bihar a failed state': What Prashant Kishor told state diaspora in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-a-failed-state-what-prashant-kishor-told-state-diaspora-in-us/articleshow/115640722.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj leader Prashant Kishor labelled Bihar a ""failed state"" considering its position ""on all developmental parameters."" Drawing comparison to Sudan, he pointed out that the characteristics of such states are visible in its population which ""are worried about who to shoot and where to capture.""""The characteristics of failed states are visible in the population here.For example... sometimes we think... why are people in Sudan fighting for 20 years in the civil war. Because when you are in that failed state, then people are not worried about how our children will study in Sudan. They are worried about who to shoot and where to capture. So that is the situation in Bihar too. And we must be aware of it,"" he said, addressing Bihari diaspora in US.""We have to realise that this (Bihar) is a state which is in deep shit. If Bihar were a country, it would be the 11th largest country in terms of population in the world. We have just overtaken Japan in terms of population,"" he added.The election strategist outlined key priorities for governance of his party, with a strong emphasis on improving school education. Kishor said that, if voted to power, his administration would prioritize educational reforms, with funding sourced from the revenue generated by lifting the statewide alcohol ban.Kishor's newly formed party, Jan Suraaj, suffered a significant setback in its debut election, failing to secure a single seat and unable to retain its deposits in three constituencies.The party's performance was disappointing, with the exception of Imamganj, where Jan Suraaj candidate Jitendra Paswan managed to secure over 22% of the vote. In the other three constituencies, however, the party struggled to make an impact, marking a difficult start for Kishor's political venture.","Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj party failed to secure a single seat in its debut election.

BAREILLY: Three people died and several others, including 20-odd police personnel, were injured when a court-mandated survey at the Mughal-era Jama Masjid in Sambhal spiralled into violent clashes on Sunday morning. Till last reports, three people, including a police officer injured in firing, were reported critical.Around a dozen people, including two women, have been detained.The survey was ordered following a petition filed by senior advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain, claiming that the mosque was originally a temple.The survey, conducted by an Archaeological Survey of India team under the supervision of court commissioner Ramesh Singh and in the presence of DM Rajendra Pensia, SP Krishan Kumar, and other officials, began at 7am and initially proceeded peacefully. Around 9am, a mob gathered outside the mosque, allegedly shouting slogans and pelting police personnel with stones.Divisional commissioner Aunjaneya Singh said, ""A crowd of 2,000-3,000 people gathered and threw stones at police personnel stationed for security. Despite initial efforts to disperse them with tear gas and lathi charges, the mob intensified its attack and started firing from nearby houses, leading to injuries among officers, including the SP's PRO, SDM Ramesh Babu, and circle officer Anuj Chaudhary, who was hit by bullet pellets."" Singh said the SDM sustained fractures and more than a dozen cops were injured. The mob also set several vehicles ablaze.The unrest later spread to Deep Sarai, where people allegedly threw stones at police from houses. ""Children aged 12-15 were used as shields, and many of the perpetrators were under 25. Several women were also involved,"" Singh said.Vehicles were torched, and additional forces were called in from neighbouring districts to contain the situation,"" Singh added. The survey team was safely evacuated from the area, and internet services were suspended in the district by Sunday evening.Those who died have been identified as Mohd Nayeem, Mohd Bilal, and Mohd Nauman, all residents of Sambhal. ""My brother was shot dead by circle officer Anuj Chaudhary. We saw him aiming at my brother. We demand strict action,"" Bilal's younger brother said.Singh dismissed the claims, saying, ""We have videographic evidence of the incident. If the family acknowledges their son was part of the mob, they should reflect on why he was throwing stones. Police responded to firing from both sides to ensure the safety of the survey team and restore order.""Concerns about potential damage to the mosque were also raised. Singh said, ""While stone pelting near the mosque may have caused some damage, it is unclear... The survey was conducted peacefully, and no changes were made to the mosque's structure.""SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi said, ""The situation is under control now. Those responsible will face charges under National Security Act. We appeal to residents to avoid violence and trust the judicial process."" Singh added, ""We are reviewing videos of the incident to identify all those involved. The perpetrators' use of stones and bullets from three sides of the mosque after the survey team left led to the need for additional force.""A similar survey was conducted peacefully on Tuesday, with police and members of the mosque's management committee present. Authorities had deployed heavy security for Friday prayers after intel inputs warned of potential disruptions by antisocial elements. The mosque's management committee also slammed the violence.","A court-mandated survey at the Mughal-era Jama Masjid in Sambhal spiralled into violent clashes on Sunday morning.

NEW DELHI: The vote counting for the Maharashtra assembly elections is underway, with early trends hinting at a fierce battle between the Mahayuti alliance and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The Mahayuti, comprising the BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar’s NCP, is pitted against the MVA coalition of Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and Sharad Pawar-led NCP.Maharashtra’s 288 constituencies witnessed a voter turnout of 66.05%, reflecting increased public participation compared to 2019.Both alliances remain optimistic, interpreting the higher turnout as a sign of support for their respective coalitions.Key contests are drawing significant attention, including Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis’s fight in Nagpur South West and a high-stakes battle in Wadala, where Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Shraddha Jadhav expressed confidence in her victory.As counting progresses, leads are emerging, with the Mahayuti gaining a landslide margin of over 220 seats in several constituencies.",Shahada (2) - Rajesh Udesing Padvi Nandurbar (3) - Dr. Vijaykumar Krushanrao Gavit Dhule Rural (6) - Raghavendra (Ramdada) Manohar Patil Dhule City (7) - Agrawal Anupbhaiyya Omprakash Sindkheda (8) - Jaykumar Jitendrasingh Rawal Shirpur (9),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115585397,imgsize-938489,width-400,resizemode-4/115585397.jpg"

About the Ladki Bahin scheme

A historic mandate

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde took a moment to celebrate the Mahayuti alliance's resounding victory in the 2024 Assembly elections by acknowledging the role of the state’s women. At an event related to the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana ( Ladki Bahin Scheme ), Shinde clicked selfies with attendees and credited the scheme for the electoral success.Speaking to reporters yesterday, Shinde expressed gratitude saying, “I thank all my ladki bahins in the state and the brothers who voted in large numbers for us. The voting trend is an endorsement of our work. Every section of society supported us because of our development efforts.”NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) chief Sharad Pawar, reflecting on the election results, acknowledged that women’s participation and schemes like Ladki Bahin contributed significantly to the Mahayuti sweep. ""The Ladki Bahin scheme and religious polarisation may have played a role. Women's participation in large numbers could be the reason for this outcome,"" Pawar said while addressing reporters in Karad. Despite the setback, he vowed to revitalize his party and its leadership.Pawar suffered his worst-ever political defeat, with his faction securing only 10 seats, compared to 41 seats won by the NCP faction led by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The Mahayuti alliance, comprising the BJP (132 seats), Shiv Sena (57 seats), and Ajit Pawar-led NCP (41 seats), emerged victorious with 230 seats in the 288-member assembly. The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi was limited to just 46 seats.Launched on Raksha Bandhan in August 2024, the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana provides Rs 1,500 monthly to over one crore financially disadvantaged women in Maharashtra. Women aged 21 to 65 years with annual household incomes below Rs 2.5 lakh are eligible.During a trial phase earlier this year, over 30 lakh women received Rs 3,000 directly into their bank accounts. Inspired by Madhya Pradesh's Ladli Behna Yojana, Shinde assured that Maharashtra’s version would continue indefinitely.As trends solidified the Mahayuti victory, Shinde emphasized that public recognition of their development efforts underpinned the success. With women emerging as a key demographic, the Ladki Bahin scheme appears to have played a pivotal role in securing the alliance’s mandate.","Eknath Shinde took a moment to celebrate the Mahayuti alliance's resounding victory in the 2024 Assembly elections.

Allegations and legal proceedings

Adani Group denies allegations

NEW DELHI: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will need to use formal diplomatic protocols to serve summons on Adani Group Founder Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, in a case involving alleged payoffs of $265 million (Rs 2,200 crore) to secure solar energy contracts. The SEC lacks jurisdiction to directly summon foreign nationals and must channel its request through the Indian Embassy in the US, sources said.The procedure is governed by the 1965 Hague Convention and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between India and the US.Officials familiar with the matter clarified that summons cannot simply be mailed but must adhere to these formalities, which could delay the process.The SEC’s summons, dated November 21 and filed in a New York court, mandates a response within 21 days of receipt. ""If you fail to respond, judgment by default will be entered against you,"" the notice warns.Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar, and others, including Cyril Cabanes of Azure Power Global, face accusations of paying bribes between 2020 and 2024 to secure lucrative solar contracts. These deals allegedly promised $2 billion in profits over 20 years.The indictment, unsealed on Wednesday, alleges the Adani Group raised $2 billion in loans and bonds, including from US firms, based on misleading anti-bribery claims. Prosecutors say the inquiry, initiated in 2022, encountered obstruction.""As alleged, the defendants orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars and... lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from U.S. and international investors,"" said US Attorney Breon Peace.""My office is committed to rooting out corruption in the international marketplace and protecting investors from those who seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the integrity of our financial markets,"" he added.The Adani Group has strongly denied the charges. ""The Adani Group has always upheld and is steadfastly committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance, transparency, and regulatory compliance across all jurisdictions of its operations,"" the company stated.The group assured stakeholders and partners of its compliance with laws and indicated its intention to explore all legal avenues to counter the allegations.An indictment in the US signifies formal charges issued by a grand jury, requiring the accused to respond or face default judgment. The outcome of this high-profile case could have far-reaching implications for international business practices and investor trust.(With inputs from agencies)","US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will need to use formal diplomatic protocols to serve summons on Adani Group Founder Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani.

"‘Marriage equality cannot be won solely through courts,’ says lawyer Rohin Bhat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/marriage-equality-cannot-be-won-solely-through-courts-says-lawyer-rohin-bhat/articleshow/115632747.cms,"Rohin Bhatt

— who represented two couples in the

marriage equality

case in the

last year — reflects on this duality in his debut book ‘The Urban Elite versus Union of India’. In an interview with Sharmila Ganesan Ram, the 26-year-old lawyer talks about the need to recalibrate the LGBTQIA+ movement

As a lawyer representing two couples in the marriage equality case, what was the lead up to the judgment like?

Is that why the narrative braids your personal experiences with the legal?

The book attributes a chunk of the progress made by queer rights activism in India to the work done by AIDS Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan (ABVA) in the 1990s…

“Queer liberation will not and cannot be won solely through litigation,” you write. What makes you put on your black gown and show up in court daily?

Many argue that marriage itself is a faulty institution. Can marriage equality liberate the queer community?

The wait for the judgment had been long and hard.It felt as if we were holding our breaths. One was obviously anxious and worried about the outcome, for it was certain that the implications of the judgment would be far-reaching not just for the queer community, but also for others who do not have social sanction, like inter-caste and inter-faith lovers, since the Special Marriage Act was being challenged. The judgment was underwhelming, yet consistent with the recent trends in the Supreme Court and the judiciary where the courts have failed to act as an anti-majoritarian force. However, the loss was a much more personal one because I knew that it was not just ‘a’ case, but one that would deeply affect me and my life as well.I think often when one talks about the law, one does it in a neutral fashion, as lofty ideals or formulaic principles that have to be applied to a given set of facts. But the law is hardly that — heart, emotions and psyche play a big role in how cases are decided. With the marriage equality litigation, one, and one’s community, were unwillingly, the subject of the law. The emotions during the hearing were frenzied and all-consuming even after the judgment. This book was not only a way of channelling those emotions as a therapeutic exercise, but also talking about the queer rights movement in India.ABVA presents an early model of a social movement that was inclusive and cohesive. It had no funding, no office. It had members from 24 to 55-year-olds who ranged from residents of some of Delhi’s poshest colonies to pavement dwellers. Their activism was one of the main forces behind making sure that the AIDS (Prevention) Bill, 1989 was withdrawn. The bill allowed for the isolation, forcible testing, questioning of people who were living with HIV and lacked any provision in place which ensured the protection of confidentiality, or the protection of due process of law. Their reports tell us about the struggle that goes in building a movement. Post 2018 and Navtej, I think the queer movement has become much more judicialised. Winning cases is easier than winning hearts and minds. But also because we were, prior to the 2024 elections, political orphans. Few political parties openly supported queer rights. Thankfully, that has changed post-2018.The belief that the Constitution and the courts can work for the proverbial ‘butcher, baker and the candlestick maker’. I don’t think it is these big-ticket cases that make the practice of the law meaningful but the smaller ones, which often don’t make it to the front page of the newspapers, do. Getting a protection order from a violent natal family is one such example. However, to say that we will achieve equality through the courts is perhaps a myopic conclusion. Unless we put in the hard work of movement building, of changing attitudes, of politically lobbying with the State, I do not think queer liberation can be achieved.Marriage, of course, replicates caste and class hierarchies, and queer marriage will do it too. Having said that, there is nuance to it. Our legal system recognises relationships in three ways: blood, marriage and adoption. Now for queer persons to have rights over their assets and their partner, marriage becomes a legitimate legal need. There is a case to be made for radical legal re-imagination of how we look at relationships, such as choosing our families, but that is a long-term project. In the meantime, our rights cannot wait, and marriage is one way of ensuring that partners have rights over natal families which are often sites of violence.","Rohin Bhatt is a 26-year-old lawyer who represented two couples in the marriage equality case in the Supreme Court last year.

COP29: India champions the cause of global south in a historic move of rejecting the climate finance outcome,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cop29-india-champions-the-cause-of-global-south-in-a-historic-move-of-rejecting-the-climate-finance-outcome/articleshow/115631984.cms,"Chandni Raina (Reuters photo)

BAKU/NEW DELHI: India's historic stand of rejecting the climate finance outcome at COP29 on Sunday triggered similar reactions from other developing countries and experts, who viewed India as a champion of the entire Global South .The moment came during the final plenary where India's negotiator, Chandni Raina , led the charge against what was delivered as the “Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T"" and pinpointed gaps in the document.Belém, a Brazilian city, will host COP30 next year. Experts pointed out that the move to accept a token financial pledge was merely to prevent the collapse of the negotiations in the Azerbaijani capital.Taking on rich nations without mincing words, Raina said, ""Developed countries are taking the lead for a mobilisation goal of a mere sum of $300 billion, and that too to be only reached by 2035, that’s almost 11 years later, and that too from a wide variety of sources. So, it would have to be private, it would have to be multilateral, and there are large amounts of it that will be left for developing countries to mobilise themselves.""""We are disappointed with the outcome, which clearly brings out the unwillingness of developed country parties to fulfil their responsibilities,"" she said, clearly underlining that the outcome at COP29 will further affect developing countries' ability to adapt to climate change, greatly impacting their NDC ambition and its implementation.Speakers from other developing countries, including Bolivia and Nigeria, took a similar line while objecting to the final climate finance outcome during their post-gavel remarks.“COP29 has failed to deliver on its core mandate—binding commitments, real finance, and meaningful action to curb the climate crisis . With the world needing over $1.3 trillion in climate finance by 2030, the agreement on a $300 billion goal by 2035, without a clear indication of what constitutes this finance, is a hollow gesture, a mere fig leaf for inaction,"" said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).Ghosh, along with former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and other experts, who sought an urgent overhaul of the UN climate talk process, pointed out that the outcome encouraging developing countries to make additional contributions, including through South–South cooperation, undermines the very principle of equity. ""Instead of delivering climate finance, COP29 has delivered a new principle: I pollute, you pay,"" he said.“India, rightly, underscored this inadequacy and the process of adoption. While the outcome reflects the current state of geopolitics as well as domestic politics in some countries in the globe, the developing countries did well standing together. The effort for mobilisation of far more resources for climate change must go on,"" said Manjeev Puri, former Indian ambassador to the European Union and a distinguished fellow, TERI.Referring to other aspects of the outcome amid all-round disappointment, Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends, noted that the finer elements, like setting aside funds for least developed countries , is, however, a slight progress. ""Climate is a matter of life and death for some countries. There is also language in the text that refers to a special assessment on access to finance by 2030 - when it will be clear how much of the funds are grants, concessional loans, and the extent of dependence on private finance,"" she said.Underlining that the devil, as ever, will be in the details, Khosla said, ""It is hard to find positive developments at these very tricky negotiations. Baku has given a deal but kept no one happy; everyone has stayed in to retain the spirit of multilateralism.”Calling the COP29 outcome not just a failure but a betrayal, the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group on climate change said, ""The bulldozed New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) is a glaring symbol of this failure.""""Once again, the countries (rich nations) most responsible for the climate crisis have failed us. We leave Baku without an ambitious climate finance goal, without concrete plans to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and without the comprehensive support desperately needed for adaptation and loss and damage,"" the group said in a statement.""We came in good faith, with the safety of our communities and the well-being of the world at heart. Yet, we have seen the very worst of political opportunism here at this COP, playing games with the lives of the world's most vulnerable people. Fossil fuel interests have been determined to block progress and undermine the multilateral goals we’ve worked to build. This can never be allowed to happen,"" said Tina Stege, Marshall Islands climate envoy.","India's Chandni Raina led the charge against what was delivered as the “Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T"" Raina said, ""Developed countries are taking the lead for a mobilisation goal of a mere sum of $300 billion, and that too to be only reached by 2035""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115632106,imgsize-1478762,width-400,resizemode-4/115632106.jpg"

Electoral results

Party’s response

NEW DELHI: AJSU Party 's lone MLA, Nirmal Mahto , on Sunday offered to resign from his Mandu seat to make way for party chief Sudesh Mahto , who lost the polls from Silli constituency. This comes after the AJSU Party, a BJP ally, contested 10 seats in the Jharkhand Assembly elections but secured only one, with a narrow margin of 231 votes.“I have sent my resignation letter to Sudesh Mahto, requesting him to accept it so that he can contest from Mandu in the bypoll and enter the assembly,” said Nirmal Mahto, who defeated Congress candidate Jai Prakash Bhai Patel by a slender margin in Mandu.In Mandu, Nirmal Mahto secured 90,871 votes, while Patel garnered 90,640. Interestingly, Patel had contested the 2019 elections as a BJP candidate and defeated Mahto with a margin of about 2,000 votes. However, after switching to the Congress, the BJP ceded the Mandu seat to the AJSU Party for this election.Meanwhile, Sudesh Mahto faced a significant defeat in Silli, losing to JMM’s Amit Kumar by a margin of 23,867 votes.Jaleshwar Mahato, AJSU Party's central committee secretary, confirmed that Sudesh Mahto has received the resignation letter and will make a decision soon.The AJSU Party’s poor performance in these elections highlights the challenges faced by smaller allies in coalition politics. A bypoll in Mandu could serve as a critical opportunity for Sudesh Mahto to re-establish his presence in the assembly.","AJSU Party's lone MLA, Nirmal Mahto, offered to resign from his Mandu seat to make way for party chief Sudesh Mahto.

What does the deal on climate finance at COP29 mean?



Overall post-2025 target

Core goa

It will come from a wide variety of sources (public and private; bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources).

It will replace the existing annual $100 billion 2020-25 period target (it was promised in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020).

BAKU/NEW DELHI: The UN climate talks (COP29) concluded on Sunday with a weak outcome on climate finance, prompting rich nations to mobilise merely $300 billion per year by 2035 for developing countries from a ""wide variety of sources,"" including public and private, rather than solely from public finance as was being demanded. The move led India to reject it in its present form, stating the document is ""nothing more than an optical illusion.""Though the amount is part of the overall package of $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 from all public and private sources for developing countries to implement their climate action goals, India, while standing up for the Global South, said the amount would not address the enormity of the challenge the world is currently facing.""The goal is too little, too distant (almost 11 years later). It is 2035, it is too far gone. Our 2030 estimates tell us that we need to do it at $1.3 trillion per year till 2030... The amount that is proposed to be mobilised is abysmally poor. It is a paltry sum... We cannot accept it... We are very unhappy, disappointed with the process and object to the adoption of this agenda,"" said Chandni Raina, India's negotiator, while articulating the country's stand amid a wide round of applause and support from several developing countries in the final plenary.India sought the floor to speak before the decision was adopted, but the finance outcome - New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) - was suddenly gavelled by the COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev.""We informed the Presidency, we informed the secretariat that we wanted to make a statement prior to any decision on the adoption. However, this is for everyone to see. This has been stage-managed. We are extremely, extremely disappointed with this incident... We absolutely object to this unfair means followed for adoption,"" said Raina, Economic Advisor, DEA in the Ministry of Finance, in her intervention.Post-gavel remarks of India and other developing countries, including Malawi, Bolivia, Nigeria, and Pakistan, on the Baku outcome were merely taken as records by the Azerbaijani Presidency and will appear in the footnote of the outcome. It is believed by many observers that the weakclimate finance outcome and India's rejection, endorsed by several developing countries, may impact the countries' update on their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - climate action targets - next year.Asked what India's rejection of the climate finance outcome meant at this juncture, R R Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI and India's former lead negotiator, told TOI that India, in expressing formal disappointment about the $300 billion NCQG, acted as a leader of the Global South. ""It is significant that, after a long time, India and many other diverse groups within the developing world have shown a common and united stand on this issue,"" he said.Rashmi, however, said it's too early to say anything about the next NDCs. ""The threat of use of unilateral trade measures by developed countries and the domestic policy limitations are a bigger constraint for India,"" he said, in a clear reference to trade barriers such as the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is a tool to put a price through imposing a border tax on carbon-intensive goods, like iron & steel, aluminium, and cement, that are entering the EU.Pointing out such barriers in her intervention, Raina said, ""The Global South is being pushed to transit to low-carbon pathways even at the cost of our growth. We have to face the CBAM measures. There are other measures that are being imposed by the developed country parties to make the transition really not easy. In fact, it is quite difficult to enable such a transition in a very, very competitive hostile environment that we are facing at the moment.""Once CBAM is implemented from 2026, it will put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries, including India and China, and impact their trade.1.: $1.3 trillion per year by 2035, from all public and private sources, for developing countries for implementing their climate action.2.l: Developed countries to mobilise $300 billion per year by 2035 for developing countries.3.: Encourages developing countries to make contributions, including through South–South cooperation, on a voluntary basis.4.: Pursue efforts to at least triple the annual fund flow by 2030 from 2022 levels for adaptation measures.5.: Baku to Belem (host city of COP30 in Brazil) Roadmap to assess progress towards the $1.3 trillion goal, with reports in 2026 and 2027.",The UN climate talks (COP29) concluded on Sunday with a weak outcome on climate finance.

Devendra Fadnavis: Will he be back in 2024 after being so-near-yet-so-far in 2019?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/devendra-fadnavis-will-he-be-back-in-2024-after-being-so-near-yet-so-far-in-2019/articleshow/115617326.cms,"Despite leading the BJP to a historic victory in the Maharashtra assembly elections and a previous promise to return as Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis's future role hangs in the balance.

In 2019, he famously said: “Me Punha Yein” (I’ll be back). In 2024, he’s maintaining a diplomatic silence even as everyone’s wondering: “Toh Punha Yeil ka?” (Will he be back?).Simple math should yield a resounding yes. BJP’s numbers are more than double of Shiv Sena’s. Logically it’s a no contest. But politics is not about hard numbers alone and with Shinde camp dropping enough hints that status quo should prevail it’s to be seen whether the man from Nagpur will head to Mantralaya as CM or not.Fadnavis played a stellar role in leading the tripartite alliance to victory.While everyone focused on the bold numbers of LS polls of barely six months ago, he zeroed in on the granular details. Mahayuti’s vote share was a mere one per cent lower than MVA’s. If only two lakh more voters had voted for them, the picture would have been very different.It is precisely with this emphasis on smart poll management that Fadnavis, with a quiet resolve, went about planning the BJP’s election campaign and at the same time performing his role as Dy CM. Finally, he has returned, with a big bang – the BJP has posted its highest seat tally ever in Maharashtra with 132 seats.Fadnavis has, indeed, a point or two to prove. In 2019, the then CM Fadnavis had been BJP’s face for the state election campaign. He had even led the party’s Mahajanadesh yatra and made the famous ‘Me Punha Yein’ statement. It turned out to be quite a millstone around his neck, and he has been hoping for five years that he’d be able to cast it away.He helped BJP leadership engineer splits in the Shiv Sena and later in NCP and took it on the chin when he was appointed deputy to Eknath Shinde. His initial reluctance to be Shinde’s deputy was very visible. But like a loyal party worker he fell in line swallowing his ego and pride. All he did after that perceived diminishing of stature was to get back to work so that he could bounce back. He must be now hoping that the BJP top brass take cognizance of both his ‘sacrifice’ and subjucation of his claims to the chief ministership in the interests of the party and reward him with the top job five years around. His mother was quite vocal about her son’s credentials for the job post results.During the Maratha quota agitation, he was personally and consistently targeted by quota activist Manoj Jarange over his ‘Brahmin’ credentials. Though the LS poll debacle was a serious setback he led an aggressive assembly campaign, describing the state election as a ‘dharmayuddh.’This combination of silent, steady work with strong pronouncements has brought him back into the reckoning for the CM’s post, again. It is now up to the BJP supremos to decide whether to reward their tallest leader with the top job or, again, sacrifice Fadnavis for Shinde for the greater good of BJP in the longer term.",Fadnavis played a stellar role in leading the tripartite alliance to victory.

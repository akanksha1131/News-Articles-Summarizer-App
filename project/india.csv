Karnataka govt favouring big fish with links to ministers: Contractors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-govt-favouring-big-fish-with-links-to-ministers-contractors/articleshow/120186509.cms,"BENGALURU/CHITRADURGA: Days after Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah's economic adviser, Basavaraj Rayareddi, caused a flutter by claiming the state was ""No 1 in corruption"" before retracting the statement, the Congress govt has faced further embarrassment.The Karnataka State Contractors' Association has now alleged growing interference by middlemen in govt departments, accusing the administration of favouring big influential contractors while sidelining small and medium ones.In a letter addressed to Siddaramaiah, his deputy DK Shivakumar, public works minister Satish Jarkiholi, and minor irrigation minister NS Boseraju, association president R Manjunath and general secretary GM Ravindra have demanded an official meeting to discuss the crisis. ""In the last 3-4 months, middlemen are spoiling the system,"" the association said in its representation to the CM.Manjunath told TOI pending dues to contractors have crossed Rs 32,000 crore. ""Govt should maintain the seniority list to clear pending bills. However, there are middlemen - described as 'invisible hands' - in each dept, and they help some influential contractors, doing injustice to the small and medium-level contractors.""The association alleged that while departments like PWD, four irrigation corporations, and minor irrigation continue to withhold payments ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, special letters of credit (LoCs) are being selectively used to benefit contractors with political backing. These LOCs, intended for emergencies such as health issues or family events, are reportedly being misused.Contractors working with BBMP in Bengaluru have also alleged that bribe-demanding middlemen influence bill clearances in the city, favouring those with deeper pockets.At a press conference in Chitradurga, Manjunath claimed interference by ministers' relatives and aides in department functioning. ""While relatives of ministers have gained undue influence across departments, ministerial interference has increased in recent months. The ministers establish proper payment schedules, but intermediaries alter these arrangements to facilitate selective disbursement.""Despite raising these issues in a meeting with DK Shivakumar on Dec 3, Manjunath said their concerns remain unresolved. ""Substantial amounts of Rs 100-150 crore are being allocated to influential parties, while smaller contractors face neglect,"" he said, adding, ""The water resources department suspended payments while, in minor irrigation, minister Boseraj's son's involvement raised concerns regarding grants and payments.""","The Karnataka State Contractors' Association has now alleged growing interference by middlemen in govt departments.

"Pakistan distances itself from ISI agent, says he is Canadian",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-distances-itself-from-isi-agent-says-he-is-canadian/articleshow/120185792.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hours before Tahawwur Rana 's arrival, Pakistan washed its hands off him saying he had ceased to be Pakistani and was a Canadian.Distancing itself from Rana, whom the ISI protected till the end, Pakistan govt's foreign office issued a statement Thursday saying they had no connection to him. ""He is a Canadian national and as per our record, he has not renewed his Pakistani documents for over two decades,"" its spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said at a briefing.The strenuous distancing is significant because the involvement of Pakistan's spy agency ISI was established by Indian agencies with the help of the confession of Ajmal Kasab , the lone Lashkar terrorist involved in the carnage to have been apprehended alive, and findings of the investigation conducted with help from foreign partners; especially the FBI.Rana, born in Pakistan in 1961, served in the Pakistan Army Medical Corps before moving to Canada in the 1990s, where he obtained citizenship. Sources in the intelligence establishment have consistently maintained that this was a routine move by the ISI to 'settle' their assets abroad to facilitate their India-centric operations.Denial has been the default first response of Pakistan govt which faced international opprobrium after the mass slaughter of innocents carried out by its assets, and which further steeled its already-formidable notoriety as the hub of jihadi terror. It had denied Kasab was a Pakistani citizen, going to the extent of identifying him as an Indian national - something which could have helped its effort to pass off the Mumbai attack as a case of homegrown terror. Kasab and others were carrying forged IDs which showed them as Hindus. As part of the camouflage, they had tied saffron strings ('kalevas') they had found on the fishing trawlerthey had commandeered.Kasab's alias was that of a Bengaluru resident, Samir Dinesh Chaudhari. The gameplan came to naught because of the expose that confirmed his identity as a Pakistani national born to Amir Kasab and Noor Illahi - both Pakistan citizens. Then Pakistani PM Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani subsequently sacked his adviser on national security Mahmud Ali Durrani for his ""irresponsible behaviour"".","Tahawwur Rana was born in Pakistan in 1961.

Mumbai market tries to erase memory of Headley office 26/11 plotter helped build,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-market-tries-to-erase-memory-of-headley-office-26/11-plotter-helped-build/articleshow/120185638.cms,"MUMBAI: The Immigration Law Centre 's former location at Tardeo's AC Market has become virtually untraceable amidst the building's numerous commercial establishments. The history of this office, which was used as a cover by David Headley with the help of Tahawwur Rana in plotting one of India's most devastating terror attacks, remains a sensitive topic with occupants of various premises in the market.From this office space, the Law Centre, established through Rana's financial support and Headley's planning, operated under the guise of helping workers obtain visas for North American countries. The premises were strategically chosen to facilitate Headley's surveillance activities across Mumbai and other Indian cities.Rana, who operated an immigration services office in Chicago, US, as a cover for terrorist activities, established a Mumbai branch here at the suggestion of his childhood friend Headley two years before the 26/11 attacks , following directives from their Pakistani handlers.According to Headley's court testimony, Rana provided financial backing for the office. Headley had hired a local woman to manage the office, who testified before the court later about Rana's visit to the office with a woman before the terror attacks.While the immigration office was opened ostensibly to help skilled and unskilled workers get visas for the US and Canada, Headley used it as a cover to visit India, meet his contact and do recce of the possible targets.Currently, the AC Market houses various commercial establishments, including advocates' chambers and those of immigration consultants. The building's narrow corridors lead to compact office spaces, with some units having just enough space for basic furniture.The office's operations began on Nov 1, 2006, following a formal agreement with the landlord by Headley. Financial transactions between Rana and Headley were conducted through IndusInd Bank's Nariman Point branch, with multiple transfers used for setting up the office and for the recce of possible terror targets.Present-day occupants of the AC Market offices, including new staff members and the society manager, maintain minimal knowledge about the tainted office's controversial past. Renovation of nearby office spaces and a regular turnover of tenants have contributed to the gradual erasure of this contentious past from local memory.Prior to the 26/11 attacks, Rana and his wife undertook extensive travels across India, visiting multiple cities including Delhi, Agra, Kochi, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Headley's last documented interaction at the premises was on July 16, 2008, when he secured an extension for the office licence.","The Immigration Law Centre's former location at Tardeo's AC Market has become virtually untraceable.

However, a brief but intense spell of rain accompanied by strong winds in the evening offered much-needed respite.The winds, gusting up to 50 kmph in parts of the city, brought the mercury down by a significant 6-10 degrees across most areas, said India Meteorological Department (IMD). The Met department predicted very light rain or drizzle on Friday and Saturday, with heatwave conditions unlikely till April 16.Parts of Delhi reeled under heatwave conditions for the fourth consecutive day.

The minimum temperature at Safdarjung stood at 25.9 degrees Celsius, six degrees above normal. It was also 0.3 degrees higher than Wednesday's minimum temperature, making it the highest minimum temperature in April in three years.

Krishnan was closely working with NIA when the extradition process began in 2019-20. He and his team also accompanied NIA to the US to present India's case, sources said, adding that he was assisting the team in an unofficial capacity due to US laws.""He was instrumental in segregating the offences to establish that India's case was different from what the US had prosecuted Rana for,"" said an NIA officer.In 2012, Krishnan was appointed as the special public prosecutor by Delhi Police for the trial in Nirbhaya gang rape-murder case.

"Tahawwur Rana arrested on arrival in India, appears before NIA court, sent to 18-day custody",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tahawwur-rana-arrested-on-arrival-in-india-appears-before-nia-court-sent-to-18-day-custody/articleshow/120177280.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , who played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives, was arrested by NIA here on Thursday after his arrival from US on a special flight.The Pakistani-Canadian terrorist was produced before special NIA judge Chander Jit Singh, who held an in-camera hearing on NIA counsel and special public prosecutor Narender Mann's plea for a 20-day remand. Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives.

Citing research that challenged the academic benefits of same-sex education, the memo acknowledged a changing educational landscape and called for feedback to help navigate a possible transition.""Over the years, many schools have made the transition to co-education,"" the document noted. ""Researchers claim that there is no significance of same-sex education on academic performance.""However, even before a dialogue could take shape, the memo had moved beyond its intended audience.

Social media is flooded with videos of people collapsing and dying suddenly while dancing, singing or just taking a walk, either due to cardiac arrest or heart attack - the conditions becoming more common in the under-40 age group.Recently at AIIMS, Dr Ambuj Roy, a senior cardiologist at the hospital, treated a 26-year-old man after he suffered a massive heart attack. He was physically fit and there was no history of any chronic illness but doctors found that he was a heavy smoker. ""People associate tobacco-use, whether it is a smokeless product or smoking, with lung diseases and cancer. But if you look at the statistics, number of deaths caused by heart diseases, where tobacco use is a culprit, is almost equivalent to the number of deaths caused by the other two diseases,"" Dr Roy said.His colleague, Dr Nitesh Naik, called for increased awareness to reduce modifiable risk factors, which can lead to serious heart conditions, including heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest. These risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and obesity. ""It is equally important for people aged 40 and above to undergo periodic health check-ups to screen for underlying heart diseases. Timely detection and intervention can reduce the risk of serious complications,"" he said.In the pilot's case, it is not yet clear what triggered cardiac arrest or sudden loss of heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. But the incident has triggered concerns regarding long work hours and stress among pilots. Several mechanisms have been postulated for linking stress with cardiovascular diseases, say doctors. This includes behavioural factors such as smoking, excess alcohol intake, lack of exercise, poor adherence to medications and increased heart rate and raised blood pressure. These factors, doctors add, may either individually or in combination lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with a higher degree of stress.","The death of a 28-year-old Air India Express pilot due to cardiac arrest, shortly after landing his flight in Delhi on Wednesday, has put the spotlight on rising incidents of sudden cardiac deaths among young people.

Poll How do you feel about Rekha Gupta's admission of past errors? I think it's too late I appreciate her honesty

‘I’m not the same person I was years ago’

Posters off, apologies on

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta has broken her silence on the backlash over her use of the word “thulla” in the Assembly last month, saying it was never meant to insult police personnel. In an interview with PTI, the 50-year-old leader acknowledged the criticism, admitted past errors, and said she’s “not fool-proof” but willing to evolve.“I used the word ‘thulla’ while narrating a story. It was not my intention to harm police personnel or jawans,” she said. “I have immense respect for them. They work 24 hours a day, often without rest or food, always just a phone call away.”The term “thulla” is commonly used as street slang to refer to beat cops in a derogatory manner. Gupta’s remark, made during a March 28 Assembly session, sparked sharp reactions from the Aam Aadmi Party, which called it an insult to the force.But Gupta, who led the BJP to power in Delhi after 26 years, is not shying away from accountability. “Sometimes we commit mistakes without any intention. What’s important is to accept them and ensure they are not repeated,” she said. “I don’t mind accepting my mistakes.”Responding to questions about her earlier aggressive posts on social media targeting opposition leaders, Gupta chalked them up to immaturity. “When we’re younger, we lack command over our language… as we grow, we mature,” she said. “It happens in everyone’s life. I’m no exception.”She added, “I’m a person who convinces others or gets convinced by them. I don’t believe in one-sided thinking.”In a candid admission, Gupta acknowledged that her own supporters may have contributed to the defacement of Delhi’s public walls with political posters in the past—something she’s now campaigning against.“When I realised how ugly Delhi looks with posters and wall-writings, I started by apologising to the people,” she said. “I’ve now asked all our MLAs and workers to stop this practice. We must move toward a clean and beautiful Delhi.”Gupta said she doesn’t see herself as a one-woman force trying to change the capital. “The vision for Viksit Delhi, Swachh Delhi, Swasth Delhi—it’s not just my mission. Every citizen must be a part of it.”","Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has broken her silence on the backlash over her use of the word “thulla” in the Assembly last month.

NEW DELHI: An Air India Express pilot suffered cardiac arrest at Delhi airport on Wednesday shortly after safely operating a flight from Srinagar and passed away. First officer Armaan, who was about 36 years of age and had recently got married, had operated Delhi-Srinagar-Delhi on Wednesday. After landing in Delhi, he went to the aircraft lav where he vomited. He collapsed in the forward galley and was taken to the airport medical centre by cabin crew and ground staff. He was then taken to a private hospital in Vasant Kunj but could not be saved.“We deeply regret the loss of a valued colleague due to a medical condition. Our thoughts are with the family during this time of profound grief. We are extending all possible assistance to them as we all cope with this tremendous loss. We request all concerned to respect privacy at this time and avoid unnecessary speculation while we commit to assisting the relevant authorities in due process,” an Air India Express spokesperson said.Armaan, who went by his first name only, had joined AI Express in 2023 from SpiceJet. He had flown for less than 12 hours in the last seven days, it is learnt.The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said in a statement there’s an urgent need to put in place transparent regulations that prioritise rest for pilots, safety and humane scheduling practices. The association, which represents over 800 pilots of various Indian carriers, has stressed the need for having comprehensive mental health support systems within airline organisations and not merely as checkboxes but as active, accessible, and stigma-free services. ALPA says the untimely death of Captain Armaan’s death raises troubling questions about pilot welfare, mental health, and working conditions in the Indian aviation industry.While not linking Armaan’s tragic death to fatigue, several pilots say they have for a long time been pleading for less strenuous working conditions in India. After a significant delay, slightly less strenuous flight duty time limitations (FDTL) rules — that govern key issues like how much a pilot can fly with what rest periods and limits on night flying — are set to be enforced from this summer.“Many pilots have lost their lives suddenly in last few years, especially post Covid, and we have been fighting for a more humane FDTL. We just hope nothing else delays implementation of the new rules, something which we have seen in the past. Well rested and not stressed pilots are key to safe flights,” said many senior pilots.","First officer Armaan, who was about 36 years of age and had recently got married, had operated Delhi-Srinagar-Delhi on Wednesday.

But the one which turned up before Supreme Court bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan a few days ago grabbed attention because it fell in the 'rarest of rare' category. It was filed by Enforcement Directorate which has been at the receiving end of rights-enforcement petitions.Though the anti-money laundering agency, through additional solicitor general S V Raju, withdrew the plea Tuesday, it will go down in court records for its extraordinariness. Appearing before the bench, Raju argued that ED also had rights. ""We expect you to be sensitive also to the rights of others,"" the bench reparteed on a lighter note.ED had filed the petition against alleged non-cooperation of Chhattisgarh police with its probe into the Rs 2,100 crore liquor 'scam' that unfolded under the then Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress govt in state. The plea was withdrawn, sources said, because Chhattisgarh police's approach changed after Congress's defeat in assembly polls. In fact, a subsequent affidavit filed by Chhattisgarh govt in Aug 2024, (after formation of a BJP govt in state), supported ED's allegation of nexus between Economic Offences Wing of Chhattisgarh police and one of the principal accused in the liquor 'scam', IAS officer Anil Tuteja .In its now-withdrawn petition, ED had cited ""evidence"" to claim that Chhattisgarh police had not just shared drafts of reports on the status of its investigation with Tuteja but had also agreed to carry out changes suggested by him. ED went on to say that Chhattisgarh police influenced a witness to retract his statement under PMLA. ""The purpose of sharing the draft (SIT report) was to seek approval from the accused persons before the same could be filed before (Chhattisgarh) HC,"" the fresh affidavit said.ED arrested Tuteja on April 21, 2024, after the agency claimed (in its remand note) that it had recovered digital evidence of the IAS officer allegedly receiving over Rs 14 crore from proceeds of crime. The agency subsequently seized Rs 16 crore of assets allegedly linked to Tuteja and his associates out of about Rs 200 crore of total attachments in the case. ED had submitted ""evidence"" of regular contact between Chhattisgarh police and Tuteja, including a WhatsApp chat purportedly between the IAS officer's son and and one of the members of the SIT, with the former sharing the advice of his father's counsel on how to draft the report on the status of investigation.In another purported exchange with Tuteja Jr, the then head of EOW and Anti-Corruption Bureau discussed ""efforts"" to influence witnesses to get them to depose in favour of the IAS officer.""The chats reveal role of successive chiefs of EOW/ACB in diluting the case against prime accused of predicate offence, Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla,"" the affidavit said, adding ""the draft report of SIT was vetted by the prime accused, Anil Tuteja, with the help of his advocate Peeyush Bhatia"".The affidavit also mentioned role of advocate general under Congress govt.","ED had filed the petition against alleged non-cooperation of Chhattisgarh police with its probe into the Rs 2,100 crore liquor'scam' That unfolded under the then Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress govt in state.

Centre cannot indefinitely withhold NREGS funds: Calcutta HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-cannot-indefinitely-withhold-nregs-funds-calcutta-hc/articleshow/120182389.cms,"KOLKATA: The central govt cannot indefinitely withhold MGNREGS funds, the Calcutta high court said on Thursday, asking why the rural employment guarantee scheme - stalled in West Bengal since 2022 - should not be implemented ""prospectively"".A division bench of Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice Chaitali Chatterjee (Das) directed Centre to submit an affidavit explaining why the scheme (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) should not be implemented in all districts of the state barring the four in which the state nodal officer had admitted ""misuse"" of funds.""A plain reading of the provision reveals there cannot be a permanent withholding of funds,"" the CJ observed, citing section 27(2) of the MGNREG Act. The rules allow the Union govt to suspend funds to a state pending an investigation, but also state that Centre should ""institute appropriate remedial measures for its proper implementation within a reasonable period of time"", he added.The bench also directed the state to file an affidavit stating why unemployment allowance should not be given to people who have remained jobless for the last three years, as provided in MGNREGA.The high court gave three weeks to both the Centre and the state govt to file their affidavits, and posted the matter for hearing on May 15. The release of MGNREGS funds to Bengal have been withheld since March 9, 2022.Chief Justice Sivagnanam noted that the both stakeholders found ""misuse"" and ""defalcation"" of funds in four districts - Hooghly, East Burdwan, Malda and Darjeeling GTA area. The state said more than Rs 2.37 crore has already been recovered from the four districts (out of Rs 5.37 crore).Additional solicitor general Asoke Kumar Chakraborty submitted that central teams inspected MGNREGS accounts in 15 districts, but the Chief Justice said the documents available with the court mention only four districts. He directed the Centre to bring on record whether it had made similar recommendations for districts other than the four.The CJ also wanted to know what measures the central govt would take to implement the scheme prospectively, and why it should not be renewed in districts other than the four where there had been misuse of funds. The bench then directed the Centre to clarify how it proposed to use the Rs 2.37 crore already recovered and deposited in the state nodal account of MGNREGS.","MGNREGS funds have been withheld since March 9, 2022.

India's natural gas consumption to rise 60% by 2030 under 'Good to Go' scenario,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-natural-gas-consumption-to-rise-60-by-2030-under-good-to-go-scenario/articleshow/120171022.cms,"India’s natural gas consumption is expected to climb by nearly 60 per cent by 2030, pushed by growing demand in the city gas distribution (CGD) sector and increased use across transport, cooking, and industry.A new study by the petroleum and natural gas regulatory board (PNGRB) revealed that daily gas consumption are likely to rise from 188 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in 2023–24 to 297 mmscmd by 2030 under the “Good-to-Go” scenario.This scenario assumed moderate economic growth and policy progress in line with current trends and government commitments. Looking further ahead, demand is projected to reach 496 mmscmd by 2040 under the same scenario.However, under a more optimistic “Good-to-Best” outlook, factoring in favourable policies, faster development, and greater investments, consumption could jump to 365 mmscmd by 2030 and hit 630 mmscmd by 2040.The CGD sector, which includeds supplying compressed natural gas (CNG) to vehicles and piped natural gas to homes and businesses, is set to be the biggest driver of demand. It is expected to account for 50 mmscmd of the 110 mmscmd incremental demand by 2030 and 129 mmscmd of the 198 mmscmd increase between 2030 and 2040 in the moderate growth scenario.“The CGD sector is expected to be the primary growth driver, with consumption projected to grow 2.5 to 3.5 times by 2030 and 6 to 7 times,” the study noted.India is targeting a rise in the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030, up from the current 6–6.5 per cent, as part of its efforts to shift towards cleaner energy and meet net-zero emission goals by 2070.So far, the PNGRB has awarded city gas licences covering 307 geographical areas (GAs), extending gas infrastructure to most parts of the country.Refineries and the petrochemical sector are also expected to see a rise in gas usage, helped by a growing focus on petrochemical integration. This sector is projected to account for an additional 21 mmscmd of gas demand by 2030, and another 10 mmscmd by 2040.While growth in power generation and fertiliser usage is expected to be moderate, given existing high consumption levels, the transition towards cleaner energy is expected to keep gas relevant in both sectors.India currently imports around half of its gas needs, a reliance that is set to increase as demand outpaces domestic production. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports are projected to more than double by 2030.The study highlights the potential of LNG in reducing diesel usage in long-haul transport, noting, “LNG as a long-haul transportation fuel could be a game changer, with the potential to play a pivotal role in replacing diesel. LNG trucking is projected to gain momentum post 2030, with the potential to emulate China’s success in reducing diesel dependency,” PTI quoted.With global LNG supply expected to increase, the report suggests this could present India with an opportunity for long-term supply deals at more competitive prices.However, the PNGRB warned that several risks remain. “Achieving India’s projected natural gas targets for 2030 and 2040 will require a continued commitment from entities towards infrastructure expansion, favourable LNG pricing, and conducive policies,” the study said. “However, geopolitics, policy uncertainty, and volatility in gas prices cannot be ignored.”From 2015-16 to 2023-24, India’s natural gas consumption rose by 45 per cent, from 131 mmscmd to 188 mmscmd. While power sector demand contracted slightly due to sensitivity to price changes, CGD usage more than doubled, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12 per cent. The fertiliser sector saw 3.4% annual growth, while the refinery sector posted 1.8 per cent.",India’s natural gas consumption is expected to climb by nearly 60 per cent by 2030. The city gas distribution (CGD) sector is set to be the biggest driver of demand.

'Govt will hang Tahawwur Rana during Bihar polls'

NEW DELHI: Who should take the credit for the successful extradition of Mumbai terror attacks accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana? Prime Minister Modi-led NDA government or the Congress-led UPA government? Ironically, even before the special flight carrying Rana from US to India had landed - the BJP and the Congress engaged in a bitter tussle to claim credit.BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla claimed Rana's extradition was a ""big achievement"" of the Modi government and its security agencies. ""This extradition is not an ordinary extradition. This is a reflection of new India's resolve which Prime Minister Narendra Modi had described in 2019, saying that if anyone dared to attack India's unity, integrity, respect and its innocent people, the new India would bring such terrorists to justice,"" Poonawalla said.The BJP spokesperson said Rana was being brought back to make him face justice due to a ""sea change"" in the ""attitude and mindset"" of the government under Modi towards terrorism and terror attacks.Union minister and BJP leader Piyush Goyal also joined the debate and said the Congress did not do anything to punish the terrorists and the extradition was possible because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “foremost and paramount commitment” to India’s national security and national interest.However, the Congress was quick to counter BJP's claim and asserted that the Modi government merely benefited from the consistent and strategic diplomacy that was begun under the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government (2004-2014).""Let the facts be clear: the Modi government did not initiate this process, nor did it secure any new breakthrough. It merely benefited from the mature, consistent, and strategic diplomacy begun under the UPA. This extradition is not the result of any grandstanding, it is a testament to what the Indian state can achieve when diplomacy, law enforcement, and international cooperation are pursued sincerely and without any kind of chest-thumping,"" senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said.The Congress leader traced the origins of the extradition efforts back to 2009 when the UPA government, under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, took a significant step by registering a case against Rana and his co-conspirator, David Coleman Headley, in New Delhi.Another Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar claimed that the extradition of Tahawwur Rana from the US was a ploy by the BJP to ""divert"" attention of the public from the “failure” of the central government to fulfill its promises.""Since the BJP has no achievement worth the name, it tries to divert public issues under one pretext or the other,"" Kanhaiya said.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut gave an interesting twist to the debate as he claimed that the government will hang Tahawwur Hussain Rana during the Bihar elections due later this year.""Rana should be immediately hanged but he will be hanged during the Bihar polls (scheduled later this year),"" Raut told PTI. Raut said there was a 16-year-old battle to bring Rana to India and it started during the Congress rule. ""So no one should take the credit of bringing back Rana,"" Raut said.The Shiv Sena (UBT) leader also demanded that Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was captured in 2016 and was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged spying, be brought back home.While the NIA and other investigative agencies work round the clock to ensure that Rana is punished for his acts, political parties will continue to fight for credit to maximise their electoral gains. Perhaps the credit for this success should be given to the agencies that have worked over the years to bring Rana to India.","BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla claimed Rana's extradition was a ""big achievement"" of the Modi government and its security agencies.

CJI Dipak Misra: Singapore Supreme Court Quashes 'Copy-Pasted' Arbitration Award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/singapore-sc-quashes-ex-cji-dipak-misras-copy-pasted-arbitration-award/articleshow/120141717.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment, Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) set up to manage dedicated freight corridors in India after finding that the tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.Though the tribunal also comprised MP HC ex-Chief Justice K K Lahoti and ex-CJ of J&K HC Gita Mittal, a Singapore SC bench led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said since the other two were not part of the earlier awards, it couldn't be ascertained whether they were even aware of Misra's ""copy-paste"" job.The Singapore SC was firm that the copying compromised the integrity of the arbitration process and thus it did not adhere to the ""principles of natural justice"".The court said, ""The patently substantial material derived from parallel arbitrations were extraneous considerations that hadn't been raised to the parties' attention. The material formed such a pervasive part of the award that it simply could not be overlooked. It was plain that it was neither contemplated nor agreed to by the parties that the award could be prepared by such a process. We agree with the (Singapore HC) judge there had been a breach of the fair hearing rule.""By its award dated Nov 24, 2023, the Justice Misra-led tribunal had ruled in favour of the three firms which formed a consortium to bag the contract for Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Aug 2015. A dispute arose because of the Indian govt's decision to raise labour wages, leading to the consortium demanding more money which was contested by the SPV, and the matter was referred to the Justice Misra-led arbitration tribunal.Upholding the Singapore HC's decision to set aside the award, Justices Menon and Steven Chong in a 40-page judgment analysed the award, found it plagued by copying and in breach of the principles of natural justice. The Justice Menon-led bench accepted the SPV's arguments and rejected those of the consortium.The SPV contended that Justice Misra, during the arbitration, had used extensive material derived from parallel arbitrations. ""It is also common ground that the award was not drafted afresh. Rather, the parallel awards were used as templates, with adjustments made to account for what were thought to be the specificities of the arbitration,"" the Singapore SC said.CJ Menon said the SPV had abandoned some of the submissions made in the parallel arbitrations and replaced these with new arguments unique to the arbitration at hand. ""These new arguments arose because of the slightly different factual matrix presented by the arbitration: for instance, the difference in the length of delay between the issuance of the notification and the consortium's claim allowed the SPV to make additional arguments on estoppel,"" he said.""Despite this, the parallel awards were used as templates in drafting the award to a very substantial degree. It is undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs from the parallel awards were retained in the 451-paragraph award. This has several implications,"" the Singapore SC said.""We also consider that the expectation of equality between the arbitrators was compromised. While, as we have noted, there is no evidence as to what transpired between the members of the tribunal, it is known that the two co-arbitrators in this case were not privy to the parallel arbitrations. They would thus have had no direct access to any material or knowledge derived from those proceedings, but which appeared to have significantly influenced the outcome of the present arbitration. The integrity of the arbitration was, therefore, further compromised as a result,"" it said.",Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV) The tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120142141,imgsize-543479,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. The online harassment Kayla faced intensified, with people comparing her to Swift, questioning her worth, and making cruel comments. She confessed that this hate still affects her to this day, despite having done nothing to deserve it.Kayla Nicole, who once interned at TMZ and the Oprah Winfrey Network before launching her own media brand, is now opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success.

Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety.

Wayne Gretzky's attendance sparks unrelated controversy



Alex Ovechkin Breaks Gretzky's Record for Most Goals in NHL History 🚨

Wayne Gretzky faces backlash over Kash Patel appearance



Alex Ovechkin etched his name into NHL history, scoring his 895th goal to surpass Wayne Gretzky ’s all-time record. But what should’ve been a celebration of hockey greatness took an unexpected turn. The spotlight drifted from the ice to the stands, specifically to Gretzky’s guest, Kash Patel . The former government official’s appearance sparked a wave of political chatter, clouding what was meant to be a milestone moment in the sport.Here’s what happened: Gretzky, invited to witness Ovechkin’s history-making night, was spotted at recent Capitals games alongside Patel, a former U.S. government official with Republican ties. That detail, insignificant to some, became headline fodder across social media.Suddenly, instead of reflecting on the end of one era and the start of another, online chatter shifted to whether Gretzky’s presence next to Patel carried political weight. Some fans, particularly from Canada, voiced disappointment, questioning Gretzky’s silence on past political issues and reading into his choice of company.Frank Seravalli, a respected NHL insider, thought so. He was quick to dismiss the controversy, reminding fans that Patel isn’t some outsider looking for a photo op—he’s a longtime hockey guy with actual time on the ice. According to Seravalli, dragging Gretzky into a political debate during a celebratory hockey moment is a misfire.Let’s not forget what actually happened on the ice. Ovechkin scored a power-play goal in the second period against the Islanders, a goal that not only broke Gretzky’s record but redefined the ceiling for future scorers.Gretzky handled the moment with quiet grace. He didn’t make it about himself. He didn’t push a narrative. He showed up, clapped, and passed the torch with a short message that was more personal than political. “I know how hard it is to get to 895,” he said, reflecting on his own kids being close in age to Ovechkin’s when he set the record.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin’s record ignites nostalgia as Penguins’ Mike Sullivan remembers legends who built NHL It was hockey history in real time. But somehow, the conversation drifted.Maybe it’s time to let moments like this breathe. Not everything needs to be filtered through a political lens. Sometimes, two hockey legends crossing paths should be just that, a handoff, not a headline.","Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th goal to surpass Wayne Gretzky's all-time record.

Internet swoons as Brittany Mahomes posts sweet moment of Bronze saying his real name at age two



Brittany and Patrick Mahomes are giving fans another heartwarming glimpse into their growing family, this time with a rare and adorable appearance by their 2-year-old son, Bronze. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and his wife, Brittany, are never shy about sharing special moments with their children, but this recent video truly struck a chord with fans.On April 8, Brittany Mahomes took to Instagram Stories to post a touching clip of her and Bronze enjoying some outdoor time. In the video, Brittany gently asks her toddler, “What’s your name?” With a shy grin, he replies, “Bronzie.” When prompted about his real name, the little boy proudly responds, “Patrick Mahomes Three,” holding up three tiny fingers. A glowing Brittany smiles and responds with, “Nice job.”Though the couple often refers to their son by his nickname, Bronze, his full name—Patrick Lavon Mahomes III—is a meaningful tribute to his father. Patrick Mahomes has long envisioned passing down his name, once sharing, “I've thought about that since I was really like five, six years old.” The nickname “Bronze” not only creates a unique identity for their son but also keeps with a fun family tradition. Their two dogs are named Steel and Silver, and their daughters, Sterling Skye and Golden Raye, also have metallic-inspired names.The sweet exchange between Brittany and Bronze wasn’t just confined to her Instagram. Patrick also reshared the video, accompanied by three “A-OK” emojis, proudly acknowledging the moment. It’s clear that this family cherishes every milestone, no matter how small.During a January appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Brittany joked about using Bronze’s formal name, saying, “I have to say his real name or his dad will get mad,” further confirming just how personal the name is for Patrick. It’s evident the couple puts thought and meaning into every aspect of their children’s lives.The Mahomes family has had an eventful start to 2025, recently welcoming their third child, Golden Raye, just weeks before Patrick competed in his fifth Super Bowl. Despite the Chiefs’ tough loss to the Eagles, Patrick’s message to fans was one of humility and determination. “I let ya’ll down today… I’ll always continue to work and try and learn and be better for it.”Through all the highs and lows—on and off the field—Brittany and Patrick Mahomes remain grounded in family. Their latest video with Bronze not only showcases a touching parenting moment but also reminds fans of the values that truly matter to them: love, legacy, and connection.Also Read: Rookie QB Caleb Williams already feeling the pressure from Ben Johnson’s coaching style","Brittany and Patrick Mahomes' 2-year-old son, Bronze, says his real name.

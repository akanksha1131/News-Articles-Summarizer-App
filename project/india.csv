Heat-related deaths up 23% globally since 1990s: Lancet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heat-related-deaths-up-23-globally-since-1990s-lancet/articleshow/124886275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Failure to curb the warming effects of climate change has seen the rate of heat-related deaths surge 23% since the 1990s, reaching an estimated 5,46,000 yearly deaths globally on average between 2012-21, according to Lancet Countdown Report on Health and Climate Change.Air pollution from wildfire smoke (PM 2.5) was linked to a record 1,54,000 deaths in 2024 alone, said the report. Underlining how the continued over-reliance on fossil fuels and failure to adapt to climate change is being paid for in people's lives, health and livelihoods, the report said the air pollution resulting from the continued burning of fossil fuels has resulted in a staggering 2.5 million deaths globally every year.It also said the global average transmission potential of dengue has risen by up to 49% since the 1950s, and linked even such a rise in India during 2015-24, compared to 1951-1960, to climate change.On India, the report, released Wednesday, said there were over 17,18,000 deaths attributable to anthropogenic air pollution (PM2.5) in 2022, an increase of 38% since 2010, whereas fossil fuels (coal and liquid gas) contributed to 7,52,000 (44%) of the deaths while coal alone accounted for 3,94,000 deaths, primarily from its use in power plants (2,98,000 deaths).It added the use of petrol for road transportation contributed to 2,69,000 deaths in India in 2022. ""In 2020-2024, wildfire smoke (PM2.5) was accountable for an annual average of 10,200 deaths in India, up by 28% from 2003-2012,"" it said.""In 2022, household air pollution due to the use of polluting fuels in India was associated with 113 deaths per 1,00,000. Mortality rates associated with household air pollution were higher in rural than urban areas...""India has, however, contested such findings, saying there is no conclusive data available to establish a direct correlation of death exclusively with air pollution. ""Air pollution is one of the many factors affecting respiratory ailments and associated diseases. Health is impacted by a number of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc. , of individuals apart from the environment,"" environment ministry has told Parliament a number of times on the question of linking deaths exclusively with air pollution.Authored by 128 experts, the report noted the continued dependence on fossil fuels also puts an unbearable strain on countries' budgets, with govts collectively spending $956 billion on net fossil fuel subsidies in 2023. ""In 2024, people in India were exposed to 19.8 heatwave days each, on average. Of these, 6.6 days of exposure would not have been expected to occur without climate change,"" said the report, while noting how it impacted labour hours and posed a moderate or higher risk of heat stress during moderate outdoor activity.It said heat exposure resulted in a loss of 247 billion potential labour hours in 2024, a record high of 419 hour per person, and 124% more than in 1990-1999, in India.",The rate of heat-related deaths has risen 23% since the 1990s.

"Chinese behind most crypto, loan app rip-offs: ED report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chinese-behind-most-crypto-loan-app-rip-offs-ed-report/articleshow/124886084.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the magnitude of cybercrime and the number of its victims continue to rise and has warranted Supreme Court's intervention, a report prepared by Enforcement Directorate shows that while domestic players have been primarily engaged in digital arrest and other such frauds, Chinese nationals have almost acquired dominance over loan app- and cryptocurrency-related rip-offs.The agency has already initiated a probe in many of these cases involving Chinese fraudsters, and an estimated Rs 28,000 crore in crime proceeds has been identified.The involvement of Chinese nationals and their control over illegal loan apps came to light after ED started probing LoanPro, FastCredit, SmartRupee and other similar loan apps over the past few years. The money trail in these cases showed that thousands of people were tricked across more than 20 states in the country. Many were bullied and blackmailed when they failed to meet the stringent repayment conditions, even leading to suicides.While these illegal ""instant loan"" apps charged hefty platform fees in the range of 30-40% of total loan amount, deducted at the time of disbursement, the term of the credit extended from 7 to 15 days.While Chinese nationals were found to be controlling these syndicates from abroad, their Indian associates ran the operations in the country from behind a veil of NBFCs and fintech and shell entities for laundering the crime proceeds.Indian and foreign payment gateways were also found involved in facilitating these transactions - some of them have already been questioned by the central agency.In many cases, the crime proceeds were converted into cryptocurrencies and siphoned off to China. In other cases, the perpetrators routed the booty as payments for fake imports from Hong Kong and other Chinese territories.According to the probe agency, these apps used a consortium of Chinese seed capital, NBFCs, fintech companies and payment aggregators. Shinebay Technologies, for instance, operated loan apps (LoanPro, FastCredit, SmartRupee, etc) that lent money at exorbitant interest rates for 7-15 days terms. Borrowers paid 30-40% of the loan amount at time of disbursement as platform fees. Private phone data of borrowers were hacked and used for blackmail in case of default, leading to several cases of suicide.In the case of HPZ Token, a cryptocurrency mining scheme, at least 10 Chinese nationals were found to have collected over Rs 2,200 crore from people across 20 states, and the alleged 'proceeds of crime' were sent out using payment gateways. As much as Rs 500 crore of this was frozen by ED with payment gateways after the scam was unearthed.In a case where investors were offered very high returns on investments using an online app 'LOXAM', the probe agency in July this year arrested a money changer who was found to have assisted a Chinese national in remittance of more than Rs 900 crore of ""proceeds of crime"" out of the country in a matter of just seven months.The arrested accused, Rohit Vij, converted Rs 903 crore into foreign currencies through his Ranjan Money Corp and KDS Forex, and helped Chinese national take the money out of the country.",Chinese nationals have almost acquired dominance over loan app- and cryptocurrency-related rip-offs.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana HC said a soldier wounded when he fell into a nullah while searching for terrorists during a counter-insurgency operation was entitled to war injury benefits, adding even accidental injury in action in an operational area was treated as a battle casualty.A division bench of Justice Harsimran Singh and Justice Vikas Suri HC passed the order while dismissing a petition filed by central govt challenging a Nov 22, 2023, order of Chandigarh bench of Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT), granting war injury pension to Havildar Sanjeeb Kumar.Centre's counsel argued although Havildar Sanjeeb was permanently released under low medical category on Nov 30, 2020, for 'fracture distal radius' (wrist fracture) and granted disability pension, AFT's order of war injury pension was incorrect. Soldier's counsel contended he was searching for terrorists during his counter-insurgency duty along the Line of Control when he fell into Panar Nullah and got injured.After hearing both parties, HC held operations specifically notified by govt from time to time had been treated under Category E, and any disability arising out of these operations had to be treated as 'battle casualty'. ""Counsel for petitioners (central govt) has not been able to rebut the fact that the soldier was posted in Operation Rakshak on Line of Control between India and Pakistan, notified by govt of India.

"Indian detentions on US border drop 62%, lowest in four years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-detentions-on-us-border-drop-62-lowest-in-four-years/articleshow/124885910.cms,"34,000 Caught Between Oct ’24 And Sept ’25

AHMEDABAD: US Customs and Border Protection intercepted 34,146 Indian nationals attempting illegal entry between Oct last year and this Sept, marking a 62% drop from 90,415 detentions during the previous fiscal. This constitutes the sharpest drop over the past four years in the number of Indians caught trying to enter the US illegally.Data released by the agency on Oct 28 shows Indian nationals now account for a significantly smaller share of total border detentions, compared to earlier years. In Sept, the final month of the US fiscal, authorities intercepted 1,147 Indians. In FY22, Indians accounted for 63,927 interceptions. The latest data is 47% lower.According to the report, total ""encounters"" on the US borders stood at 2.9 million in FY 2024, lower than the 3.2 million recorded in 2023, but marginally higher than the 2.7 million in 2022.Single adults made up the largest share of Indian nationals intercepted during FY25, totalling 31,480. Beside 2,552 family units, authorities detained 91 unaccompanied children and 23 minors travelling with adults.Immigration agents in north and central Gujarat, notorious for facilitating what are euphemistically called ""dunki routes"", seem to have slowed operations as families increasingly reconsider risks after the deaths of a family from Dingucha along the US-Canada border in 2022 and another near the Rio Grande in 2023.Officials identified the presence of minors at borders as an ""ongoing humanitarian concern"". The 91 unaccompanied children intercepted in FY25 reflect continued attempts by families relying on smuggling networks to send children in the hope of lenient treatment from US authorities.Migration researchers said the trend highlights both geopolitical enforcement changes and shifting aspirations. ""The American route is still viewed as a life-changing gamble. The decline in numbers does not mean the desire has ended - only that the risks have become clearer and costlier,"" a senior immigration official said.Employment stagnation in India, higher education aspirations and dollar-remittance dreams continue to draw aspirants, albeit with increased caution. The decline in detentions also reflects stricter border enforcement by US authorities, growing awareness about risks in migration-prone states like Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana, and changing smuggling patterns, officials said.","US Customs and Border Protection intercepted 34,146 Indian nationals attempting illegal entry between Oct last year and this Sept.

8th Pay Commission : Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, The government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to assess and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.

KAKINADA (ANDHRA PRADESH): Cyclonic storm Montha in Bay of Bengal was on Monday headed towards Andhra Pradesh, where it’s expected to cross the coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam after making a landfall near Kakinada around midnight on Tuesday before moving towards southern Odisha.The season’s first major storm, currently centred over west-central Bay of Bengal and moving northnorthwestward, is expected to intensify into a “severe cyclonic storm” before making landfall with wind speeds of 90-100 kilometres per hour and gusts up to 110 kmph.Andhra Pradesh govt has put the districts of Kakinada, Konaseema, West Godavari, Eluru and East Godavari on high alert.

The layoff ledger: Who’s cutting back



Amazon has announced 14,000 corporate job cuts , around 4% of its workforce, redirecting funds to its swelling investments in artificial intelligence. CEO Andy Jassy’s cost-cutting spree continues to reshape the company’s once-sprawling human infrastructure.

UPS has slashed 48,000 jobs this year, closing 93 operational facilities as it struggles to realign with reduced shipping volumes and global trade slowdowns.

Target has let go of 1,800 employees, roughly 8% of its corporate workforce, in what it calls a move to “streamline decisions.”

Nestlé is cutting 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years, citing rising commodity prices and tariff headwinds as major pressure points.

Lufthansa Group plans to eliminate 4,000 positions by 2030, shifting administrative work toward digital platforms and AI-based systems.

Novo Nordisk has announced 9,000 layoffs, 11% of its workforce, even as demand for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy soars.

ConocoPhillips is reducing up to a quarter of its global staff, part of a massive restructuring effort amid fluctuating oil prices and rising production costs.

Intel, caught in the semiconductor race, is shrinking its “core” workforce from 99,500 to 75,000 through layoffs and attrition.

Microsoft, after laying off 6,000 earlier this year, has followed with another 9,000 job cuts, most within its gaming and management divisions.

Procter & Gamble plans to reduce its workforce by 7,000 employees, blaming tariff hikes and rising operational expenses.

The human cost of efficiency

Staying afloat in a shifting tide



Relearn and reinvent

Build a personal brand

Cultivate financial foresight

Stay connected, stay human

Prioritize mental balance

A new definition of work

The hum of the global job market has dimmed to an uneasy silence. For millions, the comforting rhythm of employment has been interrupted by pink slips and hiring freezes. Once-booming industries, from tech to transport, now speak the language of “restructuring” and “efficiency. ” Beneath these corporate euphemisms lie anxious workers and uncertain futures.Amid this turbulence, the US economy seems suspended in a delicate balance, a “no-hire, no-fire” limbo, as analysts describe it. Companies are treading carefully, expanding only in niche roles while tightening belts elsewhere. The reason? A complex blend of geopolitics, tariffs, automation, and shifting consumer habits.And for those within federal offices, the picture is just as grim. Since President Donald Trump’s return to office, the public sector has seen thousands of job cuts, compounded by a government shutdown nearing its fourth week, leaving many without pay and all without answers.The corporate landscape tells a sobering story. Across sectors, giants have tightened their grip on spending, and, by extension, their payrolls.Across these names, spanning continents and industries, a single narrative emerges: Survival.Behind each layoff statistic lies a life disrupted, a mortgage unpaid, a child’s college plan deferred, a confidence quietly bruised. For many, it’s not just about losing a paycheck but a sense of purpose. The psychological fallout of unemployment, experts say, can rival that of grief.Economists argue that these job cuts, while painful, are not purely acts of desperation. They are also recalibrations, necessary responses to shifting market realities. But for those caught in the crossfire, pragmatism offers little comfort.In a job market increasingly ruled by automation, volatility, and unpredictability, resilience has become the new currency. Yet resilience doesn’t mean blind optimism. It means adaptation, strategic, informed, and human.The days when a single skill could last a lifetime are gone. Upskilling is no longer optional; it’s survival. Professionals must invest in continuous learning, be it AI literacy, data interpretation, or communication refinement. Platforms like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and company-sponsored programmes offer powerful avenues to reinvent one’s skillset.In uncertain times, visibility matters. Maintaining a strong digital footprint through professional networking platforms, industry writing, or mentorship can make a worker stand out in crowded applicant pools. Authenticity, not self-promotion, wins in the long run.When job security wavers, financial security cushions the blow. Experts recommend building an emergency fund covering at least six months of expenses and diversifying income streams, whether through consulting, freelancing, or passive investments.Networking isn’t transactional, it’s relational. During layoffs and transitions, emotional support often comes from peers, former colleagues, or industry circles. Nurturing these connections can open unforeseen doors when algorithms fall silent.Job loss or instability can take a toll on mental health. Seeking therapy, joining professional support groups, or even volunteering can provide perspective and restore a sense of control in uncertain times.The job market of today isn’t broken; it’s transforming. What it demands is not just technical competence but emotional intelligence, adaptability, and a willingness to evolve with the tide.As companies recalibrate and economies shift, one truth endures: The human spirit, flexible, inventive, and deeply resilient, remains the most irreplaceable asset of all.In the end, staying afloat is not merely about surviving layoffs or recessions. It’s about reimagining work itself and finding purpose even when the current pulls hardest.","Amazon has announced 14,000 corporate job cuts, around 4% of its workforce.

(With PTI inputs)

Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Friday announced that October 27 (Monday) will be a government holiday to mark Chhath Puja . The decision coincides with the festival’s third day, considered the most sacred, when devotees gather along riversides and ponds to offer prayers to the setting sun.The holiday also recognises the festival’s cultural and spiritual importance, reflecting its emphasis on faith, devotion, and the harmony between humans and nature. Chhath Puja is observed through rituals that celebrate purity, gratitude towards nature, and environmental awareness, making it one of the most significant festivals in Delhi’s social calendar. Chhath Puja School Holidays will be observed in all Delhi schools, as per the official government announcement.The Delhi government has mobilised preparations at over 1,300 Chhath ghats across the city. Seventeen model ghats along the Yamuna are being upgraded with improved facilities, including tents, lighting, toilets, drinking water, and enhanced security, to ensure devotees can perform rituals comfortably and safely.During an inspection at Pochanpur Chhath Ghat in Dwarka Sector 23B, CM Rekha Gupta, accompanied by MLA Sandeep Sahrawat and members of the Chhath Puja Committee, oversaw decoration and maintenance activities, according to media reports.The initiative emphasised citizen participation alongside government efforts to turn the festival into a city-wide celebration of cultural unity.The government’s ongoing Yamuna cleaning work has been progressing over the past eight months, showing visible improvements in water quality. Coordination with neighbouring states Haryana and Uttar Pradesh has been central to the initiative, with the city administration aiming to combine environmental responsibility with festival arrangements.Earlier on Friday, the CM inaugurated a newly constructed Chhath ghat and other development projects worth ₹30 crore in Laxmi Nagar. The initiative also recognised the contributions of the Purvanchal community to Delhi’s socio-economic growth.For Chhath Puja 2025, there is no official confirmation of a public holiday in other parts of NCR including Noida or Gurugram. However, schools in both cities are likely to remain closed, following the common practice of observing regional festivals. Residents and parents are advised to check with individual schools for final closure details.With the government holiday and upgraded facilities across the Capital, Delhi is set for a large-scale Chhath celebration, blending devotion, civic planning, and environmental consciousness.","The Delhi government has mobilised preparations at over 1,300 Chhath ghats across the city.

After Germany, Canada Aims To Lure Indian Tech Talent Amid Trump’s H-1B Visa Fee Hike

Targeting tech talent amid US visa hurdles



Continuity and challenges in immigration policy



A strategic pivot towards global competitiveness

Conclusion

Canada is set to revamp its immigration strategy, aiming to establish itself as a global hub for highly skilled talent, Prime Minister Mark Carney indicated in a recent address, according to media reports. He stated that the forthcoming federal budget would introduce a comprehensive immigration plan tailored to align Canada’s intake with its workforce requirements and overall capacity. Carney highlighted that the initiative would not only streamline entry for newcomers but also nurture innovation through dedicated skills training and apprenticeship programmes.The prime minister further explained that the plan would specifically target scientists, innovators, and professionals in high-demand sectors. He asserted that the government’s approach was designed “to do better, for newcomers, for everyone,” signaling a strategic pivot toward attracting talent that can drive economic growth and technological advancement in the country.Carney’s focus on tech talent comes against the backdrop of recent US policy changes. The administration of President Donald Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, creating uncertainty and frustration among companies that rely on global talent for programming, engineering, and other critical roles.According to Carney, Canada is considering measures to attract professionals who might have otherwise pursued opportunities in the United States, particularly those affected by the H-1B visa policy shift. It is a way to draw skilled employees who once turned to south of the border, signaling Canada’s intent to position itself as the preferred destination for top-tier innovators.While promising innovation-driven reforms, Carney has maintained several immigration caps introduced by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. These measures were initially intended to curb the rapid influx of foreign students and temporary workers, following Canada’s population surge, which had become one of the fastest in the developed world.Carney now faces the dual challenge of expanding opportunities for highly skilled migrants while rebuilding public trust in immigration policies. Public support for immigration has fallen to historic lows amid concerns over the cost of living, housing affordability, and stagnant wages, particularly affecting younger Canadians.Experts suggest that Carney’s approach signals a broader vision: Positioning Canada as a global hub for high-skilled talent, particularly in science and technology. With global mobility increasingly influenced by political shifts, Canada’s new immigration plan represents both an opportunity and a test. Success will hinge on the government’s ability to attract the right talent, integrate newcomers effectively, and maintain public confidence in the country’s economic and social fabric.Canada’s immigration strategy under Mark Carney is poised to blend pragmatism with ambition. By targeting high-skilled professionals and aligning immigration with workforce needs, the government hopes to stimulate innovation, fill critical labour gaps, and ensure the country remains a global magnet for talent, all while navigating the complex realities of domestic economic pressures and shifting public opinion.","Canada is set to revamp its immigration strategy, aiming to establish itself as a global hub for highly skilled talent.

Andhra Braces for Cyclone Montha Landfall; IMD Warns of Heavy Rain, Strong Winds

Sea turns violent in Kakinada, floods homes, tears up roads

KAIKNADA/BHUBANESWAR: Cyclone Montha roared ashore on the eastern coast Tuesday night, slamming into Andhra Pradesh between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam near Kakinada with winds topping 100km an hour and sheets of rain that ripped through towns, snapped power lines, and sent waves surging 10ft high.The season's first major cyclone made landfall as a severe storm around 7.30pm, its crossing lasting nearly 4 hours. Trees lay strewn across highways, power poles twisted in the wind, and rescue teams battled driving rain to clear the roads. A woman died in Makanapalem village of Mamidikuduru mandal when a tree crashed onto her home.Across the border in Odisha, Montha's outer bands brought torrential rain and winds up to 100kmph through Ganjam and Gajapati districts, blocking roads and toppling trees. No casualties were reported, but landslides cut off stretches of R Udayagiri, Parlakhemundi, Huma, and Kashipur.The sea turned violent at Uppada in Kakinada district, flooding homes and tearing up the coastal road. Police sealed the Kakinada-Uppada beach road after waves breached embankments. As the cyclone's eye passed inland, thousands huddled in shelters, waiting for the storm to pass. Over 10,000 Andhra residents, mostly fishing families, were evacuated from 65 villages in 12 coastal mandals before landfall.Kakinada district collector S Shan Mohan said two NDRF teams and one SDRF unit were in the field, backed by 200 swimmers and 140 boats. ""Helipads have been kept ready to airlift people from submerged areas as and when required,"" he said. More than 12,000 people took shelter in 76 cyclone relief centres. Nearly 1,000 heads of cattle were moved to safer ground.Eight flights were cancelled at Rajahmundry airport, disrupting connections to Tirupati, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai.In Odisha, state govt opened over 2,000 cyclone shelters and deployed 158 emergency teams - five NDRF, 30 ODRAF, and 123 fire service units - to lead rescue and relief work. CM Mohan Majhi reviewed operations and said that 11,000 vulnerable people had been moved to safety under the ""zero casualty"" mission. ""Another 30,000 could be evacuated if conditions worsen,"" he said.Deputy chief minister KV Singhdeo said crop damage was extensive and promised aid once district reports arrive within a week.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said Montha's impact would linger through Wednesday, bringing heavy to extremely heavy rainfall to southern Odisha before weakening over Chhattisgarh. Wind speeds could reach 80kmph as the system moves inland.Regional IMD chief Manorama Mohanty said rainfall will taper off by Friday, with lingering showers Thursday in interior Odisha.","The season's first major cyclone made landfall as a severe storm around 7.30pm, its crossing lasting nearly 4 hours.

Battle for Bihar: Sanjay Jha Reaffirms NDA Will Fight Assembly Polls Under Nitish Kumar's Leadership

NEW DELHI: In the run up to Bihar assembly poll announcement, Nitish Kumar was seen as NDA's weak link - his fitness under scrutiny, focus on CM's gaffes in and outside legislatures, the image of 'sushashan babu' fraying as sensational murders and collapse of bridges made national headlines allowing RJD-led Mahagathbandhan to home in on him.Halfway into the campaign, his challenger Tejashwi Yadav of RJD was goading voters by claiming that BJP will not repeat Nitish as CM if NDA retains power. But, as if on cue, BJP member and deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary said he will remain the CM, its poll in-charge and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan insisted there is no vacancy for CM's post and other allies like Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi endorsed his leadership.As polling day nears, the JD(U) president remains not only NDA's most dependable face in state, but also someone whom large sections continue to look up to. His party's strength has declined in the assembly over successive elections but he continues to be seen as the alliance's most assured bridge to victory.His arch rival Lalu Prasad's derisive sobriquet of 'Paltu Ram', a colloquial turn on his frequent switches between the two rival alliances in state, appeared to have stuck for a while.But what has endured for his supporters is his deliverance of Bihar from the 15-year govt of Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi, a period dubbed as 'jungle raj' by NDA for its alleged lawlessness and retreat of state from various spheres of public life.Nitish is credited for restoration of basics of governance in his 20-long years in office, save for nine months of Jitan Ram Manjhi between 2014 and 2015. A quality road network, reliable power supply with electricity reaching almost every village by 2016, state's turn to the rule of law, and partial gains in school education and healthcare, at least at primary level, are considered undeniable successes of his era.While a sense of fatigue, poor employment opportunities with little let-up in migration from the state, and public frustration of those who want the state to have more than basic necessities pose a big challenge to him, what helps him is that the opposition's chief ministerial face Tejashwi continues to be weighed down with the legacy of his father.BJP's support is a big help as it ensures support of vocal upper castes and non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs among whom the saffron party has steadily made inroads. PM Narendra Modi has been warning voters in his rallies and virtual interactions against the return of 'jungle raj' of RJD, while offering wholehearted endorsement of Nitish.Lalu had famously said he might not have given people 'swarg' (heaven) but did render them 'swar' (voice), a suggestion that RJD govt empowered socially-deprived classes even though it scored poorly on governance. Nitish is seen to have succeeded in broadening the empowerment tent by pivoting govt's welfare focus to EBCs and most-deprived of Scheduled Castes, and provided an efficient administration as well. Focus on governance, building of infrastructure and a push for welfare schemes and empowerment initiatives like quotas for women and EBCs seem to be cushioning against attempts to turn his long tenure into a vulnerability.To his admirers, Nitish is also a rare politician who, despite his two decades in office, has managed to avoid any taint of corruption or charge of subversion of due process for rewarding his band of loyalists with govt jobs or contracts, an attribute brought into sharp relief when compared to a host of netas heading regional parties, not the least his arch rival Lalu.Despite lacking the advantage of an assured vote bank like Lalu, whose caste Yadavs account for over 14.2% of population, Nitish has assiduously weaved a support block comprising of sections of non-Yadav OBCs, EBCs and Scheduled Castes.In his multiple stints in office since 2005, the 74-year-old neta has cultivated women voters with a host of sops, from 35% quota in govt jobs to 50% quota in local bodies. The recent transfer of Rs 10,000 to over 1.20 crore of them being the latest outreach. His choice of keeping family members out of politics also casts him in a positive light for his supporters when no major regional party leadership can escape the charge of nepotism.",Nitish Kumar was seen as NDA's weak link in run up to Bihar assembly poll announcement.

"After KYC, compulsory KYV is here. And it’s driving people up the wall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-kyc-compulsory-kyv-is-here-and-its-driving-people-up-the-wall/articleshow/124880566.cms,"Know Your Vehicle

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.","KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to prevent fraud.

Isro to give Navy big boost in sea communication with new satellite launch on Nov 2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-to-give-navy-big-boost-in-sea-communication-with-new-satellite-launch-on-nov-2/articleshow/124883517.cms,"NEW DELHI: Isro is set to hugely boost Indian Navy’s satellite-linked communication network by launching Gsat-7R (codeword CMS-03) from the Sriharikota spaceport on Nov 2. Gsat-7R, being considered the heaviest-ever communication satellite to be launched from Indian soil, will replace the aging satellite Gsat-7 (Rukmini), which is the backbone of naval communications on high seas at present.‘Rukmini’ has enabled secure real-time links between warships, submarines, aircraft and shore-based command centres across the Indian Ocean.With upgraded payloads, Gsat-7R or CMS-03 is designed to expand secure, multi-band communications for the Navy’s growing blue-water operations. Multi-band frequencies — UHF, S, C and Ku bands — will help transmit voice, video and data between warships, submarines and aircraft. The enhanced coverage will boost manifold India’s network-centric warfare capabilities and extend the Navy’s operational reach across critical maritime domains. CMS-03 will provide real-time communication for naval operations, air defence and strategic command control across a wide oceanic and terrestrial region.India's LVM3 rocket will be used to launch CMS-03, in what will be its fifth operational flight from Sriharikota.“The previous mission of LVM3 launched the Chandrayaan-3 mission, wherein India became the first country to land successfully near the lunar south pole,” Isro said in a statement.“CMS-03 is a multiband communication satellite that will provide services over a wide oceanic region, including the Indian landmass,” it said. It will provide sharper connectivity and increased bandwidth for civil, strategic and maritime users. Though Cyclone Montha has hit the Andhra Pradesh coast, a change in its direction has ensured that Isro’s satellite mission remains on schedule.The launch vehicle, LVM-3, has been fully assembled and integrated with the spacecraft and was moved to the launchpad on Oct 26 for further pre-launch operations, Isro said.Isro usually prefers launching heavier communication satellites from the European spaceport in French Guiana. This is the first time it will launch an around 4.4-tonne satellite from Indian soil. Isro had earlier launched Gsat-11, weighing 5,854 kg, from French Guiana using the services of Ariane-5 rocket, on Dec 5, 2018. While it is the heaviest satellite built by Isro so far, it was sent into space from a foreign spaceport.","Isro is set to hugely boost Indian Navy’s satellite-linked communication network.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah 's National Conference and BJP teamed up in the assembly for the first time Tuesday to vote out PDP 's proposed ""anti-bulldozer bill"" that seeks to grant ownership rights to locals occupying illegal properties on state-owned land for over 20 years.Omar, already facing allegations about last Friday's Rajya Sabha election being ""a fixed match"" after BJP won one of the four seats at stake, received a rare shout-out from the saffron party later for rejecting PDP's land bill ""in national interest"".""How can this bill be justified when it seeks to legitimise illegal constructions on state land?"" Omar said in the House before speaker Abdul Rahim Rather put the bill to vote. ""If it is passed, it would mean that anyone who builds a house on state land tomorrow can claim it as their own. That is simply unacceptable,"" he added.The rebuff came less than a week after PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti declared at a presser that her party had agreed to support NC in the Rajya Sabha election on the condition that the governing party would back its J&K (Regularisation and Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Public Land) Bill.""BJP's threat to block the passage of PDP's land regularisation (anti-bulldozer) bill, which they branded the 'land jihad bill', was fulfilled today,"" Mehbooba wrote on X after the move was voted out. ""The chief minister, who had earlier assured that any pro-people initiative from PDP would face no obstacles under his leadership, has once again reneged on his word. This marks yet another U-turn added to his growing list of unfulfilled guarantees and promises. ""The draft of the rejected bill defines ""residents"" as those holding permanent resident certificates, which were replaced with domicile certificates after the abrogation of Article 370. PDP projects the bill as one meant to safeguard the rights of J&K residents who are being slapped with eviction notices.CM Omar harked back to the defunct Roshni Act being challenged in court and defeated despite what he said was a well-intentioned move to ""provide relief to people who had acquired legal rights over land"".""Here, this bill is justifying illegal encroachment,"" he said, urging PDP member Waheed Parra to withdraw it immediately.Parra refused to do so, accusing Omar of siding with BJP and against the interest of those living in J&K. ""BJP calls this bill 'land jihad', and now you are backing away from it? You should debate the bill; if there are any loopholes, we can fix them,"" he said.When the PDP legislator told Omar that ""even your relatives have suffered on account of this"", alluding to the controversy surrounding Hotel Nedous in Gulmarg, the CM stood up to clarify that his kin had ""a rightful lease over the land"".""But I will not bring a bill to protect my relatives"" Omar said. ""You are bringing religion and politics into this. You should not compare land for the landless with this bill.""BJP MLA Sunil Sharma applauded and thanked the CM for taking what he said was a decisive step against ""a notorious bill"" to regularise encroachment. ""Alongside terrorism, large-scale encroachment took place with the support of previous govts in J&K,"" he said.Parra told reporters outside the assembly later that his party was only voicing ""concerns about land ownership and demographic changes since the abrogation of Article 370"".","J&K CM Omar Abdullah's National Conference and BJP teamed up in the assembly for the first time Tuesday to vote out PDP's proposed ""anti-bulldozer bill"" The bill seeks to grant ownership rights to locals occupying illegal properties on state- owned land for over 20 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124880951,imgsize-192636,width-400,resizemode-4/j-k-assembly-witnesses-uproar.jpg"

‘Bihar Got Not Even 1% of Gujarat’s Share’: Tejashwi Yadav Explodes at PM Modi

PATNA: INDIA bloc CM face Tejashwi Yadav 's projection as ""jannayak (people's leader)"" and ""nayak (hero)"" has been contested not only by BJP but also by a senior within his own RJD , with its national general secretary Abdul Bari Siddiqui taking exception to such labels.Siddiqui said it would take Tejashwi time and hard work to get the title of Jannayak, which is exclusively used for former Bihar CM and Bharat Ratna Karpoori Thakur. ""Tejashwi is engaged in politics based on his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad's legacy. He is the virasat (legacy) of Lalu Prasad's politics and may get this honour after establishing himself by following the footsteps of his father and Thakur,"" Siddiqui added.While RJD posters with Tejashwi's photograph, captioned ""Bihar ka Nayak"" have come up ahead of next month's assembly elections, he as well as Congress Lok Sabha opposition leader Rahul Gandhi were first called jannayak during ""Voter Adhikar Yatra"" in the state over a month ago against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. The row seems to have intensified after Congress put up social media posts on Monday with videos and photos of Rahul, describing him as jannayak.Tejashwi's estranged elder brother Tej Pratap also disapproved of such titles. ""Calling yourself jannayak doesn't make you a people's leader. Karpoori Thakur, Ram Manohar Lohia, Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi were the real jannayaks. Rahul and Tejashwi are under the ""chatrachaya (protection and patronage) of Lalu Prasad. If that protection is removed, they will be nothing,"" Tej Pratap said.BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla seized on Siddiqui's statement to claim that neither the public nor his own colleagues had confidence in Tejaswhi. ""Despite contesting elections for years, he has failed to earn people's trust. Even within his circle, from RJD's Abdul Bari Siddiqui to SP MLA Ravidas Mehrotra, besides his brother Tej Pratap, no one sees him as a true leader,"" he said.Another BJP spokesperson, Ajay Alok, took the title tiff further, saying Tejashwi ""is not a nayak but nalayak"".","Tejashwi Yadav's projection as ""jannayak (people's leader)"" and ""nayak"" has been contested not only by BJP but also by a senior within his own RJD.

A list of 6000-8000 invitees has been prepared for this programme,"" Mishra told ANI on Saturday.“The ceremony of hoisting the ‘pataka’ over the ‘shikar’ of the Ram temple is a kind of a religious announcement to the devotees of Lord Ram that the temple in all its description, including the outer security wall—‘parkota’—is complete in all respects.

HYDERABAD: In yet another blow to CPI (Maoist), two of its prominent figures - central committee member Pulluri Prasad Rao alias Chandranna and Telangana state committee member Bandi Prakash alias Prabhath - surrendered before DGP B Shivadhar Reddy in Hyderabad on Tuesday.The surrender, carried out without arms or much fanfare, marks the exit of two senior members long seen as key strategists within the Maoist brass. The duo cited deteriorating health, deepening ideological divisions, and sustained pressure from security forces as reasons for dissociating from the armed movement.""This is in response to CM A Revanth Reddy's call to join the mainstream,"" said Reddy. ""Both Chandranna and Prabhath decided to distance themselves from the organisation due to internal rift, chronic ailments and divergence within the Maoist leadership.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About

Crime shows to crime scene



A clue in the burn pattern



Revenge and confession



NEW DELHI: It was meant to be ""perfect murder"" -- until it wasn't. A 21-year-old forensic science student's elaborate plan to kill her 32-year-old live-in partner and disguise it as an accident fell apart after CCTV footage and expert analysis exposed her crime.Amrita Chauhan, along with her ex-boyfriend Sumit Kashyap (27) and their friend Sandeep Kumar (29), strangled UPSC aspirant Ramkesh Meena to death this month. The trio then poured oil, ghee, and wine on his body to ensure it burned completely, police said.Meena had allegedly refused to delete Amrita's private photos and videos stored on his hard disk, the dispute which turned fatal for him.According to police, Amrita, a forensic science student, used her academic knowledge and ideas inspired by crime web series to stage the murder as an accidental fire. “The case was one of the perfectly planned murders, but it was solved even more perfectly by the Delhi Police through relentless investigation and scientific analysis,” said Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Ravindra Yadav told PTI news agency.Investigators said Amrita was obsessed with crime web series and binge-watched them regularly, using what she learned to plot the murder. Initially, the crime scene -- a north Delhi Gandhi Vihar flat -- appeared to show a cylinder blast, with no visible signs of violence.Yadav said, “At the onset, it appeared to be an accidental fire. But no matter how perfect a plan is, criminals always leave some clue. Our team worked more perfectly and cracked the case.”Police said Amrita used her forensic training to erase evidence, pouring oil, ghee, and wine on the body and leaving the cylinder valve open before igniting it. “Amrita, being a forensic student, had used her knowledge to erase evidence,” Yadav added.However, forensic experts soon noticed irregularities in the burn marks that didn’t match an accidental fire. This led investigators to re-examine the case.“We scanned several CCTV cameras around the area and found two masked men entering the building on the night of October 5, followed by Amrita and another man later. Moments after they left, the fire erupted,” Yadav said.The CCTV footage shifted the course of the probe. Combined with call data records and technical surveillance, it placed Amrita near the scene when the fire broke out. Police tracked her movements and arrested her from Moradabad on October 18.During interrogation, Amrita broke down and confessed. She told police that Meena had recorded intimate videos of her and refused to delete them after their breakup. Furious, she sought help from her ex-boyfriend Sumit, who, along with Sandeep, helped her plan and execute the murder.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Raja Banthia said, “The hard disk has been sent for forensic examination. Further investigation into the matter is under way.”On the night of October 5–6, the trio went to Meena’s flat. Sumit and Sandeep strangled him, while Amrita poured oil, ghee, and wine on his body. Sumit, an LPG distributor, opened the cylinder knob near Meena’s head before setting it on fire. They locked the flat from inside using Amrita’s hand through a removed portion of the iron gate net and escaped with Meena’s hard disk, laptops, and other belongings. An hour later, the cylinder exploded, engulfing the body in flames.“We have substantial evidence to prove the crime -- from CCTV footage to recovered items and digital traces,” Yadav said.Following her arrest, police recovered Meena’s hard disk, a trolley bag, and a shirt belonging to the victim. Sumit was later caught from Moradabad on October 21, and Sandeep was nabbed two days after. Their phones and other evidence used in the crime were also seized.What was meant to be a “perfect murder” planned by a forensic mind turned into a perfect case solved by forensic science itself.","Amrita Chauhan, her ex-boyfriend and their friend strangled UPSC aspirant Ramkesh Meena to death this month.

NEW DELHI: To help bureaucrats issue quick and sharp responses to fight misinformation, the govt is sensitising its secretaries, joint secretaries, additional secretaries and directors on the use of new age media, including social media and podcasts, to put out facts coupled with information and status of schemes. TOI has learnt that a day-long conference was held for all secretary-level officers last week. Top bureaucrats, including the principal secretaries to the PM - P K Mishra and Shaktikanta Das - and cabinet secretary T V Somantahan, gave detailed presentations.Later this week, a similar programme will be held for additional and joint secretaries, while directors will be sensitised next week. ""There is serious thinking on roping in influencers and artistes as they could have more impact than traditional govt communication,"" said an official, adding that plans are afoot to set up rapid response units within ministries.","The govt is sensitising its secretaries, joint secretaries, additional secretaries and directors on the use of new age media.

The Centre has earned Rs 387 crore from the disposal of scrap gathered during the ongoing special cleanliness campaign, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday.The remarks came during a meeting of a group of ministers comprising Singh, the Union Minister of State for Personnel, to review the campaign. Youth Affairs Minister Mansukh Mandaviya and Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu also attended it.The high-level review held here on Tuesday focused on assessing the progress of cleanliness drives, file disposal, and innovative waste-to-wealth practices being implemented across ministries and departments under the campaign.Singh said the government's cleanliness drive has matured into a transformative national movement that blends cleanliness with efficiency, transparency, and innovation.He said that against a target of 7.56 lakh sites, ministries and departments have already covered 5.57 lakh sites, achieving 73.7 per cent progress by October 27, 2025, a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said.""So far, the campaign has generated Rs 387.4 crore in revenue through disposal of scrap and e-waste, freed 148.19 lakh square feet of space, and weeded out 19.21 lakh files against the set targets,"" it said.As many as 5.51 lakh cases of public grievance have been disposed of out of a target of 7.04 lakh, while 12,402 appeals have been addressed out of 17,402 targeted, the statement said.Singh said that the campaign, which began on October 2 and is set to culminate on October 31, marks a decisive step in institutionalising cleanliness and record management across government offices.""Each version of this campaign has taken us to the next level -- from file disposal to freeing up office space, and now, to turning waste into wealth. What began as a cleanliness initiative has evolved into a behavioural and economic reform,"" he said.Since its inception in 2021, the cumulative outcomes of the special campaign series have been substantial, covering 19.61 lakh cleanliness sites, freeing 844.46 lakh square feet of office space, closing or weeding out 157.07 lakh files, and earning Rs 3,684 crore in revenue for the government.Singh said these achievements reflect not just administrative efficiency but also innovative thinking within government institutions.He said that new models are being implemented under the waste-to-wealth initiative, such as AIIMS' experiment in recycling bio-laboratory waste into reusable material, and the conversion of used cooking oil into low-cost fuel through NGO partnerships, according to the statement.""These are models of sustainability that also offer economic and social benefits. Our goal is to make waste management a part of our daily administrative and civic behaviour,"" the minister said.He also highlighted the collaboration between Tata Steel and government agencies in using steel plant by-products for eco-friendly road construction.""Such practices demonstrate how the private sector can contribute meaningfully to sustainable development,"" Singh added.Calling for sustained efforts beyond October 31, the minister urged ministries to adopt successful models and maintain cleanliness, efficiency, and grievance redressal as year-round priorities.""We are institutionalising cleanliness not as a symbolic exercise but as an ethos of governance.

NEW DELHI: Social media may be often seen as a peddler of fake news, exaggeration and misleading claims but it also stores enough unfiltered facts for govts to harness its reach in order to collect genuine feedback.In a unique move, the road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to have their own YouTube channels and upload fresh videos of projects at frequent intervals. TOI has learnt that road transport secretary V Umashankar Tuesday directed NHAI to upload videos on projects on its channel at different stages of development for public viewing and getting feedback.Speaking at an event of industry body CII, Umashankar said, “There have been instances when we get a lot of information and updates about projects and the problems being faced from videos uploaded by independent YouTubers. Some comments also give insight into issues...We are working on to make the uploading of videos as a part of project contract document.”Ministry officials said highway builders are required to submit videos shot using drones during construction stage to highway agencies, and hence, uploading them for public viewing won’t be an issue.They added that the objective of the initiative is to increase public participation and accountability of authorities.Addressing a session at the event, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said he has issued instructions for installing hoardings with QR code for commuters to scan and see details of contractors and officials concerned, including their name, address and mobile numbers. “If people are paying toll, they deserve international-quality roads. Weather or poor bitumen cannot be excuses. If the surface is not comfortable, fix it — cost may increase but comfort is non-negotiable,” he added.Gadkari also said he has told officers that “if a road is bad and people are complaining about it on social media, take it seriously...From A to Z in road construction, we need ownership, sincerity, and a positive approach. Roads must be good, and they must stay good. Signboards should be put up clearly stating who is responsible”.He said institutionalising performance audits will help identify design and maintenance lapses while promoting accountability and rewarding quality work. “When audits are regular, transparency increases, and excuses decrease. That’s how we should work,” he added.",The road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to have their own YouTube channels.

Delhi Tries to Make It Rain With Cloud Seeding: A High-Stakes Weather Experiment to Fight Toxic Air

Third such experiment since 1957





What is cloud seeding?





In a bid to curb Delhi's air pollution crisis, the Delhi government conducted a cloud seeding trial in collaboration with IIT-Kanpur on Tuesday afternoon.The trial was aimed at inducing artificial rain to help settle dust and pollutants as Delhi’s AQI remained in the ‘very poor’ category. However, the results are still yet to be collated.Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said the Cessna aircraft took off from Kanpur, released eight fire flares, and covered areas such as Burari, north Karol Bagh, and Mayur Vihar before landing at the Meerut airfield. “The trial lasted for about half an hour. More such trials are planned over the next few days,” Sirsa said, PTI reported.This is the third such experiment since 1957 and was carried out after a gap of 53 years from the second experiment.Climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, told PTI that the first cloud seeding experiment in Delhi was conducted during the monsoon of 1957, and the second in the early 1970s.The 1971–72 trial, carried out from the National Physical Laboratory campus, covered a 25-km radius over central Delhi and used silver iodide particles released from ground-based generators to encourage rainfall.An IITM report noted that seeding was conducted on 11 days between December 1971 and March 1972, with 11 additional days kept as controls. Preliminary data showed an increase in rainfall on the seeded days, suggesting the potential effectiveness of artificial rain under suitable weather conditions.Since then, cloud seeding research in India has expanded.Under the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX) programme, IITM has studied clouds and rainfall patterns across the country. During CAIPEEX Phase IV (2017–2019) in Solapur, Maharashtra, scientists studied 276 clouds and found that hygroscopic seeding used in warm clouds increased rainfall by up to 46% in some areas and by an average of 18% over 100 sq km.Cloud seeding involves dispersing cloud-forming particles such as silver iodide or salts into clouds to enhance precipitation. The technique, used in over 50 countries, including China, the US, Russia, and Australia, is deployed for weather modification, rainfall enhancement, and pollution mitigation.The Delhi project, cleared by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and other departments, aims to evaluate whether artificial rain can be used as a short-term measure to reduce pollution during the winter in the coming years. The Delhi Cabinet had approved the plan on May 7, allocating Rs 3.21 crore for five trials, reported PTI.",The Delhi government conducted a cloud seeding trial in collaboration with IIT- Kanpur on Tuesday afternoon.

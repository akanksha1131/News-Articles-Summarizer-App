'Jets were shot down': Donald Trump says stopped a lot of wars; again brings up India-Pakistan conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jets-were-shot-down-donald-trump-says-stopped-a-lot-of-wars-again-brings-up-india-pakistan-conflict/articleshow/122776193.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump on Friday once again claimed credit for preventing a major conflict between India and Pakistan, saying the two nuclear-armed nations were ""hitting each other"" and that ""four or five jets were shot down"" before tensions were eased ""through trade talks. ""Speaking at a private dinner with Republican lawmakers at the White House, Trump said, ""We stopped a lot of wars. And these were serious, India and Pakistan, that was going on… These are two serious nuclear countries, and they were hitting each other. You know, it seems like a new form of warfare.""""Planes were being shot out of the air… five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down, actually,"" he added.He went on to explain how his administration used trade negotiations as leverage to calm tensions. ""India and Pakistan were going at it, and they were back and forth, and it was getting bigger and bigger, and we got it solved through trade. We said, you guys want to make a trade deal,"" he said.""We're not making a trade deal if you're going to be throwing around weapons, and maybe nuclear weapons, both very powerful nuclear states,"" he added.Trump also claimed that US also dismantled Iran's nuclear program.""You saw it recently when you looked at what we did in Iran, where we knocked out their nuclear capability, totally knocked out that,"" he asserted.This isn’t the first time Trump has made such a claim.Earlier in the week, he said, ""We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India and Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly, and we did that through trade.""""I said, 'we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled,’ and they did, and they were both great, great leaders, and they were great,"" he added.Congress reacted to US President Donald Trump's claim that he prevented a war between India and Pakistan by using trade pressure.In a post on X, Congress stated that, ""Trump said, Five jets were shot down in the war between India and Pakistan. Along with this, he said for the 24th time that I stopped the India-Pakistan war by threatening trade.""The party criticised PM Modi's silence on the issue, saying, ""Trump is constantly repeating this, and Narendra Modi is silent.""""Why did Narendra Modi compromise the country's honour for trade?"" it added.While Trump has reiterated that he helped ""stop"" the conflict through diplomacy and trade pressure, the actual peace move actually began when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) contacted his Indian counterpart to request a halt to all hostilities, on land, in the air, and at sea.Tensions had sharply escalated following a deadly terror attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag district. The strike, carried out by Pakistan-backed militants in Pahalgam, killed 26 people.In response, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, with the Indian Air Force (IAF) targeting nine major terror hubs inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Pakistan attempted to retaliate with drones and missile strikes, but Indian air defence systems successfully intercepted all incoming threats. As tensions rose, the IAF carried out precision strikes on 11 Pakistani airbases, including strategic sites such as Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.While there were no casualties or structural damage reported in India, the Indian military released visual proof of the damage caused by its cross-border strikes.The IAF’s strong air defence capabilities played a crucial role in safeguarding Indian airspace during the exchange, neutralising multiple UAV and drone threats.","US President Donald Trump claimed credit for preventing a major conflict between India and Pakistan.

Whenunveiled the reconstructed faces of Keeladi men who lived 2,500 years ago, it felt like a moment of time travel. The skulls excavated from Keeladi had been carefully studied and brought to life by researchers from the UK. Their eyes, jawlines, and foreheads appeared deeply familiar — like gazing into a mirror that stretched across millennia.From the artefacts recovered — carbon dated to 600 BCE — names that echo through Sangam literature emerge;and. It is thrilling to see the torches of archaeology and ancient poetry illuminating the same path through our shared past.Reading theis no less than an archaeological dig. With each couplet, we brush away the dust of time and catch glimpses of a civilization that once breathed on the same soil. Valluvar may not have held a chisel, but his pen was as precise.Homes were called(Kural 340). The inner courtyard — today’s living space — was(Kural 720). Doors were bolted (Kural 1251). People drew drinking water from(Kural 215). Women bracelets called(Kural-1101), and heavy studs in their ears referred to as(Kural 1081). In one unforgettable image, Valluvar paints a picture of a woman marking each day her husband is away, scratching lines on the wall to keep count (Kural 1261). Love was not a fleeting romance — it was record-keeping.Occupations of the time unfold too — farmers, weavers, palanquin bearers, carpenters, hunters, soldiers, barbers, potters, religious pundits, and goldsmiths. Agriculture was not just a profession, it was revered. Crops like sugarcane (Kural 1078), sesame (Kural 889), and millets (Kural 104) were grown with care. Farmers drew from wells (Kural 396) and spring waters (Kural 1161). “If the farmer tills properly,” Valluvar wrote in Kural 1037, “no manure is needed.” A principle that would echo well with modern soil scientists’ warning against nutrient run-off and pollution.A few months ago, I was running late and requested my daughter to heat the sambar I had made. When I returned, I saw her using the vessel meant for boiling milk. I snapped. “You’re using the milk vessel for sambar?”She looked baffled. “What’s wrong with that?”I explained: “Milk vessels are always kept separate. The ladle too. If you use them for other foods, the next time you boil milk, it may curdle.”She looked at me suspiciously. “Is this a new house rule?”“It’s a rule, yes,” I said, switching off the stove and quickly transferring the sambar. “But it’s not new. It’s been followed in households like ours for over 2,000 years.She raised an eyebrow. “Because there’s evidence — not archaeological, but literary,” I said. In, Valluvar uses the metaphor of pure milk turning bad because of an unclean vessel to speak of wealth in the hands of the undeserving. Valluvar even uses the termfor vessels exclusively used only for milk.”She paused, then said, “Sometimes you are proud because you started something new. But sometimes you're proud because you are part of a continuum — something that’s been going on for centuries.”I couldn’t agree more. That’s exactly why the images from Keeladi gave me goosebumps. It was a proud, humbling reminder: We are not the beginning of anything. We are a single link in a chain forged long before us—and if we are mindful, a link that will hold firm for generations to come.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Will shut schools if Hindi is imposed from Class 1 in Maharashtra: Raj Thackeray,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-shut-schools-if-hindi-is-imposed-from-class-1-in-maharashtra-raj-thackeray/articleshow/122774192.cms,"IANS photo

Speaking at the rally, Raj also said he was not opposed to any language, but would not tolerate compulsion.Raj warned the traders who had protested by holding a rally against the assault on a Mira Road shop-keeper by MNS activists that “there are Marathi traders as well and if we don’t buy from you, then what will you sell?”","MNS chief Raj Thackeray said if Hindi was made mandatory for Classes 1 to 5 in schools in Maharashtra, his party will ‘shut down schools’ He referred to CM Devendra Fadnavis’s latest reported statement that the three-language policy will be implemented.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122774185,imgsize-15346,width-400,resizemode-4/122774185.jpg"

Dent in exports?

Can’t accept double standards on energy security, says India

Poll Should India take a stronger stand against unilateral sanctions? Yes, to safeguard national interests No, steady diplomacy works best

NEW DELHI: Nayara Energy’s refinery in Gujarat’s Vadinar became the first in India to come under western sanctions as European Union Friday announced fresh curbs on Russian oil exports with the aim of throttling funding for Moscow’s war machine.“For the first time, we’re designating a flag registry and the biggest Rosneft refinery in India,” agencies quoted EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as saying. India responded, saying it “does not subscribe to any unilateral sanction measures. We are a responsible actor and remain fully committed to our legal obligations.”Govt of India considers the provision of energy security a responsibility of paramount importance to meet the basic needs of its citizens. We would stress that there should be no double standards, especially when it comes to energy trade,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.The new measures include lowering the current price cap of $60/barrel, the threshold at which countries outside the G7 grouping of seven developed economies can buy Russian oil and access Western shipping as well as insurance services.Additionally, 105 off-radar vessels have been sanctioned, bringing the total to 223 out of a fleet of 400 oil tankers and limiting Moscow’s ability to evade the price cap.Rosneft, along with partners — commodities trader Trafigura and Russian investment firm UCP (United Capital Partners ) — had acquired the refinery with a capacity of 20 million tonnes per annum and associated assets from Essar Oil for $12.9 billion in 2017.Rosneft holds 49.1% in the venture. The refinery depends on exports to Europe and Africa as a small retail network of 6,750 fuel stations limits domestic sales. Curbs on products derived from Russian oil could cloud exports, impacting operations and threatening jobs. The curbs will also derail Rosneft’s bid to exit the venture because sanctions make repatriation of profit impossible.As reported by TOI earlier, the Russian giant had initiated talks with Reliance Industries Ltd for selling its stake in Nayara but the asking price of $20 billion was proving to be a hurdle. The new price cap will be graded in a band to the market average as subdued prices rendered the present cap less effective.","Nayara Energy's refinery in Gujarat’s Vadinar became the first in India to come under western sanctions.

TMC anti-development: PM in Bengal

PM launches projects worth Rs 7,200 cr in poll-bound Bihar

(With inputs from Madan Kumar in Patna)

KOLKATA: PM Modi’s second rally in seven weeks in West Bengal, in the industrial township of Durgapur Friday, started with a “Jai Ma Kali, Jai Ma Durga” homage to the state’s two biggest Hindu deities. He then took Trinamool’s campaign for the 2026 assembly polls head-on, vowing that “infiltrators will be investigated as per provisions in the legal system”.“We will not allow a conspiracy against Bengal’s ‘asmita’ (pride). It is Modi’s guarantee,” he said to a cheering crowd. “For the sake of vote-bank politics, TMC is putting Bengal’s identity at stake by encouraging and protecting illegal immigrants and that has become a threat to national security as well. An ecosystem has been created to support infiltrators,” Modi claimed, dovetailing barbs against Mamata Banerjee’s “appeasement politics” with a new focus on “Bengali pride”.Other BJP politicians, like former MP Locket Chatterjee and assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari started with the customary “Jai Sri Ram” slogan but the PM’s eschewing of Ram and his focus on Bengal’s deities and past political, cultural and industrial icons (like Bidhan Chandra Roy, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Kadambini Ganguly, Dwarkanath Tagore and Bishnu Dey) gave a glimpse of BJP’s strategy in the run-up to the 2026 assembly poll: stress BJP’s connect with Bengal to offset TMC’s hammer-andtongs campaign against “the harassment and torture of Bengalis in BJP-ruled states”.Modi also brought up “classical language status” for Bengali, taking credit for “a BJP initiative”, while accusing Trinamool and Left Front of never caring for the language. Trinamool was “anti-development”, Modi said, attributing the flight of Bengal’s youth to other states to that. “People across the country used to come here for employment.The trend has changed now. Existing industries are closing down. We have to pull Bengal out of this situation,” he said. The PM wove this narrative with BJP’s usual anti-Trinamool litany as he blamed its use of “syndicate raj, gunda tax and mafia control” for driving out industries. “It formulates policies encouraging corruption.Which industrialist will dare to come to a state where there are riots,” the Prime Minister asked.Meanwhile, in Patna, PM laid foundation stones, inaugurated and dedicated to the nation multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,200 crore before addressing a public meeting during his Motihari programme.",PM Modi's second rally in seven weeks in West Bengal.

Redefining Akbar ’s reign

Shifting the lens on Aurangzeb



Studying the past, not living in it

In a significant pedagogical shift, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has released a new Class 8 Social Science textbook titled Exploring Society: India and Beyond, offering a more layered and candid portrayal of India’s medieval past. The new volume, part of the new curriculum under the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF SE) 2023, shifts the study of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, and colonial encounters from Class 7 to Class 8, aligning with the Council's restructured thematic and chronological focus.The textbook’s chapter titled Reshaping India's Political Map presents major political shifts between the 13th and 17th centuries. It covers the rise and decline of the Delhi Sultanate, the Vijayanagara Empire, the Mughal dynasty, and the emergence of Sikh resistance. What distinguishes this update is not just its content, but its tone. It invites students to examine the past critically without assigning modern-day blame.The chapter’s preface lays out the framework clearly: “History may often appear dominated by wars and destruction—but should we simply leave them out? The better path is to confront and examine these events, to understand the forces that made them possible and, ideally, to prevent them from happening again.It’s essential to study these darker chapters with objectivity, without placing blame on people living today. ”The revised chapter begins its examination of the Mughal era with Babur, founder of the dynasty, whose arrival from Central Asia changed the subcontinent’s political map. The textbook outlines his key victories, particularly the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, and his use of advanced military techniques such as field artillery.While the textbook acknowledges Babur’s strategic acumen and his observations in the Baburnama, it also notes his destruction of temples and the religious motivations behind some of his campaigns. These details aim to provide students with an unvarnished understanding of the conquest and its cultural impact, without assigning simplistic labels.Among the central figures re-evaluated is Emperor Akbar, who took the throne at the age of 13 following Humayun’s death. The textbook acknowledges both his military conquests and his attempts at religious accommodation, describing his rule as a “blend of brutality and tolerance, shaped by ambition and strategy.”One example is the 1568 siege of Chittorgarh, where thousands were massacred and women and children enslaved. Citing Akbar’s own dispatches, the book offers insight into his motivations for religious conquest. Yet, it also highlights how Akbar abolished the jizya (a tax on non-Muslims), included Rajput leaders in his court, and promoted sulh-i-kul or “peace with all.” His translation project at Fatehpur Sikri, which rendered Hindu epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana into Persian, is presented as part of a broader cultural vision.A quote from his biographer, Abul Fazl, underscores Akbar’s personal evolution: “Formerly I persecuted men into conformity with my faith. As I grew in knowledge, I was overwhelmed with shame. Not being a Muslim myself, it was unmeet to force others to become such.”In contrast, Aurangzeb is introduced as a ruler whose territorial expansion was matched by increasing religious conservatism. The textbook documents how he reinstated the jizya, banned music and dance at court, and imposed pilgrimage taxes on Hindus. The destruction of temples in cities such as Banaras and Mathura is discussed alongside the persecution of Sikhs, Sufis, Jains, and Parsis.The succession struggle that brought Aurangzeb to power is also detailed. Students learn how he defeated Dara Shikoh, executed rivals, and imprisoned his father, Shah Jahan, the emperor behind the Taj Mahal.While the inclusion of violent episodes might spark debate, NCERT has clarified its intent. In a statement quoted by ANI, the council said:“While those happenings cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone today responsible for them. Understanding the historical origin of cruel violence, abusive misrule, or misplaced ambitions of power is the best way to heal the past and build a future where, hopefully, they will have no place.”The textbook encourages students to engage with history not as a catalogue of heroes and villains, but as a record of choices, consequences, and contradictions. By combining accounts of conflict with stories of reform and cultural exchange, it offers a more rounded view of the past.As India continues to revisit its historical narratives through updated academic frameworks, Exploring Society: India and Beyond signals a shift toward critical thinking in the classroom. It invites learners to interpret and contextualise, rather than simply memorise or judge.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

BENGALURU: Panic gripped around 40 schools across Bengaluru on Friday morning after they received threatening emails warning of bomb attacks.The threatening messages were sent by a miscreant using the email ID ‘roadkill333@atomicmail.io’, who also claimed he would end his life after the children died.Schools in Central, East, West, and South Bengaluru were among those targeted.According to police sources, a single email was sent to all the institutions around 7.24am, with the subject line reading: “Bombs inside the school.”The sender, who identified himself as ""Roadkill,"" claimed to have placed multiple explosives (Trinitrotoluene) inside classrooms. He alleged that the bombs were “skillfully hidden in black plastic bags.”""I will erase every last one of you from this world. Not a single soul will survive. I will gladly laugh when I watch the news, only to see the parents show up at the school and be greeted by the cold, dismembered bodies of their children,"" the email read.The message continued with the sender expressing suicidal intent and anger at psychiatrists, stating: ""You only care about medicating the helpless and clueless humans...I am living proof that they do not [help]. You all deserve this. You deserve to suffer just like me."" He also asked that the email be shared with the media.Upon receiving the alerts, schools quickly evacuated students and staff. Bomb detection and disposal squads (BDDS) along with local police rushed to each location and began checks as per standard safety protocols. No explosives were found at any of the schools as of Friday afternoon.While police suspect the threat to be a hoax, a senior officer stated that an official declaration would only be made after the completion of checks at all affected institutions. ""We are collecting formal complaints from the schools and will initiate necessary legal action.

'None Of Pakistani Drones Could...': CDS Chauhan's Big Revelation On Operation Sindoor Success

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s Rahim Yar Khan airbase, which was hit by Indian missiles during Operation Sindoor over two months ago, is still not operational, an indication of the extent of damage the strategic military installation suffered. Pakistan airport authority is learnt to have issued another ‘Notice to Airmen’, aka ‘Notam’, for its runway, declaring it unusable till Aug 5, sources said.The airbase, located around 230 km south of Bahawalpur, holds a strategic place in Pakistan’s southern air defence due to its proximity to India’s Rajasthan border. It had suffered massive damage in the precision strikes carried out by India early in May. In May-end, PM Narendra Modi had said at a rally in Rajasthan’s Bikaner that the airbase was in ‘ICU’.Located within the perimeters of an international airport, the airbase had issued the first Notam on the evening of May 10 declaring the runway non-operational for a week (May 18), and later extended it. Notam was again issued in early June, extending the closure of the airbase until July 4. The latest notice said the runway is unavailable for flight operations due to “work in progress”.The airbase serves as a forward operating base for the Pakistan Air Force central command and was used heavily for military purposes.The missiles fired at Rahim Yar Khan airbase caused a massive crater on its runway, a Pakistan district commissioner had told the local press in May. However, the damage, clearly, was much bigger than a crater as the airbase has been non-functional for over two months.Besides this airbase, simultaneous attacks were carried out on Nur Khan airbase at Chaklala in Rawalpindi, the Rafiqui airbase at Shorkot in Punjab, the Murid airbase in Chakwal and the Chunian airbase in Punjab. Pakistan officials had acknowledged damage to transport aircraft at Nur Khan and technical facilities at Chunian.Similarly, the Markaz Subhan Allah terror camp in Bahawalpur, reduced to rubble in airstrikes, has been shut down indefinitely with the Jaish-e-Muhammed brass looking for a new address, preferably in a densely populated area, sources said.","Pakistan’s Rahim Yar Khan airbase was hit by Indian missiles during Operation Sindoor over two months ago.

Poll Do you believe NATO's sanctions threat will impact India's energy security? Yes, it could affect energy needs. No, India can manage its energy needs.

NEW DELHI: The external affairs ministry on Thursday cautioned against ""double standards"" while pushing back against the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) chief's threat of possible secondary sanctions on India for maintaining trade ties with Russia.""We have seen reports on the subject and are closely following the developments. Let me reiterate that securing the energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,"" the MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, said during the weekly media briefing in Delhi.Further, warning against ""double standards"", Jaiswal said, ""In this endeavour, we are guided by what is available in the markets and also by prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter.""The external affairs ministry's comments come after Nato chief Rutte, during a press conference in Washington alongside US Senators Thom Tillis and Jeanne Shaheen, urged India, China, and Brazil to reconsider their economic ties with Moscow or face ""100 per cent secondary sanctions"" if Russia does not commit to peace talks.Rutte echoed the position taken by American President Donald Trump, who earlier this week threatened severe tariffs on countries maintaining trade with Russia.""My encouragement to these three countries, particularly, is that if you live now in Beijing or in Delhi, or you are the President of Brazil, you might want to take a look at this because this might hit you very hard,"" Rutte had said.He further appealed to these nations to pressure Russia into talks. ""Please make the phone call to Vladimir Putin and tell him that he has to get serious about peace talks, because otherwise this will slam back on Brazil, on India and on China in a massive way,"" he warned.The statement follows Trump's announcement on supplying Ukraine with additional military aid, including air defence systems, missiles, and ammunition, largely funded by European allies. Trump also gave Russia a 50-day deadline to enter serious peace negotiations or face full secondary sanctions.","The external affairs ministry on Thursday cautioned against ""double standards"" while pushing back against the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) chief's threat of possible secondary sanctions on India.

KOCHI: Bitra Island, one of the 10 inhabited isles in the Lakshadweep archipelago, is set to be taken over by govt for defence purposes. There are 105 families on the island and many have opposed the move.Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA). It stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its “strategic location” and “national security relevance”.L akshadweep MP Hamdullah Sayeed alleged that the move was aimed at disrupting peace in the area and would be opposed tooth and nail.Lakshadweep MP vows to fight for Bitra islandersIn a video message, Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Syeed asked Bitra natives not to worry or be anxious about the notification.“As your MP, we held a confer- ence that included leaders from Bitra and Lakshad- weep and discussed it in de- tail. We have decided to fight with the people of Bitra, po- litically and legally,” he said.Sayeed said govt had already acquired land required for defence purposes on several islands.Targeting Bitra, which has had an indigenous population for decades, without considering any alternative, is unacceptable. He also criticised the administration for not holding any consultation with the islanders.The notification said that a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was needed as per pro- visions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Trans- parency in Land Acquisi- tion, Rehabilitation and Re- settlement Act, 2013. Naming the department of revenue as project developer, it said SIA activities included con- sultations with all stake- holders of the proposed ar- ea, including gram sabha.“The SIA and Consent Society, UT of Lakshad- weep, will complete the sur- vey of the proposed area un- der acquisition within two months from the date of the notification,” it said, adding that consent of gram sabhas and/or landowners was not mandatory.","Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA) It stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its ‘strategic location’ and ‘national security relevance’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122772958,imgsize-2953706,width-400,resizemode-4/122772958.jpg"

Set up NIA courts or will give accused bail, SC warns govt

NEW DELHI: With long delay in trials in hundreds of NIA investigated cases relating to terrorism and heinous crimes, Supreme Court on Friday said designating existing courts as special NIA courts was unacceptable and gave an ultimatum to the Union and Maharashtra govts to set up new, exclusive special courts for trial in these cases by Sept.“You cannot designate existing courts, which are dealing with civil and criminal cases, to put an additional burden of NIA cases on them. If you want to expedite trial in NIA-investigated cases having national ramification, you must establish new courts, appoint senior judicial officers, provide them with staff and adequate infrastructure,” SC said.Senior advocate Trideep Pais argued that his client Kailash Ramchandani was arrested by NIA in a UAPA case and was lodged in jail for the last six years without trial as the judicial officer, manning the special court, had no time to proceed with the case.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi told additional solicitor general Rajkumar B Thakre that this was the last opportunity for Union and Maharashtra govts to set up new special courts to exclusively deal with NIA cases. The bench said if such steps were not taken, then courts would be constrained to consider grant of bail to the accused in these cases on the ground of delay in trial.Rejecting NIA’s affidavit which claimed compliance with Supreme Court’s order for establishment of special courts by designating existing courts, the bench said no effective or visible step was taken by the authorities.In its last order, the Justice Kant-led bench had said, “There are hundreds of trials in different parts of the country under special statutes like UAPA, Indian Explosives Act, MCOCA and other similar statutes in different states. However, trials are not commencing because presiding officers are also occupied with several other criminal and civil cases. In the absence of a judicial audit of the matters, which are actually or likely to be generated with the enactment of a new law, trials pertaining to heinous offences have brought an enormous burden on the existing system. ”It had further said, “The most effective recourse can be the establishment of dedicated courts to whom trials under special statutes can be entrusted, without giving them any other civil or criminal cases. Ideally, the trial should take place on a day-to-day basis.”","Supreme Court gave ultimatum to Union and Maharashtra govts to set up new, exclusive special courts for trial in these cases by Sept. “You cannot designate existing courts, which are dealing with civil and criminal cases, to put an additional burden of NIA cases on them.

Digital arrest is economic terrorism: Spl prosecutor

KOLKATA: In possibly the first such sentencing in the country for cybercrimes, a trial court in Kalyani, in Bengal’s Nadia district, Friday awarded life imprisonment to nine scammers who had extorted Rs 1 crore from a Ranaghat resident by threatening him with ‘digital arrest’ last year, reports Dwaipayan Ghosh. It agreed with the prosecution’s charge that such crimes were nothing short of “economic terrorism”.Arrested from Maharashtra, Haryana and Gujarat, the nine convicts, including a woman, were part of a larger gang that has allegedly amassed Rs 100 crore by cheating 108 people across India. They are also likely to face trials elsewhere in the country.Kalyani additional sessions judge Suberthi Sarkar, who had convicted the nine on Thursday, sentenced them to life imprisonment under BNS 338, which involves forging of documents, and 10 other penal offences under both BNS and Information Technology Acts.The defence indicated they would appeal against the conviction in the HC. IGP (CID) Akhilesh Chaturvedi said the nine cybercriminals were tripped by strong digital evidence.“Probe revealed the fraudsters were siphoning money through multiple bank accounts spread across different states. Police seized numerous passbooks, ATM cards, SIM cards and mobile phones during the operation.A detailed analysis of beneficiary accounts and phone numbers led us to uncover this sophisticated network,” the IGP said.During the five-month trial, 29 witnesses from four different states testified physically before the judge. They included SHO of Andheri (West) PS and branch managers of SBI, PNB, Canara Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, from four states. The chargesheet ran into 2,600 pages. Special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee said they highlighted the ordeal of other victims of the gang and stressed that such frauds amounted to economic terrorism.“We told the judge how hard-earned money of two victims — one a retired professor and the other a retired state govt engineer — had been transferred outside the country. This was their life’s entire savings,” he told TOI.","The nine convicts, including a woman, were part of a larger gang that has allegedly amassed Rs 100 crore by cheating 108 people across India.

Bihar elections: Is BJP using Chirag Paswan to checkmate chief minister Nitish Kumar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-is-bjp-using-chirag-paswan-to-checkmate-chief-minister-nitish-kumar/articleshow/122769101.cms,"Representative image/AI generated

""The law-and-order situation in the state has become a matter of ""grave concern"" as murders are happening daily, the morale of criminals is ""sky-high"" and the functioning of police and overall administration defies reason.""

""How many Biharis will be murdered? It is beyond understanding what is the responsibility of the Bihar Police?""

""It is a matter of worry the way crime has risen and law and order have collapsed in Bihar. If such an incident has happened in a posh locality of Patna, then we can only imagine what is happening in villages. It is worrying to see such incidents occur under a government that was known for good governance; then the opposition will have a chance to speak up. Strict action needs to be taken to set a precedent so that such a thing is not repeated.""

""Such incidents aggravate our concerns ... If the family (of Gopal Khemka) is scared, it is justified. This is a family that has faced this earlier as well. Did the local administration provide security to the family? It was the responsibility of the administration.""

NEW DELHI: Is Chirag Paswan setting the stage for Round 2 of his ""targeted"" tussle with Nitish Kumar ahead of assembly elections? In the 2020 assembly elections, Chirag played a key role in making Nitish Kumar's JD(U) the junior partner of the BJP in the ruling NDA.Five years later, as the election approaches, he is back to targeting the Bihar chief minister, this time over the deteriorating law and order situation in the backdrop of several high-profile murders in the state.Here's a look at some of the statements Chirag has made targeting his own government in the poll-bound state over law and order:Clearly, a no-holds-barred attack on the Bihar police, which functions under the direct watch of CM Nitish Kumar, as he also holds the home portfolio.The LJP chief's attack is completely justified given the recent murder incidents -- first the killing of a prominent businessman Gopal Khemka, who was shot outside his residence in Patna by a bike-borne assailant in broad daylight and then the killing of a convict in a hospital by four assailants, caught on CCTV.But the only catch is: Chirag Paswan is part of the NDA -- which includes the BJP and has ruled Bihar for most of the last 20 years.The present Nitish government has two deputy chief ministers from the BJP.So, who is Chirag targeting? The NDA government in the state, or only chief minister Nitish Kumar, with whom he shares a bitter, uneasy relationship? Well, the LJP (RV) chief is certainly not attacking the BJP, as his latest tweet on deteriorating law and order in Bihar was hours after he had held a meeting with BJP chief J P Nadda.In 2020, when Chirag had walked out of the NDA ahead of the assembly elections over seat sharing, he had kept his ties with the BJP while targeting Nitish Kumar. He had then strategically fielded candidates to divide the NDA votes and ensure the defeat of JD(U) candidates in several assembly seats.Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) contested 137 seats in 2020, but mostly in constituencies where Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) was fighting and not the BJP. JD(U)’s seat count fell from 71 in 2015 to 43 in 2020. The party lost 72 seats of the total 115 it contested. In 27 of these, the LJP's vote share exceeded the margin of defeat. In 64 seats where the party failed to win, LJP’s vote tally exceeded the margin of victory, effectively altering the final outcome.This time around, Chirag is a Union minister and very much a part of the NDA at the Centre, but he is still playing the guessing game. While announcing his decision to contest elections, he slammed the lack of development in the state till now and announced that he is contesting elections to improve the condition of the people of Bihar. Interestingly, this is also what the opposition parties claim.Chirag had earlier announced that he would be contesting elections on all 243 seats to ensure that the NDA wins and forms a government again. Now, here is a catch. Perhaps, Chirag, whose party has no members in the state assembly at present, is preparing the ground to ensure that his party gets a good number of seats to contest. But that may be difficult as the JD(U) considers itself a key player and is unlikely to give up its claims despite the party's poor show in 2020.So, if Chirag is not satisfied with seat sharing, he may yet again, with perhaps tacit approval of the BJP, decide to contest alone even while continuing to be a part of the NDA at the Centre. His aim possibly would be to ensure again that the BJP does not suffer electorally while Nitish bears the brunt.If that indeed happens, Nitish will be left in the lurch. Already battling negative reports around his health, Nitish, who has dominated politics in Bihar for the last 20 years, faces one of the most challenging elections. He has already sworn again and again that he will make no more flip-flops, something that gave him the dubious distinction of being called the ""Paltu Ram"".CM Nitish is likely to be wary of Chirag's plans. The Bihar chief minister knows that if his party's tally plunges further, it will be the end of the road for him, especially when it comes to leading the NDA in the state. And the mantle would naturally pass on to the BJP.","Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) contested 137 seats in 2020. The party lost 72 seats of the total 115 it contested.

'Time For Revival...': Russia's Big Unity Call To Rivals India & China | 'RIC Troika Will...'

(With inputs from agencies)

BEIJING/NEW DELHI: China on Thursday expressed its support for Russia’s initiative to revive the dormant Russia-India-China (RIC) troika.Russian news portal Izvestia on Thursday quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying that Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format and is negotiating on this issue with Beijing and New Delhi.“This topic appears in our negotiations with both of them. We are interested in making this format work, because these three countries are important partners, besides being the founders of BRICS,” Rudenko said.“Therefore, the absence of this format, in my opinion, looks inappropriate. In this regard, we expect that the countries will agree to resume work within the framework of the RIC — of course, when relations between these states reach a level that allows them to work in a trilateral format,” he said.In India, the ministry of external affairs said RIC is a consultative format where the three countries discuss global issues and regional issues of interest to them. “As to when this particular RIC format meeting is going to be held, it is something that will be worked out among the three countries in a mutually convenient manner,” said the spokesperson.Asked for his reaction to Rudenko’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Thursday said, “China-Russia-India cooperation not only serves the respective interests of the three countries but also helps uphold peace, security, stability and progress in the region and the world.”China stands ready to maintain communication with Russia and India on advancing the trilateral cooperation, he said.The Russian and Chinese interests in the revival of RIC followed the recent visit of foreign minister S Jaishankar to China to take part in the SCO foreign ministers meeting, during which he held talks with his Chinese and Russian counterpaerts Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov.Joint work in the RIC format was stalled, first because of the Covid pandemic and then by the India-China military standoff at eastern Ladakh in 2020.","Russia's deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko says Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format.

While the shooters have been marked out from hospital CCTV footage and preliminary probes, their locations have not been traced yet, police said.Police said the murder appeared to have been orchestrated by Onkarnath alias Sheru Singh, a friend-turned-foe of Chandan currently serving life term for murder at Purulia jail in Bengal. “Sheru suspected Chandan had been informing the police about his members. Several of his associates were killed in the recent past,” a police officer said.Patna SSP Kartikeya K Sharma identified two other shooters as Monu Singh and Balwant Singh of Buxar -- Chandan’s home district. “The remaining two are also from Buxar but their names cannot be revealed now as it could affect the probe. Sheru seems to have orchestrated the entire conspiracy from Purulia jail,” the SSP said.Raids were conducted across Buxar on Friday. A suspicious SUV was stopped and three people detained but the cops could not find any evidence against them.","Bihar police announced that they had identified all five shooters, including the main gunman Tausif Badshah.

NEW DELHI: South Asian University (SAU) has expelled a Bangladeshi doctoral scholar and fined the students’ mess secretary Rs 5,000 for their role in a clash over the serving of non-vegetarian food on Maha Shivratri earlier this year. The disciplinary action follows an internal inquiry by the university’s Proctorial Committee.The February 26 incident saw an altercation in the university mess between two student groups after fish curry was served on the Hindu festival. According to students, members affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad had earlier requested that only vegetarian food be provided on Maha Shivratri as many were observing fasts. When fish curry appeared on the menu, ABVP members allegedly attempted to remove it from the serving counter, leading to a heated exchange and physical scuffle. A female member of the mess committee was allegedly manhandled during the confrontation.The Students’ Federation of India (SFI) accused ABVP members of trying to impose their dietary preferences on others and termed the incident an attack on secular values.ABVP, however, said the serving of non-vegetarian food on a fasting day was “insensitive” and disrupted religious harmony. Police received a PCR call about the ruckus, but officers found no active clash on arrival and no formal complaint was filed, leaving the university to handle the matter internally.After weeks of deliberation, the university found doctoral scholar Sudipto Das guilty of “serious misconduct” and ordered his immediate expulsion, citing repeated instances of indiscipline. He has been permanently barred from reapplying to any SAU programme and instructed to vacate his hostel within 24 hours. The university also noted that Das had previously been warned over a suspension in 2022 for similar disruptive behaviour. Mess secretary Yashada Sawant, while not directly involved in the confrontation, was held responsible for failing to maintain order in the mess and was fined Rs 5,000.The office order, issued on July 15, stated that the disciplinary action was taken with the approval of the competent authority.",South Asian University (SAU) has expelled a Bangladeshi doctoral scholar.

India welcomes move

MEA: TRF ban timely, important, strong assertion of Indo-US ties

Pakistan on Thursday suffered the humiliation of having its latest terror avatar, The Resistance Front (TRF), responsible for the Pahalgam massacre, being designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the US state department.TRF was also termed a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” in concurrence with the US treasury department. In a statement, secretary of state Marco Rubio called TRF, whose existence Islamabad denies, a “front and proxy” for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-backed terror outfit responsible for numerous terror attacks in India, including the 26/11 Mumbai carnage that killed 159.In a separate notification published in the Federal Register, Rubio said based upon a review of the administrative record assembled in this matter, and in consultation with the attorney general and the treasury secretary, he has concluded that “there is a sufficient factual basis to find that Lashkar-e-Taiba uses the additional aliases The Resistance Front; TRF; Kashmir Resistance Front; and Kashmir Resistance”. The linkage endorsed India’s stand that LeT continues to re-invent itself in Pakistan under new names.The announcement by the US state department designating TRF a Foreign Terrorist Organisation not only strengthens India's case for a UN ban on TRF but also spotlights Pakistan-sponsored terrorism exactly when Islamabad is looking to corner India on the J&K issue, using its ongoing presidency of the Security Council (UNSC) to hold an open debate next week on unresolved disputes.External affairs minister S Jaishankar welcomed the development, calling it a strong affirmation of India-US counterterrorism cooperation and appreciating the role of his counterpart Marco Rubio and the State Department.Separately, the MEA said in a statement that this was a timely and important step as the TRF had been involved in numerous terror-related activities, including the Pahalgam terrorist attack for which it twice claimed responsibility. As a non-permanent member, Pakistan had earlier worked – with help from China – to dilute the UNSC condemnation of the attack.One of the things it insisted on was removal of the terror group’s name from the statement. Since 2023 – well before the Pahalgam attack – India had been sharing information with the Monitoring Team of the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee, pointing to the TRF’s role as a cover for Pakistan based UN-proscribed terror groups like LeT and Jaish-eMohammed (JeM), for an international ban on the group.The govt is hoping that the US designation will bolster the case for TRF’s listing by the 1267 committee, even though it will be subject to approval not just by China but also, for now, Pakistan, a non-permanent member of the UNSC till the end of next year.“India has consistently emphasized the need for global cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the dismantling of terror infrastructure. The designation of TRF is a timely and important step reflecting the deep cooperation between India and the United States on counterterrorism,” said the ministry.The US ban on TRF is also the first real show of intent by the US under the second Trump administration to pin Pakistan down on the issue of cross-border terrorism. It follows multiple conflicting signals from Trump himself who made repeated remarks after India’ Operation Sindoor that seemed to equate India, which sees itself as the victim and not aggressor, with Pakistan.Trump, in fact, continues to maintain – much to the delight of Pakistan – that he mediated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, preventing a nuclear conflagration. “These actions... demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” Rubio said in a statement, even as Islamabad is angling for a US presidential visit on the margins of the Quad summit in India later this year.Pakistan reacted with its customary denials to the terror designations, insisting it is a “frontline state against terrorism” despite legions of terrorists from Osama bin Laden to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed sheltering there and its nationals conducting numerous terrorist attacks across the world, including in the US.“Investigations into the Pahalgam incident… are still inconclusive. Any linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation banned in Pakistan, belies ground realities,” Pakistan’s foreign ministry said.","Pakistan's latest terror avatar, The Resistance Front (TRF), responsible for the Pahalgam massacre, was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the US state department.

‘Use of derogatory terms go against SC guidelines’

NEW DELHI: A father’s fight for the dignity of his daughter, who has 65% intellectual disability, which made the court of the chief commissioner for persons with disabilities (CCPD) issue directives to remedy the situation, has led to the Indian Railways replacing the use of “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” on railway concession certificates.A disability rights advocate, Pankaj Maru had failed to get a response from railways regarding the terminology used in the concession certificate issued to his daughter, Sonu (26). On July 12 last year, he filed a complaint with court of CCPD regarding the description of his daughter’s disability —This (the terminology issue) was despite Pankaj Maru submitting the unique disability ID card of his daughter along with the application, wherein her disability was described as intellectual disability, in keeping with provisions of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016.In its final order Thursday, CCPD said the Railway Board had informed court on July 14 that an instruction dated May 9has been issued stating ministry of railways has decided to replace the term “mentally retarded persons” with “persons with intellectual disability”.The change has been implemented from June 1. CCPD emphasised the criticality of language in ensuring dignity of people with disabilities. While noting that the board had already issued a circular in 2018 whereby words such as “blind”, “deaf and dumb” and “physically challenged” were replaced with terms prescribed in RPwD Act, the court has recommended that railways should review their existing forms and all other documents to determine if similar corrections are required to be made and to ensure that the existing stationery is not used for any certification in future.CCPD cited the concern raised by Maru in his complaint that outdated and derogatory terms like “handicapped” still appear in preprinted concession certificate format, which goes against SC’s guidelines on respectful disability terminology. CCPD has sought an action-taken report within three months and also asked railways to sensitise its staff on types and sub-types of disabilities.In its observations in the case in Feb, CCPD had countered railways’ interpretation of legal provisions as reason for continuing with the use of “mental retardation” in concession forms.It noted that the “Railway Board’s contention that intellectual disability and mental behaviour have been separately defined in the Schedule to RPwD Act, 2016 is correct, but their averment that ‘retardation’ is defined under ‘mental behaviour’ is not. In fact, the definition of ‘mental behaviour’ in the schedule of the law explicitly excludes “retardation’.”","A father’s fight for the dignity of his daughter, who has 65% intellectual disability, has led to the Indian Railways replacing the use of “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” on railway concession certificates.

‘This is a story of universal values, a story of ours to tell’

If Ram could send one tweet from the forest, what would he say? If Raavan could do a TED talk, what would it be titled? A week before the premiere of ‘ Ramayana ’ at the Arts Council of Pakistan in Karachi on July 11, 30-year-old finance grad-turned-director Yogeshwar Karera shot off Karan Johar-style rapid-fire questions at his cast for a social media promo.This was no ordinary stage production — the Hindu epic had never been performed in Pakistan before. The cast was entirely Muslim, except for the director, and the play used AI to enhance storytelling. Despite recent Indo-Pak tensions, it sold around 1,000 tickets and generated buzz on both sides of the border.“We weren’t expecting such a response,” says Karera, surprised by the congratulatory messages pouring in for Mauj Collective, the theatre group he co-founded a year ago. He says the near-war between the two countries did not impact the play. “The sponsors and venues had no reservations at all about staging it. Only the media has asked us these questions. In fact, it didn’t even cross our minds that this might be seen as sensitive or controversial,” says Raana Kazmi, co-founder of Mauj Collective with a day job in human resources.People from all backgrounds came, regardless of their religion.Families with kids, students, the elderly, everyone. A friend told me about how a parent explained each scene to their child,” says Kazmi, who played the role of Sita. Samhan Ghazi brought fierce intensity to the role of Raavan. Karera, a Sindhi who moved to Karachi in his teens, says his fascination for the epic tale of good triumphing over evil started young.“I was five years old when I first watched Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan on Doordarshan. The story grabbed me from the start,” says Karera, who decided to pursue theatre full time in the middle of his finance and accounting degree.After getting a diploma at the National Academy of Performing Arts in Pakistan, Karera and two friends, Kazmi and Sana Toaha, founded Mauj Collective. The year-old theatre troupe uses tech-savvy stagecraft, social media flair and scripts that speak to a younger generation.Although some have interpreted Mauj’s ‘Ramayana’ as a statement on religious unity, the group maintains their goal wasn’t about sending a message. “None of us ever felt like we were telling a story outside the world we inhabit. I’ve grown up with this story of the Ramayana. I may not belong to the community religiously, but this is a story of our subcontinent. It never felt like the story wasn’t ours to tell. The values in it are universal,” says Ashmal Lalwany, who played Ram in the production.Some Sanskrit and Hindi words were adapted to terms more familiar to a Karachi audience. For instance, ‘prakriti’ became ‘kudrat’. Sometimes, this would lead to amusing confusion. “In one scene, Hanuman is supposed to give me a ring.Now, I know the word ‘anguthi’ means ‘ring,’ and that’s it. But one day during rehearsal, Jibran Khan (who plays Hanuman) says, “Aap is mundrika ko dekhein”. I was just standing there like, ‘Where am I supposed to look? What is a mundrika?” laughs Kazmi.","Young drama group stages Pak’s 1st Ramayana in Karachi. The Hindu epic had never been performed in Pakistan before.

Bid to suppress debate on tree-felling: Congress

RAIPUR: Enforcement Directorate arrested on Friday Chaitanya Baghel, son of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, from his residence in Bhilai after the agency conducted an early morning search at his premises in connection with an alleged Rs 2,100 crore liquor scam during his father’s tenure as CM.Chaitanya was presented at a special PMLA court in Raipur which sent him to five-day ED custody, an agency official said, adding that Chaitanya did not cooperate during the searches. The father-son duo stays in the same house, while Baghel also has an MLA residence in Raipur. When ED carried out searches, Baghel was at his Raipur residence and was proceeding to Vidhan Sabha.The timing of the raid, on the last day of the assembly session, triggered sharp political reactions, particularly from the opposition Congress.ED’s early-morning raid and the subsequent arrest of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel’s son Chaitanya set off sharp reactions, with Congress alleging that the move was designed to suppress discussion on deforestation in Tamnar region of Raigarh district linked to a particular industrialist.ED had earlier searched Chaitanya Baghel’s premises on March 10 while probing some transactions allegedly linking him and his entities to “proceeds of crime” in the liquor “scam” case.The agency did not disclose details of the charges against Chaitanya, but in an earlier press note, it had claimed that some senior bureaucrat, having protection of “top executive of the state”, carried out the scam.Reacting to the arrest, Baghel Senior said the Centre was misusing its agencies to target opposition netas. “To please their master PM Modi and Amit Shah, they have sent ED to my house. We won’t be scared or bow down,” he said. He, however, said he would cooperate with the probe.In this case, ED had in Jan arrested former excise minister Kawasi Lakhma; Anwar Dhebar, brother of Raipur mayor and Congress’s Aijaz Dhebar; and senior babus, including IAS officer Anil Tuteja and a telecom service officer, Arunpati Tripathi.After the arrest of Lakhma, ED had claimed that he was “aware of the complete affairs of the liquor scam, yet he did nothing to stop it”. The agency has accused Lakhma of receiving Rs 2 crore every month from the syndicate involved in illegal liquor trade.ED had also said Lakhma played an important role in policy change, which led to the introduction of FL-10A licence in Chhattisgarh. “He was an integral part of the syndicate and assisted it by manoeuvring the process and procedures as per their direction,” it said. The agency has so far attached assets worth over Rs 200 crore in the case.Baghel later said, “The adjournment motion moved by Congress in the Chhattisgarh assembly over tree felling being carried out by Adani Group in Tamnar was disallowed by Speaker Raman Singh. The opposition alleged that there has been no adherence to the PESA Act, no compliance with directives issued by the National Green Tribunal, and even the resolution unanimously passed by the state assembly has been disregarded. Not even a discussion was permitted.”Bringing an adjournment motion in the assembly, leader of the opposition Charandas Mahant and Baghel alleged in their speeches that “Tamnar coal mine, which has been allotted to Maharashtra State Power Generation Company with its mine operator and developer being Adani, is being run solely for the benefit of a single industrialist, while local residents are being harassed and displaced”.","Chaitanya Baghel is the son of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel.

Varma questions validity of in-house procedure that allows CJI to recommend removal of judge

Cong MPs to sign motion in LS against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: Ahead of a possible removal motion in Parliament’s monsoon session, Justice Yashwant Varma moved Supreme Court for quashing of an in-house inquiry report holding him guilty for the huge illicit cash at his official residence in Delhi and challenged the constitutionality of then CJI Sanjiv Khanna’s recommendation to the Centre to strip him of HC judgeship.Justice Varma, whose defence team is led by senior advocates including Kapil Sibal, filed the petition faulting the process adopted by the three-member panel to inquire into the cash allegedly found at his bungalow, terming the panel’s conclusions about his guilt as mere surmises without evidence.Interestingly, the day saw a PIL being filed in the SC by advocate Mathews Nedumpara seeking registration of an FIR for the unaccounted cash that was discovered within the premises of the judge’s official residence by first responders who reached after a fire on the night of March 14. Many former judges of Delhi HC shared the view of the PIL petitioner and said only a thorough investigation by a probe agency could unravel the money trail.In the writ petition filed through advocate Vaibhav Niti, Justice Varma asked why Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel, who discovered the cash, did not seize it or prepare a ‘panchnama’, which alone could have been admissible evidence. He accused then CJI Khanna of subjecting him to a media trial by uploading unsubstantiated material against him on the SC’s official website.Repatriated to Allahabad HC during the inquiry, the judge said the panel’s report was handed over to him on May 4 and the then CJI “advised him to resign or seek voluntary retirement by 7pm on May 6, failing which the CJI would ‘intimate competent authority to initiate action for his removal’”.The judge, who had been barred from judicial work, said he was denied a personal hearing he had sought, as per the in-house procedure, before the CJI and senior SC judges, prior to the CJI sending the recommendation to the President and the PM on May 8, just five days before CJI Khanna retired.He requested that SC declare the CJI’s recommendation unconstitutional and ultra vires. He also questioned the constitutional validity of the in-house procedure that empowered the CJI to recommend removal of a constitutional court judge.This in-house process “creates a parallel, extra-constitutional mechanism that derogates from the mandatory framework under Articles 124 and 218 of the Constitution, which exclusively vest powers for removal of judges of high courts in Parliament through an address supported by a special majority, following an inquiry under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968”, he said.Justice Varma said power to remove constitutional court judges was given to Parliament by the Constitution after conducting a thorough trial of the charges against a judge with in-built safeguards including framing of charges, cross-examination, and proof beyond reasonable doubt for ‘proven misbehaviour’.Thus, the in-house procedure, as far as it usurps parliamentary procedure to recommend removal of judges, violates the doctrine of separation of powers. Judiciary cannot assume the role reserved for the legislature in the removal of judges, Justice Varma said.He said the Constitution conferred no disciplinary or superintendence power with the CJI over HC or SC judges. Thus, the CJI cannot assume, through in-house procedure, an unregulated authority to act as the arbiter of the fate of HC and SC judges, he said.Justice Varma’s challenge mirrors the line Sibal took on his YouTube show last week to dissect the inquiry report with panellists: former SC judges Justices Madan Lokur and Sanjay Kaul and ex-Delhi HC judge Justice Mukta Gupta. In the show, Sibal argued that the in-house inquiry was not consistent with constitutional provisions.Congress MPs will sign the motion that govt will bring in Lok Sabha against Justice Yashwant Varma, with the party saying it will be done to set up a 3-member statutory panel which is required under Judges Inquiry Act before a judge’s removal. Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh said opposition will also push govt to move on the motion to remove against Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Yadav, who is accused of making “hate speech”.Ramesh slammed non-registration of an FIR against Varma, saying the entire process has been based on a report of the in-house panel of SC. He said Justice Yadav violated his oath with his speech but the notice to remove him is pending with Rajya Sabha chairman for past seven months.",Justice Yashwant Varma questions validity of in-house procedure that allows CJI to recommend removal of judge.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Parliament’s Monsoon session, several Union ministers, including Rajnath Singh , Amit Shah, J P Nadda and Kiren Rijiju, on Friday strategised over the BJP-led govt’s stand on germane issues amid the opposition raising the heat on matters such as the revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls, Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor The strategy session of the group of ministers at defence minister Singh’s residence also comes ahead of the customary all-party meeting scheduled on Sunday. Though there was no official comment on the agenda of the Friday meeting, sources said it was related to the Parliament session. Union ministers Piyush Goyal and G Kishan Reddy were among those present at the strategy meeting. Singh is likely to chair the all-party meeting.Opposition parties have also been pushing the govt to bring a bill in Parliament on restoring statehood to J&K. On the special intensive revision (SIR) of rolls in Bihar, they have claimed that it is aimed at benefiting BJP. They have also seized on US President Donald Trump's claim of mediating the “ceasefire” between India and Pakistan during Operation Sindoor to attack the Modi govt. BJP and its Bihar allies have backed the SIR in the poll-bound state, asserting that it is aimed at ensuring that only eligible people are allowed to vote in the assembly polls and take welfare benefits.Ahead of the opposition’s meeting to chart the course for the coming monsoon session of Parliament, Congress said govt must allocate two days to discuss in Parliament the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent events.The INDIA bloc will meet online on Saturday, while the Parliament session will get underway from Monday. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the Pahalgam terror attack issue is serious as the terrorists have not been arrested yet, while the claims of US President Donald Trump about the IndiaPakistan “ceasefire” have added a new dimension to the cessation of Operation Sindoor.He said the revelations by three top defence officials including the chief of defence staff and the remarks of Lt General Rahul Singh about China’s role, have made the subject “very significant”.

Indian farmers are hit by the double whammy of stagnant income and declining profit margins, according to an analysis of data compiled by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). For nearly all major crops, the increase in agricultural income over the last decade has not kept pace with the rural inflation rate.The data also shows that the profit margins for most crops have declined. The analysis of ten major crops for both kharif and rabi seasons shows that, except for maize, groundnut and rapeseed/mustard, the increase in farm income has been less than the rural inflation rate during the same period.In 2013-14, the average input cost was Rs 25,179 per hectare for paddy while the value of family labour was assessed at Rs 8,452 per hectare. The value of the crop was Rs 53,242 per hectare, which meant a profit of Rs 19,611 per hectare. In 2023-24, this profit increased to Rs 30,216 per hectare. Although this was a 54% jump, consumer prices in rural areas increased by 65% between 2013-14 and 2023-24. The crop also saw a decline in profit margins.I n 2013-14, the profit margin was 58% of the input and labour costs, which has now dropped to 49.3% of the cost. The input cost and family labour is taken as the total expense to calculate the profit margin since this spending is also part of the formula for Minimum Support Price (MSP). Wheat, unlike paddy, is primarily a rabi (winter) crop, but a comparison of decadal growth in income and margins shows a similar pattern.The surplus over input cost and family labour was Rs 29,442 per hectare in 2012-13 and increased by 53% to Rs 45,179 in 2022-23. That’s lower than the 71% increase in rural consumer prices between 2012-13 and 2022-23. The profit margin too decreased from 123% in 2012-13 to 103% in 2022-23. Sugarcane, another major crop, also saw a stagnation in net income.From Rs 96,451 per hectare in 2012-13, the profits increased to 1,21,668 in 2022-23. This 26% increase is lower than the increase in consumer price inflation. In 2012-13, the profit margin was 151%, which declined to 102% in 2022-23. Of the ten major crops (based on highest output) for which the comparison is done, only three have shown an increase in income higher than the inflation rate.These are maize (162%), rapeseed & mustard (85.7%) and groundnut (71.4%). For the rest, the increase was lower than the inflation rate. It was between 50% and 60% for gram, between 20% and 30% for soyabean and cotton, and less than 20% for arhar (tur). Apart from stagnant incomes, the profit margins have declined for all of these crops except maize. These per-hectare profits are roughly equal to the seasonal incomes for a vast majority of Indian farmers.The average land holding size in the Agriculture Census of 2015-16 was just under 1.1 hectares, but most farmers (68.5%) are marginal farmers, which means they own less than 1 hectare of land (averaging at 0.38 hectare). This means that seasonal income for them will be even lower. Experts have pointed out that the stagnation as well as lower agricultural income is due to the extent of mismatch between the share of agriculture in GDP and in employment.Despite contributing only 16% of GDP, agriculture employs more than 40% of India’s workforce. In advanced economies like the US, its share in GDP and employment is 0.9% and 2%, respectively. Even in a developing economy like China, agriculture’s contribution to GDP is 6.8% while it employs 22% of the workforce.","For nearly all major crops, the increase in agricultural income over the last decade has not kept pace with the rural inflation rate.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of rural development (MoRD) has asked states to take immediate corrective action and bolster monitoring of the National Mobile Monitoring System (NMMS) for MGNREGA, saying that several instances have come to its notice about the system for capturing daily attendance and work site photographs being “misused or manipulated”.The ministry has also asked states and UTs to identify users and officials responsible for the “misuse or deliberate manipulation” of NMMS and take strict disciplinary action against them.In the communication dated July 8, the ministry said that “such serious discrepancies undermine the credibility of the digital attendance system and may lead to potential misuse of public funds”. The discrepancies include upload of irrelevant or unrelated photographs, photo-to-photo capturing instead of live work images, and the same photo of workers being on multiple muster rolls.“These irregularities raise significant concerns regarding the lack of monitoring and accountability at the state, district and block levels, which is affecting the integrity of the implementation process and may lead to financial irregularities and potential corruption. Thus, the purpose of NMMS in Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is really at stake,” the note from MGNREGA division of the department of rural development stated.To check the irregularities, MoRD has listed measures the states have to implement. These include a manual verification process to begin with, setting a target number of photos to be verified at the gram panchayat, block, district and state levels. The states have to submit verification reports to the ministry and also set up NMMS monitoring cells.Meanwhile, Congress has lashed out at the Modi govt over the issue, with party general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh pointing out in a statement that Congress had been highlighting its operational problems since the NMMS app was introduced in May 2022. The party has demanded the “immediate withdrawal of the unworkable and counterproductive NMMS model based on photo uploads and reaffirmation of task-based payments, which is the essence of MGNREGA”.Citing the July 8 note, Ramesh said the MoRD has “finally acknowledged various problems associated with NMMS”.","The ministry of rural development (MoRD) has asked states to take immediate corrective action and bolster monitoring of the National Mobile Monitoring System.

NEW DELHI: The Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has recruited 451 candidates to the post of insurance medical officer through the UPSC ’s Pratibha Setu portal — which has on offer a talent pool of nearly 10,000 candidates who had cleared all stages of select UPSC recruitment examinations, including the Civil Services Examination, but did not make it to the final list of recommended candidates.In an update on LinkedIn, ESIC, which comes under the Union ministry of labour, said the 451 candidates were selected after going through the list of non-recommended candidates from Combined Medical Services Examination (CMSE) held in 2022 and 2023, on the Pratibha Setu portal.The UPSC Pratibha (an acronym for Professional Resource and Talent Integration — Bridge for Hiring Aspirants) Setu portal is a strategic initiative that allows verified employers, including ministries, public sector units (PSUs), autonomous bodies and private organisations, to access details of non-recommended, willing candidates who had cleared the written examinations and made it to the interview stage.Pratibha Setu was born out of the public disclosure scheme, started by department of personnel and training (DoPT) in 2018, under which UPSC published details of such non-recommended candidates from the Civil Services Examination, Indian Forest Service Examination, Central Armed Police Forces (ACs) Examination, Engineering Services Examination, Combined Geo-scientist Examination, CDS Examination, Indian Economic Service Examination, Indian Statistical Service Examination and Combined Medical Services Examination.“Many of these non-recommended candidates usually end up becoming teachers or run coaching centres for future aspirants. They can now be picked up by the private sector and PSUs for jobs suited to their qualifications and aptitude, via Pratibha Setu portal,” minister of state for personnel Jitendra Singh told TOI on Friday.A soft biodata of the non-recommended candidates, with their educational qualifications and contact details, is available on the portal.The first-of-its-kind initiative offers a platform for candidates who cleared UPSC exams but did not get recommended, to connect with prospective employers who are looking for meritorious candidates with high qualifications. Any duly registered private company, PSU, etc. may register on Pratibha Setu portal using their corporate identification number. With OTP-based verification, their nodal officer can access the dashboard and the Pratibha Setu software functionalities.","The Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has recruited 451 candidates to the post of insurance medical officer.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Bihar assembly elections , RJD leader Lalu Prasad suffered a setback on Friday with SC declining to stay ongoing trial proceedings against him in land-for-job ‘scam’ cases, in which CBI charge-sheeted him for allegedly securing plots of land from those who got jobs in the railways during 2004-09 when he was railway minister.When senior advocate Kapil Sibal attempted to discredit the cases against Prasad, lodged in 2022 after more than a decade of the alleged ‘scam’, by terming it as political vendetta, additional solicitor general S V Raju told a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh that Prasad’s petition for quashing of FIRs in the cases is still pending in the Delhi HC and that the former railway minister has challenged an interim order of HC.Though Sibal maintained with vehemence that “it is the most unfortunate case” and accused CBI of starting a probe without mandatory sanction under section 17-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the bench said, “We will not stay the trial. However, we can direct the trial court to dispense with Prasad’s personal presence. Let HC decide the main issue.”After investigations, CBI on June 7 last year filed the third and final chargesheet before a special court in Delhi against Prasad, his wife Rabri Devi, son Tej Pratap Yadav and daughter Hema Yadav, and others.

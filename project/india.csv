"'US did it, why can't Pakistan?': Indian envoy demands Hafiz Saeed's extradition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-did-it-why-cant-pakistan-indian-envoy-demands-hafiz-saeeds-extradition/articleshow/121280078.cms,"Hafiz Saeed (File photo)

NEW DELHI: India's ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, has said that Operation Sindoor , launched in response to crossborder terrorism from Pakistan, is only ""paused"" and ""not over"".In an interview with Israeli news channel i24, Singh called for the formation of a global coalition against terrorism and drew parallel with the example of Tahawwur Rana 's extradition by US. Indian envoy demanded that Pakistan should also hand over key terror figures, including LeT chief Hafiz Saeed , Sajid Mir, and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi.Recounting the events leading up to the operation, Singh referred to the April 22 Pahalgam attack, in which 26 civilians were killed after being targeted based on their religion. He said India's response was focused specifically on terrorist groups and their infrastructure within Pakistan.However, he added that Pakistan responded by attacking Indian military installations.""The terrorists killed people based on their religion,"" Singh said. ""India's operation was against terror groups and their infrastructure to which Pakistan responded by attacking India's military installations.""When asked if the ceasefire signalled an end to the conflict, Singh responded that the operation had only been paused. ""The ceasefire is still holding on but we have made it very clear that Operation Sindoor is paused, it's not yet over,"" he said. ""Wherever terrorists are, we have to kill those terrorists and we have to destroy their infrastructure.""Singh described the Indian airstrike on Pakistan’s Nur Khan base on May 10 as a game changer. He claimed the strike caused panic in Pakistan and prompted its Director General of Military Operations to reach out to India seeking a ceasefire.On the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty , which Pakistan has described as an act of war, Singh said that India could no longer uphold a treaty based on goodwill and friendship while facing constant terrorist attacks from across the border. He pointed out that although India continued to allow water to flow to Pakistan, the latter allowed terror to flow in the opposite direction. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s view that ""blood and water cannot flow together"" reflected the public's growing frustration, which led to the suspension of the treaty.""Terror must stop,"" Singh said, stressing that any treaty could only function if Pakistan ended its support for terrorism. He added, ""While IWT is in abeyance, another IWT is operational - Operation Sindoor is India's War Against Terrorism.""Singh named Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad as the two core groups behind the long list of terror attacks in India and said their leaders continue to roam freely in Pakistan. He said Pakistan could defuse tensions simply by handing over the key individuals India has long demanded.""They need to do a very simple thing - when the preamble includes goodwill and friendship, they just need to hand over these terrorists to us,"" he said.Referring again to the US example, Singh questioned why Pakistan could not follow the same path. ""When the US can hand over these culprits, why can't Pakistan hand over? They have to simply hand over Hafeez Saeed, Lakhvi, Sajid Mir and things will be over,"" he said.Singh dismissed Pakistan’s offer to investigate the Pahalgam attack as a tactic to deflect attention. He questioned what had come of earlier investigations into the Mumbai, Pathankot, and Pulwama attacks. ""We have given them dossiers after dossiers - we have given them technical inputs. America has shared with them evidence. Everything is there but what have they done?"" he asked.He mentioned that despite being named as planners and executioners of the Mumbai attack, Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed remain at large. ""So we can't believe them,"" he added.Pointing out that terrorism is a global threat, Singh called for deeper cooperation among affected nations. ""At an international level, all those countries including India, Israel and many other countries that face the brunt of terrorism, we need to expand our diplomatic reach, we need to cooperate, we need to form a coalition against terrorism and most importantly against the supporters of these terrorist groups.""He also added that by underlining India's unwavering position. ""Our prime minister has made it very clear - very clear - that we have zero tolerance on terrorism. We are not going to accept this cross-border terrorism .""","India's ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, has said that Operation Sindoor is only ""paused"" and ""not over"" Singh called for the formation of a global coalition against terrorism and drew parallel with the example of Tahawwur Rana's extradition by US.

NEW DELHI: Director general of Army Air Defence, Lt Gen Sumer Ivan D'Cunha , on Monday said that India has the capability to strike targets anywhere within Pakistan. Speaking in the context of Operation Sindoor , he explained that the Indian armed forces are fully prepared to respond across the entire depth of Pakistani territory if needed.In an interview with news agency ANI, Lt Gen D'Cunha said, ""The whole of Pakistan is within range."" He added that even if the Pakistan Army moves its General Headquarters (GHQ) from Rawalpindi to areas like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), they would have to ""find a deep hole.""During Operation Sindoor, India carried out strikes on important Pakistani airbases using loitering munitions to hit key targets.Lt Gen D'Cunha said, ""I just like to say that India has an adequate arsenal of weapons to take on Pakistan right across its depth. So, from its broadest to its narrowest, wherever it is, the whole of Pakistan is within range. We are absolutely capable, from our borders or even in depth, where we can take on the entire Pakistan. And the GHQ can move from Rawalpindi to KPK or wherever they want to move, but they are all within range, so they will have to really find a deep hole.""He said that Indian forces used locally developed technology, including long-range drones and guided munitions, which played a role in the operation.Lt Gen D'Cunha also said that the armed forces are responsible for protecting the country and its people.""Our job is to protect our sovereignty, our people... So, I think that the very fact that we have been able to protect our motherland from this onslaught, which was aimed at causing a lot of problems in population centers and in our cantonments, the very fact that we have given this reassurance to our people, not only to our civil population... a lot of our own jawans, officers, wives were staying in cantonments. And they were also equally concerned about these drone attacks. And the very fact that we ensured that this did not manifest in any casualties, I am sure it not only made the soldier feel proud, it made the families feel proud. And finally, the population of India feel proud. I think that's the takeaway.""Le Gen D'Cunha also highlighted India's preparedness in modern warfare, particularly in neutralising drones and other advanced technologies during Operation Sindoor.""The Russia-Ukraine clash and even to some extent the Israeli current conflict, taught us about the huge capability that drones have. We realised that Pakistan, by its backend support from Turkey and maybe a northern adversary as well, had a plethora of drones. We also knew that in order to take on an effective air defence integrated system that we have, they (Pakistan) would have to saturate us. So, if you see his concept of employment, they (Pakistan) would first send in low-altitude, cheaper drones in large numbers to saturate your radars, and they would also force you to open up your radars...We anticipated this, and about maybe on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, we did a simulation exercise at the behest of our army chief in the border areas, where we simulated drone attacks on the weapon system. It was not from the border, but it was internal, on the border... We started at 5:30 in the morning, maybe on the 26th for the first day, when multiple drones were coming in to train our people,"" he said.India had launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting nine terror-related sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir.This was in response to a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam last month, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists. Following India’s strike, Pakistan retaliated with shelling across the Line of Control and Jammu and Kashmir, along with attempted drone attacks along the border.After Pakistan's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase. Both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on May 10.","Director general of Army Air Defence, Lt Gen Sumer Ivan D'Cunha, said India has the capability to strike targets anywhere within Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said there was no ""rule"" that an accused in a money laundering case had to spend at least a year in jail before being granted bail , and gave relief to one of the accused in the Chhattisgarh liquor scam who had spent over nine months in custody.As the counsel appearing for the Enforcement Directorate took the stand that bail could not be granted to the accused as he was arrested in Aug last year and had not completed a year behind bars, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said it was not a ""rule"" to be in custody for a year to get bail.The ED counsel said SC had been following the one-year custody ""benchmark"" to grant bail in various cases, including that of former Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji, and argued that the yardstick be followed in the case of liquor scam accused Anwar Dhebar 's bail plea too.The bench then asked the ED counsel whether he wanted the accused to spend seven years in jail which is the maximum sentence.The court said trial in the case was not going to wind up in the near future as there were more than 450 witnesses in the predicate offence. The counsel, however, insisted that the accused was a politically connected and influential person and his bail would hamper the trial. The court did not accept his submission and granted Anwar Dhebar bail. It asked the trial court to release the accused within a week on terms and conditions fixed by the special court.SC had said on Jan 17 that in cases where an accused has spent one year in jail and the charges against them in a money laundering case have not yet been framed, they could be considered for bail.The apex court has been granting bail to various accused in money laundering cases after reading down the stringent bail provisions of PMLA by ruling that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds to release accused on bail.

According to an official document, the SOP was recommended by a committee constituted for the adoption and implementation of uniform guidelines to be followed by departments, faculties, and centres during the admission process. The recommendation was duly approved by the vice-chancellor in April last year.In addition to the student's own declaration, the SOP includes a ""Declaration by the Father/Local Guardian of the Student,"" which reads: ""I hereby declare that I take full responsibility of his/her conduct and character as a student of Jamia Millia Islamia.

In Feb, students held a sit-in protest near the central canteen of the university, demanding the revocation of disciplinary action against their peers. Following this, the university filed a police complaint, and several students later alleged that police officials contacted their parents, asking them to ensure their wards left the protest site.TOI reached out to Jamia media cordinator Saima Saeed for a comment but did not receive any response.

Mango Shipments to US rejected

US authorities have rejected no fewer than 15 mango shipments from India at various airports, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta, due to documentation irregularities. The exporters faced the choice of either destroying the fruit in the US or sending it back to India. Given the perishable nature of mangoes and the substantial costs involved in return shipping, all exporters opted to dispose of the mango shipments locally.The United States represents India's primary export destination for mangoes, making these incidents particularly significant for the trade relationship.Considering mangoes are perishable and the substantial expenses linked to destruction or re-exportation, traders anticipate losses of around $500,000.The mangoes had undergone the required irradiation process in Mumbai on May 8 and 9. However, according to an ET report US officials found inconsistencies in the documentation related to this mandatory treatment, which involves exposing the fruit to controlled radiation doses to eliminate pests and prolong shelf life. The issue stemmed from administrative errors in the pest-control documentation rather than actual pest presence, the report said. USDA communication to an affected exporter indicated that US Customs and Border Protection refused entry ""due to incorrectly issued PPQ203."" The notice specified that the shipment ""must be re-exported or destroyed,"" whilst clarifying that the US government would not bear costs for ""remedial measures for this shipment.""The irradiation procedure takes place at a facility situated in Navi Mumbai, overseen by a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) representative. This official is tasked with validating the PPQ203 form, which is essential for mango exports to the US. ""We are being penalised for mistakes made at the irradiation facility,"" an exporter said.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right Another exporter, whose consignment was detained at Los Angeles airport during May 9-11, before receiving destruction orders, was notified that the shipment failed to satisfy the ""entry requirement,"" specifically regarding the mandatory irradiation treatment.The exporter firmly denied the allegation, asserting that the irradiation procedure was completed and the PPQ203 form was issued following the treatment. ""How can we receive the form if the treatment was never done? And without that form, issued by none other than the USDA officer, the mangoes couldn't even have been cleared for loading at Mumbai airport,"" he said.When asked about the specifics of the case, including the quantity of affected mangoes and documentation discrepancies, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Authority (APEDA) chairman's office responded, ""The matter pertains to the shipment of mangoes from USDA approved facility, Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) located at Vashi, Mumbai. Hence inputs may be sought from them. "" APEDA operates under the ministry of commerce and industry. MSAMB did not provide any response to the email enquiry.Meanwhile, India and US are looking to seal a trade deal soon. US President Donald Trump has claimed that India has offered a deal with 'literally no tariffs'. The first phase of the deal is expected to be completed in the coming months.India aims to enhance two-way trade by seeking tariff reductions from the United States for sectors employing large workforces. These include textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes, and bananas under the proposed trade agreement.The United States, in return, seeks reduced duties across various sectors including industrial products, automobiles (specifically electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical products, dairy items, agricultural produce such as apples, and tree nuts.Also Read | Donald Trump says India has offered a trade deal with ‘literally no tariffs’","Mango shipments to US rejected at Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta airports.

Experts: Frequent hike will shut more shops

Poll Do you support the liquor shop owners' decision to strike against the recent licence fee hikes? Yes, it's a justified protest No, they should comply with regulations





BENGALURU: Buffeted by repeated hikes in excise duties and licence fees in the past two years, thousands of distilleries and liquor shops in Karnataka are planning a strike and demonstration on May 20 and a complete shutdown of all industry activities on May 21. Store owners are planning to stop purchasing liquor from govt depots as a mark of protest. Karnataka Wine Merchants Association , along with National Restaurant Association of India and Karnataka Brewery and Distilleries Association , took the dual-protest measure after the latest blow came in the form of govt's May 15 draft notification doubling licence fees.Calling fee hikes ""steep and unbearable"", the store owners will shutter down on Wednesday. Of 12,000 licensed liquor stores in Karnataka,over 5,000 are participating in the shutdown.According to the draft notification, the annual licence fee for breweries has increased from Rs 27 lakh to Rs 54 lakh, while for distilleries and warehouses, it has risen from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 90 lakh. The new fees take effect on July 1.Industry representatives told TOI such frequent increases will lead to more business closures and higher prices for consumers. Nearly 30,000 letters of objections have been collected from employees, licensees, customers, vendors, and landlords, highlighting concern over a fourfold increase in fee this year.A senior excise department official said the hikes were implemented to address revenue shortfalls from the previous year. ""The hike was a decision taken by the govt and we just implemented it. The decision is taken to cover the gap for the previous year target,"" the official said.While the revenue target for 2024-25 was set at Rs 38,525 crore, the department managed to collect only Rs 35,530 crore, or 92.3% of the target.Retailers noted the fresh licence fee hikes will particularly affect budget-segment sales and small outlets. More than 40 pubs in Bengaluru closed last year due to rising costs and declining customer numbers.A pub chain owner in Koramangala, said: ""The hikes are eating into all our profits. Earlier, it was AED (additional excise duty) hikes, now even the licence fee is doubled. We might as well shut our businesses. Even in peak summer, there are barely any sales.""Sampath Kumar, vice-president of Karnataka Wine Merchants Association, said: ""We had a meeting on Friday with our committee members. Both consumers and merchants can't bear the expenses.""Ananth Narayana, secretary of National Restaurant Association of India, added: ""We generate so much employment, pay crores in taxes, yet the govt is intent on killing the golden goose. Last time, we saw excise collection dip after taxes increased, and many outlets went into the red.

They will be joined by Hong Kong, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, who secured their spots by finishing in the top three of the 2024 ACC Men's Premier Cup.Defending champions India will return to protect their crown, having thrashed Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the final to clinch their eighth Asia Cup title, the most by any team in the tournament’s history.The 2023 Asia Cup was surrounded by political tensions, with India refusing to travel to Pakistan. As a result, India played their matches in Sri Lanka under a hybrid hosting model.In a six-nation tournament that included Nepal, India dominated the Super Fours, handing arch-rivals Pakistan a crushing 228-run defeat, effectively knocking them out of the competition.The final, held in Colombo, was one-sided as Mohammed Siraj’s fiery spell saw him claim six wickets, bundling Sri Lanka out for just 50 runs.India chased down the target in no time to lift the trophy in style.Post-Asia Cup, India also declined to travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, playing all their matches in Dubai.In the group stage, they beat co-hosts Pakistan who failed to progress further. India went on to defeat New Zealand in the final to claim the Champions Trophy title.","The Asia Cup 2025 is scheduled to be held in September, and like the last edition, it will be played in the T20 format.

'Judges also human': Justice Abhay S Oka admits error in judgment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-also-human-justice-abhay-s-oka-admits-error-in-judgment/articleshow/121277892.cms,"'Even for judges, learning process always continues'

NEW DELHI: Judges are also human and they can make mistakes while judging, Justice Abhay S Oka said Monday while admitting that he committed a mistake in deciding a case as a Bombay HC judge in 2016 relating to interpretation of the Domestic Violence Act and said it was a continuous learning process for judges.While holding that HCs have jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC to quash proceedings of an application filed under Section 12(1) of DV Act, which says an aggrieved woman may approach a magistrate for relief such as payment of compensation, Justice Oka, who penned the verdict for the bench comprising himself and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, said as an HC judge, he had taken a contrary view on the issue.SC said that HCs must keep in mind that DV Act is a welfare legislation specially enacted to give justice to women who suffer from domestic violence.Therefore, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 for quashing proceedings under Section 12(1), the high court should be very slow and circumspect. Interference can be made only when the case is clearly of gross illegality or gross abuse of the process of law, the bench said.Generally, the high court must adopt a hands-off approach while dealing with proceedings under Section 482 for quashing an application under Section 12(1). Unless high courts show restraint... the very object of enacting the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 will be defeated, the bench added.Justice Abhay S Oka, who penned the verdict for the bench, said: ""Before we part with this judgment, we must mention here that one of us (Abhay S Oka) is a party to a judgment dated Oct 27, 2016, of Bombay high court (HC) in writ petition 2473 of 2016 in which the view taken is that remedy under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is not available for quashing the proceedings under Section 12(1) of DV Act, 2005.""""This view was found to be incorrect by a full bench of the same high court. As judges, we are duty-bound to correct our mistakes in properly constituted proceedings. Even for judges, the learning process always continues,"" he said.""There are decisions of high courts taking a view that the jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC is not available to quash proceedings... under Section 12(1) of Domestic Violence Act. The decisions are primarily based on the premise that the proceedings... predominantly of a civil nature. The said view is not correct for the reasons set out earlier,"" Justice Oka said while correcting the orders of high courts and also correcting his stand taken as an HC judge nine years ago.","Justice Abhay S Oka said it was a continuous learning process for judges.

Prioritising retired servicemen, many of whom already receive pensions, over unemployed young people risks deepening the sense of alienation,” Mehbooba’s letter reads.Urging the administration to reconsider, or at least clarify the rationale behind the policy, Mehbooba called for more inclusive models to address security and socio-economic challenges in J&K.“This soaring unemployment is not just an economic issue but a social emergency. With few opportunities amidst utter despondency, many youngsters are falling into the grip of drug addiction and, tragically, some are even driven to suicide. We must come to their rescue by being more mindful of their future.”Governing National Conference spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said the issue was beyond the UT govt’s jurisdiction as it came under security-related expenditure (SRE).BJP spokesman Arun Gupta rejected Mehbooba Mufti’s opposition. He said the Indian Army has shaped these men into highly capable soldiers trained to meet any eventuality. “We are extremely fortunate as a nation to have such manpower at our disposal,” the BJP spokesman said.“We must recognize the unmatched training and discipline these personnel possess. Their deployment in sensitive civil installations is not just logical, it’s essential. Security today is not about hardware alone; it’s about the right people with the right experience,” the spokesman said.He said the initiative wasn’t rolled out overnight. “It took three years of careful planning, clearances, and evaluation. The govt has acted with deliberation and responsibility, and the outcome reflects a strategic approach to both security and manpower utilisation,” he added.","The Union govt has rejected PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti’s objection to the J&K govt approving the mobilisation of 4,000 ex-servicemen to guard vital infrastructure across the Union territory.

He said that Nehru not only agreed to give water to Pakistan at the cost of India but also gave Rs 83 crore to the neighbouring country, whose value now amounts to Rs 5,500 crore.Chouhan was referring to the amount that India gave to Pakistan to help build replacement canals from the western rivers of the Indus system.""We had been giving waters to Pakistan at the cost of our farmers' interest, but the neighbouring country has been responsible for producing terrorists,"" said Chouhan, adding that even former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee had opposed the Indus Waters Treaty in Parliament.Referring to Nehru's remarks where he reportedly said that India bought peace by extending financial assistance to Pakistan, Chouhan said, ""What kind of peace was that? We lost water as well as money.""Explaining the rationale behind keeping the treaty in abeyance, Chouhan said, ""Waters of Indus river system will now be used for India and its farmers."" Representatives of several organisations, including Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Bharatiya Kisan Union (non-political), attended the meeting. They supported govt's move on the treaty and even demanded that it be abrogated.The farmers’ representatives also demanded the government to work for better utilization of water resources available in the Indus River System for the benefit of farmers in Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and western Uttar Pradesh.Under the treaty, waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - are allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - are allocated largely to Pakistan. Though India is permitted to use the water of the western rivers for domestic use, irrigation and generation of hydro-electric power, the country has not been fully utilising its legal share.The government has now prepared a detailed roadmap, carrying short, medium and long-term plans, to enhance the country’s water storage capacity, speed up completing under construction hydro-power projects on priority and use of existing Ranbir and Pratap canals to ensure more water for Jammu region.","Govt has started rallying public opinion against the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), the suspension of which by India following the Pahalgam terror attack has been termed by Pakistan ""an act of war"" Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday met farmers organisations and explained to them how the then PM Jawaharlal Nehru signed the treaty.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121279583,imgsize-41586,width-400,resizemode-4/Shivraj-Singh-Chouhan.jpg"

'Mamata forced Yusuf to withdraw from delegation'



NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Yusuf Pathan has opted out of the all-party delegation after Centre chose him as party's representative, PTI reported citing party sources. The TMC indicated that the selection was ""unilateral"" and it should have been ""decided by the respective party leadership.""Although the exact reason for Pathan's decision remains unclear, both West Bengal chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee asserted that the Centre should not have the authority to choose the party's representative for the delegation.Meanwhile, the move was criticised by the Bharatiya Janata Party leader Amit Malviya calling it unfortunate, saying that this ""should have been kept above partisan politics. Members of Parliament are representatives of the people as well.""Mamata Banerjee, however, categorically mentioned that the party did not intend to boycott the delegation.""It is wrong to say that we are boycotting or not going. They need to inform the party. The parliamentary party discusses the bills in the Parliament. It takes decisions regarding the Parliament, and that too, after consulting with the party. I am the chairperson of the parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha,"" she said.""However, we are never informed. We will definitely send a representative if they inform us. Why wouldn't we? There is no point of controversy here. We are fully with the government,"" she added.""The Centre cannot unilaterally decide who will represent which party. This has to be decided by the respective party leadership. If you ask for one representative, we will give you five names. But the Centre also needs to show its good intent and call for a wider deliberation with all parties in the opposition,"" Abhishek Banerjee said.Malviya attacked the Bengal CM claiming that she ""forced"" the TMC MP to ""withdraw from the multi-party delegation"".""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s decision to force the TMC MP to withdraw from the multi-party delegation is unfortunate. This is a Government of India delegation and should have been kept above partisan politics. Members of Parliament are representatives of the people as well,"" he said in a post on X.""It sends a subliminal message that Mamata Banerjee and her party are unwilling to speak out against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. What is worse is that while a caucus of senior party apparatchiks prevailed—likely because they were not part of the delegation—other senior TMC MPs are now sending feelers to be included. After all, it is a matter of national pride to represent the country at such a moment,"" he added.Congress party has also questioned the Centre's selection criteria for the delegation calling it ""dishonest"" after it rejected all the four names suggested by the grand old party and chose Shashi Tharoor among others.The Centre on Sunday unveiled a list of seven delegations comprising political leaders, parliamentarians, and former ministers from various parties, tasked with presenting India’s firm stance against terrorism in the wake of Operation Sindoor."," Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Yusuf Pathan has opted out of the all-party delegation after Centre chose him as party's representative.

Two films created Hindi cinema's first superstar: Shakti Samanta's ' Aradhana ', shortly followed by Raj Khosla 's ' Do Raaste '.But the first few days of 'Do Raaste' were uncertain at the box-office. Mahesh Bhatt , a young ""production hand"" in the film, wept bitterly over the film's grim prognosis, says a forthcoming biography of Raj Khosla, whose 100th birth anniversary falls on May 31.Khosla had already delivered superhits in a variety of genres: thriller 'CID' (1956), suspenseful 'Woh Kaun Thi?' (1964) and romantic drama 'Do Badan' (1966) underlining his ability as an all-rounder. But his previous two ventures, 'Anita' (1967) and 'Chirag (1969)', hadn't fared well. Debtors were at the door.Do Raaste, which he produced and directed, was based on Marathi writer Chandrakant Kakodkar's novel, 'Nilambari'. When the film opened at Bombay's Royal Opera House on Dec 5, 1969, editor Waman Bhonsle and Bhatt were at the theatre.Biographer Amborish Roychoudhury writes in the book, ""A manager by the name of Desai, came to Bhatt and Bhonsle and said, ""Saamne woh Shakti ki picture chal rahi hai 'Aradhana', woh advance mein housefull hai. Yahan par log nahin aate. Picture doobegi."" (Shakti's film 'Aradhana', playing across the road, is running to full house in advance booking. No one is coming here. This film will flop.)""When he heard this, Bhatt broke down. Bhonsle had seen it all before, but the young Bhatt, all of 20, was emotionally attached to the film,"" says the book, co-authored by Anita Khosla and Uma Khosla Kapur, both director's daughters.The book titled, ""Raj Khosla: The Authorized Biography,"" also says that the film originally ended with some ""touching lines about mother-son relationship"" which wasn't working too well with the audience.Khosla reached out to heroine Sadhana, with whom he had worked in four films. ""Over the years, she had become a confidante and a sounding board. He showed her his films, and she told him what she felt,"" writes Roychoudhury.Sadhana suggested ending the film with a clip of the track, 'Bindiya Chamkegi', which was to become radio countdown show, Binaca Geetmala's No 1 song of 1971. Khosla carried out the change.'Do Raaste' ""ran for more than 50 weeks at the same Opera House where the staff had written the film off."" Debtors were paid. Khosla announced a bonus for some staff members. Bhatt's bonus was Rs 300, equivalent to a month's wage. ""He gave me 300 bucks extra to me for shedding tears!,"" the biography quotes Bhatt as saying. Khosla passed away in 1991. In the foreword, Bhatt describes him as ""My mentor. My master.""","Khosla had already delivered superhits in a variety of genres: thriller 'CID' (1956), suspenseful 'Woh Kaun Thi?'

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court dismissed on Monday the Sambhal Shahi Jama Masjid committee's petition challenging a Nov 19, 2024 trial court order directing an advocate commissioner to survey the structure, the subject of a suit claiming that the mosque was built in 1526 after demolishing a temple, reports Rajesh Kumar Pandey.While upholding the trial court's survey order, Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal vacated the interim stay on the Hindu plaintiffs ' suit. The mosque committee had asked for the suit to be dismissed on the ground that the Hindu side's claim to the site was prima facie barred under the Places of Worship Act, 1991. The legislation prohibits conversion of any place of worship and mandates maintaining the religious character of any such site that existed on Aug 15, 1947.This is not a case where any conversion of place of worship is taking place or the religious character is being changed. The plaintiffs have only sought right to access to a protected monument, declared in 1920 under Section 18 of Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, the 45-page judgment states. In its petition, the mosque committee contended that the civil judge (junior division) ordered the survey ""hastily"" and ""without issuing notice"". Based on the Nov 19 directive, a survey was conducted that very day and another one on Nov 24.Later that month, SC stayed proceedings in the trial court until the mosque committee's petition against the survey order was heard by an HC bench.Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said in its submission to the bench that the mosque had been designated as a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act , 1958. This effectively means that its status is governed by preservation laws rather than religious classification. ASI also mentioned that nowhere in official records was the mosque described as a religious place.The Hindu plaintiffs contend that the disputed Sambhal mosque stands at what used to be site of an ancient Harihar temple dedicated to Kalki, last avatar of Vishnu. The suit claims in 1526, on orders of Mughal emperor Babar, the temple was partially demolished and a mosque built over it.","Allahabad high court dismisses Sambhal Shahi Jama Masjid committee's petition challenging a Nov 19, 2024 trial court order directing an advocate commissioner to survey the structure.

Civil aviation & national security intertwined, SG Mehta tells HC

NEW DELHI: Better to be safe than sorry, the Delhi high court remarked Monday while hearing a plea by Turkish firm Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd against revocation of its security clearance by the central govt. Opposing the plea, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that the decision was taken in the interest of national security following certain intelligence inputs that it would be ""hazardous"" to permit the company to continue ground handling operations at nine airports in the country.The senior law officer shared the inputs with the court in a sealed cover, telling Justice Sachin Datta that disclosing them would be counterproductive and affect national interest and security.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Celebi, said the company has been operating in India for 17 years and had 14,000 employees.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued civil aviation and national security are interdependent. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi contended Centre acted ""because of public perception due to shareholding of the company by Turkish nationals"" but pointed out that it is ""an Indian company with Indian employees"", adding ""we are not a rogue company"". The security clearance, he said, was revoked without any opportunity for a hearing or reason.""The enemy can try 10 times and succeed once; the country has to succeed all the time... in cases of civil aviation and national security, there cannot be a doctrine of proportionality,"" Mehta countered. He said airport handling and cargo handling are ""extremely sensitive operations: where personnel know and have access to ""every nook and cranny of the airport"".Mehta said the case involved passenger and cargo handling contracts, noting intelligence inputs indicate that, given the prevailing security climate, allowing Celebi to continue operating poses significant risks. Rohatgi, however, insisted that govt must provide concrete evidence to substantiate its allegations, adding Celebi's airport ground handling operations in India are independent and professionally managed.Justice Datta wondered if such a decision is even amenable to being heard in appeal by the court and if serving a prior notice was mandatory under such conditions, before posting the matter for further hearing on May 21. The security clearance of the firms was revoked by BCAS days after Turkiye backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country.","Solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued civil aviation and national security are interdependent.

'Croc tears': Supreme Court slams MP mantri Vijay Shah in Col Sofiya Qureshi row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/croc-tears-supreme-court-slams-mp-mantri-vijay-shah-in-col-sofiya-qureshi-row/articleshow/121277929.cms,"You're a public figure, show restraint and be responsible: SC to MP minister

NEW DELHI: Trashing Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah 's ""facade of an apology for the crass comments"" aimed at Col Sofiya Qureshi , who briefed the media on Operation Sindoor , Supreme Court on Monday turned the heat on him by constituting an SIT of senior IPS officers, sought a probe status report by May 28, but stayed his arrest.The minister's ""if anyone is hurt"" conditional apology riled a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, which referred to the video of his speech and said, ""You were about to use some abusive language but could not as the words failed you. We know how to deal with people like you. You cannot say anything and when called out, attempt to wriggle out by tendering a facade of an apology which is akin to shedding crocodile tears.""The bench asked the Madhya Pradesh DGP to constitute the SIT by 10.30am Tuesday. It said members of the team should be senior IPS officers of MP cadre from outside the state, and one of them should be a woman. ""We would like to keep a close watch on the probe, though we will not be monitoring it. The SIT will submit a report to us by May 28,"" it said. The court said one IPS officer would be of IGP rank while the other two would be of SP rank.SC ordered that the FIR registered on the suo motu directions of MP high court be entrusted to the SIT. ""The petitioner (minister) is directed to join the investigation and fully cooperate with it. Subject to that, as of now, his arrest will be stayed. We are not inclined to monitor the investigation.""The SC bench did not let senior advocate Vivek Tankha intervene in the proceedings on behalf of a Congress functionary from Madhya Pradesh.""Let us not politicise it. There is no politics in it. Somebody has made crass comments. He is facing and he must face consequences. We are a nation governed by rule of law, which applies with the same rigour to the highest, and to the lowest,"" it said.When senior advocate Maninder Singh, who appeared for Vijay Shah, said the minister had tendered an apology and felt remorse for his comments, Justice Kant said, ""What kind of apology have you tendered? There is some meaning of apology.""""If this is your apology, it is rejected outright. It (Operation Sindoor) was such an emotive and uniting issue. Every citizen was standing in support of the armed forces, and you made such remarks. We are proud of our armed forces. They are in the frontline. Least we can do is to support them.""Singh said the minister was ready to apologise again without any condition. The bench was in a caustic mood and said, ""Tomorrow you want to give the impression that I apologised again because the court asked me to do so. You made the crass comments on May 12 and today is May 19. What prevented you from making a sincere apology till now?""""You are a representative of the people, yet you hurt the sentiments of millions of citizens. You are a public figure. You must display some restraint and be responsible. The standards of responsibility for elected representatives are much higher. You should lead by example.""While posting the matter for further hearing on May 28, the bench told the minister to think of ways to redeem himself from the ignominious statement that shamed the entire nation.","Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah's ""facade of an apology for the crass comments"" aimed at Col Sofiya Qureshi.

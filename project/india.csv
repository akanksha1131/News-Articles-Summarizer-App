"Trump and I both put nation first, that’s our connect: PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-and-i-both-put-nation-first-thats-our-connect-pm-modi/articleshow/119094169.cms,"I’m not neutral, I strive for peace: PM on Ukraine





NEW DELHI: Expressing admiration for Donald Trump’s courage and resilience, PM Narendra Modi said his connect with the US president was that they both put nation first and had dedicated themselves to the service of the nation.“Even after being shot (July 2024), he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. Trump’s will to live and fight for the US even after being shot appeals to me because this showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India First and that’s why I connect so well (with Trump),” the PM said.Modi’s emphatic endorsement of Trump in a podcast with Lex Fridman, popular podcaster and research scientist at MIT, comes at a time US allies, particularly Europe and Canada, are taking a heavy battering from the president who has been accused by some of dragging America into isolationism with his policies.India itself has been under threat from Trump’s tariff war but is hoping for an exemption from the Apr 2 deadline for reciprocal tariffs, based on a trade deal it’s negotiating.Trump was far more prepared in his second term, with a clear roadmap and steps to achieve his goals, the PM said, adding that he had put together a “strong, capable” team to assist him.In the podcast, Modi backed the recent thaw in ties with China said said normalcy had returned to the border since his meeting with President Xi Jinping last year, and that trust, enthusiasm and energy would return in bilateral ties “slowly but surely”. He said efforts were on to restore conditions to how they were before 2020.On Pakistan, while describing it as the epicentre of terrorism, Modi said all Indian attempts for a reconciliation had met with hostility and expressed hope Pakistan will choose the right path as its people deserved a future free of violence.On the Russia-Ukraine war, Modi strongly reiterated India’s position that both countries need to return to the negotiating table.“I can tell President Putin this is not the era of war. I can also tell President Zelensky that regardless of how many people stand with you, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield. Ukraine may hold countless discussions with its allies, but it will bear no fruit. Discussions must include both sides,” he said, adding the current situation provided an opportunity for meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine. “I am not neutral. I strive for peace,” he said, underlining India’s position and expressing concern about how the war has hurt the Global South.Asked about his relations with Trump, Modi appreciat ed the “trust” that the president has in him. “Even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. Trump’s will to live and fight for the US even after being shot appeals to me because this showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India First and that’s why I connect so well (with Trump),” the PM said.Asked what he liked about Trump, Modi recalled that the US president, during his first term, had ignored security protocol and agreed to his request to take a lap around the stadium hosting the ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston. “I was touched by his courage and his trust in me,” he said.On Trump describing him as a tough negotiator, Modi said he always puts India’s interests first. “That’s why in every forum, I speak up for India’s interest, not to harm anyone but in a positive manner and because of that, no one takes offence,” he said.On China, Modi said differences between the two countries were natural but “our focus is on ensuring these don’t turn into disputes”. “Instead of discord, we emphasise dialogue for building cooperative relationship. After my meeting with President Xi, we are seeing a return of normalcy to the border. We are now working to restore conditions to how they were before 2020. Slowly but surely, trust, enthusiasm and energy will return,” he said.“Of course, it will take some time because of the five-year gap. Our cooperation is essential also for global stability and prosperity. Since the 21st century will be Asia’s century, we want India and China to compete in a healthy way. Competition is not a bad thing but it should never turn into a conflict,” he added.","“Even after being shot (July 2024), he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation.

EC looks to sort out legal issues for swift EPIC-Aadhaar linkage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-looks-to-sort-out-legal-issues-for-swift-epic-aadhaar-linkage/articleshow/119091531.cms,"New Delhi: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar’s initiative to call a meeting with the home secretary, legislative department secretary and UIDAI CEO on Tuesday to discuss EPIC-aadhaar linkage, comes against the backdrop of the notified date for an existing elector to voluntarily intimate his aadhaar number to EC, having expired almost a year ago.There has been no extension after March 31, 2024, the outer time-limit last notified by the law ministry for existing electors to willingly share their aadhaar details to EC, in line with the Section 23 of Representation of the People Act, 1950, as amended via the Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2022.In February 2024, the Supreme Court – while hearing a plea challenging the statutory form for voter enrolment on the ground that it left no scope for an applicant issued an aadhaar number but unwilling to furnish it, to submit an alternate identification – had dismissed the plea after being assured by EC that furnishing aadhaar was not mandatory and that it would write to the law ministry to amend the R P Act 1950 to clear any confusion in this regard.This was after EC counsel had informed the apex court that over 66.2 crore electors (as against the 99 crore currently enrolled) had voluntarily submitted their aadhaar details. Interestingly, as per law ministry’s replies to questions in Parliament, the poll panel is yet to link the aadhaar details intimated to it, with the EPIC database. This linkage is crucial to establishing voters’ identity via aadhaar – seen as the most error-free method to eliminate bogus and duplicate electors since it involves biometric authentication.The advantages of biometric authentication were encapsulated by former CEC Rajiv Kumar in his farewell speech. “Innovations like biometric authentication may further help prevent impersonation and multiple voting, ensuring that every vote belongs to the rightful voter,” he had said. An EC functionary explained to TOI that Article 326 of the Constitution casts a duty upon EC to ensure voting rights for all citizens above 18 years, and that Aadhaar Act is the only statutory framework to identify such eligible electors.The options to resume aadhaar seeding for the remaining 34 crore voters – likely to be discussed at the March 18 meeting -- may include making it mandatory for electors to intimate aadhaar – a proposal that may not sit well with opposition parties who could reiterate concerns like privacy and aadhaar loopholes. This will involve amendments to Section 23(5) of R P Act 1950 to replace the word ‘may’ with ‘shall’. Alternatively, only tweaks to R P Act to clear the current confusion over ‘voluntary’ nature of aadhaar intimation, may be considered. An attempt in this direction was made in early 2024 by EC, which wrote to the law ministry suggesting changes to Section 23(6) and Section 28(2)hhhb of the Act to remove the part requiring ‘sufficient cause’ for not furnishing an identity field other than aadhaar. There has however been no movement on the proposal.Now, with a new CEC in the saddle, the EC is once again pitching to revive the long-pending efforts at EPIC-aadhaar linkage – which took seed in 2015 but have since been overshadowed by court challenges and opposition from political parties, largely the regional ones.","The outer time-limit for an existing elector to voluntarily intimate his aadhaar number to EC, expired almost a year ago.

Watch: 31 killed in Yemen after Trump orders airstrike on Houthi rebels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-launches-airstrikes-in-yemen-as-trump-vows-to-stop-houthi-attacks-rebels-react/articleshow/119057577.cms,"US strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen

Who are the Houthis?

Who backs Houthi rebels?

Major attacks by Houthis

At least 31 people were killed after US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Houthi-held areas in Yemen, reported news agency Reuters.Houthis, the militant group in Yemen, has claimed that the US strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital Sanaa on Saturday.The aerial strikes against the Yemeni rebel group came after Trump vowed to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" in the back of the Houthis' operations in the Red Sea.The airstrikes also mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump’s administration began in January amid the rebels' attacks on Israel and Red Sea vessels amid the Gaza conflict.Before the strike Trump posted on Truth Social his intention to ""use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective"", citing the Houthis' threats to Red Sea shipping.The Houthis released a statement in response declaring that the strikes ""will not pass without response"".""This aggression will not pass without a response, and our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation,"" the rebels' political bureau said in a statement on their Al-Masirah television.Trump had also demanded Iran cease support for the rebels immediately. The rebels, controlling substantial parts of Yemen for over ten years, belong to the pro-Iran ""axis of resistance"" groups opposing Israel and the United States.They have conducted numerous drone and missile strikes against vessels near Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza conflict, expressing solidarity with Palestinians.These actions disrupted the crucial shipping route, which typically handles 12 percent of global maritime traffic, compelling numerous companies to reroute around southern Africa.The US has conducted multiple strikes on Houthi positions, sometimes with British support. The Houthis suspended attacks during Gaza's January ceasefire but announced on Tuesday they would resume until Israel allows aid into Palestinian territory.Trump's communication avoided mentioning the Israel dispute, concentrating on previous Houthi attacks on commercial vessels. ""To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"" he said.""Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"" he added.The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, are a Zaidi Shia rebel group from northern Yemen, primarily based in Saada province. They emerged in the 1990s as a religious-political movement opposing Saudi-backed Sunni influence and Western interference in Yemen.The group was founded by Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who was killed in 2004 by Yemeni government forces, triggering an ongoing conflict. Though Zaidi Shia Islam is distinct from the Twelver Shia Islam of Iran, the Houthis have received military and financial support from Iran, leading to accusations that they serve as an Iranian proxy.The group gained global attention in 2014 when they took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile and sparking a war with the Saudi-led coalition in 2015. Since then, they have engaged in missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and recently, international shipping vessels in the Red Sea.Their attacks, particularly on Israel-linked ships, have drawn US and UK airstrikes in retaliation. The Houthis claim these actions are in support of Palestine, but their increasing aggression in the region has led to fears of wider conflict.Currently, they control much of northern Yemen, running a parallel government while continuing their fight against Yemeni government forces, Saudi Arabia, and UAE-backed militias.The Houthis primarily receive support from Iran, which provides them with weapons, military training, and financial assistance. Iran sees the Houthis as a useful ally in its broader strategy to counter Saudi Arabia and expand its influence in the region. The Lebanese Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed group, has also reportedly provided military training and strategic guidance to the Houthis.In addition to Iran and Hezbollah, the Houthis have received support from various local tribes in Yemen, particularly those opposed to Saudi influence. Some reports suggest that North Korea has also secretly supplied them with weapons, though this is less confirmed.The Houthis claim to be fighting against Western imperialism, and in recent conflicts, they have aligned themselves with the Iran-led ""Axis of Resistance"", which includes groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and various militias in Iraq and Syria.The Houthis have carried out several major attacks, disrupting global security and trade. In September 2019, they launched drone and missile strikes on Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, temporarily halving Saudi oil production. In January 2022, they attacked Abu Dhabi with drones and missiles, killing three people and targeting an oil facility and the international airport.Throughout 2021-2022, they launched ballistic missiles at Saudi cities, including a strike on a Jeddah oil depot during a Formula 1 race. Since late 2023, they have attacked Red Sea shipping, claiming to target Israel-linked vessels, leading to US and UK airstrikes on Houthi positions.In November 2023, they hijacked the Galaxy Leader, an Israeli-linked ship, escalating tensions further. Their increasing use of advanced drones and missiles has turned them into a key regional threat.","Houthis, the militant group in Yemen, has claimed that the US strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital Sanaa on Saturday.

A 32-year-old constable has been booked for allegedly raping a female sub-inspector multiple times by blackmailing her with a video of the first assault.

The 33-year-old victim filed a complaint at Patel Nagar police station in Dehradun, bringing the incident to light.

The assault occurred at a local hotel where the constable booked a room for the victim and entered under the pretext of checking it before locking the door.

The accused filmed the act and used the footage to blackmail the victim into repeated assaults, leading her to remain silent out of fear.

Police are gathering evidence, including CCTV footage, to verify the claims, and legal action will be taken based on the findings.

DEHRADUN : A case has been registered against a 32-year-old constable for allegedly raping a female sub-inspector multiple times by blackmailing her with a video he recorded during the first assault at a local hotel, officials said on Saturday.The incident came to light after the 33-year-old female officer filed a complaint at Patel Nagar police station in Dehradun two days ago. Following this, Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh directed SP (rural) Renu Lohani to oversee the investigation and ensure appropriate action.A police officer involved in the probe said that the sub-inspector stated in her complaint that she was transferred to a Dehradun police unit eight months ago due to family reasons.""Her home is far from her workplace, and on one of her initial days on duty, she arrived late and was reprimanded by her seniors. To avoid a recurrence, she decided to stay at a nearby hotel for a night due to important work the following day and asked the accused constable to book a room for her. After booking the room, he dropped her off and entered under the pretext of checking it. Once inside, he locked the door and raped her,"" she said.The officer said, ""The accused filmed the act and later used the video to blackmail and repeatedly assault her. Afraid of the consequences, she remained silent until she finally reported the crime on Thursday.""SP Lohani, who is supervising the investigation, said, ""The accused has not been arrested yet as police are collecting evidence, including possible CCTV footage, to verify the complainant's claims. Strict legal action will be taken based on the findings.""",The 33-year-old victim filed a complaint at Patel Nagar police station in Dehradun.

'Fake Narrative': PM Modi Opens Up About 2002 Godhra Riots On Lex Fridman Podcast

PM Modi on governance: ‘From appeasement to aspiration’

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the discourse surrounding the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat was an attempt to push a false narrative, adding that despite efforts by his political opponents to hold him responsible, the courts found him innocent.Speaking in a podcast with Lex Fridman, which was released on Sunday, PM Modi refuted claims that the 2002 riots were the ""biggest riots ever"", calling it “misinformation.”""On February 24, 2002, I became a state representative, an elected representative for the first time. And it was only around February 24th, 25th, or 26th that I stepped into the Gujarat Assembly for the very first time. On February 27th, 2002, we were seated in the Assembly for the budget session. And that same day, it had been just three days since I’d become a state representative, when suddenly the horrific Godhra incident occurred,"" PM Modi said.""It was a tragedy of unimaginable magnitude, people were burned alive. You can imagine, against the backdrop of incidents like the Kandahar hijacking, the attack on Parliament, or even 9/11, and then to have so many people killed and burned alive, you can imagine how tense and volatile the situation was. Of course, this was tragic for everyone. Everyone prefers peace,"" he said.PM Modi cited the 1969 riots, which lasted over six months, as an example of Gujarat’s history of communal violence, emphasising that these incidents occurred long before he entered politics.""The perception that these were the biggest riots ever is actually misinformation. If you review the data from before 2002, you will see that Gujarat faced frequent riots. Curfews were constantly being imposed somewhere. Communal violence could erupt over trivial issues, like kite flying contests or even minor bicycle collisions. Before 2002, Gujarat witnessed over 250 significant riots. The riots in 1969 lasted nearly six months. So there was a long history, long before I was in the picture,"" he said.""But that one tragic incident in 2002 became a sparking point, leading some people towards violence. Yet, the judiciary thoroughly investigated the matter.The prime minister asserted that allegations against him were politically motivated, claiming that his opponents, who were in power at the Centre at the time, wanted to see him punished.“At that time, our political opponents were in power, and naturally they wanted all allegations against us to stick. Despite their relentless efforts, the judiciary analyzed the situation meticulously twice and ultimately found us completely innocent. Those who were truly responsible have faced justice from the courts,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi noted that the state, which once saw regular communal violence, has remained peaceful since 2002. “In the past 22 years, Gujarat has not witnessed a single major riot. The state remains completely peaceful,” he said.Fridman followed up by asking Modi how he perceives criticism, particularly when it comes to sensitive topics like the Gujarat riots ""Criticism is the soul of democracy,"" Modi responded. ""Our scriptures say: ‘Always keep your critics close,’ because they help you improve.""However, he was quick to differentiate between constructive criticism and what he called ""sensationalism"" in modern political discourse.“Genuine criticism is based on research and analysis. Unfortunately, today’s media and political opponents often take shortcuts, making unfounded accusations instead of engaging in thoughtful critique,” he said. “The references you’re giving, they are allegations, not criticism.”PM Modi suggested that much of the opposition he faced over the years stemmed from ideological biases rather than factual concerns.“Those who criticised me for the riots did not care about Gujarat’s history of violence before 2002. They were not interested in the transformation that happened after,” he said. “They only wanted to create a narrative that suited their agenda.”Moving beyond the riots, PM Modi outlined what he sees as his administration’s biggest achievement—shifting India’s political culture from ""appeasement politics"" to ""aspirational politics.""""For decades, politics was about appeasement—keeping certain groups happy for votes. We changed that. We focused on aspirational politics, where governance is about delivering results for everyone, not just selected communities,” he said.Modi reiterated his government's guiding principle: ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas"" (Together with everyone, development for all, trust from all, and efforts by everyone).“We have ensured that governance reaches the last person in the queue, regardless of caste, creed, or religion,” he added. “Whether it’s housing, electricity, sanitation, or digital payments, every Indian benefits. That is true development.”","Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the discourse surrounding the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat was an attempt to push a false narrative. Despite efforts by his political opponents to hold him responsible, the courts found him innocent. Modi cited the 1969 riots, which lasted over six months, as an example of Gujarat’s history of communal violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119076600,imgsize-1129483,width-400,resizemode-4/119076600.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in an interview with US-based podcaster and AI researcher Lex Fridman on Sunday, spoke about global conflicts and the role of international organizations . He said that organizations that were once powerful have now become almost irrelevant.PM Modi said, ""Today, I see so many kinds of conflicts happening. Physical battles often get discussed. Struggles are happening in every domain. International organizations that were once powerful have become almost irrelevant.""He added, ""No real reforms are happening. Institutions like the UN are failing to fulfil their roles. People who disregard international laws and rules, continue to act freely, and no one can stop them.""The conversation, which lasted nearly three hours, covered topics related to leadership, diplomacy, and global challenges.

""We must also understand that the world has become one small village today. No country can thrive in isolation. Today, we all depend upon one another. No one can make it far by themselves. That is why you must learn to synchronize with everyone and everyone else must learn to synchronize with you. That’s the only way to propel this initiative forward. Organizations like the United Nations came into being after the First World War, but they failed to evolve with the times, and this inability to adapt has sparked a global debate on their relevance,"" he said.PM Modi also spoke about rising geopolitical tensions , mentioning conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, and US-China relations. ""Look, Covid exposed the limitations of every nation. No matter how much we consider ourselves as a great nation, no matter how progressive we think we are, or how scientifically advanced we believe we’ve become, everyone has their own way of looking at things. In the end, we all found ourselves on the same ground. Every country in the world faced this reality. At that time, it felt like the world would learn from it, that we would move toward a more unified world. Just as a geopolitical order emerged after World War II, many thought something similar would happen post-Covid. But unfortunately, instead of moving towards peace, the world became even more fragmented, ushering in a period of uncertainty, and the wars have only made it worse,"" he said.","PM Narendra Modi spoke about global conflicts and the role of international organizations.

NEW DELHI: Speaking with Lex Fridman, PM Modi recalled key moments from his relationship with US President Donald Trump, highlighting their bond of mutual respect and trust. He shared a special memory from the 2019 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston, where the two leaders walked around a packed stadium together, an unexpected move that stunned security personnel.""In American life, it’s almost impossible for the President to walk into a crowd of thousands, but without even a moment’s hesitation, he agreed and started walking with me,"" PM Modi said. He called the moment a demonstration of Trump's courage and faith in him, showing their strong personal rapport.Reflecting on Trump’s resilience, PM Modi said that after being shot during a campaign rally, Trump remained steadfast in his commitment to his country. ""His life was for his nation. His reflection showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in India First,"" PM Modi said, adding that this shared vision is why they connect so well.PM Modi also recalled his first visit to the White House during Trump’s presidency. While media reports had shaped global perceptions of Trump, he found him to be deeply respectful of American history. ""He personally took me on a tour of the White House, without notes or an aide. He showed me where Abraham Lincoln lived and where key moments in history took place. It showed his deep connection with America’s legacy.""Even after Trump's first term ended, PM Modi said the US President continued to express warmth. ""Whenever someone we both knew met him, he would say, ‘Modi is my friend, convey my regards.’ That kind of gesture is rare.""When asked about Trump calling him a ""much tougher and better negotiator,"" PM Modi downplayed the remark, saying, ""That’s his graciousness. I always put my country first, and people know that if I am in a negotiation, I will advocate for India's interests.""PM Modi also observed that Trump seems more prepared for a second term, with a clear roadmap and a strong team. “I have observed President Trump both during his first term and now in his second run. This time, he seems far more prepared than before. He has a clear roadmap in his mind with well-defined steps, each one designed to lead him toward his goals,"" he said.During his US visit, PM Modi met several prominent figures, including Elon Musk, Tulsi Gabbard, and Vivek Ramaswamy, describing the atmosphere as warm and family-like. Speaking about Musk, he mentioned knowing him since his time as Gujarat’s chief minister. ""With his DOGE mission, he is incredibly excited about its progress,"" he said.PM Modi also drew a parallel between Trump’s bold leadership and his own governance reforms, including eliminating fake welfare recipients and improving transparency through direct benefit transfers. ""When bold changes happen, just like DOGE’s mission, they become a topic of discussion worldwide,"" he said.","PM Modi recalled key moments from his relationship with US President Donald Trump.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi shared an interesting moment during his conversation with Lex Fridman from his visit to the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency, revealing how his practice of fasting became a topic of discussionAs part of the formal itinerary, a high-level bilateral meeting was followed by a state dinner.However, there was a moment of concern among US officials when they realised that PM Modi was fasting. “How do you host the leader of such a major nation at the White House without serving food?” they wondered.When dinner was served, PM Modi simply placed a glass of hot water in front of him. To lighten the mood, he turned to Obama and quipped, “Look, my dinner has arrived.”The incident left a lasting impression on the former US President. When PM Modi visited the White House again later, this time for a lunch meeting, Obama greeted him with a smile and a playful remark: “Last time you were fasting, this time we’re having lunch. Since you’re not fasting, you’ll have to eat twice as much.”During his conversation with Lex Fridman, PM Modi also explained that fasting had been an integral part of his life for over 50 years. He revealed that he never intended to make it public, but after he became chief minister and later Prime Minister, people started noticing his routine.“Most of the time, I don’t even let people know about it. It’s my personal matter,” he said, adding that he only spoke about it if asked, hoping his experience could help others.He described fasting not just as a religious or cultural practice but as a deeply scientific and spiritual discipline. “Fasting is not just about skipping meals. If someone goes hungry due to hardship, that’s not fasting. True fasting is a process of inner discipline and balance,” he explained.He shared how fasting sharpens the senses and enhances awareness. “You may notice the aroma of water, something you never realised before. A flower you have seen a thousand times appears more vivid. The mind gains clarity, and thoughts flow effortlessly”, he said.PM Modi also spoke about his rigorous fasting schedule, particularly during Chaturmas, when he eats only once a day for over four months, and Navratri, when he fasts for nine days, consuming only hot water or a single fruit.Despite this, he continues his responsibilities without any disruption. “Fasting never slows me down. Sometimes I even work more,” he said, adding that his discipline had only strengthened his ability to lead effectively.",PM Narendra Modi shared an interesting moment from his visit to the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency.

AAP’s three-year report card

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday dismissed opposition claims that Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann would be replaced, asserting that Mann would not only complete his five-year term but also seek another.Kejriwal, who recently completed a 10-day Vipassana meditation session, visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar along with Mann and other AAP leaders to mark three years of the party’s government in Punjab.Addressing reporters, Kejriwal identified drugs and corruption as the most pressing issues in Punjab.""Three crore people of Punjab have come together to wage war against drugs and corruption... this is a battle for justice,"" he said, vowing to continue efforts to cleanse the state.Mann echoed the sentiment, saying his government was committed to restoring Punjab to its former glory—“Rangla Punjab” (Prosperous Punjab).Reacting to speculation about Mann’s removal, Kejriwal firmly denied the claims.""Mann saab will complete five years, you do not need to worry... he will complete the next five years as well,"" Kejriwal declared.His remarks come amid Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa’s recent claim that 32 AAP MLAs were in touch with him and that Mann himself was in discussions with the BJP.

NEW DELHI: In a podcast with Lex Fridman , Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in detail about India’s troubled relationship with Pakistan while calling out the neighbouring country for state-sponsored terrorism and failed peace efforts .The discussion, which was part of a three-hour-long podcast episode released on Sunday, explored India's historical ties with Pakistan, past attempts at fostering diplomacy and PM Modi’s vision for the future of bilateral relations .Fridman asked the Prime Minister about the tense conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations and whether he saw a path to friendship and peace.PM Modi responded by recalling India’s partition in 1947, describing it as a painful and bloody chapter in history. He explained that despite India's acceptance of partition, Pakistan did not choose peaceful coexistence.""After getting their own way, we expected them to live and let live, and yet, they chose not to foster a harmonious coexistence. Time and again, they decided to be at odds with India. They have waged a proxy war against us,"" PM Modi said in the podcast.He accused Pakistan of exporting terror, saying that India is not its only victim — terrorist activities linked to Pakistan have impacted the entire world.""Wherever terror strikes in the world, the trail somehow leads to Pakistan. Take the September 11 attacks, for example. The mastermind behind it, Osama bin Laden—where did he eventually emerge from? He had taken refuge in Pakistan. The world has recognized that in a way terrorism and the terrorist mindset are deeply rooted in Pakistan,"" he said.PM Modi further called Pakistan an "" epicentre of turmoil "", urging its leadership to ""abandon the path of terrorism"" and work towards peace. He also mentioned that the people of Pakistan themselves long for peace, as they have suffered from years of internal unrest and terrorist violence.When Fridman asked PM Modi about past attempts to improve India-Pakistan relations , PM Modi recalled his historic invitation to Pakistan’s then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for his swearing-in ceremony in 2014.""My first attempt at improving bilateral relations was when I invited my Pakistani counterpart to my swearing-in. It was a gesture of goodwill, a diplomatic gesture unlike any in decades,"" he said.He also elaborated on his surprise visit to Lahore in 2015, aimed at fostering better ties between the two countries. However, he lamented that every peace initiative was met with hostility and betrayal from Pakistan.""Yet, every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal.

He went on to highlight the benefits of fasting , emphasizing its role in sharpening the senses, enhancing mental clarity, and instilling discipline.The Prime Minister spoke about how fasting helps bring ""both the inner and outer self into balance,"" making the senses—especially smell, touch, and taste—more sensitive. He also shared how fasting accelerates the thinking process and fosters out-of-the-box perspectives.""Fasting is a form of self-discipline. It never slows me down; instead, I feel more energetic and work just as much, sometimes even more,"" Modi said.Modi recalled a past meeting with former US President Barack Obama at the White House, where officials were unsure how to host him during a formal dinner since he was fasting. He was eventually served a glass of hot water, leading to a humorous exchange with Obama.""When we sat down, they brought me a glass of hot water. I turned to President Obama and jokingly said, 'Look, my dinner has arrived!'"" Modi recounted. In their next meeting, Obama remembered the incident, joking that since Modi wasn’t fasting, he would have to eat ""twice as much.""","US podcaster Lex Fridman fasted for 45 hours before his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

NEW DELHI: Congress leaders have strongly criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on the 2002 Gujarat riots during his interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman, accusing him of deflecting responsibility.During the podcast, Fridman asked PM Modi about the riots, describing them as one of the most challenging periods in India’s modern history, leading to over 1,000 deaths. PM Modi, in response, placed the events in the context of a series of terrorist attacks in India and abroad, including the 1999 Kandahar hijacking, the 2001 Parliament attack, and the 9/11 attacks in the US.He argued that Gujarat had a long history of communal riots and claimed that after 2002, the state had remained peaceful for over two decades.Targeting PM Modi, Congress leader Danish Ali said that Prime Minister’s comments were an attempt to justify the riots, which he claimed reflected the failure of the then-Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led central government in handling law and order.“The way the PM has tried to justify the Godhra riots shows the failure of the Vajpayee government regarding law and order in the country. The way he talked about the Kandahar hijacking, the Parliament attack, and more, this is, in a way, a condemnation of the Vajpayee government,” Ali said.Former Uttarakhand chief minister and senior Congress leader Harish Rawat also criticised Modi, referring to Vajpayee’s well-known remark urging Modi to follow ""rajdharma"" (duty of governance).""When the Godhra incident happened and riots broke out, the scenes were gory. Finally, the PM had to ask to uphold 'rajdharma.' If anything is wrong, the leader has to take responsibility—it will always be with a leader. These words of Atalji will keep on echoing in his ears,"" Rawat said.In the podcast, PM Modi also pointed out that India’s Supreme Court had twice upheld that he had no involvement in the riots. He dismissed allegations against him as politically motivated, saying that his government had prioritised peace and development over “appeasement politics.”","Congress leaders strongly criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on the 2002 Gujarat riots during his interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman.

Narendra Modi: Prime Minister of India - Power, Democracy, War & Peace | Lex Fridman Podcast #460

PM Modi on Swami Vivekananda

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s podcast with MIT scientist and AI researcher Lex Fridman was released on Sunday.During the conversation, PM Modi spoke on various topics, including the impact of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Hindu nationalism. When asked how he joined RSS, PM Modi said, ""In our village, there was a branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, where we played sports and sang patriotic songs. Something about those songs touched me deeply. They stirred something inside me, and that’s how I eventually became part of the RSS.""Speaking further the influence of RSS, PM Modi said, ""One of the core values that were instilled in us at RSS was, whatever you do, do it with a purpose. Even while studying, study with the goal of learning enough to contribute to the nation. Even when you exercise, do it with the purpose of strengthening your body to serve the nation. This is what we were taught. And today, RSS is a massive organization. It is now nearing its 100th anniversary. Such a massive volunteer organization likely doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. Millions of people are connected to it, but understanding RSS is not that simple. One must make an effort to truly grasp the nature of its work. More than anything, the RSS provides you with a clear direction toward what can truly be called a purpose in life. Secondly, the nation is everything, and serving the people is akin to serving God.""Also read - PM Modi's podcast with Lex Fridman released: Talks about early life, journey in Himalayas, RSS, and Hindu nationalism PM Modi also said, ""Alongside education, values are prioritized, and students remain grounded, learning skills so they don’t become a burden on society. That is in every aspect of life, whether it’s women, youth, or even laborers, the RSS has played a role.""Talking further about the Sangh, PM said that he feels blessed to have gained life's purpose from such ""sacred"" organisation. ""The volunteers who come from the RSS follow their own interests, nature and inclination, and in doing so, they strengthen and promote these kinds of activities. When you observe these initiatives, you’ll see how over the past 100 years, the RSS has dedicated itself with the discipline and devotion of a seeker staying away from the glare of mainstream attention. I feel blessed to gain life’s values from such a sacred organization. Through the RSS, I found a life of purpose. Then I was fortunate to spend some time among the saints, which gave me a strong spiritual foundation. I found discipline and a life of purpose. And through the guidance of saints, I gained spiritual grounding,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi also spoke about Swami Vivekananda and his teachings. ""Wherever I go, I carry with me the essence of thousands of years of Vedic tradition, the timeless teachings of Swami Vivekananda, and the blessings, dreams, and aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians,"" he said.He also reflected on how Vivekananda inspired him. ""When I used to read about Swami Vivekananda or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, I would often wonder, ‘How did they live? How did they build such remarkable lives?’ And for that, I constantly experimented on myself. Most of my experiments were physical in nature, testing my body’s limits.""He added that his interest in Vivekananda deepened as he read more. ""One time I read about Swami Vivekananda, his mother was ill. So, he went to Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa for guidance. He would argue with him, debate with him. In his early days, he would often argue with him, questioning everything intellectually.""PM Modi added, ""The teachings of Ramakrishna Mission, Swami Vivekananda, and the service-driven philosophy of the RSS have played a crucial role in shaping me.""Lex Fridman is a research scientist and hosts the ""Lex Fridman Podcast."" His podcast features discussions with various personalities on topics ranging from complex subjects to broader social issues.Notable guests on his podcast have included political leaders such as US President Donald Trump, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Argentina's Prime Minister Javier Milei, as well as business and academic figures like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Magnus Carlsen, and Yuval Noah Harari.Fridman posted on X, ""I had an epic 3-hour podcast conversation with @narendramodi, Prime Minister of India. It was one of the most powerful conversations of my life. It'll be out tomorrow.""PM Modi responded, calling it a ""fascinating conversation"" and mentioning that he spoke about different phases of his life, including his childhood, time in the Himalayas, and journey into public life.""It was indeed a fascinating conversation with @lexfridman, covering diverse topics including reminiscing about my childhood, the years in the Himalayas and the journey in public life. Do tune in and be a part of this dialogue!""

THIRUVANANTHPURA: Moration and circulated among key government departments proposes sweeping changes to the state's land laws, paddy land and wetland protection regulations , and the powers of local self-government institutions (LSGIs).The proposals could dismantle some of the very laws that successive Left govts introduced - such as Kerala Land Reforms Act , Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land, and Wetland Act - along with the decentralized planning framework that gave local bodies control over industrial approvals. If implemented, the changes could lead to large-scale industrial land acquisition, widespread paddy land conversion , and reduced authority for local bodies.Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963, which abolished feudal ownership and imposed land ceilings to ensure equitable distribution, faces a potential major overhaul.The proposal suggests exempting all industries from land ceiling limits, which could open the floodgates for corporate land accumulation.It also recommends increasing the land ceiling for industrial projects from 15 acres to 100 acres, with the possibility of even larger exemptions granted by a high-level committee.While the government justifies these changes as necessary to attract large-scale investments, critics argue that they contradict the core principles of land reforms.Even more controversial is the proposed dilution of Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, 2008, which was enacted to protect the state's rapidly shrinking agricultural land and wetlands.","Proposals could dismantle some of the very laws that successive Left govts introduced.

Siddaramaiah himself is keen on releasing it but has faced stiff opposition from politically dominant castes, with his deputy and Vokkaliga strongman DK Shivakumar himself leading the resistance.Other cabinet heavyweights like industries minister MB Patil and forest minister Eshwar Khandre, both Lingayats, have also opposed the report. Their main argument is that the data aren't ""scientific"" and the numbers are based on ""old"" census (population) figures.Intense lobbying by functionaries of dominant communities had forced Congress' high command to intervene and put a lid on the report. Sources in the chief minister's office, govt, and Congress indicate the administration might either permanently withhold the report or revise it with updated population figures once the pending central census data are available.""The problem is that some in the party are unwilling to accept the report,"" said a source.But some senior Congressmen like BK Hariprasad insist the report will be made public at some point. ""There is no possibility of backtracking since it is a promise in Congress's manifesto.

Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

PM on 2002: Kar sevaks' killing acted as spark in tense climate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-on-2002-kar-sevaks-killing-acted-as-spark-in-tense-climate/articleshow/119089591.cms,"Lex Friedman, Prime Minister Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi asserted that a fake narrative was spread to malign his image over the Gujarat riots in 2002, while emphasising that the burning of kar sevaks coming back from Ayodhya acted as a spark at a time when the situation was already tense because of a number of attacks carried out by Islamic terrorist groups in India as well as abroad.Talking to Lex Fridman, research scientist at MIT and a leading podcaster, Modi listed the terror attacks - hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Kandahar, attacks on Red Fort and the J&K assembly, the Al Qaida strike on New York and the attack on India's Parliament in the months leading up to the Feb 2002 riots which already had public opinion in India tense and on the edge.""In such situations, a spark is enough to cause disturbance and such a situation had already built up... and then the pilgrims were killed, burnt alive, you can imagine the situation that arose, given the background,"" Modi told the famous podcaster who fasted for hours to prepare for the more than three-hour-long conversation with the PM.""Nothing untoward should have happened, true. I also wish the same,"" Modi added. He also took issue with the ""narrative"" on the 2002 riots being an unprecedented phenomenon, recalling that Gujarat's communal situation had been traditionally inflammable and minor skirmishes would set off conflagrations.He also said that while a narrative was built to damage his image, the judiciary had cleared him.The conversation saw the PM touching upon his equations with RSS by launching into fulsome praise of the Sangh. He said it was his good fortune to be part of the Sangh tradition which places patriotism and public service above everything else. He detailed the activities of different Sangh outfits, focusing on Seva Bharati, Vidya Bharati, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, ""perhaps the world's largest trade union body which unlike the Leftist ones which believe in 'workers of the world unite' subscribes to the motto 'unite the world' philosophy"".Modi also praised Mahatma Gandhi had called him ""GOAT"". ""Mahatma Gandhi wasn't just a 20th-century leader. His relevance transcends centuries. His legacy will last for centuries to come, and he remains relevant to date.""This was the second time after his speech at a Marathi literary festival in Delhi in Feb that Modi has publicly lavished praise on RSS: something which was seen through the prism of speculation about their tense ties during the Lok Sabha campaign and because of crucial decisions, like appointment of a new BJP chief, expected shortly.Modi said RSS teaches that the country is supreme and serving people is like serving God, adding that the organisation gave him a ""purpose"" in life. ""I feel blessed to have got values from such a sacred organisation,"" he said.Asked about the Department of Government Efficiency US President Donald Trump has launched under Elon Musk, Modi said while the initiative has been talked about, he had also tried to improve efficiency in govt and make it more responsive since taking over in 2014. He mentioned the removal of ghost beneficiaries of development schemes, elimination of middlemen and launch of DBT and said it had resulted in saving of Rs 3 lakh crore.","PM Narendra Modi spoke to Lex Fridman, research scientist at MIT and a leading podcaster.

Officials said most of the snow on the slopes has melted, leaving only five-inch-deep patches in some spots-too shallow for skiing or snowboarding.Ajay Bhatt, general secretary of the state winter games federation, said, ""The event has been postponed due to unavoidable natural reasons. All arrangements were in place, but as fate would have it, there wasn't much snowfall this year, leading to this situation.""

Avalanche risks in the Western Himalayas have increased due to climate change and human activities with 30-40 deaths annually due to such disasters, a study published by Springer Nature has revealed. Rising temperatures, high population density, and rapid infrastructure development have made the region more vulnerable to avalanches, the study found.The worst-affected areas include Lahaul & Spiti in Himachal Pradesh and Chamoli in Uttarakhand. The study, titled 'A multi-aggregation approach to estimate avalanche vulnerability and suggest phase-wise adaptation', was conducted by Akshay Singhal, M Kavya, and Sanjeev K. Jha from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal. It assessed avalanche vulnerability in 11 districts of HP and Uttarakhand, identifying Lahaul & Spiti as the most at risk, followed by Chamoli. Last month, a massive avalanche in Chamoli's Mana area killed eight Border Roads Organisation (BRO) contractual workers and trapped 54.The researchers developed a Combined Avalanche Vulnerability Index to evaluate risk based on exposure (weather and snow conditions), sensitivity (topography and human activity), and adaptive capacity.","Rising temperatures, high population density, and rapid infrastructure development have made the region more vulnerable to avalanches.

NEW DELHI: India has stepped-up work on fencing the 1,643-km porous border with Myanmar, which will be completed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in phases over the next 10 years.The ongoing ambitious project will entail around Rs 20,000 crore being spent on the fence itself and another Rs 11,000 crore on construction of over 60 border roads.""As per the survey conducted by govt agencies, over 1,500-km of fencing - which includes 300-km of electric fencing - is required for effective management of the India-Myanmar border as well as ensuring security and stability of India's north-east region,"" Army sources told TOI.The fencing comes at a time when there are still no signs of normalcy returning to conflict-torn Manipur, where over 250 people have been killed in ethnic violence between the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities since May last year.While over 60,000 people have been internally displaced, less than half of the around 6,000 weapons looted in the state have been recovered forces so far by security.The volatile situation in Myanmar amid the fighting between the military and armed opposition outfits over the last one year, subsequent to the coup in Feb 2021, has also led to over 31,000 people fleeing and seeking refuge in India.""Myanmar's ongoing instability has further aggravated the situation, with a surge in smuggling, human trafficking and movement of armed infiltrators. Drugs worth Rs 1,125 crore, for instance, have been seized along the border in the last six-seven months,"" a source said.Some communities in Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, all of which border Myanmar, have however strongly opposed the proposed fence as well as scrapping of the ' Free Movement Regime ', which allowed people residing along the border to venture 16-km into each other's territory without visas, earlier this year.Apex Kuki bodies, for instance, say the twin steps ""threaten to infringe upon the cultural, traditional and historical rights of indigenous communities"".Some experts have also criticised the ""costly"" move, stressing it will cause hardships to people who share ethnic ties across the border as well as disrupt closer connectivity, trade and people-to-people ties.The defence and security establishment, however, contends the fencing does not intend to restrict the movement of civilians or sever cultural and familial connections on either side of the border.""A network of gates with biometric systems along the fence is being planned to allow cross-border movement, while ensuring security. The locations of these entry and exit points will be decided through collaborative consultations with local residents,"" another source said.The fencing's primary objective is to curb ""the movement of armed groups"", as well as stem the smuggling of weapons, drugs, human trafficking and illegal immigration, he added.The ""success"" of the 10-km fencing completed in Moreh (Manipur) underlines the project's potential to improve both security and trade management.""The fencing will also regulate and boost legitimate trade, ensuring economic benefits for the local communities while eliminating the adverse impact of illegal trade,"" he said.","India has stepped-up work on fencing the 1,643-km porous border with Myanmar.

Survivors' reluctance stalls 35 SIT cases based on Hema panel report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/survivors-reluctance-stalls-35-sit-cases-based-on-hema-panel-report/articleshow/116118767.cms,"Actor Mala Parvathy has urged SC to quash the SIT probe, arguing that it is harassing innocent individuals

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Law enforcement officials here are now finding themselves in a catch-22 situation as they grapple with 35-odd FIRs stemming from findings of the Hema Committee report on sexual abuse and gender inequality in the Malayalam film industry, with survivors expressing reluctance in pursuing legal action.According to sources, the FIRs were filed by a special investigation team set up to address allegations of molestation, attempted rape and rape. However, many of the incidents date back to early 2000s. The passage of time left little circumstantial evidence, limiting the investigation to the survivors' statements, which are now insufficient for further legal proceedings.Most survivors have also expressed disinterest in taking the matter forward. This lack of cooperation has left police unsure of how to advance the cases.While the survivors refrained from naming their alleged assailants, police believe they could identify culprits based on hints provided in the statements made before the committee. As a result, the FIRs have been kept under wraps. This secrecy is intended to protect the identities of the survivors (and also the high-profile culprits) while the investigation is going on.Amid this turmoil, actor Mala Parvathy, who testified before the committee, has sought the Supreme Court intervention to quash the SIT's probe, arguing that the investigation is harassing innocent individuals. The outcome of Parvathy's legal challenge could have significant implications for both the investigation and the broader discourse surrounding accountability in the industry.Meanwhile, G Poonguzhali, AIG (coastal security), is now the nodal officer and immediate contact person for survivors of cases being probed to seek cover from threats and intimidation related to Hema panel report.","Police grapple with 35-odd FIRs stemming from findings of the Hema Committee report on sexual abuse and gender inequality in the Malayalam film industry.

PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-why-you-should-apply-for-new-pan-card-with-qr-code-top-5-benefits-explained/articleshow/115888220.cms,"Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards those without QR codes should apply for PAN 2.0. (AI image)

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Also Read | PAN 2.0 for free! How to get PAN Card with QR code with address update online; step-by-step guide Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""","Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

Two schools in Delhi received bomb threats via e-mail |RK Puram | Paschim Vihar | Delhi Police

NEW DELHI: Over 40 private schools in Delhi received bomb threats via email on Monday morning. Among these, five schools that received these threats are Delhi Public School in Vasant Kunj and in R.K. Puram, G.D. Goenka School and Doon Public School in Paschim Vihar, and Brilliant's Convent School in Pitampura.An official said calls of bomb threats were received from DPS RK Puram at 7.06 am and GD Goenka Paschim Vihar at 6.15 am.A team from the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) immediately reached the spot. The police, bomb disposal squad, and dog squad, along with DFS personnel, are checking the entire premises of the school.As of now, nothing suspicious has been found, a police official said.The schools were targeted in a threatening email, which claimed that hidden bombs were planted within the premises. The email asserted that multiple bombs were strategically placed inside the building, posing a significant threat to the students and staff.The anonymous sender demanded a ransom of $30,000, warning that failure to comply would result in the detonation of the bombs. The school administration took immediate action, sending students back home who came to attend classes. Parents were asked to pick up their children as a precautionary measure.""I planted multiple bombs inside the building. The bombs are small and hidden very well. It will not cause very much damage to the building, but many people will be injured when the bombs detonate. You all deserve to suffer and lose limbs. If I do not receive $30,000 I will detonate the bombs,"" the email read.Also read: Bomb threats at multiple Delhi schools spark panic and security scramble Meanwhile, the school administrations have sent the students back home. Further checking was underway.Earlier on November 19, the Delhi high court directed the local government and police to create a thorough action plan, including a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for handling bomb threats and similar emergencies. The authorities were given eight weeks to complete these instructions.The Court specified that the SOP should clearly outline the duties of all involved parties--law enforcement, school management, and municipal authorities--to ensure seamless coordination and implementation.Justice Sanjeev Narula's bench, responding to an application by Advocate Arpit Bhargava, instructed the Delhi Government and Police to complete a comprehensive action plan, including an SOP for managing bomb threats and related emergencies.The action plan must be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including school representatives, law enforcement agencies, municipal authorities, and other state departments.Meanwhile, Delhi chief minister Atishi attacked the Central government and said that the BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security.""After the daily incidents of ransom, murders, firing in Delhi, now threats of bombing of schools are being received. The law and order situation in Delhi has never been so bad before. The BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security to the people of Delhi,"" Atishi posted on X.Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal slammed Union Home Minister Amit Shah and said that the people of Delhi have never seen such a bad state of law and order.""The people of Delhi have never seen such a bad state of law and order in Delhi before.

He had been on his way to carry out another alleged murder when his plan was thwarted by a tip-off from a business partner with whom he had conspired.The police had been monitoring Chavda’s activities and secured his remand until December 10, aiming to delve deeper into his occult practices and investigate possible links to human sacrifices.After hours of intense interrogation, he began to feel unwell and was rushed to the civil hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.His confession before his death however, sent shockwaves through the investigation.According to a report by news agency PTI, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Shivam Verma confirmed that Chavda had admitted to murdering 12 individuals using a toxic substance – sodium nitrite, a chemical commonly used in dry cleaningChavda's confession revealed a series of brutal killings spanning several years and locations. He disclosed that his victims, including a man in Ahmedabad, six people in Surendranagar (three of whom were from the same family), three in Rajkot, and one each in Wankaner and Anjar, had all succumbed to heart attacks induced by the poisoning. Chavda further admitted to the 2021 murder of a man whose death had initially appeared accidental, only for later investigation to reveal the true cause of poisoning.Among the victims were his own family members, including his grandmother, mother, and uncle, who Chavda claimed to have killed in previous years using the same method.According to police, Chavda had obtained sodium nitrite from a laboratory in his hometown of Surendranagar, using it in occult rituals to enhance his powers and solve his victims' problems—often under the guise of offering them wealth or good fortune.The sinister details of Chavda's operations were unearthed during his arrest, as the police discovered ritualistic items and white powder in his vehicle, all evidence of his dark practices. Authorities suspect that the chemical, when dissolved in water and consumed, caused the victims to suffer fatal heart attacks within 15 to 20 minutes of ingestion.Chavda's ashram in Wadhwan, Surendranagar, was a hub for his occult activities, where he would perform black magic and exploit vulnerable people.","Navalsinh Chavda, a self-proclaimed ""bhuvaji"" with mystical powers, was arrested in the early hours of December 3 by the Sarkhej police.

'Shared goal of diminishing India's growth': BJP alleges Sonia Gandhi's links to Soros-funded group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shared-goal-of-diminishing-indias-growth-bjp-alleges-sonia-gandhis-links-to-soros-funded-group/articleshow/116107482.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Sunday accused former Congress president Sonia Gandhi of having ties to an organization funded by the George Soros Foundation.The ruling party claimed in a series of posts on X that Sonia Gandhi, as the co-president of the Forum of the Democratic Leaders in Asia Pacific (FDL-AP) Foundation, is linked to an organisation financed by the George Soros Foundation.The BJP said that this group has previously supported the idea of Kashmir as an independent nation, raising concerns about foreign influence on India’s domestic affairs.""Notably, the FDL-AP Foundation has expressed views treating Kashmir as a separate entity,"" one of the posts said.The BJP also shared a photo of Salil Shetty, the vice president of the Soros-funded Open Society Foundation with Rahul Gandhi during the Bharat Jodo Yatra to back their statement.The party also referenced Congress MP Shashi Tharoor's acknowledgment of Soros as a ""old friend"".BJP MP Nishikant Dubey vowed to question Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha over what he described as ""collusion"" between opposition leaders, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), and Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros. ""The objective of this collusion is to ruin India’s economy and tarnish the Modi government’s image,"" Dubey alleged.Dubey cited the Congress's alleged reliance on OCCRP reports to target the Adani Group, claiming that Rahul Gandhi's press conferences criticising the industrialist were amplified by platforms linked to Soros.The allegations follow the BJP's earlier claims that the US ""deep state"" has colluded with OCCRP and opposition leaders to destabilize India. However, the US embassy categorically denied these accusations, describing them as ""disappointing"" and emphasising the US government’s commitment to media freedom.Soros was at the centre of noisy exchanges between BJP and Congress earlier in Parliament, with the former alleging that the 94-year-old was acting in collusion with the opposition in India to undermine the Modi government.Congress members in both Houses had protested against BJP's attack. ""Agents of Adani have been given only one task - to defame and abuse those who expose their mega corruption. We do not tolerate the objectionable words used against LOP Rahul Gandhi, Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi and the Congress party by Adani Agent Nishikant Dubey on the floor of the House,"" AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said.OCCRP, headquartered in Amsterdam, focuses on investigative stories related to corruption and crime. Recently, the platform has drawn attention for reports implicating the Adani Group in alleged financial misconduct, which the opposition Congress has used to press for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe. The Adani Group has dismissed the allegations as baseless, while the BJP has accused Congress of attempting to shield its links with foreign interests.","BJP claims Sonia Gandhi is linked to an organisation financed by the George Soros Foundation.

The BCI has also instructed its Secretary to approach the CBI to verify the authenticity of the degree and investigate possible fabrication of related records.The BCI revealed that a sub-committee was constituted earlier this year to investigate the matter following directions from the Delhi high court. The inquiry found several discrepancies in the records provided. Among them was the fact that PMB Gujarati Arts and Law College, Indore, was not authorized to conduct an LLB (Hons) course during the relevant period. Moreover, the LLB (Hons) program itself was introduced under Bar Council regulations only in 2008, raising doubts about the legitimacy of the degree purportedly issued two decades earlier.BCI said that the further scrutiny of the academic records revealed signs of tampering, with uniform handwriting and ink consistency over extended periods.The BCI, citing its authority under the Advocates Act, 1961, resolved to adopt the inquiry report and removed Nasiar from his post pending the outcome of the CBI investigation .This comes months after the Delhi high court in August dismissed a petition challenging the authenticity of Nasiar’s degree. Justice Rajiv Shakdher, while delivering the judgment, relied on a verification report from the concerned university that declared the degree genuine.

NEW DELHI: In one of the single-biggest restitution exercises undertaken by ED , involving the 32 lakh victims of the Agri Gold ponzi 'scam', the agency has begun the sale of attached properties , worth over Rs 6,000 crore, across multiple states.With the concurrence of the Supreme Court and the Andhra Pradesh HC, favouring distribution of attached 'proceeds of crime' to poor investors, ED last week moved a special PMLA court in Nampally, Hyderabad, against the Agri Gold group of companies and their promoters, seeking to dispose of the attached properties located in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Odisha.In the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, PM Narendra Modi had said he was exploring options of changing the law, if necessitated, to reimburse victims of frauds by using seized assets of perpetrators of scams.However, there is already a provision under section 8(8) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act , under which attached assets confiscated by ED can be restored to ""a claimant with a legitimate interest in the property, who may have suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of the offence of money laundering"". ED's panchnama for such transfer of attached property may be used as evidence during trial, according to the law.""The attached assets for which application has been filed by ED for their sale and restoration include 2,310 residential and commercial plots, apartments as well as an amusement park, Haailand, at Chinnakakani in Andhra Pradesh's Guntur district,"" a senior official said. Out of the 2,310 attached properties, 2,254 are in Andhra Pradesh, 43 in Telangana, 11 in Karnataka and two in Odisha.Earlier, the Andhra Pradesh HC had allowed restitution of properties attached by CID under provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments (APPDFE) Act.""Since the objectives of the APPDFE Act and the PMLA, insofar as restitution of properties to victims is concerned, are not contradictory to each other, and since the process of restitution in terms of section 6(4) of the APPDFE Act could also be done in terms of section 8(8) of PMLA, the matter went up to the Supreme Court, which while keeping the question of law open, ruled in favour of disbursal of the attached amounts to the depositors,"" the official said.The agents of Agri Gold scheme collected more than Rs 6,400 crore from 32 lakh customers. Andhra Pradesh CID, which had filed the predicate offence against the accused in 2018, had moved the HC earlier, seeking release of ED attachment so that it could distribute the money to the victims.Agri Gold group and its promoters Avva Venkata Rama Rao and his family members Avva Venkata Seshu Narayana and Avva Hema Sundara Vara Prasad were arrested by ED in Dec 2020. So far, the special court has taken cognisance of two chargesheets filed against them and 20 other accused.","The agency has begun the sale of attached properties worth over Rs 6,000 crore.

As per their preliminary probe the toy-like balloon did not carry any device or equipment typically associated with espionage. However, it is not being taken lightly given the history of narcotics smuggling across the border.

NEW DELHI: A group of former deputy CAGs have approached the Supreme Court through a PIL seeking interpretation of Article 148 of the Constitution by prescribing a collegium system for appointments of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) - a constitutional position that enjoys the same status as a judge of the apex court.In both cases, their appointments are by the President, have retirement age fixed at 65 and where removal from office entails impeachment by both Houses of Parliament.The veterans of Indian Accounts & Audit Service also challenged the vacuum in Article 148, which prescribes the appointment of CAG but lacks any specified procedure. The petitioner (Anupam Kulshreshtha vs Union of India case) quoted from Constituent Assembly debates, where Ambedkar asserted the importance of CAG as ""the most crucial officer in the Constitution"" and that its duties should be as independent as those of the judiciary, free from any executive or legislative influence. The collegium, as suggested by the PIL, should comprise the speaker of Lok Sabha, LoP in Lok Sabha, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (a position held by an opposition leader) and the CJI or his nominee.At present, a panel of names is suggested by the cabinet secretary to the PM who then recommends his selection to the President. The absence of a prescribed procedure by way of a selection committee, criteria and qualifications for appointments, etc is against the constitutional mandate, the petition said. The petition, signed by three deputy CAGs - Anupam Kulshreshtra, Arun Kumar Singh and Sangita Chandrakant Choure - was listed twice since Jan but is yet to come up for hearing as govt is yet to file its response to the notice served by the SC.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116030.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

RAIPUR: In a disturbing sign that Maoist reprisal is getting more savage, insurgents murdered a second woman in a span of two days in Chhatisgarh's Bijapur on Sunday, accusing her of acting as a police informant.Yalam Sukra , 40, was from Loded village in Madded, less than 50km from Timapur where a woman, 45, was murdered Saturday. Both were strangled in front of their families. On Dec 7, Sukra was kidnapped along with her husband Ramaiya Yalam.Maoists blamed Sukra of tipping off security forces in Chhattisgarh and Telangana.The couple was beaten mercilessly after which the woman was strangled and her body was dumped on the outskirts of Loded. Battered and bloodied, Ramaiya was left next to the body. He somehow staggered into the village, wailing for help.A Maoist leaflet found close to Sukra's body said, ""Sukra was in touch with police since 2017 and informed them about movement of cadres. Between 2017 and 2024, she was warned four times not to work as a police informer, but she ran to police and tipped them and Telangana Greyhounds about our movement recently, which ended up killing seven Naxals. Hence, she has been killed at a jan adalat.""Ramaiya is in hospital with grievous injuries.

AHMEDABAD: Delays, detentions and the constant threat of deportation have turned the American dream into a cruel nightmare for thousands of undocumented Indians in the US . They are facing the predicament mainly due to a system that leaves them waiting for years to get Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) clearance, lack of which can hamper their asylum process .Some face hearings as far off as 2027, while others, detained at the borders, are stuck in detention camps, say sources. Stranded in a legal no-man's land, they face the spectre of deportation if caught for staying illegally in the US.A staggering 41,000 Indians applied for asylum in the US in 2023, but many will have to wait for years for a hearing before ICE, the US federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws and investigating if the individual poses a threat to national security or public safety.According to legal document of an American agency, a man from Gujarat granted ""alien status"" in Atlanta was granted a hearing date in March 2027. He had applied for the hearing in Jan this year.A statement by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about the man reads, ""You are not a citizen or national of the United States. You are a native of India and a citizen of India."" Official documents state that if he gets apprehended for staying illegally before his hearing is held, he risks deportation to India.In another case, a couple from Gujarat's Mehsana district was detained with their child after crossing the US-Canada border illegally in June. They were put in a detention camp and their case is pending with ICE. When the couple approached the ICE office last week, they were not allowed to enter. They recently got to know from a US agency officer that their hearing has been scheduled for Aug 2026.Meanwhile, human smuggling networks are advising clients, especially from Gujarat, to avoid citing political persecution as a reason for asylum. A source in the human smuggling network said, ""US officials will strictly scrutinise people who seek asylum citing political harassment. They are more likely to face deportation, too."" Videos obtained by TOI show Gujaratis illegally entering the US and falsely claiming to be workers of opposition parties, when caught.This issue was recently debated in Rajya Sabha and saw government accusing asylum seekers of ""maligning the country for personal gain"".","A staggering 41,000 Indians applied for asylum in the US in 2023.

‘Imported rotten meat’ sparks outrage in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/imported-rotten-meat-sparks-outrage-in-kashmir/articleshow/123247461.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K is in the grip of a food safety scare after officials seized more than 11,600kg of “imported rotten meat” from warehouses, eateries and shops across Kashmir valley, triggering a storm of halal concerns and rumours.The seizures, excluding poultry, were made over the past week during surprise inspections that uncovered illegal storage and gross violations of safety rules. Images of decayed meat on social media spurred calls to boycott animal meat in restaurants.Religious leaders joined the outcry, questioning how such supplies had gone unchecked for years and whether they were even permissible under Islamic law.Kashmir’s grand mufti Nasir-ul-Islam urged people to avoid animal meat dishes such as tikka, kebab, biryani and momo in eateries until the matter is resolved. “The rumour mills have it that the meat could be that of stray dogs,” he said.Kashmir’s chief priest Mirwaiz Umar Farooq condemned the alleged supply of unsafe food as “a betrayal of public trust”, warning it could involve carrion — strictly forbidden in Islam.CM Omar Abdullah convened a meeting Monday to review the enforcement drive, urging residents to report concerns to authorities and avoid taking the law into their own hands.“The grave problem appears to have remained unchecked and unnoticed for too long. The unscrupulous elements have played with the health and lives of people. This has to stop,” he said.Food safety commissioner Smita Sethi said the seized meat has been destroyed. In one case, inspectors found an unregistered cold storage unit in Srinagar’s Zukura area allegedly hoarding imported meat without power backup. “We didn’t find much in other areas because people had already dumped it in rivers,” she said.Sethi said frozen meat imports into J&K are legal, but the seized consignments lacked expiry and packaging dates, import source details and proper labelling. Many storage sites allegedly failed to maintain the mandatory –18°C temperature. Using inspections, smell checks and mobile labs, authorities confirmed much of it was “unfit and rotten”.No FIR has been filed yet, but Sethi said investigations will lead to inquiries against those involved.CM Abdullah ordered “exemplary punitive action” under the Food Safety and Standards Act, including criminal proceedings for serious violators.“No meat should be sold and used without proper clearance,” he said, while directing that entry-point check posts and testing labs be set up at Lakhanpur and Qazigund, and district-level food testing facilities established beyond Srinagar and Jammu.","Officials seize more than 11,600kg of “imported rotten meat’ from warehouses, eateries and shops across Kashmir valley.

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over the US move to impose a 50% tariff on Indian goods significantly impacting the export of India's fisheries, the government on Monday asked seafood exporters to explore alternative markets for shrimps and other fish varieties.""We have asked them (exporters) to face the current challenge bravely. There are alternative markets available...

Since the enhanced tariff will impact India's market share in the US, the country will have to explore alternative markets. The meeting on Monday was held to chart a strategy to expand India's market reach.The alternative markets identified for the purpose include the UK, European Union (EU), Oman, UAE, South Korea, Russia and China, with there being special focus on South Korea's potential and west Asia's growing demand for Indian seafood.Emphasising the need for greater value addition and better packaging in gaining new markets, Singh said, ""We have asked them (exporters) to work in this direction"".","India is currently the leading supplier of frozen shrimps and prawns to the US.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah seeking clarity on the whereabouts and health of former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, who resigned unexpectedly on July 21 citing health reasons.In his letter, Raut expressed concern that there has been “no information” about Dhankhar since his resignation and urged the home minister to “provide genuine information” on his safety.Raut recalled that on the morning of July 21, Dhankhar “appeared normal” while presiding over the Rajya Sabha’s Monsoon session and even engaged in a verbal exchange with Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge before adjourning proceedings.However, by 6pm the same day, his resignation was announced, a move Raut described as “shocking.” He wrote: “From July 21 till today, there has been no information about the whereabouts of our Vice President. What is his current location? How is his health? There is no clarity on these matters.”The Shiv Sena leader said attempts by Rajya Sabha members to contact Dhankhar had failed, and rumours were circulating in Delhi that the former vice president had been “confined to his residence” and “reportedly not safe.”He warned that some MPs were considering a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, but he had decided first to approach Shah: “Before knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court I thought it to be prudent to seek this information from you. ”Raut’s intervention follows similar calls from Independent MP Kapil Sibal, who questioned the silence around Dhankhar’s whereabouts. Sibal said he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa [missing] vice president’,” and noted that even Dhankhar’s family and close associates had offered no update. “The home ministry must know where Dhankhar is and must reveal it,” he said, warning that such secrecy “should not happen in a democracy. ”Dhankhar, 74, resigned midterm as vice president, just two years after assuming office in August 2022.

Five Al Jazeera journalists, including well-known correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, accusing al-Sharif of being a Hamas operative who “posed as a journalist” and led a terrorist cell responsible for rocket attacks.Al Jazeera condemned the killings as a “targeted assassination” aimed at silencing independent reporting from Gaza, where international media access remains heavily restricted. The strike marks one of the deadliest incidents for the network since the war began nearly two years ago, during which over 200 media workers have been killed, according to press freedom groups.Al Jazeera confirmed that five of its staff died in the attack: correspondent Anas al-Sharif, fellow reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa.Also read: Journalist or Terrorist? Who was Anas al-Sharif? Al Jazeera reporter killed in Israeli strike The group had been sheltering in a tent opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex, a site long used by media crews. Al-Sharif, 28, was one of the most recognisable Arabic-language reporters covering the conflict, known for his frontline reports from northern Gaza. Hours before his death, he posted footage on X showing nearby Israeli strikes. The killings have deepened concerns about journalist safety in Gaza, where local reporters provide most coverage due to the ban on foreign press entering without Israeli military escort.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described Anas al-Sharif as a “Hamas terrorist” who used journalism as cover. They claimed intelligence from Gaza — including rosters, training records, and salary documents — proved his affiliation. According to the IDF, al-Sharif led a Hamas cell responsible for organising rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and troops. “A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism,” the statement read. The military also accused Al Jazeera of integrating Hamas operatives into its reporting teams. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.Al Jazeera condemned the attack as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom. The network accused Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists following repeated incitement by Israeli officials. It said the slain reporters were among the last to remain in Gaza, providing live, unfiltered accounts of the humanitarian crisis. The broadcaster warned that the killings were part of a wider campaign to “silence the truth” about the war. Calling for urgent international action, Al Jazeera argued that immunity for perpetrators fuels further attacks and urged governments to pressure Israel to halt the targeting of media workers.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was “appalled” by the deaths, warning that Israel’s practice of branding reporters as militants without public evidence raises “serious questions about its respect for press freedom.” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah stressed that journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) noted that over 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began, making it one of the deadliest conflicts for media in recent decades. Both organisations called for an independent investigation into the strike and for the protection of reporters working in conflict zones.Israel and Al Jazeera have had a strained relationship for years. The Israeli government has banned the broadcaster from operating inside the country, accused it of incitement, and raided its offices. The latest war in Gaza has heightened tensions, with Al Jazeera frequently challenging Israeli narratives about military operations. Qatar, which funds the network, also hosts the political leadership of Hamas and has mediated indirect talks between Israel and the group. Critics say this fuels Israeli mistrust of the channel, while supporters argue it remains one of the few outlets providing on-the-ground coverage from Gaza.With Gaza sealed off from most international journalists, global news organisations rely heavily on local reporters like al-Sharif for coverage. These journalists face extreme danger, lacking the protection afforded to embedded foreign correspondents. Many live under constant bombardment, while also coping with shortages of food, water, and medical care. The deaths of prominent figures such as al-Sharif further diminish the flow of independent reporting from the enclave. UN agencies and rights groups have warned that the loss of these voices leaves the world reliant on official statements and severely limits scrutiny of military actions.Before the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed foreign media, defending Israel’s expanded military operations in Gaza. He insisted Israel must “finish the job” by dismantling Hamas strongholds, not only in Gaza City but also in the central refugee camps and Muwasi. Netanyahu promised “safe zones” for civilians, though similar areas have been bombed in the past. He also announced plans to bring more foreign journalists into Gaza under military supervision. Critics, including the UN, warned that the expansion risks worsening the humanitarian disaster in the territory, which is already facing severe food shortages and mass displacement.The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting after Netanyahu’s announcement, but no concrete action was agreed. The United States defended Israel’s right to act against Hamas, rejecting allegations of genocide. China condemned the “collective punishment” of Gaza’s population, while Russia warned against a “reckless intensification” of hostilities. UN humanitarian official Ramesh Rajasingham said starvation was already occurring, with conditions “beyond horrific. ” Rights groups argue that targeting journalists undermines transparency and accountability in such a crisis, making independent reporting all the more crucial.Gaza’s health ministry reports more than 61,000 Palestinians killed since the war began, with roughly half being women and children. The conflict has displaced the majority of Gaza’s population and driven parts of the territory into famine. The ministry says at least 100 children and 117 adults have died from malnutrition-related causes since June. Aid delivery remains chaotic, with incidents of gunfire reported near distribution sites. Israel denies pursuing a policy of starvation, blaming shortages on Hamas. Humanitarian agencies say access restrictions and ongoing fighting are preventing sufficient relief efforts.Palestinian officials, press freedom advocates, and humanitarian organisations have called for the killings of al-Sharif and his colleagues to be investigated as war crimes. They argue the strike fits a broader pattern of silencing journalists who document alleged abuses. Al Jazeera says its slain reporters embodied the “courage and resilience” of Gaza’s press, working despite personal risk to expose the war’s impact. As the conflict nears its second year, the network warns that without independent witnesses, the humanitarian crisis will unfold largely unseen — and those responsible will face even less scrutiny.","Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday. Al Jazeera condemned the attack as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123225275,imgsize-76992,width-400,resizemode-4/123225275.jpg"

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

Poll Do you believe Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs until the 2027 World Cup? Yes, they should play. No, it's time to retire. Only if they are performing well.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is in no rush to make decisions about the ODI futures of cricket stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , despite ongoing speculation. The matter has gained attention as India's next ODI series against Australia approaches in October, with questions arising about whether the duo, who have collectively scored 83 ODI hundreds and over 25,000 runs, can continue playing until the 2027 ODI World Cup.India's scheduled ODI series against Bangladesh in August has been canceled, making the Australia series from October 19-25 their next one-day international commitment.The age factor has become a significant talking point, as Kohli and Rohit would be 39 and 40 years old respectively by the 2027 ODI World Cup.""Obviously, if they (Rohit and Kohli) have something in mind, they would tell the BCCI brass like they did before the England Test tour. But from an Indian team's perspective, the next big assignment is the T20 World Cup in February and preparations before that. The immediate focus will be on sending the best team for the Asia Cup T20 tournament, hoping all players are fit and available,"" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The BCCI is known for its measured approach to sensitive decisions, particularly considering the massive fan following of both players.The last tournament featuring both players was the Champions Trophy in Dubai, where Kohli scored a century against Pakistan in a group stage match, and Rohit contributed with a crucial half-century in the final.Neither player has participated in competitive cricket since the Indian Premier League concluded.Kohli, now residing in London, has shown signs of returning to training, posting an Instagram story of an indoor nets session.Rohit, who was also in the UK post-IPL, has returned to Mumbai and is expected to begin training soon.While some media outlets have reported about BCCI potentially offering the duo a farewell game in Sydney on October 25, the BCCI source indicated no such discussions have taken place yet.""Even if they play Vijay Hazare, before that there would already be six ODIs that will be played. In between the Australia ODIs and the South Africa ODIs, there is an India A series against South Africa A where three List A games (50 overs) will be held at Rajkot on November 13, 16 and 19 respectively.""""Now, will the duo want to play those three A games, or possibly two, before the South Africa series is the question. Even more important is whether Ajit Agarkar and his colleagues would want that,"" the source added.The national One-Day Championship, Vijay Hazare Trophy, is scheduled to begin on December 24, 2025, preceded by a three-match ODI series against South Africa starting November 30.""Overlapping the Vijay Hazare Trophy (December 24, 2025 - January 18, 2025) will be the three ODIs between India and New Zealand (January 11, 14, 18). So even if they play the Vijay Hazare Trophy, it can't be for more than two to three games,"" the source concluded.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have scored 83 ODI hundreds and over 25,000 runs. The duo would be 39 and 40 years old respectively by the 2027 ODI World Cup. India's scheduled ODI series against Bangladesh in August has been canceled.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123218480,imgsize-148776,width-400,resizemode-4/123218480.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Delhi police on Monday detained animal rights activists, rescuers, caregivers, and dog lovers protesting at India Gate against the Supreme Court’s order to move all stray dogs in Delhi-NCR to shelters within eight weeks.Earlier in the day, in a suo motu case on dog bite incidents, the Supreme Court directed the Delhi government to start picking up stray dogs from all localities, house them in shelters, and not release them back onto streets, colonies, or public places.The court said shelters must be set up to accommodate around 5,000 dogs and staffed with enough personnel for sterilisation and immunisation.Calling the situation “extremely grim,” the bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan stressed, ""We are issuing these directions keeping larger public interest in mind,"" further adding that infants, young children should not at any cost fall prey to stray dog bites leading to rabies.PETA India Advocacy Associate Shaurya Agrawal criticised the ruling, calling it “impractical, illogical and… according to the animal birth control rules, also illegal.”He said Delhi has around 10 lakh stray dogs and housing them all in shelters would be impossible.“This is going to create chaos and problems. Removal of dogs is inhumane, is cruelty in itself, and the conditions within the shelters are going to be very bad...We are exploring all our legal avenues. And in the past, we have met the Delhi government and have urged them to implement the ABC rules properly and the sterilisation programs in the city,” he added.","Delhi police detained animal rights activists, rescuers, caregivers, and dog lovers protesting at India Gate.

Rahul Gandhi's 'Vote Theft' Bombshell On EC Ignite BJP Vs Cong War Of Words

NEW DELHI: Congress leader KN Rajanna resigned as Karnataka Cooperation Minister on Monday after the party’s high command asked him to step down.This followed his critical remarks about his own party, where he expressed concern that they had failed to address alleged lapses in the electoral rolls before the election. He stated that the party “should feel ashamed” because these “irregularities happened right in front of our eyes. ”While he supported the party's ""irregularity"" charge, Rajanna also questioned the alacrity of the Congress party, saying the voter list was prepared when Congress was in power."" At that time, was everyone just sitting quietly with eyes closed?"" he asked, adding that the party ""should feel ashamed"".""Look, if we just start talking about such things casually, there will be different opinions. When was the voter list prepared? It was prepared when our own government was in power. At that time, was everyone just sitting quietly with eyes closed? These irregularities did take place — that’s the truth. There is nothing false in this. These irregularities happened right in front of our eyes — we should feel ashamed,"" the Karnataka minister told news agency PTI.The leader further said that at a time when the party should have filed objections, ""it kept quiet"".""We didn’t take care of it at the time. That’s why we must be alert in the future....In Mahadevapura, there was indeed fraud. One person was registered in three different places and voted in all three. But when the draft electoral rolls are being prepared, we have to monitor it, right?...When the draft electoral rolls are made, we must file objections — that is our responsibility. At that time, we kept quiet and now we are talking,"" he said.

Rajanna's remark undoubtedly miffed the party high command, which is holding march to the Election Commission of India (ECI) over alleged ""vote chori"".Karnataka duputy CM DK Shivakumar said Rajanna was ""totally at fault"" and that the party's leadership will reply to his remarks.Rahul Gandhi on Monday declined to sign a sworn declaration backing his ""vote-theft"" allegations against the Election Commission of India, despite repeated calls from the poll body.Reiterating that the documents he cited for his “vote theft” claims came from the Election Commission’s own data, the Congress leader called it a fight for “One Man, One Vote” and questioned the state of democracy, noting that “300 MPs” were denied a meeting with the poll body.His remarks came after being released from Delhi Police detention during the INDIA bloc’s protest march to the EC office. ""Why should I sign an oath? This is their data, not mine. They should take it from their own website. They are just diverting attention. And no one should think this happened only in Bengaluru; it happened in many constituencies. Today, the Election Commission is trying to hide something, but I want to tell you that one day, everything will come out,"" he said.","Congress leader KN Rajanna resigned as Karnataka Cooperation Minister on Monday after the party’s high command asked him to step down.

A young suitor followed. The scrub and dust of Ranthambore's Zone 6 bore witness Saturday evening to a spectacle even veteran trackers blinked at - the national park's oldest living tigress T-39, aka Noor, mating at an age when most big cats have long hung up their claws.Estimated to be 17 to 18 years old, Noor already holds the Ranthambore record for breeding at the oldest age ever seen in the wild. In 2022, she produced a litter - her ninth - defying the norm that tigresses stop breeding by 12 or 13. In May 2023, conservation biologist Dharmendra Khandal saw her litter weak and emaciated, her udder dried up.Yet here she was - glowing coat, canines intact - mating with T-101, with reports she had also paired with another male days earlier. ""Mating at this age has not been observed in the wild,"" former honorary wildlife warden Balendu Singh said. ""She is healthy. At present, she is the oldest living tigress in the wild without intervention.""Noor's longevity and reproductive fire point to formidable genetics. She is the daughter of Old Sultanpur female T-13 - known as Binda. ""Her mother reached 18.5 years without support until she disappeared in Oct 2023,"" Khandal said.""But the maximum breeding age I've personally observed in the wild is that of Noor in Ranthambore.""The mating may never bear fruit. ""Not a cat in hell's chance,"" said a veterinary officer, adding there's no documented case of a tigress birthing at or after 17 even in captivity.But in the wild, as Khandal put it, there's always ""a rare push against nature's limits"".Sometimes it's male pressure, sometimes it's her choice.

Meet ‘Hercules’, Asia’s Largest Tiger Caught on Camera in Uttarakhand | 7 Feet, 300 Kgs

N EW DELHI: Two Bengal tiger cubs have died at the Delhi zoo in the past three days, officials said on Monday, just a week after the birth of six cubs, the largest litter in two decades.The cubs were born to a seven-year-old tigress, Aditi, on August 4. This was her first litter since arriving from the Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur.The smallest cub in the litter died inside the enclosure on the morning of August 8. Another, too weak to feed, was moved to the zoo hospital on August 9, but died the following night despite treatment.Zoo director Sanjeet Kumar said Aditi is feeding and caring for the remaining four cubs, who are under 24-hour CCTV and manual monitoring.“Supplements are being given to the mother to support milk production. The remaining cubs are active and feeding well,” Kumar said as quoted by PTI.Before this litter, the zoo had six white tigers and seven Royal Bengal tigers. In 2023, tigress Siddhi from Gorewada gave birth to five cubs, the first Royal Bengal tiger birth at the zoo in nearly 18 years, but only two survived. The last litter of six was in 2005, when two survived. The most recent white tiger birth was in 2022, when tigress Sita delivered three cubs, of which two survived. Officials say survival rates in large litters are often low.The Delhi Zoo, which has housed tigers since its opening in 1959, is recognised under the Central Zoo Authority’s conservation breeding programme as a centre for tiger conservation and breeding.","Two Bengal tiger cubs have died at the Delhi zoo in the past three days.

"Army recruitment must be merit-based, gender-neutral: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-recruitment-must-be-merit-based-gender-neutral-supreme-court/articleshow/123246918.cms,"NEW DELHI: When women officers can fly Rafales and can be a part of UN peacekeeping missions in combat zones like Syria, Lebanon and Israel, then why can't they be deployed in counter-insurgency and counter-terror forces or get attached to infantry/artillery units in times of emergency, the Supreme Court asked on Monday while ruling that recruitment in streams where women are allowed must be merit-based and gender-neutral with no restriction on entry of women candidates.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan found fault in Army's policy of preparing separate merit lists for male and female candidates to recruit three female and six male candidates for Short Service Commission course for law graduates for Judge Advocate General (JAG) branch and said it was discriminatory as it put restrictions on female candidates. It said the practice of fixing a ceiling on recruitment of female candidates has the effect of perpetuating the status quo, which has been historically discriminatory to women candidates. There are 10 streams in the Army where women are eligible for appointment as SSC officers.""This court is of the view that once the Army permits women officers to join any corps, department or branch forming a part of the regular Army, it cannot impose an additional restriction with regard to 'extent of induction' of women officers in the said corps, department or branch - as Section 12 of the Army Act, 1950, does not empower it to do so,"" Justice Manmohan, who wrote the verdict for the bench, said.The court allowed the plea of a woman who contended that she scored more than her male counterparts but was denied because only three females were to be selected.The Centre and the Army took the defence that JAG officers are primarily combatant personnel and that was the reason for restriction on entry of females but the court refused to accept the plea and said if it was accepted, then it would lead to exclusion of women officers from all streams of the Army.""It does not stand to reason that when women officers like Captain Ojaswita Shree of the elite Parachute Air Defence Unit, Major Dwipannita Kalita of highly specialised airborne medical unit of the Indian Army and Flight Lieutenant Shivangi Singh (pilot of Rafale jet) of the Indian Air Force can operate behind enemy lines with all expected risks, why women officers in times of emergency cannot be deployed for counter-insurgency or in counter-terror forces or attached to infantry/artillery units. This is supported by the fact that the Indian Army entrusts women officers with complex tasks, such as transporting convoys of 30 to 50 vehicles through militant-prone areas in Leh, Srinagar, Udhampur and the north-east,"" the bench said.","Women officers can fly Rafales and can be a part of UN peacekeeping missions in combat zones like Syria, Lebanon and Israel.

The plan is to make it mandatory for universities to justify every NFS decision and have it examined by the UGC, which can suggest remedies or alternative recruitment measures.The move, aimed at curbing the alleged misuse of the provision to sideline SC, ST and OBC candidates, comes amid a political slugfest: BJP accuses Congress of having historically manipulated recruitment processes under the pretext of NFS, while the Opposition says vacancies remain high under the Modi government.The ""Not Found Suitable Candidates"" committee, constituted by the UGC on June 19 , has been tasked with examining the scale and causes of the problem. In its initial note, the panel said a considerable number of vacancies in central universities are attributed to ""non-availability of suitable candidates against posts advertised,"" an issue repeatedly flagged in parliamentary questions and at other forums.The committee will analyse university-wise and category-wise data, study whether NFS declarations have led to uneven representation and recommend ways to address such disparities.Institutions will have to file detailed reports whenever candidates are rejected as ""not suitable"" despite meeting eligibility criteria. Government sources said UGC's scrutiny will help detect bias, identify procedural lapses, and recommend solutions, including fresh recruitment drives or targeted outreach to eligible candidates.","The move is aimed at curbing the alleged misuse of the provision to sideline SC, ST and OBC candidates.

DHARALI: To say it's difficult to reach Dharali after the floods ravaged it on Aug 5 would be a great understatement. A TOI team crossed rivers, scampered up slippery boulders, trudged through forests and trekked for 26 hours before reaching the village that until a few days ago was a busy stop for pilgrims heading to Gangotri but is now a deserted mass of stones, mud and sediment. The pain of seeing Dharali as it stands today doesn't end there. At every step one is reminded there are people buried underneath. No one knows how many.Dharali is these days marked by a quiet that hangs heavy over the uneven landscape, broken only by the clank of metal on stone and the hum of search teams. Rescuers and villagers move slowly across the moonscape of debris, eyes scanning for the faintest signs of life, arms sifting through rubble for valuables - a family photograph, a tool that might still be of use - anything the angry waters did not claim. Each find is set aside with care, logged and passed to villagers waiting at the Siddhveshar temple, now serving as a relief centre. Conversations are brief, often breaking off mid-sentence as people glance towards the road, scanning for familiar faces that have not returned. Rajat Panwar, clutching an empty bag, said: ""We don't know why God punished us so ... Our homes, orchards, and people were gone in seconds. Wehave nothing to live for.""The bridge linking Dharali to Mukhaba, a hamlet on the opposite slope, leans at an angle, one side eaten away by the river's pull, the other swallowed by a slide of rock and mud. Beyond this point, old lanes and apple orchards that gave Dharali its fruity air are memories of the past. The landscape was rewritten overnight in a twisted way. Dharali, with undulating sand looks like an empty desert in the mountains.","Dharali is these days marked by a quiet that hangs heavy over the uneven landscape, broken only by the clank of metal on stone and the hum of search teams.

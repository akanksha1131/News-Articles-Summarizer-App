Bihar election: How Rahul Gandhi tuned Congress’ Bihar pitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-election-how-rahul-gandhi-tuned-congress-bihar-pitch/articleshow/124353012.cms,"PATNA: Until June this year, Congress looked desperate. It first replaced the party’s 74year-old Bihar in-charge Mohan Prakash by a rather young Krishna Allavaru and then appointed Rajesh Kumar, a Dalit face, as state president, removing Akhilesh Prasad Singh, who came from the upper caste Bhumihars. But nothing seemed to make a difference.Then came EC’s decision to conduct a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. Congress found a cause, dubbing the exercise as a conspiracy to strike opposition voters off electoral rolls. Congress fused it with its broader claim that all BJP victories since 2014 were facilitated by “vote fraud”. Rahul Gandhi started Voter Adhikar Yatra, invited INDIA bloc big names like M K Stalin and Akhilesh Yadav.But will it influence voters? One clue comes from the subdued response of Congress and other opposition parties to the final electoral roll published on Sept 30. That reaction was anticlimactic. And this, when SIR did result in the deletion of 0.4 million “ineligible” names from the draft voters’ list. Significantly, even during the Voter Adhikar Yatra, grumbles could be heard about how it pushed “bread-and-butter” issues off centre stage, giving Nitish Kumar crucial time to repair a potential point of vulnerability.But the Yatra helped Congress acquire a profile it lacked. It upstaged RJD, its senior partner, which had planned to launch its own protest against SIR.Congress’s enhanced confidence is indicated by its refusal to defer to RJD’s insistence that Tejashwi should immediately be projected Mahagathbandhan’s CM candidate.","Congress found a cause, dubbing the exercise as a conspiracy to strike opposition voters off electoral rolls.

Suvendu Adhikari slams West Bengal CM:

.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “politicising” the recent floods and landslides in North Bengal, calling his remarks a political low.She said the crisis was not a time for partisan chest-thumping and urged all parties to prioritise relief and recovery efforts over political disputes.In a post on X, she wrote: ""Yes, we all condemn violence, unequivocally. But this is not the time for partisan chest-thumping. This is a time to help and heal.""She called PM Modi’s remarks “unfortunate and deeply concerning” and reminded him that he is the Prime Minister of India, not just of the BJP . His responsibility lies in nation-building, not narrative-building.Banerjee further accused the prime minister of blaming the TMC and the West Bengal government without verified evidence or proper investigation.She wrote: “It is unfortunate and deeply concerning that the Prime Minister of India has chosen to politicise a natural disaster without waiting for a proper investigation, especially while people in North Bengal are grappling with the aftermath of devastating floods and landslides.”This comes after BJP MLA Shankar Ghosh and Malda North MP Khagen Murmu were allegedly attacked while distributing relief materials in Nagrakata, North Bengal.PM Modi’s remarks came in response to the incident, criticising the TMC and the West Bengal government for the law and order situation in the state.Banerjee highlighted that while the state administration and police were fully engaged in relief and rescue operations, BJP leaders visited the affected areas with a large convoy of cars and central security forces without informing local authorities.She questioned, ""How can the state administration, local police, or the TMC be blamed for the incident?""She slammed the recent visit of PM Modi to Manipur in September, observing that he visited the ethnic violence-hit state 964 days after the crisis.The West Bengal CM accused him of engaging in “opportunistic political theatre” and criticised him for making sweeping claims without verified evidence.She added, ""The PM has blamed the TMC and the West Bengal Government outright without a shred of verified evidence, legal inquiry, or administrative report. This is not just a political low, it is a breach of the constitutional ethos the Prime Minister has sworn to uphold.""She observed that the incident occurred in a constituency represented by a BJP MLA, yet the Prime Minister attributed it to the TMC, calling such sweeping and unsubstantiated generalisations immature and unbecoming of the highest office.Banerjee also accused the BJP of trying to polarise the state along North Bengal and South Bengal lines, stressing that while violence must be condemned, the focus should remain on relief and healing.She urged unity, calling on all parties to work together to serve the people in need and leave politics aside during the crisis.As floodwaters began receding in North Bengal on Monday, eight more bodies were recovered, raising the death toll in one of the region’s worst calamities to 36.Many people remain missing. Until Sunday, 28 bodies had been recovered across the hills and plains of North Bengal, including five Nepalis.West Bengal CM who arrived in the region on Monday had announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the family of each deceased.West Bengal Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari hit out at Banerjee after her post.In a post on X, Adhikari wrote, “You are nothing but a ‘Dictator in Denial’. Resign if you have any shame left.”He accused her of attempting to whitewash her party workers’ misconduct and criticised her for failing to act while North Bengal was affected by floods.Adhikari added that BJP leaders stepped in to help victims and said the Prime Minister’s remarks on the issue were accurate, observing that such violence was unexpected during a time of crisis.",West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “politicising” the recent floods and landslides in North Bengal.

Bihar assembly election: Why Prashant Kishor’s poll debut could upset old equations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-election-why-prashant-kishors-poll-debut-could-upset-old-equations/articleshow/124352932.cms,"PATNA: Many might still remember the slogan “Bihar me bahaar hai, Nitish -e Kumar hai ” (Bihar is a happy place because Nitish Kumar is on the throne). Coined by poll strategist Prashant Kishor (PK) , during the 2015 assembly elections, it was part of Nitish Kumar’s effective campaign after he joined hands with RJD and Congress to outdo the BJPled NDA.This time, Kishor is himself in the fray as the leader of the party he launched last year, Jan Suraj — hoping to pull off an upset of the same magnitude as AAP’s shock win in Delhi in 2015.That may look unrealistic. But PK cannot be accused of not trying. He has extensively toured the state and, using the experience he accumulated while organising campaigns for others, launched a bold campaign which audaciously targets the established players.Initially and for a long time later, he targeted RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his “family first” ethos, which had fuelled the rise of Tejashwi, NDA’s primary opponent. But he has also trained his guns at the NDA, of late.PK’s message is simple: the established players, who have alternatively been at the helm over the last two and a half decades, share the responsibility for the state’s backwardness and cannot be trusted to improve matters.The message is specifically aimed at young people, who are angry about the lack of employment opportunities and are being forced to migrate to states where they are unwelcome. It is amplified by a combination of pluckiness and freshness, innovative use of social media and the fact that he was first off the campaigning blocks.Observers believe that the platform offered by PK — who happens to be a Brahmin — may resonate, especially with youth from the upper castes. Unlike OBCs, who have the satisfaction of seeing their own man in office or are hoping to see their man in office, upper castes cannot expect to receive any such compensatory benefit in a state where they have been excluded from the leadership race because of their numerical disadvantage. They have seen their numbers in services shrink from what they were before the introduction of reservation, and also because of the diminished power of the elite among them to influence jobs through the patronagedispensing network.But he faces the risk of getting squeezed out of the race in what is essentially going to be a bipolar contest in large parts. The challenge for him is to appear viable and avoid being a “vote katua ”, a spoiler. That would require him to find candidates who appear winnable (read resourceful) and, at the same time, are aligned, in terms of image and credentials, with his promise to be an agent of change.Kishor can, of course, lend strength to his candidates by contesting one of the seats: something that would convey his commitment to electoral politics. He has in the past helped his “clients” overcome similar challenges on turf he did not belong to. But the strategist will have to dig deeper into his bag of tricks and expand it when he himself is at the wicket on the home ground.","Prashant Kishor is himself in the fray as the leader of the party he launched last year, Jan Suraj.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for assembly elections across 243 seats, political strategist-turned-leader Prashant Kishor has confirmed that he will contest the polls, with his political startup Jan Suraaj set to unveil its list of candidates on October 9 -- a list he says will be “full of surprises.”The announcement followed Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar’s declaration of the Bihar election schedule, which will be conducted in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results to be announced on November 14. Bihar, with 243 constituencies, has the fourth-largest assembly in India.Speaking to reporters, Kishor said, ""The party will declare its list of candidates for the coming assembly polls on October 9 and it will be full of surprises. My name will also be there in the list.""The former poll strategist declined to reveal the constituency he will contest from, saying, ""You will come to know on October 9.""When asked about Jan Suraaj’s prospects, Kishor asserted that his party would attract a significant voter base that does not align with either of the major alliances. ""In the last polls, the two alliances bagged votes of 72 per cent of voters only. I must clarify that we will get votes of the remaining 28 per cent of the voters.Besides, people say that Jan Suraaj Party will get 10 per cent votes each of both alliances. That means we are expected to get 48 per cent votes of the total electorate in the coming polls,"" he said.He added that many believe Jan Suraaj will cut into the vote shares of both the NDA and the INDIA bloc.Kishor also took aim at Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, saying, ""I am saying it with full confidence that this will be the last election of Nitish Kumar. He will not celebrate the next 'Makar Sankranti' (in January 2026) at 1 Anne Marg, the official residence of the Bihar chief minister in the state capital.""He said this election would mark ""a new chapter"" in Bihar politics as people vote for ""the bright future of their children, against migration and unemployment.""The upcoming contest is set to be triangular -- the NDA alliance of BJP, JD(U), Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustan Awami Morcha, and Rashtriya Lok Shakti Party facing off against the INDIA bloc of RJD, Congress, CPI(ML), CPI, CPM, and Vikasheel Insaan Party, with Jan Suraaj emerging as a new challenger expected to disrupt traditional vote banks.","Prashant Kishor's political startup Jan Suraaj set to unveil its list of candidates on October 9.

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness.

""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF).

""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets.

An Indian student recently received a visa rejection letter from the US that said they were not convinced that he had sufficient ties to India that would compel him to return to India after his time in the United States. In an interview with the Washington Post, Kaushik Raj revealed that he made it clear during the application process that he was born and brought up in India and that his entire family lives in India. Kaushik Raj told Post that he feels the rejection came after the US officials went through his social media profiles, which is now a mandatory process for a visa.Kaushik Raj said he was not active on social media and did not post anything on controversial issues, but he spent four years working as a journalist and posted links of his stories.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged more than 4% on Monday, hitting record highs after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) elected Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative and close ally of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as its new leader, paving the way for her to become Japan’s first female prime minister.The broader Topix index also advanced 2.3%, buoyed by investor optimism that Takaichi will continue Abe’s pro-market and stimulus-heavy economic policies.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged 0.1% lower to 27,119.36, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was largely unchanged at 8,984.70.Markets in mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea remained shut for holidays, AP reported.The yen weakened against the US dollar, falling to 149.79 per dollar from 149.33 a day earlier, amid expectations that Takaichi could introduce higher public spending measures, potentially adding to inflationary pressures. The euro dipped slightly to $1.1720.Takaichi, 64, is seen as a protégé of Shinzo Abe and has long admired former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Known for her hawkish views, she has vowed to strengthen Japan’s defence, boost industrial competitiveness, and implement measures to address demographic challenges such as the country’s ageing population and rising debt burden.""The Nikkei was on course to reach as high as 48,000 by year-end, but because Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader, it shot up toward that level already,"" Hitoshi Asaoka, the chief strategist at Asset Management One told Reuters.""The market welcomes her spending policy, but whether she can achieve that goal is not certain, as the LDP is still a minority party.

Poll Do you think the safety measures on flights are adequate? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, Air India was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, Air India said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: In the high-stakes showdown for Bihar assembly polls, NDA, helmed by BJP and CM Nitish Kumar's JDU , is expecting a resounding endorsement of its ""double engine"" governance, claiming to have lifted the state from 'Jungle Raj' quagmire to the cusp of 'Viksit Bihar'.Home minister Amit Shah said on Monday that NDA government has pulled Bihar out of 'Jungle Raj' and given it a new direction of development and good governance, and expressed confidence that the state's people will once again choose politics of development in the coming polls.BJP president JP Nadda and JDU executive president Sanjay Jha sounded equally confident as they asserted that the polls are for continuing the state's development, ridding it of infiltrators, and stopping return of 'misgovernance'.Matrize opinion poll has projected a landslide victory for NDA with the alliance's vote share expected at 49%, translating into 150-160 seats in the 243-member assembly. 'Mahagathbandhan' (RJD-Congress-Left combine) is expected to garner 36%, accounting for 70-85 seats, it said. The projections, though always taken with a pinch of salt, will further boost the mood in NDA camp.Governing coalition views the election calendar as a canvas to paint its narrative of progress with steady focus on welfarism, even as it braces for opposition INDIA bloc's ""caste-driven"" counteroffensive.PM Modi's popularity, coupled with announcements of social empowerment schemes & development projects, complements Nitish's 'Sushasan Babu' image. The 9-term CM is seen to have retained his grip over extremely backward classes (EBCs), bolstered by an attempted 27% EBC reservation hike and local body quotas for women.Central to NDA's strategy, however, is to capitalise on the image of Modi also as a move to combat possibility of fatigue among voters after two decades of Nitish's incumbency. Besides, Shah's tactical acumen is seen as a decisive factor as he has played a crucial role in consolidating the alliance & equation among partners with a reasonable seat-sharing formula, likely to be announced soon.Yet NDA's journey isn't without potholes. Internal performance audits have indicated anti-incumbency for several sitting MLAs, prompting ticket denials to inject fresh blood, resulting in rebellions. Nitish's health is another factor that ignites hope in opposition camp even as NDA parties have played it down.","Matrize opinion poll has projected a landslide victory for NDA with the alliance's vote share expected at 49%.

Not being allowed to meet Wangchuk, wife tells Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to Centre and Ladakh UT on a petition filed by Sonam Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali J Angmo, challenging his detention under the stringent National Security Act, but refused to pass interim order to the authorities to give her the grounds of arrest after it was alleged they had been “served on the detenue (Wangchuk)”.Posting hearing on October 14, SC asked why she too shouldn’t be given grounds of arrest.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria that he would examine the feasibility of providing grounds of detention to Sonam Wangchuk’s family.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Angmo, contended that she was not being allowed to meet him. SC asked her to approach the authority concerned and allowed her to move court if denied. Sibal argued that detention could not be challenged if the grounds of arrest were not provided.Mehta refuted the allegation, stating that 12 people had already been permitted to meet Wangchuk. The bench remarked, “Grounds have to be supplied as per judgments of this court. Why withhold it from his wife?” Mehta said the law requires grounds of arrest to be served on the detenue, not the wife, but added, “We will examine it.No issues as such, but we don’t want them to create a new ground to challenge the detention order. ”The SG also claimed a hype was being created in the media, which Sibal strongly rebutted. The two got entangled in counter-allegations until the bench intervened, asking both not to make emotional arguments. In a lighter vein, Sibal said, “The SG kept provoking me and I fell into his trap.”Justice Aravind Kumar, smiling, remarked, “We do not know what is going on,” to which Sibal replied, “You should know what is going on.”Wangchuk was detained under NSA on September 26, days after protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh left four dead. Angmo has sought President Droupadi Murmu’s intervention for his release.","Supreme Court issues notice to Centre, UT on wife's plea.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan

NEW DELHI: The Army used artificial intelligence (AI) tools in a big way during Operation Sindoor against Pakistan to generate a common operational picture, intelligence analysis, threat assessment, and predictive modelling and weather forecasting for long-range strikes.“AI was extensively used for multi-sensor data fusion and multi-source data fusion in real time during Operation Sindoor…Overall, 23 apps with specific tasks were used to deal with data and inputs,” director general EME (Electronics and Mechanical Engineers) Lt-General Rajiv Kumar Sahni said on Monday.Asked about China’s huge strides in AI-driven warfare as well as active support to Pakistan during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities, which included “live” satellite inputs on Indian military deployments, he said the Indian Army was plugged into the “IndiaAI mission” under a “whole of nation approach” as well as collaborating with industry and academia in a big way in the arena.While perceptions about China's AI capabilities exist, the Indian Army is also well-prepared and focused on national security, developing indigenous AI technologies and solutions for use in operations, logistics, autonomous weapon systems and the like, Lt-Gen Sahni added.The senior officer, who was the DG Information Systems during Operation Sindoor, said the ongoing integration of AI into the core functions of the 11.5-lakh strong Army, as part of the overall transformation drive, will bring greater speed, precision and lethality to combat operations.The key AI-driven applications used during Operation Sindoor included the electronic intelligence collation and analysis system (ECAS), a home-grown software upgraded in real time to identify and prioritise critical threats, which helped “achieve strategic dominance”, he said.Then, there was the “Trinetra” system, integrated with “Project Sanjay”, which provided a common operational picture for better coordination, situational awareness, and decision superiority. “AI was also leveraged big time for predictive modelling and weather forecasting tools, which enabled precise planning and targeting for artillery units and long-range vectors. These innovations significantly enhanced the Army’s operational preparedness and response,” he said.Having set up the AI Research and Incubation Centre in Bengaluru in Dec last year, the force is also developing an indigenous “unified AI platform” that will integrate operational, intelligence, logistics, and training applications on a single secure framework. “This will replace fragmented systems and enable validated AI deployment within 24 hours, significantly enhancing operational readiness,” an officer said.The Army is also establishing dedicated AI cells, creating secure cloud-based and edge-computing environments for battlefield applications, and developing AI-enabled autonomous systems such as drones and unmanned vehicles. “We are prioritising AI in domains where it reduces risk to personnel, improves decision-making, and strengthens resilience,” the officer said.","The Indian Army used artificial intelligence (AI) tools in a big way during Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.

Activist Sonam Wangchuk Arrested, Internet Snapped In Leh After Deadly Ladakh Clashes

SRINAGAR: Leh Apex Body (LAB), a grouping of religious and political organisations in Ladakh, rejected Monday government’s claims of normalcy in the region and accused authorities of harassing village heads (gobas) by summoning them for questioning“In our villages, gobas (nambardars) play a vital role. Nothing happens without their consent. When LAB began its hunger strike on September 10, village heads informed their villages about it. Now they are being summoned and questioned. We see this as an attack on our culture and will not accept it,” LAB co-chairman Chhering Dorje Lakruk said at a presser in Leh.Environmental activist and LAB member Sonam Wangchuk led the fast demanding Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh before the protests snowballed into violence on Sept 24, killing four people and injuring over 70. Wangchuk was arrested on Sept 26 and remains jailed under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).In Ladakh, a goba is a village headman chosen periodically by villagers through voice vote. The system remains effective as people traditionally follow the gobas’ guidance. “Some gobas were detained earlier but released due to our intervention. It is their job to inform people about the issues and the hunger strike of LAB.They shouldn’t be harassed for it,” Lakruk said.He questioned the government’s claims of normalcy, pointing to the gobas’ questioning and continued internet suspension. “The restrictions are still in place and people are being harassed,” Lakruk said. Govt should restore internet, stop arrests, lift restrictions and rebuild public confidence if it wants to normalise the situation, the LAB co-chairman said.On Saturday, Ladakh authorities had asserted that the situation was returning to normalcy while reaffirming the Centre’s commitment to a dialogue to address the aspirations of the people. The government had lauded the people of Ladakh were known for their peace-loving nature, fierce patriotism and their contribution to nation-building in securing its frontiers.After the violence of Sept 24, the authorities had imposed curfew-like restrictions, suspended internet, and arrested more than 60 people. While the administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violence, LAB and another umbrella group Kargil Democratic Alliance have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired Supreme Court judge.The two groups also withdrew from talks scheduled for Monday with a Union home ministry high-powered committee, seeking Wangchuk’s release and an impartial investigation.",Leh Apex Body (LAB) rejects Monday government’s claims of normalcy in the region.

Though the order did not mention that he was barred from holding public office, he chose to approach court to seek clarification. But the court said that the order was very clear and no clarification was needed.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Balalji, said the court cannot issue the mandate to bar a person from holding public office when he is not convicted and the apex court's April order against the former minister should not be understood to convey that he cannot hold public office.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, however, said that the very strong observation was passed by the court in its order for becoming minister two days after getting bail. ""You file application in case you want to be minister,"" the bench said.""There is nothing in order which requires clarification. The order is very clear,"" the bench said.The bench also suggested that the trial in cash-for-job 'scam' be tranferred from Tamil Nadu to Delhi and sought response from the state which strongly objected to the idea. The apex court's order in Balaji case had restored the convention that a person facing serious charges should not hold office till his name is cleared.","Former Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji had to resign after the court strongly objected to his conduct.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

NEW DELHI: The battle royal of 2024 put the opposition back in the opposition benches. But only just, with the unmistakable message from the power play being that after a decade of reeling from Modi-led BJP 's cycle of victories, the anti-BJP bloc was robustly ascendant.Over a year-and-a-half later, the scenario for INDIA bloc has shifted firmly back to the gloomy days of pre-2024, with BJP having stolen convincing victories from expected defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra, making its equally embarrassing losses in Jharkhand and J&K a sideshow. This post-2024 context makes the coming battle for Bihar more consequential nationally, far outweighing the otherwise equally crucial local questions like if RJD can return to office after a hiatus of two decades, and if it can stop BJP from emerging from the shadow of allies to become the single-largest player in state for the first time in its history.By general reckoning, Bihar will be watched for whether opposition still has the resilience that put it within striking distance of winning in national contest last year, despite adverse circumstances skewing the playing field in favour of the incumbent.It is, by universal acceptance, an uphill task for INDIA bloc. The BJP-JDU combine is looking to use incumbency to its advantage, like by announcing massive doles for women voters in the run-up to the polls, backed by the face of Modi, with CM and JDU chief Nitish Kumar as the solid ally. The equation brings with it caste engineering that has helped the governing combine to tide over challenging circumstances, like in the narrow win in 2020 in the shadow of Covid pandemic.INDIA bloc believes it has done the basics right, like getting the allies together and running an early statewide campaign of cohesion through 'Vote Adhikar Yatra' headlined by Rahul Gandhi, with Tejashwi Yadav and others in tow. The outrage over voters' list revision turned out well for the alliance as SC stamped on its demand for enlarging the basket of documents for voter registration. If a chord was to be struck through the efforts, it happened.But taking on BJP-JDU is a challenge. The caste net of the two allies, from upper castes to weaker backward classes, is a solid foundation, and much would depend on how far the rainbow alliance of Congress-RJD-CPI (ML)-VIP has succeeded in socially denting the rival camp in past couple of years since they came together with a purpose.If RJD managed to run the rivals ragged five years ago, it was helped by the unrest caused by grievances over Covid relief and Chirag Paswan's contesting solo, with LJP's gun trained on CM Nitish. This time, Paswan is an ally of BJP-JDU, which is a huge plus for the governing combine.Sources said positives for opposition are Nitish's Muslim voters are angry over waqf law & BJP's unmitigated 'communal' rhetoric. Also, there is hope that most backwards are not sure of his primacy in the alliance, with doubts about his becoming the CM, which could persuade them to go for opposition - a possible reason Tejashwi has been talking about Nitish's 'erratic behaviour', claiming he is in ""achet awastha"" (an unconscious state). The other hope is that pollster-turned-politician and Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor would dent the BJP-JDU support base and help opposition.","Bihar will be watched for whether opposition still has the resilience that put it within striking distance of winning in national contest last year.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, when asked on Monday to share the number of illegal foreign immigrants deleted from the Bihar electoral rolls on account of the sp ec ial intensive revision (SIR), did not elaborate on the figure, saying that the relevant data field was not available with EC.""The 7.4 crore electors of Bihar have reposed confidence in EC with their full participation in the SIR exercise and EC reciprocates confidence in them... I appeal to the people of Bihar to participate enthusiastically in the ensuing polls,"" Kumar said while announcing the Bihar poll schedule.The CEC said the data on illegal foreigners removed from the rolls for failure to provide proof of citizenship would be available at the assembly constituency level with electoral registration officers (EROs) or assistant EROs concerned, given the ""decentralised"" nature of preparation of rolls. The ERO, he explained, is the final authority on inclusion or exclusion of names. Kumar, however, said the names deleted from the Bihar rolls - 65 lakh at the draft roll publication stage, and 3.7 lakh more at the final roll publication stage - were found ""ineligible"" on account of reasons like death, having permanently shifted, remaining untraced during enumeration, for being non-citizens, or having been enrolled at multiple places.""All these lists have been shared, at the level of the assembly constituency, the district level, and state level, and have been shared with the statistics,"" the CEC said. ""That is why, all these different lists that you are talking about are not at the level of EC, but at the level of the ERO, district election officer (DEO) and chief electoral officer (CEO),"" he added.EC had given a break-up of the electors covered in different categories at the time of publication of draft roll, but did not have any separate category for those deleted on account of being non-citizens. Of the 65 lakh deletions, 22 lakh were on account of being deceased, 7 lakh due to being enrolled at multiple places, and 36 lakh on account of having permanently shifted or not being found. Though the last category of 36 lakh voters is inclusive of foreign illegal immigrants, possibly covered under the category ""not found"" or ""untraced"", their exact number was not disclosed. In earlier press notes, EC had put the number of ""untraced/not found"" voters at 1 lakh, when the overall figure of dead, permanently shifted, enrolled at multiple places and untraced/not found was around 60 lakh.A further 3.7 lakh voters were removed at the time of final publication of roll, but no breakup has been provided yet on why they were deleted.","Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar did not elaborate on the figure, saying the relevant data field was not available with EC.

Coldrif tragedy: Drug to fight hooch poisoning antidote to killer cough syrup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gmch-nagpur-docs-used-anti-hooch-poisoning-drug-to-contain-damage-by-killer-cough-syrup/articleshow/124350625.cms,"Representative image

NAGPUR: A drug usually administered on hooch (spurious liquor) poisoning victims proved to be the antidote for the damage caused by the killer cough syrup, Coldrif, which allegedly killed 15 children from Madhya Pradesh's Chhindwara district and severely affected several others below the age of 12 since August.When all standard treatments failed and children continued to succumb, the department of paediatrics at GMCH, Nagpur, led by Dr Manish Tiwari, held scientific discussions with reputed paediatricians and decided to administer Fomepizole — a drug generally used as an antidote in confirmed or suspected cases of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning.Lab reports from Tamil Nadu confirmed Coldrif contained 48.6% diethylene glycol (DEG), a toxic industrial solvent used in brake fluids and antifreeze.While six children from Madhya Pradesh died of renal failure at GMCH alone when the cause was unknown, six managed to survive, but are in a critical condition. ""Two have begun passing urine, but are in deep coma, while four others are still unable to pass urine. DEG concentration was 500% (48.6%) and has left them with severe brain damage too,"" said Dr Tiwari. These kids were brought to Nagpur between September 26 and October 4 and by then the role of killer syrup was established.Fomepizole, commonly administered in liquor poisoning cases, was found to be largely effective against DEG toxicity, officials said. Its timely use prevented further fatalities and showed positive outcomes among patients currently under treatment, civic health officials confirmed.The treatment protocol was promptly shared with private hospitals and Chhindwara health authorities, who were instructed to start administering Fomepizole on patients being sent to Nagpur, as it is effective if started within 18 hours of poisoning.""The sudden death of three children in August within hours of admission at Nagpur GMCH raised suspicion. GMCH immediately alerted Nagpur Municipal Corporation's Metropolitan Surveillance Unit (MSU), which directly coordinates with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). A central and state team of experts visited Chhindwara and Nagpur to conduct a detailed analysis of the reported cases and deaths in coordination with Madhya Pradesh state authorities,"" top officials told TOI.Doctors were initially perplexed when multiple clinical, environmental, and entomological samples taken by these teams and sent to NIV Pune and NEERI Nagpur for testing, did not show the cause of acute kidney injuries.Once preliminary findings ruled out common infectious diseases, doctors began searching for a common link. ""Coldrif, prescribed by the same doctor to all affected children, turned out to be the culprit. Once DEG poisoning was confirmed, the picture became clear,"" officials said.Renowned paediatrician Dr Anand Bhutada, director of New Era Mother and Child Hospital, where four children from Madhya Pradesh were treated last month, said, ""Initially, we had no specific drug for the unexplained kidney failure. Hooch poisoning involves the same contaminant as DEG. After using Fomepizole, we observed gradual improvement in the children's kidney function."" Three of these kids were discharged while one succumbed.""We cannot say with certainty, but this was the only medicine that appeared to help flush out the toxicity from the body, apart from haemodialysis. The rest was supportive care,"" Dr Bhutada added.","Fomepizole, commonly administered in liquor poisoning cases, was found to be largely effective against DEG toxicity, officials said.

SRINAGAR: The National Conference government in Jammu & Kashmir on Monday removed the chief education officer of north Kashmir after he issued a circular warning teachers against posting comments related to policy matters on social media.J&K education secretary Ram Niwas Sharma issued an order attaching the officer, Bashir Ahmad Shah, to the Directorate of School Education, Kashmir, pending an inquiry. In the circular issued Saturday (Oct 4), Shah had mentioned that the education secretary had raised concerns during a review meeting the previous day over the misuse of social media by teaching and non-teaching staff.The circular said any violation of the December 2017 social media guidelines could attract disciplinary action, including censure, fine up to one month’s salary, withholding of increment or promotion, demotion, premature retirement, or dismissal from service.The guidelines were not meant to discourage the constructive use of social media, the circular stated, but cautioned staff to refrain from “unwarranted debates, discussions, or posting inappropriate content”.The guidelines, issued by the then PDP-BJP dispensation, bar government employees from engaging in political discussions, criticising government policies and actions, or posting or endorsing political or communal content online. PDP legislator Waheed Parra criticised Shah’s circular, calling it “deeply concerning”. “In an already numb Jammu and Kashmir, this order warning teachers and staff against raising their voice is deeply concerning. A govt that came to office on the promise of giving people a voice is now contributing to silencing the few remaining ones,” Parra said.NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq responded that the circular was based on guidelines framed by the PDP-BJP government in 2017. However, the Omar Abdullah govt still removed the officer.","J&K education secretary Ram Niwas Sharma issued an order attaching the officer, Bashir Ahmad Shah, to the Directorate of School Education, Kashmir, pending an inquiry.

A proposal, a royal wedding, and life as a family

When hockey legend Wayne Gretzky first met Janet Jones , neither of them could have predicted that a chance encounter on a television set would grow into a lifelong love story. Today, the couple shares over three decades of marriage, five children, and a reputation as one of sports’ most enduring power couples.The pair first crossed paths in 1981 on the set of Dance Fever, where Wayne Gretzky was a celebrity guest judge and Jones a dancer. Though sparks didn’t fly right away, their story reignited six years later. In 1987, they ran into each other at a Los Angeles Lakers game — Wayne Gretzky with his friend Alan Thicke and Jones with a girlfriend. That night, the casual meet-up led to dinner and a conversation that revealed how similar their outlooks on life were.“We got along very well the first time we sat and actually chatted with each other,” Wayne Gretzky later recalled. “Mindset was very similar and our goals were the same in life. We started off that night where we were both on the same page. It makes life that much more simple.”Their whirlwind romance moved quickly. Gretzky proposed over the phone while Jones was away filming, and in July 1988, the couple married in Edmonton in what was famously described as a “wedding of royal proportions.”Thousands of fans lined the streets to witness the ceremony, and the event became a city-wide celebration.Family soon became the heart of their relationship. Their first daughter, Paulina, was born later that year, followed by four more children over the next 15 years. Despite busy careers — Gretzky rewriting hockey history and Jones pursuing acting — both prioritized raising their family. “Our goals were the same in life. Family was of number one importance,” Gretzky said.Also Read: Inside Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner’s private love story that has lasted more than 15 years From their early connection to their life as parents and grandparents, Gretzky and Jones have shown that the Great One’s greatest victory may well be found off the ice.","The pair first crossed paths in 1981 on the set of Dance Fever.

The photos showed her holding the fluffy pup close, planting gentle hugs, and sharing what looked like an afternoon of pure affection.Fans immediately recognized the tiny dog that has made recurring appearances in her posts over the past year. Earlier this summer, Bryant posted about the same pup after it accidentally smeared red lipstick across its fur, leading to a hilarious and heartwarming cleanup moment. Despite the mischief, Bryant couldn’t resist showing love, sealing the moment with another sweet kiss.It’s not the first time she’s shared glimpses of their bond. In a past post, she captured her pet sound asleep on her lap, writing, “Can’t move now,” proving that even a small dog can take over her heart— and her couch. The Bryant family has also been seen traveling with the little companion, with Natalia Bryant once posing with it during a walk through Central Park in New York City.Vanessa’s affection for her pets goes beyond the occasional social media post. Alongside her teacup pup, she’s also mom to a German Shepherd named Loki , who joined the family in early 2022. “My girls are happy,” she wrote at the time, sharing a photo with her daughters and their new “Big Boy.” Loki’s arrival helped fill the void left by Crucio, the beloved family dog who passed away just a month prior.""We love you, Crucio,"" she wrote in her farewell post. ""Thank you for everything sweet boy. Thank you for watching over us. We’re going to miss you. #GoodBoy #RestEasy.""Over the years, Vanessa Bryant has used her platform to share moments of love, family, and healing. Vanessa who was married to NBA legend Kobe Bryant, share 4 children Natalia, Gianna, Bianka and Capri. Tragically, Kobe and Vanessa’s second daughter, Gianna died at the age of 13 alongside her father in 2020 in the devastating helicopter crash at Pacific View Memorial Park and Mortuary in Corona Del Mar, California.Also Read: Klay Thompson shares cozy romantic photo with Megan Thee Stallion after dodging reporter’s question about their relationship","Vanessa Bryant shared a pair of endearing photos on her Instagram Story, cuddling with her tiny white puppy.

Klay Thompson shares a subtle Instagram post following a viral press moment



Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson’s romance stays strong



Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion are keeping the spark alive both online and off the court. Just days after the Dallas Mavericks star avoided a question about his romance during Media Day, he surprised fans with a set of intimate photos featuring the Grammy-winning rapper. The post, captioned “THE BEST THING IN LIFE IS LIFE,” offered a glimpse into their easy affection, marking another public show of love from the high-profile couple.The NBA veteran’s Instagram drop came shortly after a now-viral moment during Mavericks Media Day, when a reporter asked how his relationship with Megan Thee Stallion had influenced him “on and off the floor.”Klay Thompson initially appeared confused, repeating, “My relationship with?” before realizing the question’s intent. He quickly shut it down, replying, “I’m not going to talk about that, but I will say every summer hasn’t changed for me. Because I know what it takes to go the distance and there’s really no such thing as an off-season.”The response sparked mixed reactions online— some fans praised his privacy, while others noted the irony of his romantic post appearing so soon after. Still, Thompson’s guarded approach toward the media isn’t new.Known for his calm, introspective nature, the four-time NBA champion has often preferred answering with select words.The couple, who went public over the summer, seems unfazed by public scrutiny. Megan has also shared glimpses of their time together— from golf dates and yacht trips to charity events. Their first red carpet appearance came at Megan’s Pete & Thomas Foundation gala, where the rapper gushed about her boyfriend.""This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,"" she told Page Six. “I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite the media’s curiosity, the pair seems focused on balance. She is preparing for new music releases, and Thompson is for another NBA season. And Thompson’s recent post shows that he is not very comfortable discussing his private romantic life with reporters, but he will certainly celebrate his love with Stallion on social media.Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson quietly made their relationship public in early July 2025, sparking a wave of excitement online. The rapper first dropped a few swimsuit photos by a luxury pool, but fans quickly noticed the real detail— a man relaxing in the background who looked a lot like the Dallas Mavericks star. It didn’t take long before people started connecting the dots. Both Stallion and Thompson often share their sweet moments of togetherness on social media. They have previously shared their golfing and gym moments.Also Read: Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion's combined net worth: Exploring the power couple's career earnings, brand endorsements and more",Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion went public with their relationship over the summer.

Alex Ovechkin’s journey to greatness and the woman who stands beside him

Anastasia Shubskaya’s life before marriage: modeling, film, and family legacy

Ovechkin family: legacy of love and sport

For years, the famed Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin, now the all-time leading goal scorer of the NHL , has exerted his domination in the rink with power and laser-target precision. Behind his glories, there stands a woman who kept quietly weaving the other side of his world — that woman being Anastasia Shubskaya. Their love story is of perfect timing, of dedication, and of merged dreams, entwining sports, glamour, and family into one gifted tapestry.When, in April 2025, Alex Ovechkin came to surpass Wayne Gretzky's goal record, the hockey world cheered for the achievement and for the family who stood by his side with pride. Anastasia, as well as their two boys, Sergei and Ilya, were on the ice, amongst the cheering crowd, celebrating the man who had manifested greatness into a new vision.At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, they met for the first time, exchanged numbers, and lost contact with each other in no time. Social media fever rekindled the flame of their old acquaintance into something far more serious over a few years. The couple finally tied the knot in a private ceremony in Russia in 2016, followed by a grand reception in Moscow.Together, they have continued to forge stronger and deeper connections through each personal and professional milestone.Long before becoming Mrs. Ovechkin, Anastasia named herself in Russia. She, daughter of Vera Glagoleva, late actress and director-had a film and culture-packed upbringing. Studying at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, she entered modeling as well as film production. She was admired for her grace and force of presence in the several films and fashion campaigns she appeared in-had she not been overtly associated with her famous family. Long before the story of Ovechkin came into the public gaze, she was an embodiment of charm and ambition.The family life of the Ovechkin family reflects those values shared by the parents perfectly. Their sons, Sergei and Ilya, are very popular among the fans and often accompany their father to games. The name Sergei is in memory of Alex’s late brother and shows the depth of the player's commitment to family and honor.Alex himself comes from the highest sporting traditions. His mother, Tatyana Ovechkina, is a two-time Olympic gold medalist in basketball, and his late father, Mikhail Ovechkin, was a professional soccer player. The number 8 on Ovechkin's jersey derives from his mother, and with every goal he scores, he keeps close to his heart the memory of his brother Sergey.Ovechkin has been seen back in full-contact practices with the Caps; this was a true indication that he is quite spot-on, armed up for the 2025–26 NHL season, translated to the full participation of the NHL for the coming season.The remarkable achievement of Alex Ovechkin is made possible through both his ability with hockey and the unwavering love and support of Anastasia Shubskaya. From as far back as her model and film days, right through to life as a devoted wife and mother, she has remained a silent yet indispensable factor in hockey's greatest tale — the heart behind the legend.Also Read: Scott Laughton injury update: Maple Leafs forward expected to miss weeks of action",Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin married Anastasia Shubskaya in 2016.

Is Xavier Worthy playing in Week 5 of Monday Night Football against the Jacksonville Jaguars?

“Kansas City Chiefs had a little sort of injury scare, I would say. Yesterday, Xavier Worthy popped up on the injury report with an ankle, along with his shoulder. My understanding is kind of just turned his ankle a little bit, woke up swollen. They put it on the report. He is fine. He is expected to go. More of a precaution than anything else. Worthy has been excellent since he returned, playing with that torn labrum.”

“I'm told that while the Chiefs have Xavier Worthy listed as questionable (shoulder/ankle), the expectation is he will be okay for MNF against the Jaguars. We'll see how his body feels tomorrow, but KC is hopeful he'll be able to go.”

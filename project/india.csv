"Nipah under control in Bengal, says Centre as Thailand, Nepal step up screening",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nipah-under-control-in-bengal-says-centre-as-thailand-nepal-step-up-screening/articleshow/127675604.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry on Tuesday clarified that the Nipah virus situation in West Bengal is under control, with only two confirmed cases reported since December last year, even as Thailand and Nepal tightened health screening of passengers arriving from India as a precautionary measure.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said reports from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) show no additional Nipah Virus Disease cases beyond the two confirmed infections.Despite the limited case count, neighbouring countries have moved to heighten vigilance. Thailand has begun screening passengers at three international airports receiving flights from West Bengal, while Nepal has initiated checks at Kathmandu airport and major land border points with India.Nipah virus is a rare but highly fatal zoonotic infection that spreads from animals to humans and through close human contact. Naturally harboured by fruit bats (flying foxes), the virus can cause symptoms ranging from fever and respiratory illness to acute encephalitis, with a case fatality rate of 40–75%. There is no specific antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine, making early detection and strict infection control critical.The World Health Organization classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen due to its epidemic potential.Following confirmation of the two cases, the Centre, in coordination with the West Bengal government, activated comprehensive containment measures, including enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing and field investigations by central and state health teams.The ministry said 196 contacts linked to the cases were identified, traced, monitored and tested, with all found asymptomatic and negative. “These measures ensured timely containment, and no further spread has been detected,” it said.Health officials stressed that the screening measures adopted by Thailand and Nepal are precautionary, reflecting global sensitivity to Nipah’s high fatality rate rather than any escalation in India.“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health safeguards are in place,” the ministry said, urging the public and media to rely only on verified official information and avoid speculative reports.With no fresh cases detected and all contacts testing negative, authorities maintain that India’s response has been swift and effective, even as neighbouring countries err on the side of caution to prevent cross-border risk.",Nipah virus is a rare but highly fatal zoonotic infection that spreads from animals to humans and through close human contact.

First for India: Startup edges closer to launch of its inflatable Space habitat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-for-india-startup-edges-closer-to-launch-of-its-inflatable-space-habitat/articleshow/127669003.cms,"BENGALURU: A Bengaluru-based startup has moved a step closer towards launching an inflatable space habitat, a first for India, by completing key tests in Switzerland, enabled through its partners, including the European Space Agency (Esa).Akashlabdhi, a startup incubated at IISc, is now planning to launch a scaled-down version of the inflatable habitat, “AntarikshHAB”, designed for future human missions, in July. Conventional space habitats, like the International Space Station (ISS), have long grappled with issues of scalability, cost-efficiency, and limited living space.“Unlike what was done with ISS, or what is being planned for future space stations, AntarikshHAB can be launched as a compact habitat which will later inflate in space. In July, we will be launching a habitat that will be 70 cubic metres while the final habitat we are planning to develop will be around 300 cubic meters,” Akashlabdhi CEO Siddarth Jena told TOI.The July mission, to be launched aboard a vehicle provided by Spanish firm PLD Space, is designed as more than a brief technology demonstration. In addition to deploying the inflatable module in orbit, the plan includes a controlled de-orbit and atmospheric re-entry.“Post-flight inspection of recovered material is expected to yield data on degradation, survivability and end-of-life behaviour, areas that are increasingly important as regulators and space agencies stress responsible operations in low Earth orbit,” Jena said.For its programme, Akashlabdhi has collaborated with multiple European organisations, including Versuchsstollen Hagerbach (VSH) and the Amberg Group. “The programme is supported through grants and institutional participation from Esa and its partners, enabling the establishment of a dedicated Human Habitat Safety and Research & Development facility at VSH Hagerbach in Switzerland,” Jena said.The underground lab, operated by Amberg Group, provides a controlled environment with substantial natural rock overburden, allowing for realistic studies of radiation attenuation, structural integrity, isolation effects, and long-duration habitat performance under conditions that are difficult to replicate using surface-based facilities.“To advance our system to Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6), a comprehensive test campaign was conducted. This included pressure and leak-before-burst tests on multi-layer flexible structures, thermal cycling and accelerated ageing of materials, and impact testing to simulate micrometeoroid and orbital debris strikes. Repeated deployment trials have also been carried out to assess the reliability of restraint and inflation mechanisms,” Jena said.These activities are supported by an integrated sensor network feeding into a digital twin framework, enabling real-time correlation between measured performance and predictive safety models.“Academic and research participation forms a core pillar of the collaboration. On the Indian side, IISc, IIT-Roorkee, and IIT-Delhi are contributing expertise in space structures, materials, systems engineering, and human-centric design. Swiss participation includes ETH Zurich, EMPA, and the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), working alongside Esa-linked research activities to support materials science, radiation studies, and advanced validation methodologies,” Jena said.Akashalabdhi leads overall habitat architecture, systems engineering and mission design, while the Amberg Group brings decades of experience in underground safety engineering and certification-oriented testing. The partnership, both sides say, is an attempt to apply proven terrestrial safety principles to the emerging domain of orbital infrastructure.Felix Amberg, president of the board of Amberg Group, said: “The collaboration is an extension of established civil and underground engineering principles into the domain of space systems, highlighting the value of combining underground safety validation with orbital deployment and recovery.”Beyond the immediate technical goals, the project is also being seen as a marker of closer cooperation between India and Switzerland, and more broadly with EFTA nations, in high-technology research.","A Bengaluru-based startup has moved a step closer towards launching an inflatable space habitat, a first for India.

Why unions are striking

Government banks step in to limit disruption

Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on Tuesday as bank unions go ahead with a nationwide strike to press for the immediate implementation of a five-day work week.The strike has been called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions representing bank officers and employees, after conciliation meetings with the chief labour commissioner on January 22 and 23 failed to yield any assurance on their demand, union leaders said.With banks already closed on January 23 (Basant Panchami), January 24 (fourth Saturday), January 25 (Sunday) and January 26 (Republic Day), the strike on January 27 is expected to disrupt branch-level services for five consecutive days.“Despite detailed discussions during the conciliation proceedings, there was no assurance on our demand. Hence, we have been compelled to proceed with the strike action,” C H Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), a UFBU constituent, told PTI.Branch-level services such as cash deposits, withdrawals, cheque clearances and administrative work are expected to be hit at public sector lenders, including State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda.However, operations at major private sector banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are expected to remain largely unaffected, as their employees are not part of the unions participating in the strike.Digital banking services, including UPI, mobile and internet banking, will continue to function, though ATM cash availability could face localised issues due to logistical delays.The unions are demanding that all Saturdays be declared holidays, a proposal they say was agreed upon during the 12th Bipartite Settlement signed with the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in March 2024 but is yet to be notified by the government.“It is unfortunate that the government is not responding to our genuine demand. There would be no loss of man-hours as we have agreed to work an extra 40 minutes daily from Monday to Friday,” Rupam Roy, general secretary of the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), said.At present, banks remain open on the first, third and fifth Saturdays of every month.Union leaders said the strike was not aimed at inconveniencing customers. “This movement is not against customers, but for a sustainable, humane, and efficient banking system. A rested banker serves the nation better. A balanced workforce strengthens financial stability. 5-Day banking is not a luxury; it is an economic and human necessity,” L Chandrasekhar, general secretary of the National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), said.An urgent meeting was held on Monday under the chairmanship of the secretary, department of financial services, with the chairman of SBI, managing directors and CEOs of nationalised banks, and the chief executive of the IBA, sources told ANI.Banks were advised to take all necessary steps to ensure smooth functioning of customer services, digital channels, clearing and settlement systems, government business and services delivered through business correspondents.Sources said banks have conveyed that ATMs are being adequately loaded with sufficient cash and arrangements made for timely replenishment. While branch operations may be impacted, digital banking services are expected to remain available seamlessly.Several public sector banks, including SBI, have also informed stock exchanges about the possible impact.“We advise that while the bank has made necessary arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices on the day of strike, it is likely that work in the bank may be impacted by the strike,” SBI said in a regulatory filing on Friday.","Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on Tuesday as bank unions go ahead with a nationwide strike.

'Europe Will Retaliate': America's European Allies FIRE BACK At Trump Over Greenland Tariff Attack

US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent, accusing the ally’s legislature of failing to uphold its trade agreement with the United States.Trump added that South Korea’s legislature has not approved the trade deal he and President Lee Je Myung agreed to on July 30, 2025, and reaffirmed during his visit on October 29, 2025, questioning why it has not been ratified.""Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.""Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same,"" Trump added.South Korea has been moving to implement a deal announced with Washington in November aimed at reducing US tariffs on its exports. More recently, Seoul has been in talks with US officials to clarify its investigation into US-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N), which was launched following a major data leak, as cited by Reuters.South Korea is a key trading partner for the United States, consistently ranking among the top 10 sources of US imports. American companies and consumers import nearly $150 billion worth of goods from South Korea each year.In July, Trump announced a trade deal with South Korea’s president, but progress stalled for months amid disagreement over an investment pledge sought by the United States. The two leaders later finalized the agreement in October during Trump’s trip to Asia, including a commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States.In November, the White House and the South Korean government released a ""fact sheet"" outlining the deal, which was intended to move the agreement forward, as cited by NBC News.The agreement included reduced tariffs for both countries, capping US import duties at 15 per cent. This marked a rollback from the 25 per cent tariff rate announced earlier in 2025 on South Korea’s ""Liberation Day"" in April, a move that had unsettled markets.Trump’s latest tariff announcement follows at least three previous threats that were never carried out. These included a proposed 10 per cent tariff on Canada after Ontario ran an anti-tariff World Series ad, threatened tariffs on European countries over Greenland, and a 100 per cent tariff on Canada that was announced last week.","US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent.

‘Accident’ that wasn’t: Bengaluru techie crashes SUV twice to finish off friend; cops uncover chilling dashcam truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dashcam-shows-techie-ramming-suv-into-wall-killing-friend-clinging-to-car/articleshow/127583686.cms,"Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.





BENGALURU: What a passer-by reported as a road crash turned out to be bone-chilling act of murder on Ananthnagar Road in Electronics City late Sunday evening. The deceased, Prashanth M, 33, and accused, Roshan Hegde, 36, were friends, said police. Roshan works as a software engineer with a firm in Domlur.The murder came to light when M Narayana, DCP (Electronics City), noticed the car dashcam and ordered the footage to be examined. Police said Roshan intentionally crashed the SUV twice to kill Prashanth -- who was clinging to the front-left side of the car -- after driving for 600 metres.Prashanth was a resident of Veerasandra in Electronics City. Roshan is a resident of Vignananagar and a native of Udupi district.Based on a complaint by Prashanth's mother Anu, police have registered a murder case against Roshan.A passerby mistook the scene for a road crash and alerted police, following which, Roshan was rushed to a hospital. The case was initially treated as an accident until M Narayana, DCP (Electronics City), noticed the dashcam on the vehicle and ordered the footage to be examined.Dashcam footage revealed that Roshan had suddenly accelerated and deliberately rammed the vehicle, an SUV, first against a compound wall and then reversed and crashed it again against a tree.In the twin blows, victim Prashanth, who was clinging on the vehicle from outside, suffered serious injuries and died on the spot.""After confirming it was an intentional act, we went to the hospital where Roshan was undergoing treatment. Doctors informed us that his tongue was almost severed and that he underwent a minor surgery. He was discharged on Monday and was taken into custody for interrogation,"" Narayana told TOI.Police said a group of men had gathered to play cricket in Kammasandra on Sunday evening and later consumed alcohol. In a drunken stupor, Prashanth allegedly approached Roshan, seeking a lighter and abused him, triggering an argument. ""In a fit of rage, Roshan assaulted Prashanth and both attacked each other with beer bottles. As the situation escalated, Roshan got into his Tata Safari and tried to leave,"" the police officer said.As Roshan drove away, Prashanth jumped onto the SUV's left footboard and clung on to the front-left window. Dashcam footage showed Roshan initially driving around 35 kmph before accelerating on a deserted stretch, ramming the vehicle into a compound wall, reversing it, and crashing into a tree.Police said the dashcam also captured the two abusing and threatening each other, adding that Sunday's altercation was the fallout of a feud during a cricket match played Saturday.","Prashanth M, 33, and accused, Roshan Hegde, 36, were friends.

Decline of Himalayan rivers could trigger nuclear war: UK report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decline-of-himalayan-rivers-could-trigger-nuclear-war-uk-report/articleshow/127567910.cms,"ANI file photo

LONDON: The decline of rainforests and glacier-fed rivers could lead to global competition for food and water as early as the 2030s, UK intelligence chiefs have warned, adding that the decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, potentially leading to nuclear war The British govt report warns that ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions and “every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse”.There is a realistic possibility that some ecosystems (SE Asia coral reefs, boreal forests and the Himalayas) will start to collapse from 2030, and others (rainforests and mangroves) start to collapse from 2050, it states.“Severe degradation or collapse would drive displacement of millions, change global weather patterns, increase global food and water scarcity, and drive geopolitical competition for remaining resources,” the 14-page report said.The impacts will range from crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks to conflict within and between states. Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”"," decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan.

A century in uniform: Chandigarh girl carries 4 generations of Army service to Kartavya Path,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-century-in-uniform-chandigarh-girl-carries-4-generations-of-army-service-to-kartavya-path/articleshow/127567608.cms,"CHANDIGARH: A fourth-generation Army officer from Chandigarh, carrying a family legacy that stretches from the cavalry of the British Indian Army to post-Independence gallantry and modern-day integrated warfare, was among the commanding faces of this year’s Republic Day parade. Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path, a role that brought together her recent commissioning, a rare multi-decorated military lineage, and a contemporary operational showcase at the national ceremony.Commissioned into the Indian Army in 2021, Captain Buttar represents a rare continuity of service across four generations. Her great-grandfather served with the 4th Hodson’s Horse in the British Indian Army. Her grandfather, Brigadier Sampuran Singh, then a Lieutenant Colonel, earned the uncommon distinction of being awarded both the Mahavir Chakra and the Vir Chakra for his role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war. He later raised the 19 Punjab Regiment and remained in service until he passed away in 1971 due to battle casualties sustained during the 1965 conflict.The lineage continued with her father, Sarbjeet Singh, an officer of the 8 Mechanised Infantry. Captain Buttar is the only child in the family and the fourth successive generation to wear the uniform.She credits her early grounding in discipline to her schooling. “As a boarding school student, I knew no other way of life than discipline,” Captain Buttar said. “Routine, structure and accountability were part of everyday life, and that shaped how I approached responsibility.”At the Republic Day parade, Captain Buttar led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau, which depicted coordinated planning and operational control. The assignment placed her in command of a display reflecting how contemporary military operations are planned and executed through integrated systems rather than single-arm deployments.Captain Buttar is an alumna of Lawrence School, Sanawar, where she spent her formative years. She said the boarding school environment prepared her for the demands of uniformed service. “You learn to manage yourself early. That stays with you,” she said.She was commissioned into the Army in 2021 after completing her training at Officers Training Academy, Chennai. She pursued a degree in law from the Army Institute of Law, Mohali. She is currently pursuing a PhD from the same institution, focusing on the study of military law in India.Captain Buttar’s presence at the Republic Day parade brought together region’s contemporary contribution to the Army and a family history that has moved with the institution itself- from colonial cavalry regiments and post-Independence infantry formations to today’s integrated operational doctrine.","Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path.

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

'Never Defied Cong In Parliament': 'Unapologetic' Shashi Tharoor Defends Modi Praise, Sindoor Stand

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who recently missed a crucial party meeting, sparking speculation about his future with the grand old party, missed another one on Tuesday, but stated he received the invitation at a very short notice, by when he had already made plans for a visit to Dubai.""As for not attending today's meeting, the invitation came only yesterday or the day before, by which time my travel plans were already finalised. With Parliament in session, I had booked my ticket directly from Dubai to Delhi,"" he told reporters.With the Budget session of Parliament starting on Wednesday, Congress legislative party (CPP) chairperson and former party chief Sonia Gandhi convened a meeting of the Congress' parliamentary strategy group at her residence to decide on the issues to be raised during the session.Sources confirmed that Tharoor, the four-time Thiruvananthapuram MP who has held the seat since 2009, could not attend the meeting as he was returning from Dubai. They added that the former diplomat had informed the party in advance about his inability to be present.Meanwhile, Tharoor said he would convey his ""issues"" directly to the Congress top leadership.""Whatever issues I need to raise, I will convey them directly to the party leadership.There is no doubt that I will get that opportunity, especially since everyone will be together during the Parliament session,"" he added.In recent months, Tharoor's repeated praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government has irked the Congress, leading to him being ""sidelined"" from party affairs. He has been particularly vocal in his support for the government on Operation Sindoor , the five-day India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025. On the other hand, the Congress has sought to corner the Centre over alleged losses of Indian fighter jets during the conflict and US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating the truce between the two nuclear-armed rivals.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor recently missed a crucial party meeting, sparking speculation about his future with the grand old party.

Diplomacy Meets Fashion: EU Chief Ursula Dons Traditional Indian Bandhgala At Republic Day Parade

What is Eri silk?

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen drew wide attention on social media after they were seen twinning in a traditional Eri silk scarf during her visit to India.The silk scarf, also known as Eri silk or “Ahimsa silk,” featured elephant motifs and colour-blocked patterns. Ursula along with European Council president Antonio Costa came to India as chief guest for the Republic Day celebrations India and the European Union also announced a landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) after nearly 18 years of negotiations.Sharing her thoughts on X, von der Leyen highlighted the significance of the moment and the broader partnership between the two sides.“Europe and India are making history today. We have concluded the mother of all deals. We have created a free trade zone of two billion people, with both sides set to benefit. This is only the beginning. We will grow our strategic relationship to be even stronger,” she wrote.The India-EU FTA, billed by the EU president as the “mother of all deals,” aims to deepen economic ties, reduce trade barriers and create one of the world’s largest free trade zones.The agreement was announced following summit-level talks between Prime Minister Modi and leaders of the 27-nation bloc.The cultural symbolism of the visit was also underscored ahead of Republic Day. Earlier, President Droupadi Murmu shared a video of the specially designed ‘At Home’ invitation sent to guests, which celebrated the living traditions of India’s North Eastern region.In a post on X, the President said the invitation was a tribute to the skilled artisans and craftspeople of the Ashtalakshmi states. “The invitation kit this year celebrates the living traditions of India’s North Eastern Region. This invitation is a tribute to the skilled artisans and craftspersons of the Ashtalakshmi states.”Eri silk, which featured prominently during the visit, holds deep cultural and ethical significance. Native to Assam, it is produced without killing the silkworm, earning it the name “Ahimsa silk.”Known for its warmth, durability and eco-friendly production, Eri silk is traditionally worn during festivals such as Magh Bihu and is closely linked to village life and women-led weaving practices.",PM Narendra Modi and EU President Ursula von der Leyen twinned in a traditional Eri silk scarf during her visit to India.

Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through ‘lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

While his fan base is large and organized, the success of TVK hinges on converting this popularity into votes, a challenge that has tripped up other stars.

Can TVK convert fan frenzy into votes?

Ghost of the Karur stampede

Possibilities for TVK

NEW DELHI: When Prashant Kishor entered Bihar’s electoral arena with Jan Suraaj, he set out to challenge the state’s entrenched caste politics with a different pitch — one centred on governance failures, migration and the promise of jobs. The message found an audience. The votes, however, did not follow.Kishor’s transition from celebrated strategist to politician fell short, highlighting just how hard it is for political outsiders to break through systems built on long-standing loyalties and social networks.A case in contrast was Arvind Kejriwal, who left his government job and formed the Aam Aadmi Party after the successful India Against Corruption campaign.Kejriwal made his mark in his first electoral outing by winning 28 out of 70 seats, and thereafter, in subsequent elections, he went on to sweep the Delhi Assembly.As Tamil Nadu prepares for another assembly election, a familiar outsider story is taking shape once again. Actor Vijay Thalapathy has positioned himself as an alternative for the people in a state where politics, for a very long time, has revolved around the Dravida Munnetra Kashagan (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).But will Vijay face the same fate as Prashant Kishor, or will he do a Kejriwal? There is one key difference. This is Tamil Nadu — a state where cinema does not merely entertain, but also governs.Film stars are worshipped like gods in Tamil Nadu. Before the screening of their films, fans offer milk baths on towering cut-outs of these stars. Many stars even have temples across the state.This level of popularity could be one of the reasons that motivates these stars to pivot to politics and attempt to transform their fan base into a voter base. The best examples are M G Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa, who withdrew from active stardom and went on to occupy the top job in the state. While MGR served as chief minister of Tamil Nadu for more than a decade, Jayalalithaa was chief minister for over 14 years across six terms.Similarly, several other actors like Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Sivaji Ganesan and Vijayakanth have experimented with politics and turned into full-time politicians.However, many stars were unable to convert their stardom into votes and fell flat during polls.Kamal Haasan launched his party - Makkal Needhi Maiam - in February 2018, positioning it as a centrist, non-Dravidian alternative to the DMK and AIADMK. However, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party failed to win a single seat. In the 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly elections, Kamal Haasan himself contested from Coimbatore South but lost to the BJP.Additionally, MNM could garner only a little over 2.6 per cent of the statewide vote, as per electoral records.In March 2024, MNM joined the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance ahead of the general elections, choosing alliance-building over ideological isolation. Haasan was subsequently offered a Rajya Sabha seat as part of the alliance’s power-sharing arrangement.Rajinikanth, too, had made a euphoric announcement to his fans that he would launch a political party, claiming that his outfit would contest all 234 assembly seats in the state.However, he soon made a U-turn and dropped the plan to take the plunge into politics, citing health concerns.“With extreme sadness, I say that I can’t enter politics. I alone know the pain I went through while announcing this decision,” Rajinikanth said in a three-page statement.“Without entering electoral politics, I will serve the people. This decision of mine will disappoint my fans and people, but please forgive me,” he added.Unlike Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, Vijay has decided to bid farewell to films after a long career spanning 33 years.His upcoming film Jana Nayagan (if released) would be his last.“Politics is not a time pass for me. It is a deep quest. I wish to immerse myself completely in politics. I have decided to dedicate myself entirely to the service of the people after completing my responsibilities towards one more film I have signed up for,” the 51-year-old Vijay said.Meanwhile, actors like Kamal Haasan and Vijayakanth had to face unfavourable electoral results after deciding to remain active in both films and politics.By stepping away from cinema altogether, Vijay is attempting to address a credibility gap that has historically hurt actor-politicians. Full-time political commitment — rather than episodic engagement between film releases — has often been a prerequisite for voter trust in Tamil Nadu, as demonstrated by stalwarts like MGR and Jayalalithaa in the state.Ahead of the upcoming elections, TVK has been successful in pulling crowds. In October 2024, TVK drew over 8 lakh people during its first state conference in Vikravandi.Thousands of people attend Vijay’s rallies to hear him speak or catch a glimpse of him. The superstar has supporters across every class, gender and age group in different regions of Tamil Nadu.Unlike many film stars, Vijay’s supporters are organised and politically active. In the 2021 local body polls, his “fan club” candidates won 115 of the 169 seats they contested.Meanwhile, his fan clubs have also taken on the role of foot soldiers on social media and regularly conduct blood-donation camps, free medical check-ups, education support drives and disaster-relief work.Additionally, TVK has a significant social media presence. Vijay has claimed that his party has the largest social media force in India.“TVK’s social media army is the biggest in India — not just our claim, but what others are saying after witnessing it. You are no longer just fans on social media; you are TVK’s virtual warriors,” he had said.Yet, Tamil Nadu’s electoral history suggests that crowd mobilisation does not automatically translate into seat conversion. Booth-level organisation, caste arithmetic and alliance mathematics continue to play a decisive role — factors that even popular actors have struggled to master in their first electoral outings.After the Karur stampede, Vijay’s die-hard fans defended him and his party even after the top leadership of TVK went off the radar.However, Vijay and his party may also have to bear the brunt of the stampede in Karur, which claimed 41 lives. Both the AIADMK and DMK have pinned the blame on TVK functionaries and accused Vijay of mismanagement that allegedly led to chaos in September last year.Moreover, the CBI is also grilling Vijay over the stampede, taking up a significant chunk of his time that could otherwise have been used for pre-poll strategy or campaigning.On January 19, the central probing agency questioned the TVK chief for over six hours at its headquarters in New Delhi for the second time in connection with the stampede case.According to officials, several questions related to decision-making about the rally, reasons for his delay, continuation of the speech, his knowledge of the chaos, turnout and crowd mismanagement were put to him.The call on attributing responsibility to individuals in the chargesheet will be taken only after a thorough analysis of the statements of the actor, senior political officials of his party, and police and district administration officials involved in granting clearance and managing the rally, they said.Politically, the impact of the probe remains ambiguous. While rival parties have sought to frame the stampede as evidence of administrative inexperience, sections of Vijay’s support base view the investigation as pressure politics — a narrative that could either erode confidence or consolidate sympathy, depending on how the case unfolds closer to polling.Since Independence — barring a brief stint of Congress rule — the chief minister’s post in Tamil Nadu has largely alternated between the two Dravidian parties — DMK and AIADMK. Vijay’s entry into state politics as a challenger has given voters a third option.At the same time, Vijay’s emergence has introduced new calculations for both the DMK and AIADMK. While the DMK appears wary of losing sections of its youth and urban vote, the AIADMK is closely watching whether TVK dents its traditional base or cuts deeper into the ruling party’s support.Amid reports that the BJP has been pressuring him to join the NDA — citing the CBI inquiry into the Karur stampede and the CBFC sitting on the certification of his film Jana Nayakan — Vijay has said he will not give in to any pressure.He said TVK would contest the assembly elections on its own and win if other parties chose not to align with it. “Unlike the party that ruled and the one that is ruling, we will not allow corruption … I won’t touch a paisa, you know that I don’t need to touch that,” Vijay said, asking his party functionaries and cadres to be as clean.Cleaning up the system cannot be done overnight, he said, adding, “It’s a process.”Even if TVK were to emerge only as the third-largest party, its presence could still alter Tamil Nadu’s political arithmetic. In a fractured mandate, a strong TVK showing could place Vijay in the role of a potential kingmaker — reshaping alliances and bargaining power within the state.In a tripartite contest, it will be interesting to see whether Vijay can emerge as a winner — or whether his entry ends up splitting votes to the advantage or disadvantage of the DMK or AIADMK.Just as the box office determines whether a film is a hit or a flop, election results will reveal whether Vijay succeeds or fails in his political endeavour.","Actor Vijay Thalapathy has launched a political party, TVK, in Tamil Nadu. The actor has decided to quit films after 33 years to enter politics. Tamil Nadu politics has been dominated by the Dravida Munnetra Kashagan (DMK)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127623112,imgsize-855573,width-400,resizemode-4/127623112.jpg"

Bouncing Back From Failure

BENGALURU: India was to ring in its 2026 space calendar with a launch that quietly captured the direction the sector is now taking. The PSLV-C62, carrying a clear private sector imprint, however, failed on Jan 12. Notwithstanding that setback, 2026 is still shaping up as the year when India’s private sector can show results in orbit.Just eight days after the PSLV mission, the country’s first Earth Observation Satellite System (EOSS) under PPP saw a key milestone with the signing of a concession agreement that allows the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground, four months after it won the project from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe)The agreement was between IN-SPACe and Allied Orbits — the special purpose vehicle (SPV) created by the consortium of Pixxel Space, Piersight Space, Satsure Analytics India, and Dhruva Space — at the former’s office in Bengaluru.TOI reported earlier in Aug 2025 that the Pixxel-led consortium had won the project through a “zero-bid”. While the concession agreement was to be signed within three months, delay in processes saw it signed on Jan 20.The project will create a constellation of 12 satellites, data from which will be used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture, infrastructure planning, maritime operations, and national security, where there are huge gaps so far as having eyes in the sky is concerned.The consortium will implement the project through Allied Orbits. “As part of the project, PierSight will build synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, Pixxel will build hyperspectral & high resolution optical satellite, Satsure will make multispectral satellites and Dhruva will develop ground stations,” Gaurav Seth, Piersight CEO and co-founder told TOI.Pixxel CEO Awais Ahmed toldthat their firm was “implementing 60% of the project and investing the same amount to boot.""“Of the 12 satellites, seven will come from Pixxel, three from SatSure and two from PierSight,” Awais said, adding that Pixxel will build two types of satellites: Five of them will be ultra high-res submeter satellite and two will be hyperspectral satellites.Over the next four to five years, the consortium is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore to create the 12-satellite constellation in low-Earth orbit. The project is designed to enhance India’s data sovereignty and reduce dependence on foreign imagery. All satellites will be manufactured in India, launched on Indian rockets, and controlled from ground infrastructure within the country.Aside from this, three private entities will also produce 31 satellites as part of the space-based surveillance (SBS) programme for India’s strategic needs to be used by national security agencies.This is the first time that private industry will be developing satellites for strategic needs. The current SBS programme — built upon the earlier avatars that have seen satellites from the Cartosat and Risat families — will further enhance India’s space surveillance capabilities and see a total of 52 satellites in both geostationary orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO).Twenty-one of these satellites will be developed by Isro and the other 31 will come from the private sector. Together, the project is to cost an estimated Rs 26,000-Rs 27,000 crore — this is expected to be revised.The latest iteration marks a substantial upgrade from its predecessors, incorporating artificial intelligence to enable unprecedented satellite interaction and intelligence gathering.A key innovation of the current SBS will be its integrated network of satellites positioned in both LEO and GEO. This dual-layer system will allow for dynamic cooperation between satellites, with GEO satellites at 36,000km able to detect activities and direct LEO satellites at 400-600km to provide detailed observations.The programme is expected to allocate dedicated satellites to support land, sea, and air-based missions across India’s military services, enhancing the nation’s defense capabilities.At a time India’s aspirations of having a sustainable human presence in space is taking shape in the form of Gaganyaan and Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS) programmes, Bengaluru start-up Akashalabdhi is working on an “expandable space habitat”.A prototype model of the habitat dubbed ‘Antariksh HAB’ is ready. The final version is being designed to accommodate six to 16 personnel and will have an innovative structure that promises superior protection against orbital debris and radiation while boasting versatility.Beyond this single launch, 2026 is expected to see the first large-scale realisation of India’s private launch ambitions.Skyroot Aerospace remains among the most closely watched startups. In late 2025, the company unveiled its Vikram-I orbital rocket along with its “Infinity Campus” in Hyderabad, a facility designed to support parallel rocket design, manufacturing and testing.In 2026, Skyroot aims to conduct its first commercial orbital launch, placing small satellites into low-Earth orbit. The company has indicated an initial cadence of one launch every three months, with plans to scale to monthly missions by 2027. Revenue generation is expected to begin once regular commercial operations are established.Success would mark a turning point: India’s first privately built orbital rocket, launched from Indian soil, carrying paying customer payloads rather than experimental technology demonstrators.Agnikul Cosmos, based in Chennai, is pursuing a different approach. Its launch vehicles are built around modular architectures and patented upper-stage designs that could double as orbital payloads. Internally, the company is targeting monthly launches once its first orbital mission is completed.Agnikul’s emphasis is on adaptability and production efficiency, with engines and stages designed for rapid manufacturing and lower per-mission costs, a potential advantage in an increasingly crowded global small-satellite launch market.Digantara operates in a niche that is gaining urgency worldwide: space domain awareness and orbital intelligence.The company specialises in tracking resident space objects, including debris and active satellites, using its own spacecraft, ground networks and data platforms. In 2025, it launched its first commercial space surveillance satellite, SCOT.In 2026, Digantara plans to deploy at least eight more satellites, primarily through rideshare missions on vehicles such as SpaceX’s Transporter series. It is also close to operationalising a ground-based telescope in India.As low-Earth orbit becomes more congested, such capabilities are increasingly critical, not only for commercial operators but also for defence and civil authorities responsible for collision avoidance and orbital safety.Bellatrix Aerospace has evolved from an early focus on launch vehicles to concentrate on propulsion systems and orbital transport technologies. Its portfolio includes electric propulsion thrusters for small satellites and an orbital transfer vehicle capable of repositioning spacecraft after launch.Recently, Bellatrix and Digantara both entered partnerships with Japan’s Astroscale, a global leader in debris removal and orbital servicing. These collaborations reflect how Indian hardware startups are increasingly plugging into international technology ecosystems.For satellite operators, such propulsion and servicing systems could become essential, enabling low-cost manoeuvring, orbit changes and mission life extension.India’s Earth observation (EO) sector is also entering a new phase. IN-SPACe’s Build–Own–Operate framework began transitioning into implementation in 2025, signalling a shift in how satellite infrastructure and data services are commercialised. It is under this push that Allied Orbits was formed.Separately, Pixxel has already placed its first private batch of hyperspectral imaging satellites in orbit through its Firefly series, serving agriculture, environmental monitoring and resource analysis.Other firms, including Satellize and Grahaa Space, are working on satellite manufacturing and data services, such as near-real-time geospatial video, which could serve both commercial users and strategic agencies.On the launch side, public–private partnership models are beginning to take concrete shape. The LVM-3 heavy-lift programme is being scaled with deeper industry involvement to support future commercial missions.The first PSLV manufactured by a HAL–L&T-led consortium is expected to fly in early 2026, marking a milestone in the industrialisation of India’s launch vehicle production.Technology transfer agreements for the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), and eventually for PSLV manufacturing, are also expected to progress, as part of broader privatisation plans. On Jan 8, Dept of Space issued an EoI inviting industries to build the first module of the proposed Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS).Together, these steps point to a deliberate shift from a research-centric model to a market-driven space economy.Industry associations argue that private momentum will need stronger public backing to sustain scale. The Satcom Industry Association-India (SIA-India), in three coordinated pre-budget submissions prepared in collaboration with KPMG, pointed out that India’s public spending on space, at about 0.04% of GDP, remains well below global norms.It recommended a phased increase to levels closer to the 0.12% seen in leading spacefaring nations, with predictable support for launch capability, satellite constellations, navigation systems and testing infrastructure.SIA-India president Subba Rao Pavuluri said: “From secure communications and navigation to climate systems, launch infrastructure and disaster resilience, every layer of our national architecture now depends on space assets. Granting space the status of critical infrastructure and decisively expanding public investment is essential if we are to match our strategic aspirations and secure our leadership in the Indo-Pacific. ”The Indian Space Association (ISpA) echoed the sense of transition. “Private space startups in India raised nearly $150 million during FY 2025 taking the total funding to over $617 million till date… India’s space sector is moving firmly into an execution-led phase. While challenges remain in manufacturing scale, long-term capital access, and assured demand, the year established a clear foundation for sustained growth, deeper industry participation, and India’s expanding role in the global space economy,” said ISpA director-general Lt Gen (retd) A K Bhatt.Among the 15 satellites onboard PSLV-C62, 13 were from private industry, highlighting how commercial payloads are now becoming the norm rather than the exception on Indian launch vehicles. And the Indian companies that had their payloads and deployers on the rocket are also expected to bounce back.Dhruva Space, whose Polar Access-1 (PA-1), a structured launch programme that would have enabled 10 satellite deployments serving multiple Indian states and international customers, was lost, will aim to get back to orbit.One of the most closely watched payloads on the mission was AyulSat, built by OrbitAID Aerospace. The satellite was designed to demonstrate a technology that would eventually allow the firm to conduct a full-fledged on-orbit refuelling, a capability that could change how satellites are operated and maintained.Now, the firm is looking at launching both the target, and the chaser satellites together sometime later this year.","The PSLV-C62, carrying a clear private sector imprint, however, failed on Jan 12. 2026 is still shaping up as the year when India’s private sector can show results in orbit. The project will create a constellation of 12 satellites, used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127612092,imgsize-96772,width-400,resizemode-4/isros-pslv-c62-mission.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said, even as interest from British and Canadian universities gathers pace under India's liberalised foreign education regime. Officials said that colleges under the University of London and several Canadian universities have also conveyed keenness, with preliminary discussions underway.The momentum follows policy changes that have opened India's higher education sector to foreign universities. The National Education Policy, 2020 first articulated the case for allowing top global institutions to operate locally, and this was operationalised in 2023 through UGC regulations. The rules allow eligible foreign universities to establish independent campuses, design curricula and set admission norms, marking a decisive shift from earlier partnership-only models.There are foreign universities already running physical campuses in India - Australia's Deakin University and University of Wollongong at Gujarat's GIFT City, and the UK's University of Southampton in Gurgaon. These campuses offer programmes in high-demand areas such as STEM and management, and have demonstrated that overseas institutions can operate within India's regulatory ecosystem.University of Liverpool, University of York and University of Aberdeen, among others are working towards similar operations.Against this backdrop, Purdue University's proposed India campus is being seen as a major credibility boost for the foreign university policy. Sources said discussions have reached an advanced stage, with talks focused on academic offerings, regulatory compliance and operational frameworks. Govt officials indicated that the plan is for Purdue to offer its flagship engineering and technology programmes in India, allowing students to earn a Purdue degree without having to study overseas.","Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said.

Ukrainian Envoy Hails PM Modi As Global Leader, Praises Ukraine Peace Efforts

NEW DELHI: After co-chairing the India-EU summit PM Narendra Modi said India and the EU were natural partners in a changing world and remained committed to strengthening multilateralism. However, Russia’s Ukraine war remained a vexing issue as the EU said it was counting on Modi’s support to end the conflict.European Council President Antonio Costa said in his media statement that the summit reaffirmed their commitment to supporting efforts towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, one that fully respects Ukraine’s “independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity”.“This is a key moment. We are supporting all efforts to reach a just and sustainable peace. Ukraine has shown its readiness, including at the cost of difficult compromises. I know, dear Prime Minister, that we can count on you to help create the conditions for peace, through dialogue and diplomacy,” said Costa, addressing Modi at the joint media event.India’s ties with Russia have been a thorn in the side of the EU since the beginning of the conflict but Brussels didn’t allow it to stand in the way of the grounbreaking trade and defence pacts with India, recognising the need to work with New Delhi in a world marred by unpredictability and disruptions.The EU is also learnt to have urged India to provide more humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.Modi said in his own statement that the global order is undergoing profound turbulence and in that context the partnership between India and the EU will strengthen stability within the international system. “Against this backdrop, we held detailed discussions today on several global issues, including Ukraine, West Asia, and the Indo-Pacific,” said the PM, adding that respect for multilateralism and international norms remained a shared priority.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said EU leaders expressed their concerns about the conflict and the PM indicated to them he had been in close touch with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders. “We favor a negotiated solution between the parties most closely concerned with this conflict. The PM himself has advocated this to both leaders. He has publicly stated that India is ready to do whatever is needed to support the outcomes from such a negotiated solution. And that we are interested in seeing the earliest possible cessation of this conflict,” said Misri.The leaders also discussed the Gaza situation, calling for a just and lasting solution, based on the implementation of the two-State solution, through dialogue and diplomacy.According to the joint statement, they noted the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution 2803 of 17 November 2025 which welcomes the establishment of the Board of Peace and authorizes an International Stabilisation Force, as outlined in the Comprehensive Plan, as a step forward to end the Gaza conflict.Both India and the EU have reservations about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace initiative which, unlike what is mandated by the resolution, will look to resolve conflicts all over the world and not just Gaza.In the statement, Modi and the EU leaders encouraged all parties to implement the resolution in its entirety, in line with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions. “Both sides restated their readiness to support efforts towards just and durable peace and stressed the need for unhindered humanitarian access,” said the joint statement.","PM Narendra Modi said India and the EU were natural partners in a changing world.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah lost his cool during a rally in Bengaluru on Tuesday after some youth Congress leaders started shouting slogans in favour of deputy CM DK Shivakumar before his address.As he rose from his chair and walked towards the podium, a section of party workers began shouting “DK, DK,” with the chants growing louder by the second.Visibly irritated, Sidda snapped at the crowd and asked them to maintain silence, but his appeal went unheeded, prompting him to angrily demand to know who was raising the slogans.""Who are those shouting ‘DK, DK’,"" an irked Siddaramaiah asked the Congress leaders.The situation forced the event’s compere to intervene, publicly warning Youth Congress leaders to stop interrupting the chief minister and listen quietly.""The Youth Congress leaders should keep quiet.

Siddaramaiah has sought to project confidence, asserting that he has the backing of the leadership and is certain of completing the full five-year term as chief minister, signalling his intent to shut down speculation over a possible leadership change.","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah lost his cool during a rally in Bengaluru on Tuesday.

.

NEW DELHI: Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids of up to 48% less than the estimated project cost, largely due to aggressive bidding, which usually has a direct bearing on the quality of work.In a recent case, the road transport ministry cancelled a tender for a project in Manipur as the contractor with the lowest bid quoted 47% less than the cost the ministry had estimated. The contractor challenged the bid cancellation in Gauhati high court, and the court ordered an interim stay. ""This case is a classic example of how highway agencies are caught in the middle. Highway contractors are getting projects quoting low bids arguing they have quoted price after carrying out detailed assessment,"" said an official.Data since April 2023 showed that because of less number of projects being offered, there is fierce competition among bidders. For each tender, the number of bidders is in the range of seven to 19.Officials and industry insiders said that while there has been a huge increase in the number of highway contractors in the past 7-8 years, with govt rolling out a large number of projects and also bringing down the qualification criteria, there has been a significant fall in the number of works being bid.""This has resulted in players quoting low bids to ensure that their manpower and machinery do not lie idle, which causes further financial stress. This trend will hurt the sector and quality of work as well since we can't reject a lowest cost or L1 bid in construction works,"" said another official.The details of some of the low quoted bids since 2023-24 showed that a project in Madhya Pradesh - four-laning of Rahatgarh to Berkhedi - was bid out at Rs 324 crore, which was 48.4% less than NHAI's bid cost of Rs 627 crore. In the case of another project in Maharashtra - augmentation of existing stretch in urban areas of Pune on the Pune-Satara section - was bid out at Rs 321 crore, around 46% less than the project cost estimated by the highway authority.Similarly, the work for four-laning from Dareota to Kalar Bala in Himachal Pradesh was tendered at Rs 435 crore against NHAI's project cost of Rs 734 crore this year, which was around 41% less.","Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids.

UGC Equity Regulations Explained: What Exists What Changed And Why It Has Sparked Protests

New Delhi: As University Grants Commission’s regulation on promotion of equity in higher educational institutions has stirred a huge debate with a few sections split along the caste divide, a petition has been filed in the apex court for declaring it illegal and unconstitutional for being discriminatory and not covering harassment of non-SC/ST/OBC students.UGC framed the law on the suggestion of the apex court to put in place a mechanism to prevent ragging, sexual harassment, and discrimination on the basis of caste, gender, and disability in educational institutions.The bone of contention is its Section 3(1)(c) which says “caste-based discrimination’’ is against members of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other backward classes. The petition sought SC’s intervention to direct UGC and the Centre to ensure everything prescribed under the regulation, be caste-neutral and not only for SC/ST/OBC.",University Grants Commission’s regulation on promotion of equity in higher educational institutions has stirred a huge debate with a few sections split along the caste divide.

Census 2027 To Kick Off As Government Seeks Data On Homes, Food, Internet And How India Lives Today

New Delhi: The home ministry on Tuesday countered the ""deliberate misinformation campaign"" by the opposition painting the govt as non-serious about caste enumeration, based merely on the Census 2027 ""houselisting"" questionnaire notified last week, despite govt's well-known public stand that caste will be captured in the second stage of the census, that is, population enumeration phase due in Feb next year, that is 2027.Sources said that the sequencing is not something new and recalled that the questionnaire for population enumeration stage of Census 2011 was notified by the then UPA govt only towards the end of the first stage of the census - the ""houselisting and housing"" phase held from April 1 to Sept 30, 2010. As per the notification issued on Aug 31, 2010, a total of 29 questions were listed for the census officer to collect information from persons within his or her area, through the housing schedule.The ""houselisting"" schedule or questionnaire for Census 2011, notified on Feb 25, 2010, had listed 30 questions, unlike 33 questions included in the Census 2027 ""housing"" schedule notified on Jan 22.""Full information on Census 2027 was put out in a press statement dated Dec 12, 2025. Yet, some people are intentionally trying to spread falsehoods about Census 2027, particularly the caste census,"" the home ministry spokesperson said on X a day after Congress's Jairam Ramesh reiterated his allegation questioning the govt's intent to conduct a caste-wise enumeration.""It has been clearly outlined that Census 2027 shall be conducted in two phases, with the caste census due only in the second phase. This two-stage schedule - the first stage being 'houselisting and housing phase' and second, 'population enumeration' - replicates the practice followed in all previous censuses,"" ministry said while attaching its Dec 2025 press statement put out after the Union cabinet approved a proposal to conduct Census 2027 at a cost of Rs 11,718 crore.Sources said the questions to be asked during the population enumeration phase in Feb 2027, including those intended at recording a respondent's caste, may be notified only in Aug or Sept this year.In fact, the questionnaire for the second stage of Census 2021 was yet to be notified when the Covid pandemic forced its postponement days before it was scheduled to start on Apr 1, 2020.","The home ministry on Tuesday countered the ""deliberate misinformation campaign"" by the opposition.

The court said it was needed to ensure that judicial proceedings were not misused ""to settle a score"".While interpreting section 175 of Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan said that the section was somewhat confusing and needed judicial interpretation.""Suffice it to record at the outset that BNSS being a statute of recent origin, which has been enacted after exactly half a century of its precursor (CrPC), governing the field of criminal procedure, one would have expected the legislative drafting thereof to be of the highest order with clear expression of the will of the people. Sadly, Section 175 BNSS is somewhat confusing and requires ironing out the creases in the legislation without altering the material of which it is woven,"" the bench said.The court said the legislative intention behind insertion of sub-section (4) of Section 175 was clear: Parliament intended it as an additional safeguard for public servants when a complaint was made against them. ""Cognizant of practical realities and to prevent false or frivolous allegations, it appears to us that the mandate is to obtain a report from the accused public servant's superior officer and to extend to such a public servant an opportunity to explain his side of the story.While society's interest is served by prosecuting offenders, it is equally vital, if not more, to ensure that prosecution is not launched against individuals, including public servants, to settle a score or wreak vengeance or put them in such an awkward position that it becomes difficult for them to act in a similar future occasion. The responsibility, nay duty, after all, is not just to pursue the actual culprit, but also to protect the innocent from being falsely implicated, wrongly accused and unnecessarily victimised,"" it said.Section 175(4) says any judicial magistrate empowered under Section 210 may, upon receiving a complaint against a public servant arising in course of the discharge of his official duties, take cognizance, subject to - (a) receiving a report containing facts and circumstances of the incident from the officer superior to him; and (b) after consideration of the assertions made by the public servant as to the situation that led to the incident so alleged.The court said sub-section (4) was not an independent provision but operated subject to the procedural safeguards that sub-section (3) embodied, including the requirement that the application be supported by an affidavit.","Supreme Court rules that complaint must be backed by an affidavit.

In his complaint, Dr Babu urged the ministry to take action against NMC members who took ""an illegal decision"" in 2021 to return appeals filed by patients claiming that NMC Act did not allow them to appeal.In Oct 2021, NMC's Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) had decided that in keeping with NMC Act, 2019, ""only medical practitioners or professionals should be allowed as (sic) appeals before EMRB"". Section 30(3) of NMC Act states that medical professionals aggrieved by state council decisions can appeal.Though nothing in the section expressly bars patients from filing appeals, EMRB inserted the word ""only"" medical practitioners into its reading of the section in its Oct 2021 meeting.""Ever since NMC was formed, they have been rejecting, on average, one patient appeal every week, 256 rejections in more than five years. There is no explicit provision in NMC Act which bars the hearing of appeals from the public. If anything, the act clearly mandates that NMC is to adopt earlier statutory provisions of MCI. Rejecting patient appeals has been illegal right from the start. Moreover, in 2024, in the 16th meeting of NMC it was agreed that all appeals received by EMRB will be entertained. However, EMRB has continued to reject appeals coming to it,"" said Dr Babu.The draft amendment of NMC Act put in public domain by health ministry in Dec 2022 contains a provision that explicitly provides for the public to file appeals before NMC's EMRB against decisions of state councils in complaints related to medical negligence or professional misconduct.

Not a single case of halala has been reported in Uttarakhand since the implementation of the UCC, and that is why Muslim women have welcomed this law.""The chief minister, however, also said that some cases of polygamy have been reported in the state, and the strictest action will be taken against them.Uttarakhand is the first state in the country to implement the UCC.Dhami said that for decades after independence, due to ""vote bank politics"", no one dared to implement the UCC, while a uniform code is already in force in all developed and civilised countries, including major Muslim nations.He said that all the framers of the Constitution, including Baba Saheb Ambedkar, had included the UCC in the Directive Principles of State Policy under Article 44 of the Constitution.Dhami said that before the 2022 Assembly elections, he had promised to bring the UCC, and the public supported him on this.Dhami said that work started as soon as the new government was formed, and after completing all the procedures, it was implemented on January 27, 2025.Describing this day as a ""golden chapter"" in the history of Uttarakhand, he said that it was a matter of immense personal pride for him that he had successfully implemented the law.The chief minister reiterated that the UCC is not against any religion or sect, but rather a legal effort to eliminate social evils and establish ""equality and harmony"" among all citizens.He said, ""Through this law, the fundamental beliefs and practices of any religion have not been changed; only the harmful practices have been removed.""Dhami said that the state government recently brought an ordinance related to necessary amendments in the UCC, under which there is a provision to annul marriages if a person conceals their identity or provides false information at the time of marriage.He said that, along with this, strict punitive provisions have been ensured for any kind of force, coercion, fraud, or illegal acts in marriage and live-in relationships.Dhami also honoured the officers who contributed to the UCC and those who did commendable work in its registration.","Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday said that the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code in the state has ushered in a new era of women's empowerment.

GUWAHATI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday said the cabinet will take a formal decision on the future course of action on the SIT report on state Congress president Gaurav Gogoi's alleged links with Pakistan on February 7.Addressing a press conference after a cabinet meeting here, Sarma alleged that Gogoi and his British wife have ""direct links"" with Pakistan as per a presentation made by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Assam Police formed to probe the controversial matter.""In today's cabinet meeting, we had an informal discussion on the SIT report. A presentation was made, following which all ministers were shocked to know the truth. Some even commented how (former chief minister) Tarun Gogoi's son could be like this,"" he said.Sarma said the cabinet decided to bring in a formal memorandum on the topic to decide the future course of action on the case in its next sitting on February 7.""Whether the report will be forwarded to the Union Home Minister for an investigation by the NIA, RAW or IB, or Assam Police will continue probing the matter -- this will be decided on February 7.On February 8, we will close the chapter,"" he added.Sarma stressed that the SIT report is going to be a ""very sensitive and shocking"" document for the public.""The cabinet also authorised the CM to address a press conference to make the public aware of the findings of the SIT to the extent possible. Some secret and sensitive information may not be shared, but most of the facts will be presented before the public,"" he added.Accordingly, a press conference will be organised at 10:30 am on February 8 to reveal most of the SIT findings, the CM said.""If anyone from the national media wants to come from outside the state to cover the press meet, we will be happy to facilitate them,"" he added.Sarma had last year announced to make public all evidence related to Gogoi's alleged link by September 10, 2025. Earlier this month, he had said that the hullabaloo over popular singer Zubeen Garg's death on September 19 caused a delay.The Assam CM and the BJP have been attacking Lok Sabha MP Gogoi over his wife's alleged connection with Pakistan's spy agency ISI.A Special Investigation Team (SIT) probed a case of alleged interference of Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, who was claimed to have links with Gogoi's British wife Elizabeth Colburn, in India's internal affairs.""Sheikh is a Pakistani national, so there is no doubt about him. The SIT found that Gogoi and his wife have direct links with Pakistan, and they presented the proofs in front of the cabinet,"" the CM claimed.He said that Colburn was examined by the SIT sleuths during the course of the investigation, besides quizzing 22-25 more people.Referring to the citizenship of Gogoi's wife and children, Sarma said, ""In the family, there is one Indian and three foreigners. If he (Gogoi) had any shame, he should have immediately given Indian citizenship to his children after the controversy erupted.""Sarma claimed that the Assam Congress chief considers Indian citizenship as ""second-class"" and gives more importance to British citizenship.Earlier, the BJP leader had claimed that the opposition leader is a ""100 per cent Pakistani agent"".Sarma had alleged that Colburn had travelled 19 times between India and Pakistan and Gogoi had visited the neighbouring country on an invitation from its spy agency ISI and undergone training there.He also claimed that Colburn was collecting various classified government documents, mainly IB reports, on behalf of the Pakistani climate lobby.Hitting back, Gogoi had slammed Sarma over his accusation and questioned his mental state due to issues at the home front. He even said the CM's remarks were ""ridiculous, baseless, insane and nonsense"" and that he was behaving like an ""IT cell troll"" without talking with facts.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the cabinet will take a formal decision on the future course of action on the SIT report on February 7.

Nepal Gen Z Protest EXPLODES For 2nd Time, Curfew Imposed, Cops Use LETHAL Force | Watch

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: An Indian national from Gujarat, who escaped from a jail during last year’s ""Gen Z"" protests in Nepal, has been apprehended by Ahmedabad Police, officials said on Tuesday.Dharmesh Chunara, a resident of Thakkarbapa Nagar Road in Ahmedabad, was arrested by the Special Operation Group (SOG) Crime Branch, according to a police release.He had fled Bhadra Jail in Kathmandu, the capital of the neighbouring Himalayan country, during last year’s protests.Chunara, who had arrived in Kathmandu from Thailand's Bangkok, was caught with 13 kilograms of hybrid ganja valued at around Rs 13 crore. Following legal action by Nepalese authorities, he was sent to Bhadra Jail.During the protests, demonstrators vandalised the jail, leading to the escape of all inmates, including some Indian nationals. Chunara entered India via the Sonauli border in Uttar Pradesh, from where he came to Ahmedabad.According to police, the Nepal government released a list of escaped prisoners, based on which the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Delhi, circulated the details to all Indian states, including the CID Crime unit in Gujarat's Gandhinagar.Chunara, whose full name and address were not immediately available, was traced through a combination of human intelligence and technical analysis.In September 2025, Nepal was shaken by large-scale youth-led demonstrations, known as the “Gen Z protests.” The immediate trigger was the government’s ban on social media platforms, which escalated into violent clashes following a crackdown. The protests grew into a broader movement addressing multiple grievances, ultimately leading to the toppling of the KP Sharma Oli-led government and the formation of a caretaker administration.Nepal is now scheduled to hold its next parliamentary elections on March 5.","Dharmesh Chunara, a resident of Thakkarbapa Nagar Road in Ahmedabad, was arrested by the Special Operation Group (SOG) Crime Branch.

Rahul Gandhi Targets Modi Over Us Textile Tariffs, Bjp Fires Back

NEW DELHI: Accusing the Modi govt of fudging data to present a rosy picture, Congress on Tuesday expressed concern over the state of the Indian economy in the wake of what it called is questionable growth and production coupled with rising inequality and dimming welfare.Ahead of the President’s joint address to Parliament, economic survey and Union budget, Congress released its “real state of the economy 2026 report” to put “facts” before the people as the govt would indulge in “propaganda” in the coming days.Congress spokespersons Rajeev Gowda and Amitabh Dubey released the annual report with the title “inequality on the rise, welfare in retreat”.“IMF gave India’s statistics a C grade. 0.5% inflation rate is not the reality of people’s lives. Former economic advisor Arvind Subramanian calculates that GDP figures are at least 2.5% higher than actual reality,” the spokespersons said.Questioning govt data, Gowda said manufacturing in the first half of 2025-26 grew at 8.4%, but the Index of Eight Core Industries showed only 2.9% growth. At the same time, he said the Rupee has been Asia’s worst performing currency in 2025.Congress said the most alarming fact is that between 2017-18 and 2023-24, the share of workers in manufacturing fell from 12.1% to 11.4%, while it rose in agriculture from 44.1% to 46.1%.“Job growth is concentrated in low value, informal, and gig economy,” it said.Expressing concern over “rising inequality”, Gowda said the top 10% capture 58% of national income while the bottom half receives only 15%. He said the top 10% own 65% of India's wealth. Alongside, he said, four of five Indians subsist on less than Rs 200 per day.Gowda and Dubey said net household financial savings are at a five-decade low of 5.2% while household debt has sharply risen to 41% from 35% in 2019.Congress said the best welfare net for the poor was MGNREGA but the job scheme has now been dismantled which will hurt the deprived sections the most.","Congress accuses the Modi govt of fudging data to present a rosy picture.

NEW DELHI: The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) on Tuesday rescued 60 people, including 40 soldiers of a Rashtriya Rifles unit, after they were stranded in a snowbound area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district following heavy snowfall.The high-altitude rescue and road restoration operation was carried out under Project Sampark at Chatergala Pass on the Bhaderwah–Chatergala axis, located at an altitude of about 10,500 feet.The operation began on January 24, a day after continuous snowfall for nearly 40 hours blocked the route.According to the spokesperson, personnel of the 118 Road Construction Company (RCC) under the 35 Border Roads Task Force (BRTF) cleared around 38 km of road buried under five to six feet of snow.The route was reopened by the evening of January 25, allowing the safe evacuation of 20 stranded civilians and 40 personnel of the 4 Rashtriya Rifles, along with their weapons and supplies.The rescue mission was completed by the early hours of January 26 with no casualties. The operation was conducted in close coordination with the Army and helped restore critical communication links in the region despite extreme weather and difficult terrain.Meanwhile, the BRO also restored road connectivity in the Kandi-Kotranka area of Rajouri district after heavy snowfall disrupted movement in the Pir Panjal region.Snow accumulation of up to three feet had cut off the Kandi-Kotranka subdivision from Rajouri town, affecting both civilian and military movement, including medical emergency services.Personnel of the 110 RCC under the 31 BRTF launched round-the-clock snow clearance operations, using specialised equipment and manpower. A single-lane road was initially opened within 14 hours to allow controlled movement of vehicles, including emergency services.The spokesperson said that the clearance and widening work continued. Around 35 km of road was fully restored within 24 hours, ensuring safer and smoother movement in the area.","60 people, including 40 soldiers of a Rashtriya Rifles unit, were stranded in a snowbound area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district.

"Stillbirths rose 44% after Covid, national study finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stillbirths-rose-44-after-covid-national-study-finds/articleshow/127604577.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Even as hospital deliveries resumed after Covid, India recorded a sharp rise in babies dying just before birth in the post-pandemic period, according to a major national study analysing births between 2019 and 2022. The findings point to serious gaps in pregnancy care—losses that often go unnoticed and are grieved in private.The rise was driven by disrupted antenatal care, delayed referrals and weakened pregnancy and delivery services during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers said. The study documented a 44% increase in the stillbirth rate between the pre-Covid and post-Covid periods.The study, published in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, was conducted by researchers from the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) with support from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It is based on a nationally representative mortality survey covering nearly one million people across nine states—Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.Data show that India’s stillbirth rate increased from 12.7 per 1,000 births before Covid to 14.4 during the pandemic, and then rose sharply to 18.3 per 1,000 births in the post-Covid period.The increase was most pronounced in rural areas, where rates reached nearly 20 per 1,000 births, compared to about 14 in urban areas, highlighting gaps in access to timely antenatal care and emergency obstetric services.Based on detailed interviews of 745 stillbirths, the study found that 44.7% occurred in public hospitals, 39.2% in private hospitals and 16.1% at home. The dominant place of delivery varied sharply across states: stillbirths were reported mostly from private hospitals in Kerala (66.7%), Gujarat (60%) and Haryana (50%), while public hospitals accounted for the majority in Odisha (72.6%), Assam (69.6%), Maharashtra (54.8%) and Tamil Nadu (54.6%), reflecting differences in health system utilisation rather than state-wise stillbirth rates.More than half of all stillbirths occurred at nine months of pregnancy or later, often just days before delivery, pointing to failures in late-pregnancy monitoring and delivery-time care.Explaining this, Dr Renu Gupta, Director (Obstetrics & Robotic Gynaecology), Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Delhi, said: “The rise in late-term stillbirths points to failures in timely risk detection and action, not gaps in early pregnancy care. After Covid, third-trimester monitoring—blood pressure, fetal growth and movement, Doppler studies—has become inconsistent, especially in overstretched public hospitals. Referral delays, staff shortages and weak transport systems mean warning signs are often missed. While delivery numbers have recovered, quality and continuity of care have not, leading to preventable losses just before birth.”Delays were a major factor. Nearly one in five women whose babies were stillborn had been referred between facilities during labour, sometimes being sent back to return later.Only about one-third of mothers were told why their baby died. Despite registration being mandatory, just 1% of stillbirths were officially registered, keeping most cases out of official records.The study also highlighted the emotional toll on families. Nearly half of mothers neither saw nor held their stillborn baby, often due to family decisions or medical advice.Researchers warned that without stronger antenatal surveillance, faster referrals and better quality care during labour and childbirth, India may miss its target of a single-digit stillbirth rate by 2030 under the India Newborn Action Plan.","India recorded a sharp rise in babies dying just before birth in the post- pandemic period.

Crime in India 2023

Is there a possibility of 4B in India then?



These lines are not lifted from the script of an ultra-feminist film where the protagonist finally walks away from patriarchy in the closing scene.They are spoken to real women, in real classrooms, playgrounds, homes, and workplaces, in response to the question: 'What is it that you got to hear because you are a woman?'When asked if they took any action against it, the answer was mostly negative.And yet, in some parts of the world, women have begun doing something radical: they have stopped trying to negotiate with patriarchy altogether. In South Korea, a small but radical feminist movement emerged in the late 2010s that rejected not just misogyny, but the social institutions built around it. Called 4B — short for— the movement is where women opt out of four things entirely.No marriage.No childbirth.No dating.No sex.The terms sound radical, but they are, at their core, a language of refusal to participate in patriarchal norms.Known as the 4B movement, the name comes from four Korean words beginning with, meaning “no”:(no marriage),(no childbirth),(no dating), and(no sex). Together, they form a clean break from heterosexual relationships as they are traditionally structured in South Korea.“Patriarchy breaks every sense of one's existence. As much as you might want to resist you somehow see yourself being a part of it. It's a sad state because then you don't feel honest but also can't help,” said Varalika Aditya Singh, who studied law, and is currently “figuring out new normal after marriage”.“Breakthrough from the entire conditioning is important. I don't believe we can resist and also be a part of it,” she added.Like earlier “separatist” feminist movements, 4B is not about personal lifestyle branding so much as political resistance: a rejection of institutions many women see as pipelines to unpaid labor, diminished autonomy, and systemic inequality.“Patriarchy’s hold on women runs so deep that from the moment they are born until they die, the dark, unyielding shadow of men follows them everywhere,” said Bhagya Luxmi, a former journalist.There’s no exact incident that triggered the movement, no single spark that neatly explains why some South Korean women began collectively opting out of marriage, motherhood, dating, and sex. Instead, 4B coalesced through accumulation—years of online hostility, public violence, and institutional indifference layering into something heavier than outrage: resolve.The backdrop was already hostile. In the early 2010s, the rise of Ilbe Storage, a notoriously misogynistic online forum, helped harden what became known as South Korea’s “gender wars,” normalising slurs, rape jokes, and open contempt for women in mainstream digital culture. Against this tide, feminist counter-spaces began forming. By 2015, ideas that would later define 4B—no marriage, no childbirth, no dating, no sex—were circulating within the Megalia community, which became known for its use of “mirroring” tactics: reflecting misogynistic language back at men to expose its violence and absurdity.In mid-2016, resistance took on a physical form with the emergence of the “escape the corset” movement. Young women rejected South Korea’s rigid beauty standards by cutting their hair short and destroying makeup on camera, reframing appearance as a site of control and reclaiming bodily autonomy—an ethos that would feed directly into 4B’s refusal of gendered expectations.Later that year, the Gangnam Station femicide, in which a woman was murdered by a stranger who said women had ignored him, shattered any lingering illusion that misogyny was merely rhetorical. Mass protests followed. Around the same time, the release of a so-called “pink birth map,” which reduced women to their reproductive potential, further inflamed feminist anger by rendering women as demographic tools rather than citizens.By 2017, the term “4B” itself began appearing on Daum Cafe forums and Twitter, as South Korea’s own #MeToo movement gained traction and feminist networks tightened. Through 2017 and 2018, these online circles solidified the movement, propelled by the aftershocks of the Gangnam murder and a growing wave of sex crime scandals, including illegal filming and image-based abuse. By 2019, 4B had achieved broader recognition on social media, peaking in visibility before declining domestically—even as its ideas continued to reverberate beyond South Korea’s borders.In that sense, 4B was not born of a moment but of momentum: a slow, collective decision that participation itself had become a liability.The conditions that produced 4B in South Korea are not exceptional—and in India, the parallels are often stark.As in South Korea’s “gender wars,” India’s digital spaces have increasingly normalised misogyny. In 2020, theincident exposed a private Instagram group of teenage boys sharing morphed images of underage girls, issuing rape threats, and casually discussing sexual violence.What unsettled many observers was not just the content but its ordinariness: the ease with which entitlement and cruelty flourished in supposedly liberal, urban spaces. Much like South Korea’s Ilbe Storage, the episode revealed how online ecosystems can incubate misogyny long before it escalates into physical harm.India’s reckoning with gendered violence, however, predates social media scandals. The 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder in Delhi remains a defining rupture—a moment comparable to South Korea’s Gangnam Station femicide. The crime triggered mass protests, legal reforms, and global attention. Yet the burden of change fell unevenly. Women were urged to be vigilant and resilient; institutions were reformed on paper, while everyday patriarchy remained structurally intact.The scale of violence women face in India remains stark. According to the NCRB’sreport, cases of crimes against women rose slightly by 0.7% in 2023, from 4.45 lakh to 4.48 lakh cases. As in previous years, the most common crime was cruelty by husband or relatives, which made up nearly 30% of all cases—about 1.33 lakh incidents, affecting 1.35 lakh women. While this category saw a small dip from 2022, it continues to dominate the data, underscoring how violence is often rooted inside the home. The NCRB also recorded 29,670 rape cases in 2023, involving 29,909 victims, with over 10,700 cases still pending from the previous year. Most victims were young: nearly 20,000 were between 18 and 30 years old, and 852 were children, including some below the age of six.Shravya Singh, a teenager who studies in a co-ed school in Ranikhet, recalled the differences in treatment meted out to boys and girls in her school""I remember once, when I was standing with a friend, a teacher came up to us and said that your body looked 'heavy' and the shirt looked ‘odd’ and asked to go sit in the medical room instead,” she recalled.Asked if she saw a possibility of “ditch the sweater” as a protest in her school, she said that if we try to do any such thing, it would mean “direct suspension”.“Too far fetched,” said Varalika Aditya Singh, however, adding that she agreed with the concept “of sort of abstinence from every possible aspect where patriarchy does play a huge role”.“But in India I still believe we only do things to please, a lot under pressure to be accepted, validated and to be looked at a certain way. Women might choose to live this way but secretly,” she said.“In India it's mostly vocal, nothing in action,” Neeraja Nath, who works as a news writer said.Given the fact that marriage is something so ingrained in Indian culture, when asked if it was a patriarchal institution, Singh “absolutely” agreed.However, she added that “marriage might not be entirely patriarchal but the conditioning has always been that.”“I cannot and also don't want to defy an entire institution because patriarchy has seeped everywhere. Marriage is just more convenient also because there's a lot of stigma attached if in the longer run the relationship doesn't work out,” she said.","In South Korea, a small but radical feminist movement emerged in the late 2010s that rejected not just misogyny, but the social institutions built around it. Called 4B — short for— the movement is where women opt out of four things entirely. 4B coalesced through accumulation of online hostility, public violence, and institutional indifference layering into something heavier than outrage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127620543,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

J&K: Operation Akhal enters Day 3; at least one terrorist killed during encounter with security forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-operation-akhal-enters-day-3-at-least-one-terrorist-killed-during-encounter-with-security-forces/articleshow/123071553.cms,"NEW DELHI: At least one terrorist was killed in an encounter after the security forces carried out Operation Akhal in Jammu and Kashmir 's Kulgam district.According to Chinar Corps of the Army, the operation, which started on Friday, continued overnight as troops responded with calibrated fire.""OP AKHAL, Kulgam. Intermittent and intense firefight continued through the night. Alert troops responded with calibrated fire and tightened the noose while maintaining contact,"" Chinar Corps wrote in a social media post on X.""One terrorist has been neutralised by the security forces so far. Operation continues,"" the post added on X.The gunfight broke out on Friday evening in the Akhal Khulsan forest area after joint teams of the Army, J&K Police, and Special Operations Group launched a combing operation, based on intelligence inputs about the presence of three to five terrorists.According to officials, the identity and group affiliation of the slain terrorist are being ascertained. They added that the operation is still underway.Security forces have been carrying out aggressive operations against terrorists in the hinterland, while the Army has been on maximum alert guarding the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.Three hardcore Pakistani terrorists, including LeT commander Suleman Shah and his two associates Abu Hamza and Jibran, responsible for the Pahalgam attack, were killed on July 28 in the higher reaches of Dachigam National Park at the foot of the Mahadev mountain peak in the Harwan area of Srinagar.The Army code-named this operation Operation Mahadev. After the Pahalgam terror attack, the security forces have been carrying out anti-terrorist operations against gun-wielding terrorists, their overground workers (OGWs), and sympathisers.Drug smugglers and drug peddlers are also on the radar of the security forces, as it is believed that the funds generated by hawala money rackets and drug smuggling are used to sustain terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.The coordinated and information-backed operations of the joint forces are aimed at dismantling the ecosystem of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, rather than focusing solely on the elimination of gun-wielding terrorists.","The gunfight broke out on Friday evening in the Akhal Khulsan forest area.

'He Has His Reasons...': Shashi Tharoor Reacts To Rahul Gandhi's Remark On Trump Tariffs

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday refused to comment on Rahul Gandhi ’s endorsement of US President Donald Trump ’s remark calling the Indian economy ""dead."" Tharoor said the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha may have had his ""own reasons"" for saying so, but stressed that maintaining economic ties with the US is vital for India.When asked about Rahul Gandhi's statement, Tharoor said, ""I don't want to comment on what my party leader has said. He has his reasons for saying so. My concern is that our relationship with the US, as a strategic partnership and economic relationship, is important for us. We are exporting around 90 billion worth of goods to America. We can't be in a position to lose that or have it diminish significantly.""He added, ""We must wish our negotiators strength to get a fair deal for India. We should also be talking to other regions for exporting our goods. Then we could make up for some of what we might lose in the US. We have to support our negotiators.""Tharoor’s response came after Rahul Gandhi, on Thursday, agreed with Trump’s description of the Indian economy. Gandhi had said, ""Yes, he is right. Everybody knows this except the prime minister and the finance minister. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact. The entire world knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. BJP has finished the economy to help Adani. ""Trump had made the comment on Wednesday through his social media platform, Truth Social. In that post, he announced a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and warned of additional penalties in response to India importing oil from Russia.","'He Has His Reasons...': Shashi Tharoor Reacts To Rahul Gandhi's Remark On Trump Tariffs.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Saturday criticised the government's global outreach following ' Operation Sindoor ', particularly taking aim at his party MP Shashi Tharoor , who was part of the all-party delegation that visited multiple countries.""None of the 33 countries that Tharoor and his team visited blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam terror attack ,"" Aiyar said while talking to news agency IANS.He further said, ""Neither the UN nor the United States has held Pakistan responsible. We are the only ones saying that Pakistan is behind it, but no one is willing to believe us. We haven’t been able to present any evidence that convinces people about which Pakistani agency carried out this act.""He also said, ""We are engaged in dialogue with China.

"Malegaon blast case: Judge showed concern over torture methods, detention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malegaon-blast-case-judge-showed-concern-over-torture-methods-detention/articleshow/123070485.cms,"MUMBAI: In the 1,036-page judgment in the Malegaon blast case , the judge found merit in allegations that the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had tortured witnesses and planted evidence. While the court dismissed torture claims from now- acquitted accused Pragya Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit, it did find accused Sameer Kulkarni's claims of illegal detention to be credible.These findings against the agency echo those made by the Bombay high court in the 11/7 train blasts case judgment. The HC in its July 21 judgment discarded the evidence used to imprison 12 men for almost two decades. The HC also expressed serious doubts about the integrity of ATS's investigation methods. It held that confessions of the accused were a result of custodial torture. The court detailed brutal methods allegedly used by police to extract confessions, including, forcing individuals to split their legs 180 degrees, tying people to a chair all night, denying them food for long periods, placing cockroaches in vests and rats in underwear, along with severe beatings.The HC said, ""Not allowing a person to sleep, making him stand the whole night with his arms tied above his head, or stretching his legs to 180 degrees, as has been repeatedly testified to by the accused, will not leave visible scars on the body, no matter how much this may bruise the mind or injure the psyche.""In the Malegaon case, 39 of the 323 who resiled from their statements purportedly given to ATS too made allegations of torture.The NIA judge expressed concern about methods of torture and illegal detention adopted by ATS officers and raised questions about credibility of evidence collected. A witness claimed he was forcibly taken by ATS officers in Nashik and interrogated late into the night. He alleged the officers threatened him and pressured him to give a statement that aligned with their narrative. Feeling sick and fed up with the repeated calls and forceful detentions, he gave a statement as dictated by ATS. He said the facts in that statement are baseless and had filed a complaint against ATS officers with the human rights commission. The judge concluded, ""Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that his statement was recorded by browbeating and threatening him to face dire consequences. The testimony of this witness itself shows that his statement was involuntary and forceful. Such a statement cannot be relied upon.""The judgment also called for an inquiry into the actions of ATS officer Shekhar Bagade, whose presence at an accused's house under suspicious circumstances was noted. The accused, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, was acquitted on charges of assembling the bomb. ""Remnants of RDX which were found tilted towards the planting. Two Army officers testified that they had seen... Bagade in the house in suspicious circumstances holding one bag and carrying out some suspicious activities,"" the judge said. Similarly in the train blasts case, HC made observations on the importance of genuine justice. ""But creating a false appearance of having solved a case by presenting that the accused have been brought to justice gives a misleading sense of resolution.""",Court finds merit in allegations that the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had tortured witnesses and planted evidence. Bombay high court in 11/7 train blasts case judgment discarded evidence used to imprison 12 men for almost two decades. HC expressed serious doubts about integrity of ATS's investigation methods.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123070526,imgsize-1722238,width-400,resizemode-4/123070526.jpg"
Air India crash: UK families await update on DNA-matched remains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-crash-uk-families-await-update-on-dna-matched-remains/articleshow/123069128.cms,"LONDON: British families, waiting for the remains of relatives aboard the London-bound Air India 171 plane that crashed soon after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport, are expecting confirmation on DNA matches after high-level India-UK government talks, their legal team has said.Keystone Law, which has been working with aviation experts to assist many of the families who lost loved ones in the June 12 crash, called for urgency in the process this week.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's UK visit last week, Downing Street had confirmed that Prime Minister Keir Starmer had discussed the Air India plane crash during their bilateral talks against the backdrop of UK media reports of mislabelling of some remains repatriated to Britain.""The UK and Indian governments have held high-level talks, as a result of the international media coverage of this problem,"" said James Healy-Pratt, Aviation Partner at Keystone Law.""It is believed that some matched DNA remains may now have been located in India. Confirmation is awaited,"" he said.The 241 passengers and crew who died in the disaster included 52 British nationals, with two out of 12 caskets repatriated to the UK for last rites found to be incorrectly identified.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) had responded to the UK reports to stress that ""all mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased"".""We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue,"" the MEA's official spokesperson said in a statement last month.Asked to estimate the scale of the issue, Keystone Law said of a sample of 12 caskets repatriated from India to the UK, two were ""mislabelled, mishandled and misidentified"".""Extrapolated out - with an unacceptable error rate of 15 per cent, that would suggest 40 sets of remains may have been mislabelled, mishandled and misidentified. That is a known unknown, and many of the families' loved ones have been cremated already,"" said Healy-Pratt.Last month, an inquest into the deaths of some of the British passengers was opened and adjourned in London, with the process of identification overseen by the Senior Coroner under UK procedures.It came as a preliminary report by the Indian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) found that fuel to both engines appeared to have cut off shortly after takeoff.The engines tried to restart, but it proved too late to prevent the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft from crashing into Ahmedabad's B.J. Medical College, claiming 19 lives on the ground.Keystone Law called for further clarity about the transitioning of the fuel cutoff switches, and which voice was saying what on the excerpts of the Cockpit Voice Recorder.""The Indian AAIB has this evidence, and has for unexplained reasons not shared this detail with the families of AI 171. The Indian AAIB cannot complain of further speculation when evidence in its possession is not released to the families on a transparent basis,"" said Healy-Pratt.The aviation lawyer also called for further details around reports of compensation being considered for impacted families by the Tata Group, owners of Air India.Healy-Pratt said: ""There is talk of TATA setting up a (Rs) 500 crore fund for all the AI 171 families - which will provide ex gratia support (legally a gift and separate and apart from any Court ordered compensation against Air India, or indeed Boeing) of a minimum of (Rs) 1 crore per loved one lost.""Families deserve to get details of that support urgently, as legal proceedings take time in India, England, and the United States.""The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has ""expert status"" in the Indian safety investigation and has said it is reviewing the findings of the preliminary report released one month on from the crash, on July 12.The UK-based families who lost loved ones in the crash have previously also called for a mechanism of expert representation in the India-led investigatory process into the plane crash.",Keystone Law has been working with aviation experts to assist many of the families who lost loved ones in the June 12 crash.

The world’s wealthiest individuals dominate industries ranging from technology and e-commerce to luxury goods and investment. These top 10 richest billionaires not only hold staggering personal fortunes but also shape the global economy with their innovative ideas and strategic ventures. According to Forbes, nine out of these ten billionaires are American, showcasing the dominance of the US in wealth creation, while Bernard Arnault represents Europe’s luxury empire. From Elon Musk’s space ambitions to Jeff Bezos’s e-commerce revolution and Warren Buffett’s legendary investing style, their wealth-building stories are remarkable examples of vision, execution, and global impact. Check the full updated list of the world’s top 10 billionaires influencing markets, industries, and future innovations.Elon Musk stands as the world’s richest individual, owing his fortune to groundbreaking ventures in electric vehicles, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. He holds about 12% of Tesla, the electric car pioneer valued at hundreds of billions, and owns a 42% stake in SpaceX, a leader in commercial space technology. Musk’s 2022 purchase of Twitter (renamed X) for $44 billion further solidified his influence in social media and AI-driven communication.Known for his ambitious projects, such as Neuralink and The Boring Company, Musk’s vision revolves around sustainable energy, interplanetary travel, and integrating AI into human life.Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corporation, built one of the most successful software companies in the world, specializing in databases and enterprise solutions. He owns 40% of Oracle’s shares, which drive most of his wealth. In addition to technology, Ellison is known for his real estate ventures, most notably his purchase of 98% of Lanai Island in Hawaii for $300 million. A board member at Tesla until 2022, Ellison continues to influence the tech industry with his investments and strategic vision. His lifestyle and property holdings place him among the wealthiest tech moguls globally.Jeff Bezos revolutionized retail through Amazon, transforming it from a humble online bookstore into a global e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse. Even after stepping down as CEO in 2021, Bezos retains significant wealth with a 9% stake in Amazon and ownership of Blue Origin, a space exploration company. Recently, he married Lauren Sánchez, marking a new personal chapter. Bezos also focuses on philanthropy, investing in climate change initiatives and education. His success story is a prime example of how innovation and risk-taking can create unprecedented wealth.Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook in 2004, a social media platform that became an integral part of global communication. Now rebranded as Meta Platforms, Zuckerberg’s company is heavily investing in AI and the metaverse—a virtual reality-based internet experience. He owns about 13% of Meta, which drives most of his fortune. Despite facing privacy controversies and regulatory scrutiny, Zuckerberg remains one of the most powerful tech leaders, continuously shaping how billions connect and interact online.Larry Page co-founded Google in 1998 alongside Sergey Brin, creating the most widely used search engine in the world. He served as CEO of Google and later Alphabet (Google’s parent company) before stepping down in 2019. Page remains a controlling shareholder and board member, ensuring continued influence over Alphabet’s direction. He invests in futuristic projects, including flying cars and AI innovations, highlighting his interest in disruptive technology and long-term visions.Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, helped build the foundation of the world’s most powerful search engine and ad-based revenue model. Like Larry Page, he stepped down from executive responsibilities in 2019 but retains significant voting power as a shareholder. Brin’s wealth largely stems from Alphabet’s dominance in search, advertising, and cloud computing. He is also known for investments in artificial intelligence and robotics, emphasizing innovation beyond traditional internet services.Jensen Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993, leading it to dominate the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, which powers gaming, AI, and supercomputing. Owning about 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth has skyrocketed due to the AI boom, as Nvidia chips are essential for advanced AI systems worldwide. His leadership and strategic direction have positioned Nvidia as one of the most valuable tech companies, crucial to the growth of AI and cloud computing industries.Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), oversees more than 70 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora. He is the only non-American on this list, representing the luxury fashion and goods sector. Arnault’s five children also play active roles in the family business, ensuring continuity in leadership. His fortune showcases how luxury goods and global branding can rival tech industry wealth.Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, transformed the company during his tenure (2000–2014), significantly expanding its software and enterprise services portfolio. After retiring, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion, diversifying his investments. Much of his wealth comes from Microsoft stock holdings, which continue to grow as the company remains a leader in cloud computing and software.Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is known globally as the “Oracle of Omaha” for his unmatched value investing strategies. Berkshire Hathaway owns diverse businesses like Geico, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, making it a financial powerhouse. Buffett is also a leading philanthropist, pledging most of his fortune to charitable causes through the Giving Pledge initiative. Despite his immense wealth, Buffett is known for his modest lifestyle and long-term focus on ethical, disciplined investing.Together, these billionaires not only reflect individual success but also underscore the sectors defining the 21st-century economy—tech, AI, luxury, and finance. Their influence spans across industries, policy, innovation, and philanthropy, shaping the world far beyond just their net worth.","The world’s wealthiest individuals dominate industries ranging from technology and e-commerce to luxury goods and investment.

The move follows review meetings conducted by Kannada Development Authority (KDA) in collaboration with local administrations.""We have instructed district administrations to mandate commercial and industrial establishments submit geotagged photographs of their signages as proof to get confirmation about the compliance of 60% Kannada signage,"" said KDA chairperson Purushottama Bilimale. ""The DCs and assistant commissioners (ACs) of sub-divisions are issuing orders to ensure the law is followed.""He said KDA had already covered 19 districts, holding meetings with respective deputy commissioners and district officials, and that similar reviews will be conducted in the remaining districts soon.In parallel, some deputy commissioners have written to the state govt seeking approval to link the Kannada signage requirement to industrial benefits under the new Karnataka Industrial Policy 2025–30. The proposal would make photographic evidence of Kannada signage a precondition to access state incentives and concessions.KDA's intensified push comes after concerns that many businesses were ignoring signage rules, despite the amendment being notified earlier this year. The submission of geotagged photos is intended to eliminate ambiguity and offer clear, location-tagged evidence of compliance. Bilimale said the goal is not punitive but to promote uniform respect for Kannada across commercial spaces in the state.","Kannada must occupy 60% of space on all business, industrial, and commercial signages.

Whether you're planning a study break, or simply catching up on assignments, here’s a list of school holidays in August 2025 to help you plan better.Here are the major holidays that apply across most schools in India:Raksha Bandhan is widely celebrated in northern and central India to honour the bond between siblings.

Most schools observe the occasion with flag hoisting and cultural programs, followed by a day off.Janmashtami, marking the birth of Lord Krishna, is a public holiday in many states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Depending on regional tradition, schools may declare a holiday either on August 16 or the preceding/following day.Onam is Kerala’s biggest harvest festival, celebrated with cultural events, pookalam (flower rangoli), and traditional feasts.

Trade standoff continues



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday sent a clear message to the United States amid an escalating trade standoff, saying the welfare of farmers, small industries and youth remains the government’s “top priority. ”“India is set to become the world’s third largest economy... therefore, India must remain vigilant about its economic interests. Our farmers, our small industries, employment for our youth... their welfare is our top priority.

This resolve will also be a true service to the nation. Every moment, we will now buy only indigenous goods. This will be a great tribute to Mahatma Gandhi,"" he added.The remark came as US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods, alongside a warning of further penalties over India’s continued purchases of Russian oil and military equipment.On his first visit to Varanasi following the deadly Pahalgam terrorist attack in April, PM Modi also sent a message to Pakistan, declaring that those who attack India “will not survive even in hell”.Also read: PM Modi flags off Rs 2,200 crore projects in Varanasi; releases 20th instalment of PM-Kisan scheme PM Modi said the success of Operation Sindoor had not only avenged the victims but also showcased India’s “fierce form” to the world.

I had pledged to take revenge for my daughters' sindoor, and I fulfilled it with the blessings of Mahadev,” Modi said. “Operation Sindoor showed the world India’s fierce form.

These include air defence exercises, sross-deck helicopter operations, precision targeting with surface and aerial platforms, complex maneuvering drills and VBSS (visit, board, search, and seizure) operations,” an officer said.After the $375 million contract to supply three anti-ship coastal batteries of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to the Philippines in Jan 2022, India has also stepped-up discussions on arms exports to other Asean countries like Indonesia and Vietnam.Apart from the Brahmos missiles, which have been developed jointly with Russia, India also plans to sell the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25-km, to countries like Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.",Three Indian warships have now reached the Philippines while another is exercising with the Singapore Navy.

Malegaon case

What happened in 2008

NEW DELHI: Sadhvi Pragya, recently acquitted of terror charges in the Malegaon blast case , claimed on Saturday that she was ""tortured and forced to name Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, and others"".The former Bhopal MP said she did not name them, as it was ""a clear attempt to coerce her into lying"".“They made me name several people, including Ram Madhav. To do all of this, they tortured me. My lungs gave up... I was detained in a hospital illegally. All of this will shared in the story I am writing, but the truth cannot be buried. I lived in Gujarat, so they also asked me name Prime Minister Modi (who was then Gujarat chief minister). I did not take anyone's name because they were trying to make me lie,"" she said.She further claimed that the other names she was pressured to mention included Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Mohan Bhagwat, and senior Sangh functionary Indresh Kumar.""They said take these names and we won't beat you,"" she alleged.After nearly 17 years, a special NIA court in Mumbai on July 31 acquitted all seven accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, including former BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit.All were already out on bail.The blast, which struck Malegaon town in Nashik district on September 29, 2008, killed six people and injured over 100. The court ordered compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to each injured victim.In its verdict, the court noted that the chassis number of the motorcycle allegedly used in the blast had been wiped out. It also ruled that there was no reliable evidence proving that Thakur owned the vehicle. The court further observed that she had taken sanyas (renunciation) two years prior to the incident and had given up material possessions.An explosive device, allegedly strapped to a motorcycle, detonated near a mosque during the holy month of Ramzan and on the eve of Navratri festivities. Among the other accused acquitted are Major Ramesh Upadhyay (Retd), Ajay Rahirkar, Sameer Kulkarni, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, and Sudhakar Dhar Dwivedi.The ATS had alleged that the motorcycle used in the blast belonged to Thakur, while Purohit brought the RDX from Jammu and Kashmir and stored it in his house. Both denied the allegations. They were acquitted from charges under various stringent sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including committing a terrorist act, conspiring to commit a terrorist act, criminal conspiracy, murder, and promoting enmity between religious groups.The investigation, initially led by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) under the late Hemant Karkare, quickly led to the arrest of Thakur and now Purohit in late 2008. The ATS, at the time, alleged, for the first time, the involvement of ""saffron extremists"" and linked the accused to a larger conspiracy, including other blast cases.Investigations into the alleged larger conspiracy of the Abhinav Bharat organization allegedly brought to light a series of crucial meetings, painting a picture of a group purportedly intent on avenging perceived atrocities against Hindus and establishing a ""Central Hindu Government"" (Aryawart). The prosecution contended that these gatherings demonstrate a calculated effort to strike terror by orchestrating a bomb blast in Malegaon, a Muslim-dominated area.The case took a significant turn when it was transferred to the NIA in 2011. In 2015, special public prosecutor Rohini Salian publicly alleged that the NIA had instructed her to ""go soft"" on the accused, leading to a change in prosecution. The NIA's supplementary chargesheet in May 2016, accusing the ATS of planting RDX traces to frame Purohit and, notably, giving a clean chit to Thakur and others, citing insufficient evidence.Despite the NIA's stance, the special court on December 27, 2017, ruled that seven accused, including Thakur and Purohit, would face trial under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), though charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) were dropped. Finally, on October 30, 2018, terror and murder charges were formally framed against Thakur, Purohit, and five others. The trial, commenced on Dec 3, 2018.The proceedings were also characterized by over 323 prosecution witnesses, with 37 turning hostile, and a rejected plea for an in-camera trial. The trial also saw numerous dramatic moments. In June 2019, Pragya Singh Thakur, by then an elected Member of Parliament from Bhopal, famously caused a stir in court, complaining about the ""dirty and small"" chair and the ""dusty"" courtroom.The recording of final statements from the accused concluded in 2024, followed by the examination of eight defence witnesses. The long journey to judgment also saw five different judges preside over the case, with the tenure of the current special judge, A K Lahoti, recently extended by the Bombay high court till August 31, 2025, to ensure he could deliver the verdict.Final arguments concluded in April 2025, and after a brief adjournment from May 8, the matter was finally reserved for the verdict.","'I Was Forced To Name PM Modi': Sadhvi Pragya's EXPLOSIVE Claim In Malegaon Blast Case.

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his comments on late union minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley , calling them “irresponsible” and stating such remarks ultimately damage the Congress.Sitharaman responded to Gandhi's comments made earlier in the day where he had claimed that former finance minister Jaitley “threatened” him on behalf of the government when he was fighting against the farm laws.In a post on X, Sitharaman said, ""If irresponsibility has a face, it is Rahul Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in LS. To throw baseless allegations at people in public life, even those who are no longer with us, is becoming a personality trait for him. His remarks on the late Shri. Arun Jaitley is despicable. India needs a strong opposition party. An irresponsible leadership hurts his party @INCIndia and the country. But does he care?""Speaking at the Congress-organised Annual Legal Conclave 2025, the leader of opposition alleged in his address that the NDA government had deployed the late minister to ""threaten"" him for opposing the farm laws introduced by the Modi government in 2020.""I remember when I was fighting the farm laws, Arun Jaitley was sent to me to threaten me. He told me, 'If you carry on opposing the government, fighting the farm laws, we will have to act against you.

'Mai Raja Nahi Hoon': Rahul Gandhi Responds To Congress Workers' Slogans At Legal Conclave

Nahi... Nahi... Main raja nahi hoon. Raja banna bhi nahi chahta hoon. Main raja ke concept ke against hoon

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was greeted with an unexpected chant at the party’s high-profile Legal Conclave in New Delhi on Saturday: “.” But the Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha was quick to shut it down.As Rahul took the stage to speak at the event titled “Constitutional Challenges: Perspectives and Pathways”, party workers broke into chants of “” (“What kind of king should the country have? One like Rahul Gandhi!”).In response, Rahul said, “.” (“No, no… I am not a king. I do not want to become a king. I am against the concept of kingship.”)The Congress leader used the platform to launch a scathing attack on the Election Commission of India (ECI), alleging that the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were “rigged” and that India’s electoral system is “already dead”.""The truth is that the election system in India is already dead. The Prime Minister of India holds office with a very slim majority. If 15 seats were rigged—and we suspect that the number is over 70 to 80—he would not have been the Prime Minister of India,"" Rahul claimed.He also alleged that the Congress had undertaken a six-month investigation which revealed large-scale electoral fraud. Citing one Assembly seat in Karnataka, the congress leader claimed that out of 6.5 lakh voters, 1.5 lakh were “fake”. “You will see the shockwave that is going to go through the electoral system when we release this data. It is literally like an atom bomb,” he said.Rahul further alleged that the ECI has been ""obliterated and taken over"". “We have such proof that will show the whole country that the institution of the Election Commission does not exist. It has disappeared,” he said.Reiterating that he had suspected electoral wrongdoing since 2014, the LoP recalled the BJP’s sweeping wins in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, where Congress failed to win even a single seat. He cited the case of Maharashtra, where he said one crore new voters appeared in the run-up to the Assembly elections—most of whom backed the BJP.He concluded by asserting, “I say with absolutely no doubt that we have proof. And whoever I have shown it to has fallen off the chair. They literally said how can it be possible. But it is possible. It’s happening. Literally.”The conclave was hosted by the AICC’s Department of Law, Human Rights and RTI.","Rahul Gandhi was greeted with an unexpected chant at the party’s high-profile Legal Conclave in New Delhi on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Arun Jaitley’s son, Rohan Jaitley, on Saturday rebutted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s claim that the late Finance Minister had been sent to “threaten” him for opposing the Modi government’s now-repealed farm laws.Speaking at the Congress-organised Annual Legal Conclave 2025, Gandhi recalled a tense exchange, saying, “I remember when I was fighting against the farm laws, Arun Jaitley was sent to threaten me. He said, ‘If you continue down this path, opposing the government and fighting us on the farm laws, we’ll have to take action against you.’ I replied, ‘I think you don’t know who you’re talking to. We’re Congress people, we’re not cowards. We never bend. The British couldn’t bend us.’”Gandhi’s remark quickly drew a sharp rebuttal from Jaitley’s son, Rohan Jaitley, who accused the Congress MP of misrepresenting facts and politicising the memory of the deceased. “Rahul Gandhi now claims my late father, Arun Jaitley, threatened him over the farm laws. Let me remind him, my father passed away in 2019. The farm laws were introduced in 2020,” Rohan Jaitley said in a statement.Calling the claim factually incorrect and in poor taste, Rohan further added, “More importantly, it was not in my father’s nature to threaten anyone over an opposing view. He was a staunch democrat and always believed in building consensus.” He described his father’s approach to politics as one that welcomed open discussion rather than confrontation. “If at all such a situation was to occur, as it often does in politics, he would invite free and open discussions to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to all. That was simply who he was and that remains his legacy today.”Rohan Jaitley also urged Gandhi to exercise caution while speaking about deceased public figures. “I would appreciate Rahul Gandhi being mindful while speaking of those not with us,” he said, recalling a previous instance where Gandhi had allegedly politicised the final days of former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. “He attempted something similar with Manohar Parrikar ji, politicising his final days, which was in equally poor taste. Let the departed rest in peace,” he added.Gandhi’s broader speech at the conclave included allegations of voter fraud in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, criticism of the Election Commission of India, and remarks about constitutional decline under the current government.","Rahul Gandhi said Arun Jaitley was sent to threaten him over farm laws.

'I Was Forced To Name PM Modi': Sadhvi Pragya's EXPLOSIVE Claim In Malegaon Blast Case

EW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday strongly defended former BJP MP Pragya Thakur after her controversial claim that she was tortured during the Malegaon blast probe, and accused the Congress-led UPA government of using the incident to frame prominent Hindutva leaders.S peaking in Thane, Shinde said: “Even in the blasts that happened before the Malegaon bomb blast, it was said that this is ‘saffron terrorism’. The then Congress and the UPA government gave it this form. This is an insult to Hindus... A retired police officer had said that RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat should also be implicated in this case... An attempt was made to implicate the prominent leaders of Hindutva in this case.”Shinde also backed Thakur’s recent allegations that investigators pressured her to take Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name. “Sadhvi Pragya said that she was tortured to take PM Modi's name in this case... How can anyone do such a disgusting act for votes and politics?” he asked, before launching a sharp attack on Rahul Gandhi “Rahul Gandhi always speaks the language of Pakistan. He is famous in Pakistan... Is this patriotism? This is love for Pakistan.The politicians who pressured those conducting the investigation should be investigated, their narco tests should be performed, and strict action should be taken against them,” Shinde said.Thakur, who was acquitted this week in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case along with six others, had earlier told reporters that officers tried to force her to name top BJP and RSS leaders including PM Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. She alleged illegal detention and torture, although the court found no evidence to support these claims. “I did not take anyone’s name because I didn’t want to lie,” Thakur said, adding that she is writing her story to reveal the full truth.The special NIA court ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

""If there was no Dr Ambedkar and no Constitution, I would not be in Chief Justice's chair,"" he said at the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar College diamond jubilee celebrations in Deekshabhoomi. He said his visit to Deekshabhoomi was not as a guest but as ""a son of the soil"".Standing alongside CM Devendra Fadnavis, senior judges Shree Chandrashekhar, Nitin Sambre, Anil Kilor, Anil Pansare, Prafulla Khubalkar, Abhay Mantri, the CJI said: ""This is not a ceremonial visit. It's deeply personal. I have a lifelong emotional connect with this place.""Praising Ambedkar's choice of Buddhism over other religions, Gavai said, ""Despite offers to embrace Islam and Christianity, Babasaheb chose Buddhism because it ensures equality for all."" He cited the 1981 silver jubilee of the Buddhist movement when ex-governor and his late father R S Gavai brought Dr Ambedkar's ashes to Nagpur. ""I remember the massive procession.My father carried the ashes on his head. It was a defining moment,"" hesaid.The CJI also reflected on the Ambedkar college's early struggles when staff salaries were unpaid, and operations ran out of a temporary structure. ""My father and Dadasaheb Kumbhare sought help from Manoharbhai Patel in Gondia, who agreed to support on the condition they'd have meals with him at his home one day,"" he said, praising such sacrifices that built the institution ""brick by brick"".He lauded the college's evolution into a NAAC-accredited institution. Highlighting women's empowerment as a true tribute to Dr Ambedkar's vision, Gavai noted that 80% of today's achievers here are girls. ""Ambedkar always said the progress of a society is reflected by the progress of its women,"" he added.","Chief Justice of India Bhushan Gavai spoke at the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar College diamond jubilee celebrations.

Plastic treaty shouldn't hurt sustainable development: India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/plastic-treaty-shouldnt-hurt-sustainable-development-india/articleshow/123068716.cms,".

NEW DELHI: With countries gearing up for a crucial meeting of the UN's International Negotiating Committee (INC) in Geneva from Aug 5-14 to finalise a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution, India will pitch for ""consensus-based decision making"" to reach an agreement that should focus on aspects related to ""plastic pollution only"" without affecting right to sustainable development of developing countries.""Aspects which are not directly related to plastic pollution should not be taken up. We need to strike a critical balance between preventing plastic pollution without affecting the right to sustainable development of developing countries and keeping in view their respective national circumstances,"" Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav told TOI recently in an interview.Specifically asked about an obstacle before developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution and India's stand in this context, Yadav said the country believes that the success of negotiations at INC require consensus-based decision making with the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation for reaching an agreement on various provisions.He further said, ""As developed countries have higher per capita generation of plastic waste and have historical responsibility, they need to provide financial and technical assistance by setting up a standalone multilateral fund which provides incremental cost for transition to developing countries for meeting compliance obligations.""The treaty is vital as currently more than 460 million metric tonne of plastic is produced globally every year, of which an estimated 20 million tonne ends up polluting the environment by affecting land, freshwater and marine habitats. The situation will gradually become more serious as global plastic waste is expected to reach 1.7 billion metric tonne by 2060.","India will pitch for ""consensus-based decision making"" to reach an agreement.

NEW DELHI: As part of the Navy's ongoing operational deployment to Southeast Asia with an eye firmly on China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, three Indian warships have reached the Philippines while another is exercising with the Singapore Navy.The deployments of stealth frigate INS Satpura for the bilateral ""Simbex"" exercise with the Singapore Navy as well as guided-missile destroyer INS Delhi, anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kiltan and fleet tanker INS Shakti to Manila ""is a testimony to the Indian Navy's commitment to strengthen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific"", according to officers.Leading the three warships in Manila, Eastern Fleet commander Rear Admiral Susheel Menon said India and the Philippines shared the commitment towards maintaining stability and enhancing maritime security in the region, emphasizing the importance of such deployments in promoting understanding, trust and cooperation among friendly maritime forces.The warships will undertake a bilateral naval exercise with the Philippines, which will focus on joint manoeuvres and communication protocols to improve preparedness, build mutual trust and strengthen operational synergy in the maritime domain.INS Satpura, in turn, is participating in the 32nd edition of the Simbex exercise, marking yet another chapter in the strong and enduring maritime partnership between the Indian Navy and the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN).""The exercise involves execution of a comprehensive array of advanced naval operations.

NEW DELHI: Now, all vegetable oil producers and processors will have to furnish monthly details of arrival of raw materials, production, import, sale, export and stock in hand to the food ministry, a move that will help the govt get real-time updates on availability rather than depending on data from their associations.The ministry has amended the Vegetable Oil Products, Production and Availability (VOPPA) Regulation Order of 2011 by notifying fresh changes. Industry sources said India has over 15,000 oil mills and more than 250 vanaspati manufacturing units. Most of them are in the small-scale sector.The new order focuses on enhanced monitoring of edible oil imports, production, stocks and sales through digital tools. Recently, speaking on the sidelines of an industry event, food secretary Sanjeev Chopra had said now they are groping in dark because they are dependent on associations for data.He had also said under the new framework, the govt will track production, pricing and availability in real-time, providing critical data to industry stakeholders, while improving compliance, market monitoring and product integrity.As per the new notification, issued on Friday, a producer who intends to produce, stock for sale or offer for sale of vegetable oil, vegetable oil products or solvent extracted oil will need to apply for registration. The director of directorate of sugar and vegetable oils or any person appointed for it can inspect any premises.","The ministry has amended the Vegetable Oil Products, Production and Availability (VOPPA) Regulation Order of 2011.

PATNA/NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday slammed Congress neta Rahul Gandhi for claiming to have an ""atom bomb of evidence of vote theft"" against Election Commission of India , and dared him to detonate the explosive.At an event organised by a media house in Patna, Singh also likened the upcoming state polls to a crossroad, with one path (under NDA ) leading to further progress and another (under the INDIA bloc) taking Bihar back to its old era of lawlessness and caste strife.""Rahul Gandhi says he is in possession of an atom bomb. If it is so, he should detonate it at once. He should just ensure that he is himself out of harm's way,"" Singh said.Gandhi had Friday said that his party has an ""atom bomb"" of evidence to prove ""vote chori"" by EC for BJP, remarks that evoked a sharp response from the poll panel.The commission termed Gandhi's remarks as ""baseless and wild allegations"".Singh also said the nation remembers his past rhetoric. ""Rahul had threatened Parliament of an earthquake, but when he spoke, it turned out to be a damp squib.""Singh said EC is an institution that enjoys a reputation for unquestionable integrity.""It is pulling out all the stops to ensure that the upcoming assembly polls in the state are held in a free and fair manner. It does not behove the leader of the opposition to make frivolous statements about a constitutional body,"" the BJP MP from Lucknow said.The defence minister reminded the LoP that his own party has blood on its hands, having tried to murder democracy in 1975 with the imposition of the Emergency.The defence minister also criticised the Congress-led opposition for raising questions about Operation Sindoor instead of paying tributes to the valour displayed by the Indian armed forces.The former BJP president alleged that the Congress had been soft on insurgency while in office, and tried to frame innocent people by spinning the theory of saffron terror because of vote bank considerations.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh slams Congress neta Rahul Gandhi for claiming to have an ""atom bomb of evidence of vote theft"" against Election Commission of India.

Operation Akhal: Indian Forces Gun Down Terrorist In Kulgam Amid Rising Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: The 'Janaza-Ghaib (funeral in absentia)' of Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir - a second confirmation that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 incident in which 26 civilians were killed.Videos and pictures posted on Telegram channels show the elderly of Khai Gala in Rawalkote gathering for the final prayers for the former Pakistan Army soldier and Lashkar-e-Taiba operative. But the funeral took an unexpected turn when local LeT commander Rizwan Hanif tried to be part of it. Tahir's family explicitly barred LeT members from attending the funeral but Hanif insisted, leading to a confrontation.Tahir's association with LeT and his role in the Pahalgam attack had made him a wanted category 'A' terrorist. His killing during Operation Mahadev in Srinagar last week along with two others was a major breakthrough for Indian security forces.During the funeral, a source said, ""Lashkar operatives threatened mourners with a gun, sparking outrage among villagers. The residents of Khai Gala, who have long been wary of radicalisation, are now planning a public boycott to oppose terror recruitment.""This development is significant as it not only highlights the growing resistance among POK residents against Pakistan's state-sponsored terror machine but also confirms that the impact of Operation Sindoor - conducted as a response to the Pahalgam attack - is being felt across the border.""A Lashkar commander facing public backlash and being forced to flee is a testament to the changing dynamics in the region,"" the source added.Tahir's past includes his association with the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT) and the Student Liberation Front (SLF) before joining the Pakistan army. The Sadozai Pathan community, to which Tahir belonged, has a rich history of resistance, having migrated from Afghanistan in the 18th century and playing a key role in the Poonch Rebellion. This also led to Tahir getting the alias of 'Afghani' with which he was known in intelligence records.","Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Not one claim from booth level agents of parties in 24 hours of poll roll publication,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-one-claim-from-booth-level-agents-of-parties-in-24-hours-of-poll-roll-publication/articleshow/123068463.cms,"NEW DELHI: Not a single claim or objection was filed within the first 24 hours of publication of the draft electoral roll in Bihar, by any of the 1.6 lakh booth level agents (BLAs) deployed by a dozen political parties across the state's 90,712 booths.However, EC said 3,223 applications were received between 3pm on Aug 1 and 3pm on Aug 2, for fresh enrolment of electors turning 18 years on the cutoff dates July 1 and Oct 1, 2025. All have submitted their Form 6 with the mandatory declaration.As reported by TOI, EC, in an exercise aimed at 100% transparency, put out the first of its daily reports Saturday on the partywise claims and objections received from BLAs and resolved by the electoral registration officer or assistant ERO. As per rules, claims and objections are to be disposed of after the expiry of seven days.The update shared by the poll panel lists 'zero' claims and objections filed between 3pm on Aug 1 and 3pm on Aug 2, by the BLAs appointed by RJD, Congress, CPM, AAP, BSP, National People's Party, BJP, JD(U), CPI (ML) (Liberation), LJP (Ram Vilas), Rashtriya LJP and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party.The district election officers of all of Bihar's 38 districts had Friday shared the draft electoral roll for all 90,712 polling booths with the political parties.It also provided them the list of electors who were there in the roll as on June 24, 2025, but are not in the draft electoral roll published Friday.The absence of any claim or objection from RJD, which has 47,506 BLAs in the field, is interesting given that Saturday started with party chief Tejashwi Yadav claiming his name was not in the roll. The claim turned out to be incorrect as a copy of the draft roll for the relevant booth in Digha assembly constituency lists not only Tejashwi as entry no. 416, but also his wife Rajshree as entry no. 445.Tejashwi had earlier, while objecting to the non-inclusion of Aadhaar in list of documentation accepted under SIR, voiced the fear that his wife, who only has Aadhaar, may not be on the roll.EC on Saturday said it is not able to understand why Tejashwi is making such baseless allegations. As regards his fears regarding large-scale deletions, the poll panel said he should ask his 47,506 BLAs to file claims and objections, for which they have an entire month from Aug 1 to Sept 1. ""No BLA of any political party has submitted a single case to BLOs during the last 24 hours. This, despite all BLAs having agreed to go through the boothwise draft lists given to them on August 1, carefully,"" said the commission.EC is meanwhile issuing advertisements in print, TV and social media to create awareness among the electors of Bihar regarding the option of filing claims and objections. It will also set up special camps in all block-cum-office circles and urban local body offices, from 10am to 5pm on all days till Sept 1.Any elector of Bihar can check his name in the draft electoral roll by filling his EPIC number directly on the EC voters' portal and can also file claims and objections.","Not a single claim or objection was filed by any of the 1.6 lakh booth level agents (BLAs) deployed by a dozen political parties across the state's 90,712 booths. 3,223 applications were received for fresh enrolment of electors turning 18 years on the cutoff dates July 1 and Oct 1, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123068470,imgsize-1578764,width-400,resizemode-4/123068470.jpg"

India’s Space Dream: PM Modi Vows To Build Nation’s Own Space Station After Gaganyaan On Space Day

What is a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)?

A rare opportunity for observation

Background: The Chandrayaan-2 mission

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable scientific achievement, India’s Chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiter has made the first-ever observation of the effects of the Sun’s Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on the Moon, the Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO ) said on Saturday.The finding was made using Chandra’s Atmospheric Composition Explorer-2 (CHACE-2), one of the scientific instruments onboard the orbiter. The observations showed a significant increase in the total pressure of the Moon’s dayside exosphere or its extremely thin atmosphere, when a CME impacted the lunar surface.According to ISRO, the total number of neutral atoms and molecules, known as “number density” increased by more than an order of magnitude during this event. This confirmed long-standing theoretical models that had predicted such an effect but had never been directly observed before.“This increase is consistent with earlier theoretical models, which predicted such an effect, but CHACE-2 onboard Chandrayaan-2 has observed it for the first time,” the space agency said in its statement.A Coronal Mass Ejection is a massive burst of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun’s corona, its outer atmosphere that ejects high-energy particles, mainly Hydrogen and Helium ions, into space.When such emissions reach planetary bodies, they can affect their atmospheres and surfaces.For Earth, its magnetic field offers a layer of protection against these effects. However, the Moon has no atmosphere or global magnetic field, making it highly exposed to the Sun’s activity.The rare observation occurred on May 10 last year when a series of CMEs were hurled from the Sun toward the Moon. This powerful solar activity caused atoms on the lunar surface to be knocked off and released into the Moon’s exosphere, temporarily increasing its density and pressure.ISRO said this direct observation offers valuable insights into how solar activity influences the Moon’s environment, knowledge that could prove crucial as humans plan to build future lunar habitats and scientific bases.ISRO highlighted that such extreme solar events can temporarily alter the lunar environment, posing potential challenges for establishing long-term bases on the Moon.Launched on July 22, 2019, from Sriharikota aboard the GSLV-MkIII-M1 rocket, Chandrayaan-2 is India’s second lunar exploration mission. The mission carried eight scientific payloads to study the Moon’s surface, atmosphere and mineral composition.While the Vikram lander lost communication during its September 7, 2019, landing attempt, the Orbiter remains fully functional and continues to orbit the Moon at an altitude of around 100 km. It has been conducting valuable scientific observations for over five years.The CHACE-2 payload, part of the orbiter’s suite of instruments, is specifically designed to study the composition and variability of the lunar exosphere.This first-of-its-kind observation not only enhances scientific understanding of space weather and its effects on the Moon but also has broader implications for future lunar missions.","India's Chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiter has made the first-ever observation of the effects of the Sun's Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on the Moon.

Kajol Reveals Acting Trick That Helped Her Nail A DDLJ Scene

Bhattacharya is an economist and author of ‘Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh’

Thirty years of ‘Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’, the film that invited a subset of urbane women to ‘come fall in love’. My qualifications to trace its journey involve being an accidental chronicler of the economics and mathematics of Shah Rukh Khan and his female fans. For fifteen years, I thought I was interviewing women about how they saw Khan. Instead, I discovered how these women saw themselves and their frustrated attempts to find love and livelihoods.Finer minds than mine have dissected every inch of the film; there is thirty years of discourse out there. Stunning photographs of audiences at Maratha Mandir signal how the film continues to offer escape from the drudgery of daily life. For parts of the commentariat, the romance of Raj and Simran captures India's enduring love affair with patriarchy and caste endogamy. After all, Simran can only marry Raj if her father approves. Raj prefers patriarchal permission games to the rebellion of elopement. Familial regulation of women’s bodily autonomy remains at the heart of the plot. None of the women in the film seem to have jobs beyond loving andcaring for men. Simran writes great poetry but possesses no clear profession. Her girl gang and Europe trip looks fun, until a group of entitled boys crashes into it.Raj most certainly meshes harassment with wooing.The film marks the beginning of elite Indians awkwardly managing the pretense of modernity. In post-liberalisation India, with candy floss and GDP growth in the air, here is the fusion of traditional rituals, wealth and retail consumption.So, in its thirtieth year, what does DDLJ mean? I am not brave or foolish enough to make summary pronouncements on how most, or even many women feel about the film. DDLJ may be one movie, but each of us has experienced it in our own unique way. Some of my closest friends have grown up to be cynical about the love story. “He will grow old to be an unhelpful unsexy Uncle”, they say. They surmise that Simran would be better served by revolution than Raj. Others continue to prefer the promise of Raj’s wideopen arms and sanskari happy endings.For some elite urban women like myself, the film is a reminder of the years spent in the captivity of romantic love, hoping to find the One. We were foolish and privileged when we watched DDLJ as teenagers; we are foolish and privileged in our forties. For women our age from the precariat, it was often the first film they recalled watching in a hall or a screening at home or their neighborhoods. Songs from the movie haunted my fieldwork across India; homebased women workers I surveyed had memorised the film’s beautiful soundtrack.Aditya Chopra fashioned a new masculinity through Khan. He raced airplanes, cried beautiful tears, fasted for karwa chauth , broke Preeti’s heart, helped women with housework and sarees. In the second half of the film, Raj transforms into a man who performs emotional and care labour with elegance and elan. Dialogues were equally proportioned between men and women, a rare event in Hindi films.One scene seemed to stir every fan I interviewed. It involved Simran’s mother remarking on how men would never sacrifice their well-being, while women were expected to give up their desires without complaint. She urges the young couple to run away. Simran is willing and raises this option repeatedly, Raj declines. So many women would wonder about Simran’s fate. If she gave up on Raj or gave up on the protection of her family home — where would she go? Would she risk an honour killing? Could she find safe housing? Could she afford to live on her own? Could she bear the loneliness of her revolt? Would the state or market offer credible protection?Since DDLJ’s release in 1995, the times have certainly changed for women, as has the economy. However, the binding constraints on Simran’s horizons remain the same. In 1994, 23% of urban women held paid jobs or were looking for work compared to 80% of urban men. In 2024, the gap remains significant — 76% urban men participated in the labour force compared to 28% women. Public space and the housing market remains odiously masculine. Rates of domestic violence suggest the home is deeply unsafe. Ten percent of our police force is female.A young home-based worker I followed, with a brief history of running away from home, insisted that elopement was the easier choice for men, more so when their fam-ilies supported the match, as was the case in DDLJ. Since intimate violence was assumed as a fact of life, women would always need a safe place to escape. I heard the same explanation from a posh Rajput woman in an abusive marriage. Abandoning the family would make Simran’s ‘fall back’ position weak. Projecting their precarities onto the film’s couple, these women understood Raj as securing Simran a way home should their marriage fall apart. Where earlier all I saw was capitulation and conformity, I began to see bargains and trade-offs. I started to realise that the calculus of rebellion can look very different for women. There are days when a clumsy regressive Raj feels better than liberal men who find no greater joy than lecturing ladies without ever comprehending our bitter constraints.DDLJ marks three decades of women's complicated relationship with their own freedom, the conformist compromises forced upon some, while happily chosen by others. But much like Simran’s mother, I'm impatient now. I have long given up on Raj, the belief that a handsome man can offer happiness. I prefer a political regime that prioritises liberating Simran to fall in love with her own possibilities. I long for the romance of public institutions that credibly care for women's safety and safety nets. Raj can wait. Come fall in love with your freedom. Jee lete hai apni zindagi.","Bhattacharya is an economist and author of ‘Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh’ The film marks the beginning of elite Indians awkwardly managing the pretense of modernity.

"Gyttja, Caziques, Mbaqanga Scrabble’s now a competitive sport",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gyttja-caziques-mbaqanga-scrabbles-now-a-competitive-sport/articleshow/124681332.cms,"Players across all ages at a Scrabble tournament in Delhi

It was once a gentle, afternoon pastime. But, for an increasing number of players, making up words on a board is a serious pursuit — for which they crisscross the country and even go abroad, writes Avijit Ghosh

What’s Gyttja?

‘Works Like An Antidepressant’

Bingo! India has a youth world champion

,

In a chandelier-lit basement of a south Delhi hotel, a bunch of men and women across 30 tables are focused on a board game that seems gender-neutral and age-agnostic. A 10-year-old fourth-grader squares off with a 60+ English professor, and a retired civil servant duels with a young businesswoman. The players take notes, challenge words and, much like chess, press a game timer.But it’s the frequent clatter, much akin to a rattlesnake clicking its tail, that gives the roomy arena its buzz and the game its signature. It’s the sound of the tile bag being jiggled and shaken; that is where consonants and vowels are stored, and from which match-winning words are formed. Welcome to the serious world of competitive Scrabble — once a gentle afternoon pastime, it is now a sharp strategic sport that receives little media attention.Early last month, though, the scenario changed, albeit briefly, when Madhav Gopal Kamath, a class 10 student from Delhi (see box), became the first Indian to win the 2025 World Youth Scrabble Championship. “People were astonished to know Madhav was just 14 years old,” says Harry Bhatia, president, Scrabble Association of India (SAI).Scrabble was invented by unemployed American architect Alfred Mosher Butts during the Great Depression, which haunted the US in the 1930s. While the exact year it arrived in India is fuzzy, senior citizens from English-aware homes recall relishing the game or its variants in childhood.“What we do know is that it emerged as a competitive sport in the mid-1990s in Hyderabad,” says Mohan Chunkath, 69, India’s first national champion. Since then, the sport has gained ground. Scrabble clubs are active in Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Goa, Hyderabad, Pune, Vadodara, Kochi, with Kottayam the latest addition. From around 60-odd players in the 1990s, India has about 400 registered players now, says Bhatia. Players are ranked and rated on performance. The Chennai-based Chunkath says he was the lone player to represent India at the Melbourne world championship in 1999. That number now has gone up to six-eight.There are more young players on the scene. Vihaan Singhvi, a class 10 student from Jaipur who was part of India’s youth team, learnt the sport from his aunt. “Jaipur doesn’t have too many offline players. I mainly play online,” he says. His sister, Khanak, just 6, is a promising Scrabbler. So is Noida-based Dahlia Verma, 12, who has represented her school at an international inter-school meet.Nine-time national champion Sherwin Rodrigues says domestic tournaments have doubled since he started competing in 2005. “Currently, we have about 10-12 three-day tourneys,” he says, “plus a clutch of one-dayers, making it a packed domestic calendar.”A team-based Scrabble League is also scheduled in Lonavla next month. The KSSA Indian Open, a four-day international meet, will be held in Bengaluru next Jan. Corporates, too, are slowly coming on board, pun intended. “Kids are even putting Scrabble in their college resumes,” says Bhatia. “We are forming more state associations to boost the game’s infrastructure,” he adds.Scrabble is a complex mix of word knowledge, strategy, concentration and chance. Words are loved not for their beauty, but for the points they rack up. India’s top-ranked woman player, Ishika Shivalingaiah, used “roneoed”, in Delhi last week. The word is ‘playable’ and means ‘duplicated’.In the past too, she has used words that would stump most of us. “Gyttja”, for one, which means a fine-grained, high-organic-matter sediment, or, just, “Shh” — to silence someone. The validity of a word can be ‘challenged’. But Scrabble has its own DRS, the all-knowing umpire: the Collins Scrabble Word List, a constantly growing dictionary.Ishika and other Scrabblers also point out that the game is about much more than just employing high-scoring ‘playable’ words to create a “bingo”, the term for any seven-letter word that fetches an extra 50 points. Which is why, as Chunkath points out, the best players are not literature professors, but mathematicians, computer programmers and musicians. “They follow patterns,” he says.Good players practice one-two hours daily. “They must be good at tile-tracking, which means being aware of the letters already played and those yet to come,” says Vihaan. Rack management, balancing vowels and consonants, is another key skill, he says.Nonetheless, an element of randomness is integral to Scrabble. “You have no control over the tile (letter) fished out of the bag,” says Chunkath. But there’s a general consensus that while luck can be critical in a single match, it mostly evens out in tournaments, where every player plays about 25 matches. Attentiveness, too, is vital when you are playing eight games per day, each lasting 50-60 minutes.Simply put, a combination of word knowledge, strategy and attentiveness outdoes the role of chance. “Nigel Richards of New Zealand, the current world champion, is the best because his strategy is unmatched,” Madhav says.Like chess, volleyball and basketball, defence, too, is integral to Scrabble. You play in a way to maximise your own points, but you also block your opponent from piling them up. Madhav recalls being tested in Malaysia against Nigeria’s Abdulqudus Aliu Olawale, who had bested him on previous occasions.“My style is open and high-scoring; He is defence-oriented, a master in limiting the opponent’s scoring opportunity,” Madhav explains. “I had to adapt by becoming a blocker myself.” It was a tight encounter, but Abdulqudus ran into time trouble and Madhav prevailed.Anjana Meira Dev, 61, who teaches English in Delhi’s Gargi College, says Gen Z players are sharper strategists and memorise more. “They can make words they don’t know the meaning of. Which is legal. But we never did that. They also anticipate bingos better,” she says. “They play Scrabble like T20. For us, it is Test cricket,” says Anjana, who started playing when she was six.These days, players also use technology to improve their game. Ishika uses a web app, ‘aerolith’, which offers a fast way to learn words and woogles.io, a free, non-profit online platform for word gamers, which also analyses matches, including the best possible choices you could have made. Madhav refers to a word tool, zyzzyva.Players have taken to Scrabble for different reasons and ended up being its devotees. Ishika, a 43-year-old consultant at PWC, was a former chess player who had sparred against the likes of Tania Sachdev and Harika Dronavalli. She got interested in the word game after participating in a corporate event five years ago. What chess couldn’t give her, Scrabble did: major success.For hotelier Ritu Chadha, the game has been like meditation, her ‘no-mobile time’. “It works like an antidepressant for me,” says Ritu, also treasurer, SAI.Many Scrabblers, like her, are working professionals. Money is invested in, rather than taken out of the game. Prize money is low, sponsors rare, plane tickets and hotel bills footed individually. “Every time, I tell myself I am not doing this anymore. But I end up doing it again,” says Ritu. Then she smiles and says, “I guess I am addicted.” Most tournaments last three days. “Expenses roughly work out to Rs 25,000 for each of them,” says Rodrigues, who plays about five of them every year. The India No.2 won the Delhi Scrabble Open last week and pocketed Rs 20,000. The cost-benefit ratio doesn’t add up.Yet Scrabble thrives, not on prize money, but passion. And, one carefully placed letter at a time.is potentially the highest scoring word in Scrabble. It can net up to 1,778 points, won the World English-language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA) title in 2017. He had represented Bahrain thenMadhav Gopal Kamath’s first memory of Scrabble is watching a game and pointing out how the player had missed out on the word, ‘aediles’, the plural for magistrates in ancient Rome. He had seen his father use the word a fortnight before that and remembered. He was five.The boy could remember well even before he had properly begun to read. When four, he learned the names of 80 dinosaurs from flashcards. “From a very young age, he could concentrate well. We knew he was gifted,” says his entrepreneur father, Sudhir.By the time he was eight, Madhav would occasionally beat Sudhir. “But in the last two years, it has been eight out of 10,” he says. Sudhir is ranked 28 in Scrabble Association of India’s latest official ratings. Madhav is India No.3 — and No.1 among juniors.The Class 10 student of Delhi’s Sanskriti School has bigger plaudits to his name, though. When he became the world youth champion in Malaysia last month, he also pocketed a cash prize of $1,000. He is also the national champion. His ambition is to be world champ. “But I have a long way to go,” he says.“What makes Madhav special is his ability to stay cool under pressure, which is crucial during end games,” says Neeta Bhatia, who was coach and team manager at the Malaysia event.In the Scrabble Association of India (SAI) magazine, Endgame, Madhav spelt out a small list of dream playable words back in Sept 2021. Two of them were: “Caziques” and “Mbaqanga”.

Government to pay bail surety of poor undertrials: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-pay-bail-surety-of-poor-undertrials-sc/articleshow/124678809.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Framing a unique standard operating procedure, Supreme Court has directed that if a poor person, arrested for an offence and lodged in jail pending trial, is unable to furnish monetary surety for bail, government concerned through district legal services authority will provide it to ensure release, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The new SOP was framed by SC after incorporating suggestions from amicus curiae.The new SOP was framed by a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S C Sharma after incorporating suggestions from amicus curiae and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati.The case was taken up suo motu by SC after learning that thousands of undertrials are languishing in jail despite being granted bail just because of their inability to fill bail bonds with or without sureties. The bench said district legal services authority (DLSA) can fill a surety amount up to Rs 1 lakh and if the trial court has fixed it higher than Rs 1 lakh, then it would file an application to get it reduced. In the new guidelines, the bench said if an undertrial prisoner is not released from jail within seven days of grant of bail, then the jail authorities would intimate to DLSA secretary, who will immediately depute a person to verify whether the undertrial has funds in his prisoner’s savings account.If the accused did not have money, then “district level empowered committee will direct release of funds for surety on DLSA’s recommendation within a period of five days from the date of receipt of the report”.“For cases where empowered committee recommends that undertrial prisoner be extended the benefit of financial support under ‘Support to Poor Prisoners Scheme’, then requisite amount of upto Rs 50,000 per case for one prisoner, can be directed to be drawn and made available to court concerned by way of fixed deposit or any other prescribed method, which district committee feels appropriate within five days of its decision pending integration in inter-operable criminal justice system,” SC said.",The new SOP was framed by a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S C Sharma.

Role of GTPRO:

Why GTPRO needed?

Next steps:

The road covered so far

NEW DELHI: The government’s in-principle go ahead to setting up of an apex federal agency for planning and monitoring of all modes of surface transport, railways, shipping, civil aviation and mass transit at national level, and logistics sector is set to bring a paradigm shift in the country’s infrastructure planning and accelerated development. The new entity — GatiShakti Transport Planning and Research Organisation (GTPRO) — to be housed in the Cabinet Secretariat will eliminate at least two layers of project approval process, which take around 60 days.TOI on October 9 had first reported the go ahead given for GTPRO at a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi, which was attended by five cabinet ministers and secretaries from related ministries, and other top officials. Sources said DPIIT has been tasked to prepare a proposal for the Cabinet for setting up of the new entity, which will be headed by a senior officer designated as secretary (transport planning).Proposed to be set up under Section-8 of the Companies Act, the GTPRO will include PM GatiShakti framework, logistics and supply chain, transport sector (research and planning), transport big data, project monitoring and impact assessment for all infrastructure projects.The agency would be responsible for roll out of Master Plan or integrated plan; it will appraise sectoral plans such as rail, road and aviation, appraise all projects that cost over Rs 500 crore, monitor projects and assess their impact, and to have a repository of Big Data.The ministries concerned will prepare sector plans for five and 10 years, execute and monitor them as well.Govt expects that the new entity will bring a system of structured framework to initiate master planning and will have datasets that are required for planning and research. It is also expected to put a well placed mechanism for continuous flow of expertise and promote knowledge-sharing in planning.The need to have an Integrated Transport Planning Authority (ITPA) was mooted by three empowered Group of Secretaries in November 2023 and the presentation on transformational change before PM Modi. They had suggested the ITPA could be akin to the establishments in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Japan to deal with all issues relating to transportation.They had proposed that the new entity would help take the best decisions for creating the right infrastructure keeping in mind the value for money. Then it was envisaged that the agency will coordinate with states for key infrastructure projects. They had proposed integrated transportation solutions with a target to achieve over 42% movement of freight by rail or waterways by 2030. The plan envisaged to increase the average speed of freight trains to 40 kmph by 2030 as compared to the current speed of 24 kmph and also to to increase the average speed of trucks from current 25-40 kmph to more than 40 kmph by 2030.At present, there is no apex agency to deal with transportation issues as a whole in India. Each ministry has its own vision document, there is no brainstorming among ministries and no defined 5-year or 10-year plans. PM Gatishakti National Master Plan has played in project evaluation, but the impact was not as per expectation. There is monitoring by different agencies and by different frameworks while no agency to suggest global best practices, new technologies, no agency to do policy advocacy and recommend changes in Acts and Rules.The government felt the need for transport planning considering that India needs a direction with infrastructure investment, which has been increasing over the past decade. Sources said there is a need for a super specialised expertise in transport planning as China and South Korea.The administration also realised that the current planning is primarily consultant-driven, with minimal collaboration among ministries and states. Also, there is no central agency responsible for policy advocacy or recommending changes to Acts and Rules to improve planning and project implementation. Sources added that there is no mechanism for mid-course correction in case of project failures.As per proposal, GatiShakti division, project monitoring and logistics division of DPIIT may be placed in Cabinet Secretariat. Proposal to seek cabinet nod for the organisation may be completed within 90 days.* Oct 2013: PM GatiShakti National Master Plan covering seven sector — road, rail, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport & logistics infrastructure — focussed on integrated planning & evaluation* Dec 2023 to Aug 2025 : Meetings conducted with various countries & institutions, including Korea Transport Institute, Infrastructure Australia, World Bank, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport & Tourism of Japan, IITs, IIMs & ADB* Studies have found the need for strong institutional mechanism for transport planning, need for transportation and sectoral plans, scientific research by government-funded institutions & close coordination of ministries and research institutions","The new entity — GatiShakti Transport Planning and Research Organisation (GTPRO) — to be housed in the Cabinet Secretariat will eliminate at least two layers of project approval process.

'Jiski jitni sankhya bhari utni uski hissedari?'

Sabka sath sabka vikas?

NEW DELHI: It has been more than three decades since former Bihar chief minister and a flag bearer of backward classes, Karpoori Thakur bowed out from the stage of Bihar politics. However, his disciples, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar, still swear by Karpoori's name on the issue of social justice.When RJD and JD(U)-led Mahagathbandhan came to power in 2022, they conducted a caste survey to identify the exact population of the state’s Other backward castes (OBC) and Extremely Backward Castes (EBC), to push demands for policies such as expanded quotas. After initial opposition, BJP also came around and supported the exercise.The survey found out that the EBCs constitute the largest portion at 36 per cent, along with the other backward classes at 27 per cent, which amounts to 63 per cent of the total 13.07 crore population of the state; together, they constitute the socially hefty segment of backward classes. Meanwhile, the “upper caste” groups among Hindus account for only 10.6 per cent.After the caste survey report, political parties claimed that the exercise would ensure representation proportional to each community’s population. However, this seems unlikely in the upcoming Bihar elections, as parties appear to be prioritising their traditional voter bases and other factors over population-based representation during the screening of the candidates.Catering to its traditional vote banks of Yadavs and Muslims, Rashtriya Janata Dal distributed tickets to 28 Yadavs and 6 Muslims. It also included candidates from the upper caste and EBC communities. However, the exact number is unknown as Tejashwi is yet to make an official announcement.Riding on the vote banks of the upper castes, BJP gave 49 tickets (48.5%) to upper caste candidates.

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Both gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-demerger-what-does-it-mean-for-investors-why-did-the-share-price-drop-40-explained/articleshow/124544495.cms,"The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units.

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Congress vs BJP:Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge Sparks Debate on RSS Event in Public Institutionss

NEW DELHI: Congress MLA K N Rajanna on Saturday raised questions over whether the Karnataka government would require Muslims to seek permission for performing 'namaz' (prayers) on roads, amid a new directive banning RSS activities in public places and government institutions without prior permission.Reacting to the order, Rajanna said he would watch how far it can actually be implemented. “We have to see to what extent it can be implemented,” he said.The former minister, who was sacked a few months ago, emphasised that only rules which can be enforced should be made, otherwise they will remain only in the books.Noting that the government order was based on a letter from minister Priyank Kharge, Rajanna said the minister had only stated that the RSS could hold events in public places after obtaining permission and had never suggested a total ban.“Now, we have Idgah. They (Muslims) offer Namaz on the road only. Do they take permission? Or will they listen if they are told to get permission first?” Rajanna asked, as quoted by PTI, highlighting what he sees as a potential double standard in enforcement.The Karnataka cabinet on Thursday decided to frame new rules to regulate Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activities, including marches and events held on government-owned properties and public roads.","The Karnataka cabinet on Thursday decided to frame new rules to regulate Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activities, including marches and events held on government-owned properties and public roads.

Jan Suraaj Party's Prashant Kishor Drops Bombshell, Reveals Why He Will Not Contest Bihar Elections

parivaar's

Mahagathbandhan

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor on Wednesday announced that he would stay out of the electoral fray in Bihar , even as he seeks to ""disrupt"" the state's power equation that has long swung between Nitish Kumar 's JD(U) and Lalu Prasad Yadav 's RJD .Prashant Kishor, who has served both the NDA and the Bihar(grand alliance) as a political strategist, has set for himself an ambitious target. To replace Nitish and Lalu in Bihar's caste-driven political landscape.But will his decision to stay out of the electoral ring give him an edge, or prove to be a strategic misstep?Rumours were rife that Kishor might throw a direct challenge to RJD’s successor Tejashwi Yadav from Raghopur, the Lalutraditional bastion. The speculation was not for no reason, as PK had on several instances hinted at contesting from the bastion of either Nitish or Tejashwi.But the buzz fizzled quickly, as PK on Tuesday fielded Chanchal Singh to take on Tejashwi instead.Kishor said that the party members asked him to concentrate on ensuring the victory of other party candidates, which is why he has decided not to contest the elections.The moment Kishor announced he would stay out of the contest, rivals pounced. Both the BJP and RJD took jibes at him for ""accepting defeat before the battle.""“Kishor realised that he would not win elections, and that is why he announced that he would not contest polls. Whatever he had invested in forming the Jan Suraaj Party had been recovered. His party is nothing but a ‘vote katwa’ (a party that cuts the votes of others). Jan Suraaj is the 'B' team of the RJD,"" Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh alleged.RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwary said: ""Kishor has realised that he and his party will face a humiliating defeat in the upcoming assembly polls. That is why he has announced that he will not contest. He has accepted defeat for the Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield.""Away from political jibes and rhetoric, is his decision truly about strengthening the Jan Suraaj in the polls, as PK claims, or is there more to it?Calling the move prudent, political analyst Kumar Vijay told TOI that if PK focuses on a single constituency, he cannot give time to party candidates.""He has taken the right decision because even CM Nitish Kumar is an MLC. Whoever leads a party needs more time. If he focuses on one constituency, he cannot give enough time to his party’s candidates. He is contesting elections across Bihar for the first time, and being the sole star of his party, I believe he thought it was prudent to devote his time to his candidates,"" Vijay said.Since Prashant Kishore is the lone big face of his party, his decision not to contest the polls has raised questions about whether it could dent the morale of his candidates.""In the present scenario, the way NDA andare fighting elections, they have created chaos in Bihar, especially in the ticket distribution system. This has given a certain edge to PK and Jan Suraaj because confusion has been created by these parties,"" Kumar Vijay told TOI.He also said that PK may not emerge as a giant slayer in the present scenario, but the ""ticket distribution system has brightened their (Jan Suraaj) chance to increase the tally"".In Bihar’s crowded political ring, Prashant Kishor has set an ambitious target of winning over 150 out of 243 seats for Jan Suraaj, calling anything less a defeat. For now, the claim looks like threading a needle in a storm.As Bihar’s campaign battle intensifies, his gamble will be tested against the state’s hard political math, where personality, perception, and caste arithmetic collide. Whether this outsider’s playbook rewrites Bihar’s politics or fades as another ambitious experiment will be the story to watch.","Prashant Kishor, who has served both the NDA and the Bihar(grand alliance) as a political strategist, has set for himself an ambitious target.

A shifting bloc



2020: Return of vote splits



Same forces, new dynamics



In the 1990s, the powerful ""MY"" (Muslim-Yadav) vote bank propelled Lalu Prasad Yadav to the summit of Bihar politics. Today, as his eldest son Tejashwi Yadav aims to repeat that feat, the crucial question is: which way will Muslim voters swing? With Prashant Kishor 's pledge to field 40 Muslim candidates and Asaduddin Owaisi ’s Grand Democratic Alliance, the answer might be more complex than ever.Filing of nominations for the first phase of polling closed on Friday, with over 1,250 candidates entering the fray for 121 seats to be contested on November 6. The remaining seats will go to the polls on November 11. The NDA, led by chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and the BJP, appears united and confident, while the opposition Mahagathbandhan, comprising the RJD, Congress and Left parties, is struggling with internal rifts and overlapping candidacies.JD(U) has released its complete list of 101 candidates, giving prominence to backward and extremely backward classes, but only four tickets to Muslim candidates. This limited representation has raised questions about whether Nitish Kumar’s party has moved away from its earlier efforts to engage minority voters, given its long-standing alliance with the BJP. In contrast, Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj has pledged to field 40 Muslim candidates, while AIMIM, led by Asaduddin Owaisi, has joined hands with smaller outfits under the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), announcing plans to contest 64 constituencies.The Election Commission’s 2022 caste survey revealed that Muslims make up 17.7% of Bihar’s population, about 23 million people, and hold significant influence in nearly 70 of the state’s 243 constituencies, particularly in Seemanchal districts such as Kishanganj (68%), Katihar (43%), Araria (42%) and Purnia (38%). With multiple parties now targeting the same voter base, the split in the Muslim vote could once again shape the outcome.Muslim voters have historically been pivotal in Bihar’s electoral politics, often voting as a bloc in support of secular coalitions. The 2010, 2015 and 2020 elections reveal how shifts in alliances and vote splits have impacted their representation.In 2010, the RJD fielded the highest number of Muslim candidates at 30, but only six won. Congress performed even worse, with only three of its 49 Muslim candidates winning all from Muslim-majority constituencies like Kishanganj, Kasba and Bahadurganj. The JD(U)-BJP alliance, then riding high on Nitish Kumar’s first term as chief minister, won a large share of seats, including in areas with substantial Muslim populations, mainly due to the consolidation of non-Muslim votes.Five years later, in 2015, the political landscape shifted dramatically. The RJD, JD(U) and Congress came together under the Mahagathbandhan banner, drawing nearly 80% of Muslim votes. This alliance resulted in the election of 24 Muslim MLAs, up from 19 in 2010. The RJD had 12, Congress six, JD(U) five, and the CPI-ML one. Four MLAs came from Muslim-dominated Kishanganj, three each from East Champaran and Purnia, and two each from Araria, Darbhanga and Katihar.Notably, the AIMIM failed to make a mark despite contesting six seats in Seemanchal. The BJP, which had fielded only two Muslim candidates, saw both lose. As RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui pointed out at the time, the increase in Muslim representation was welcome but still fell short of reflecting their 16% population share.The 2015 results reaffirmed the strength of the “MY” (Muslim-Yadav) coalition, long seen as the backbone of RJD’s social base, and marked a period of renewed confidence among minority voters in mainstream alliances.The 2020 assembly election once again saw fragmentation in Muslim voting patterns. The Grand Alliance, now led by Tejashwi Yadav, weakened as Owaisi’s AIMIM gained ground in Seemanchal, winning five seats. Although four of those MLAs later defected to the RJD, AIMIM’s performance underscored its growing appeal among young Muslim voters disillusioned with both the RJD and Congress.The RJD fielded 18 Muslim candidates, out of which eight won, while the Congress had 11 Muslim candidates and managed only four victories. The JD(U), despite being part of the NDA, failed to elect any Muslim MLA. In total, 19 Muslim legislators made it to the assembly, five fewer than in 2015.The 2020 election marked the end of a decade-long trend of consolidation and a return to fragmentation. While the Grand Alliance retained support in several mixed constituencies, AIMIM’s entry in Seemanchal altered traditional vote patterns, cutting into the secular coalition’s base and indirectly benefiting the NDA.As the 2025 election nears, political alignments are shifting. The RJD-Congress alliance remains the largest opposition bloc but is struggling with clear disagreements over seat-sharing. At the same time, AIMIM has formed the Grand Democratic Alliance with Chandrashekhar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party and Swami Prasad Maurya’s AJP, introducing fresh competition for the Muslim vote.Meanwhile, JD(U) and BJP’s joint strategy seems aimed at consolidating the majority vote while conceding limited ground to minorities. With Muslims influencing nearly one-third of Bihar’s constituencies, how this community votes, united or divided, will once again determine not just the number of seats won, but who governs the state.","Muslim voters have historically been pivotal in Bihar’s electoral politics, often voting as a bloc in support of secular coalitions.

'India-China Partners, Not Rivals': PM Modi Stresses 'Strategic Autonomy' In Talks With Xi Jinping

NEW DELHI: China Eastern Airlines will be the first Chinese carrier to resume direct India flights after an over five-year lull with a thrice-weekly service between Shanghai and Delhi from November 9. IndiGo is the first Indian carrier that will resume China service with a daily between Kolkata & Guangzhou from October 26 and then Delhi & Guangzhou from November 10. Air India will fly to the country before the end of the year and other Chinese carriers will have India flights too.In 2019, India and China had 539 direct flights operated by airlines including Air India, IndiGo, China Southern and China Eastern. In March 2020, international flights were halted during Covid. Since then travelling between India and China means doing so through a third country, mostly in Southeast Asia.While IndiGo will use its single aisle Airbus A320s on the first two announced China routes, China Eastern will operate wide body A330s.The aviation ministry had said on X October 2 that direct flights between the two countries “follow continuous technical-level engagement between civil aviation authorities as part of broader efforts to normalise bilateral ties. The move will greatly enhance air connectivity, support people-to-people exchanges and contribute to the strengthening of economic collaboration between the two countries.”",China Eastern Airlines will be the first Chinese carrier to resume direct India flights after an over five-year lull.

Optics vs reality

""Not a sign of disintegration""

A bigger bloc, more arithmetic

Friendly fights and withdrawal loophole

Not the first messy start

NDA's campaign mode on

NEW DELHI: As nominations for Phase 1 of the Bihar assembly elections closed on Friday, the NDA appeared battle-ready, its candidate list finalised, campaign plan rolled out.Across the aisle, the opposition's Mahagathbandhan (or INDIA bloc), led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), continues to debate who fights where. Congress and RJD, which are still holding talks, have also declared a few of its candidates for the high-prestige contest.This, obviously, has given a big ammunition to the NDA which has claimed that the Mahagathbandhan has crumbled even before the contest.Yet, despite the optics of confusion, alliance leaders insist the delay signals expansion, not disarray.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been part of the opposition bloc's discussions, said such coordination takes time. ""Coordination matters more than speed,"" he quipped, adding that the bloc’s final list would be announced soon.Congress leader Pawan Khera on Thursday also questioned why NDA was concerned about Mahagathbandhan's deal.Khera informed that candidates were filing their nominations and the procedure for seat distribution was under way. He affirmed clearance on the situation and mentioned that the Mahagathbandhan government will be formed in Bihar.""The work is going on very well, symbols are being distributed. Those who have to file nominations are also doing so. The process has started... Very soon, the entire situation will be clear to everyone. The Mahagathbandhan government is going to be formed. Why is the NDA raising questions? They should think about themselves,"" Khera told ANI.CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya dismissed speculation of infighting within the opposition alliance.""People may feel there is chaos in the INDIA bloc. But the delay in announcing seats is because more constituents are on board this time. It’s definitely not a sign of disintegration,” he told PTI.Bhattacharya revealed that his party, which won 12 of the 19 seats it contested in 2020, would field roughly the same number this time.This year's Mahagathbandhan is more crowded than in 2020, when it included the RJD, Congress, and the three Left parties — CPI(ML), CPI, and CPI(M).Now, Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has joined the fold, while talks are under way with Hemant Soren’s JMM, which wants to contest a few border seats.Congress, meanwhile, has released its first list of 48 candidates even before the seat-sharing formula was finalised - a move that signalled both impatience and self-confidence. Among the key names are state chief Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), CLP leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa), and Youth Congress chief Prakash Garib Das (Bachhwara).In Bachhwara, however, CPI’s Awadesh Roy has also filed papers, creating what insiders call a ""friendly contest"", a common phenomenon in Bihar’s multi-party coalitions.Sources within the bloc told PTI said RJD has tentatively agreed to allot 61 seats to the Congress, with some negotiations still underway over high-stakes constituencies.In India’s electoral playbook, such overlaps between allies are common. When alliances negotiate till the last minute, parties often field 'friendly' candidates in the same seats, using the withdrawal window to clean up overlaps once the deal is sealed.The withdrawal window, which opens after nominations close, gives them room to tidy up overlaps once the final deal is sealed. Candidates in overlapping seats typically withdraw nominations at the last minute, leaving only the officially endorsed name in the fray.With the Phase 1 withdrawal deadline on Monday, and Phase 2 deadline on Thursday, several overlapping candidates are likely to quietly withdraw once the bloc finalises its list.This isn’t the first time Bihar’s opposition has walked into an election season with unresolved seat-sharing issues.In 2020, the RJD and Congress sparred till the eleventh hour over key constituencies, and yet, the alliance went on to deliver one of its strongest performances in years, falling just short of defeating the NDA. The Grand Alliance registered win on 110 seats out of 243. Tejashwi Yadav's RJD emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and he was election leader of opposition in the assembly.The Left parties contested as part of the alliance and performed notably well, especially CPI-ML(L) that won 12 seats. Congress secured 19 seats.That precedent might have made leaders more relaxed about the optics of delay.The NDA, by contrast, has its machinery in motion. The JD(U) and BJP are contesting 101 seats each, with allies LJP (Ram Vilas), RLM, and HAM covering the rest.The BJP’s 40-member star campaigner list, led by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, signals a high-energy campaign. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking his 10th term, is pitching continuity and stability, while the opposition bets on discontent, voter fatigue and anti-incumbency.The first phase of voting will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14. For now, the NDA may have the early advantage in optics, but Mahagathbandhan's late start may not necessarily have an impact on the final results.","BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls.

What is the case against Mehul Choksi?



A Belgian court on Friday ordered the extradition of fugitive Mehul Choksi to India, news agency PTI reported citing officials. Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.""The order has come in our favour. The court has termed his arrest by the Belgian authorities on India's request valid. The first legal step in getting him extradited is now clear,"" a senior official told PTI.Officials stated that the order marks a significant validation of India's efforts to secure Mehul Choksi's extradition, although he still has the option to appeal the decision in a higher Belgian court. Prosecutors argued before the court that Choksi poses a flight risk and should not be released from custody, the officials told PTI.Choksi, who relocated to Belgium in 2023 after leaving Antigua and Barbuda, was arrested there in April following India’s extradition request. He and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused of defrauding the bank of over Rs 13,000 crore.India had earlier assured Belgian authorities that if extradited, Choksi will be housed in Barrack No. 12 at Arthur Road jail, Mumbai, with adequate space and no risk of overcrowding or solitary confinement.The Union home ministry, in a September 4 communique, confirmed that the cell meets the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) of Europe’s minimum space standards.Choksi fled to Antigua and Barbuda, where he acquired citizenship, before being apprehended in Belgium. India’s agencies swiftly coordinated to secure his extradition. The cell assigned to Choksi measures roughly 20 by 15 feet, with a separate toilet, ventilation, and security measures. Inmates receive daily cleaning, fresh water, outdoor exercise, board games, yoga sessions, and access to media and telemedicine. Weekly family visits and daily legal consultations are permitted.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in a Rs 13,000 crore fraud involving fraudulent Letters of Undertaking issued by Punjab National Bank. Nirav Modi, a declared fugitive economic offender, is currently jailed in London and contesting extradition. The CBI’s extradition request cites the UN conventions against corruption and organised crime, supported by arrest warrants from Mumbai courts. The fraud involved PNB issuing 165 LoUs and 58 Foreign Letters of Credit in 2017 without limits or proper records, leading to massive losses covered by the bank.Authorities allege that loans were obtained from overseas banks across locations including Mauritius, Hong Kong, Antwerp, and Frankfurt based on these fraudulent guarantees. When the companies failed to repay, PNB was forced to pay over Rs 6,300 crore, including interest, to these foreign banks.","Fugitive Jeweller Mehul Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.

Rajnath Singh, Yogi Adityanath Flag Off First Batch of BrahMos Missiles from Lucknow Unit

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday warned Pakistan that every inch of its territory is now within the range of India’s BrahMos missiles, calling Operation Sindoor “just a trailer” of India’s capabilities. The operation showed that victory has become a habit for India, he added.Singh, along with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, flagged off the first batch of BrahMos missiles manufactured at the BrahMos Aerospace unit in Sarojini Nagar, Lucknow.Describing BrahMos as a symbol of India’s rising strength, Singh said, ""BrahMos is not just a missile, it is proof of India's strategic confidence. From the Army to the Navy and the Air Force, it has become a key pillar of our defence forces.""He added that India’s defence capabilities now serve as a strong deterrent. ""Every inch of Pakistan's territory lies within range of BrahMos. What happened during Operation Sindoor was just a trailer. It made Pakistan realise that if India could create Pakistan, then if the time comes... I need not say more, you all are wise enough,"" he said.Operation Sindoor, Singh said, proved that ""victory is not just a small incident for us but it has become a habit.""He said the operation instilled confidence among Indians and demonstrated BrahMos’ effectiveness to the world. ""Maintaining this confidence is now our collective responsibility. The entire world now recognises India's capability. BrahMos has strengthened our belief that India can turn its dreams into reality,"" he said.Operation Sindoor, carried out in May, targeted terror infrastructure and defence installations in Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir on April 22 that killed 26 people. Armed forces used indigenously developed BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to strike Pakistan’s air bases during the operation.On the manufacturing of BrahMos at Lucknow, Singh said the project represents India’s growing confidence and capability in defence production. “Lucknow is not just my parliamentary constituency, it resides in my soul. Today, it has become a city of technology and industry, apart from culture and tradition. The successful production of BrahMos missiles here shows that what was once a dream has now become a reality. The project represents patience, hard work and determination,” he said.UP CM Adityanath said the event is a proud moment for Uttar Pradesh and reflects Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ vision. “Under the Defence Industrial Corridor, Uttar Pradesh is emerging as a major hub of indigenous defence manufacturing. The BrahMos unit is a shining example of that. With a missile like BrahMos, India is now not only able to meet its own security needs but also those of its allies in the world,” he said.The UP CM added that his government is committed to supporting projects that strengthen national security and create employment and technical expertise in the region.Inaugurated on May 11, the state-of-the-art BrahMos Aerospace unit includes facilities for missile integration, testing, and final quality checks. After successful testing, the missiles are prepared for deployment by the armed forces.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh warns Pakistan that every inch of its territory is now within the range of India’s BrahMos missiles.

The seat-sharing surprise

The bargaining power

The kingmaker potential

Beyond caste politics - the youth factor

NEW DELHI: When Ram Vilas Paswan, Bihar's legendary political ""weatherman,"" passed away in 2020, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) seemed at a crossroads. His son, Chirag Paswan, stepped in to lead the party, inheriting both the mantle and the expectations of a Dalit political legacy.Since taking over, Chirag has sought to modernise the party’s image, balance traditional constituency support, and stake a claim in the larger NDA alliance. His induction into the Union cabinet added national credibility and signalled his clout within the NDA. Now, he faces another test, the 2025 Bihar assembly elections — a test of both his leadership and political strategy.However, even before November 14, when votes are counted, Chirag has already emerged as a winner in terms of influence and positioning within the NDA alliance.Chirag’s negotiation skills were on full display during NDA seat-sharing talks. Engaging in multiple rounds of discussions with senior BJP and JD(U) leaders, Chirag held firm on his demands until favourable terms were agreed upon.As a result, LJP(RV) secured 29 seats, making it the largest junior ally in the NDA. As BJP and JD(U) settled for 101 seats each, other smaller allies, Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's RLM, were allotted only six seats each.This elevated seat share signals Chirag's rising clout in Bihar politics and marks him as a key player in post-election arithmetic, irrespective of the NDA’s overall performance.Chirag Paswan's electoral performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls strengthened his bargaining position. LJP(RV) contested five seats in Bihar and won all five, registering a 100% success rate. The party also secured a nearly 6% statewide vote share, demonstrating that Chirag can mobilise voters beyond the party’s traditional Paswan-Dalit base.In previous assembly elections, LJP(RV) had a mixed record, but the Lok Sabha sweep has cemented Chirag’s reputation as a vote-getter. This electoral credit seems to have not only boosted his confidence during alliance talks but also forced larger NDA partners to accommodate his demands on both the number and strategic importance of constituencies.The BJP is probably looking at Chirag not merely as a junior partner but also as a strategic asset. With chief minister Nitish Kumar seeking a 10th term, the 29 LJP(RV) seats could prove pivotal in government formation.Chirag's willingness to challenge, renegotiate, or even realign his party at short notice adds another layer of influence. Political insiders suggest that the LJP(RV) leader could emerge as a kingmaker, shaping both cabinet formation and NDA’s legislative strategy post-elections.Chirag is working to transform the party’s image, positioning LJP(RV) as a pan-Bihar force rather than a purely caste-based outfit. His ""Bihar First, Bihari First"" campaign is emphasising on development, youth employment and governance reform.The strategy resonated with first-time voters and women, especially in urban and semi-urban pockets, who have traditionally been ambivalent about caste-based politics. If this outreach succeeds, Chirag could translate his traditional base into a broader mandate, enhancing his bargaining power in future coalition politics.With more seats than any other smaller ally, a proven track record in the Lok Sabha, negotiation leverage, kingmaker potential, and a growing voter base beyond his traditional Paswan constituency, Chirag Paswan enters the 2025 Bihar assembly elections as the biggest NDA gainer.","Chirag Paswan has sought to modernise the party’s image, balance traditional constituency support, and stake a claim in the larger NDA alliance.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested 7 seats, winning 4, achieving 0.9% of the vote share and a 32.9% strike rate.","BJP, Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan have 40% chance of retaining power.

It will contest six assembly seats – Chakai, Dhamdaha, Katoria (ST), Manihari (ST), Jamui and Pirpainti (SC).” These seats will go to polls in the second phase on November 11.Elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with counting of votes on November 14.Bhattacharya said the JMM had on October 11 informed INDIA bloc leaders that it would decide independently on contesting the Bihar elections if “a respectful number of seats” was not allotted to it by October 14. The party had sought 12 seats as part of the coalition.“We had urged constituents of the INDIA bloc like the Congress, Left parties and the RJD, which is one of the largest parties in Bihar, to provide the seats demanded by the JMM.In the 2019 Jharkhand election, we had given our support to Congress and RJD. The party not only gave seven seats to RJD, but also made its MLA from Chatra a minister,” he said.“Even in the 2024 Jharkhand polls, JMM gave six seats to the RJD and accommodated an MLA as minister,” Bhattacharya added, as quoted by PTI.Commenting on the political scenario in Bihar, Bhattacharya said the contest will be multi-cornered and marked by internal divisions. “The battle of Bihar is a multi-corner fight where infighting prevails in the NDA as well as the INDIA bloc,” he said.“We will fight, win and make sure that without the JMM, no government is formed in Bihar,” he asserted. “And, after the Bihar polls, the JMM will have a relook at the coalition in Jharkhand.”The party also announced a list of 20 “star campaigners” for the Bihar elections, led by its president and Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren. Other campaigners include the CM’s wife and Gandey MLA Kalpana Soren, Dumka legislator Basant Soren, and senior leaders Stephen Marandi and Sarfaraj Ahmed.","The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Saturday announced that it will contest the Bihar assembly elections independently.

In the upcoming Bihar assembly election, multiple factors will come into play including caste dynamics, anti-incumbency sentiments, internal rifts in both major coalitions, the emergence of new political players like Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party and significant voter-driven issues like unemployment and development.Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Bihar this year on 6 November and 11 November to elect a total of 243 members. Here are the key factors playing a role:Long-time chief minister Nitish Kumar, at the forefront for nearly two decades, faces increasing anti-incumbency sentiment and voter fatigue with his shifting alliances also raising questions about his credibility.RJD's leader Tejashwi Yadav is gaining popularity, particularly among the youth, by focusing on issues like jobs and migration. He was named the Mahagathbandhan's chief ministerial candidate, though some question his leadership experience and the party's legacy.The NDA government faces considerable anti-incumbency, but this is among the opposition, potentially neutralizing its effect. Both alliances are relying on welfare schemes to sway voters.The election features a close contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition INDIA bloc (Mahagathbandhan).Both major coalitions are dealing with internal conflicts over seat-sharing.The NDA has seen tensions between the BJP and JD(U), partly due to past actions involving Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), who was allegedly used as a 'vote-cutter' against chief minister Nitish Kumar in 2020 but is now a key NDA ally.Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan is seeing infighting, with candidates from its member parties, such as the RJD and Congress, contesting against each other in some constituencies.Traditionally, the NDA has relied on support from upper castes, non-Yadav OBCs, and Mahadalits, while the Mahagathbandhan has depended on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) vote bank.However, voting patterns are becoming more fluid. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Mahagathbandhan made inroads into the Scheduled Caste (SC) vote by focusing on social justice issues and reservations.The Dalit vote, which makes up 20% of the electorate, is complex and fragmented among different sub-castes. While some sub-castes align with the NDA through leaders like Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi, others are shifting toward the Mahagathbandhan.Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) has emerged as a potential disruptor by appealing to youth and educated voters on a platform of development and non-traditional caste politics.Once among India’s most sought-after election strategists, Prashant however announced that he would stay away from contesting this year’s Bihar polls — a decision he said was taken 'in the larger interest' of his Jan Suraaj Party.His sharp criticism targets both NDA and Mahagathbandhan leaders, challenging their credibility and governance. He has described this election as a make-or-break moment for his party, stating it will either finish first or last, leaving no middle ground.Meanwhile, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has announced the launch of a new third front — the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA). The alliance brings together AIMIM, Chandrasekhar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party (ASP) and Swami Prasad Maurya’s Apna Janata Party (AJP). It plans to field candidates in at least 64 of the 243 constituencies.A recent statewide caste census found that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) constitute over 63% of the population. This has intensified the focus on caste-based mobilization.Bihar's total population of approximately 13.07 crore is divided along caste lines as follows: Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) constitute about 36.01%, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) 27.12%, Scheduled Castes (SCs) 19.65%, Scheduled Tribes (STs) 1.68%, and General Category about 15.38%.BJP leans on upper-caste blocs, Brahmins, Rajputs, Bhumihars and Kayasthas, who, while a minority, wield outsized influence. However, the party, which is aiming to be self-sufficient in Bihar without relying heavily on the JDU alliance, has broadened its outreach to non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs by elevating leaders from those groups and secured roughly 30% of votes in recent contests through this social mix.The Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar faces a complex caste and electoral landscape shaped by the state's diverse demographic composition. Together, this Muslim-Yadav combination makes up more than 30% of the electorate supporting RJD. The Indian National Congress garners support mainly from upper castes, some OBC sub-groups, and urban voters, forming a moderate but significant segment of the Mahagathbandhan.A major concern for voters is high unemployment and the ongoing out-migration of youth seeking better job prospects elsewhere.Both alliances have made ambitious economic promises that critics say the state budget can barely afford, raising questions about their feasibility.Women are emerging as a distinct voting bloc, with the NDA seeing stronger support among women voters partly due to welfare schemes.Bihar's significant Muslim population remains a decisive force, with the Mahagathbandhan largely backed by Muslim voters. However, AIMIM and JSP could potentially divide this vote.","Bihar will vote in two phases - 6 and 11 November.

'Amit Shah Behaving Like Acting PM': Mamata Banerjee's 'Mir Jafar' Warning To PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that while infiltration has stopped in BJP-ruled Assam , it continues in neighbouring West Bengal, claiming that the state government is giving a ""red carpet welcome"" to illegal immigrants.Addressing a media conclave in Patna, Shah also mocked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for dropping the allegation of ""vote theft,"" and said the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls would remove ""infiltrators.""""It is baffling that the opposition has been getting a bellyache over an exercise launched by the Election Commission, which would weed out infiltrators. I am fully in support of the SIR exercise, which would eventually take place in the entire country,"" he said at the conclave, as reported by news agency PTI.When reminded that the opposition blamed the Centre for infiltration in the country, which has been in power at the Centre for 11 years, Shah said, ""People sitting in Lutyens Delhi have no idea of what the borders are like. The border with Bangladesh has dense forests and mighty rivers, which are in spate during the monsoons. Fencing is impossible, and so is round-the-clock vigil. Boats for security personnel manning the borders also tend to get washed away.""My point is, when a person from the neighbouring country enters our territory, can it not be known to the local police station and the patwari? Why do these officials not raise an alarm? Because they are under orders from above to give a red carpet ('lal jaajim') welcome to these infiltrators. This is the reason why infiltration is rampant in West Bengal but has been checked in Assam,"" he added.Shah urged people in West Bengal to vote out chief minister Mamata Banerjee in next year’s assembly elections and promised to ""drive out every infiltrator"" from the state.Claiming that Gandhi has dropped the ""vote chori"" charge, Shah said, ""on the very few occasions that he has been seen in public, he has never made the charge in the last 15 days. Perhaps the people of Bihar have made him give up on the charge. He must have been under advice based on some feedback.""The reference was to Gandhi’s 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' in Bihar, which protested the SIR exercise, alleging it aimed to disenfranchise voters.Shah also rejected opposition claims that the 130th Constitutional Amendment Bill, which allows removal of ministers including the PM and CMs if jailed for 30 days or more, was meant to destabilise governments in non-BJP states.""I had stepped down when a case was pending against me in the court, and did not accept a post until I was acquitted. We have seen, in the recent past, governments being run by people behind bars. That cannot be allowed. Why is the opposition so scared? The Bill does not stipulate that a minister be removed as soon as his name comes up in an FIR,"" he said.","Union home minister Amit Shah says West Bengal is giving a ""red carpet welcome"" to illegal immigrants.

'Mungerilal ke haseen sapne?'



Can Jan Suraaj really disrupt the two-horse race?



NEW DELHI: For nearly three decades, Bihar has been dominated by socialist forces, with Lalu Prasad ’s RJD and Nitish Kumar ’s JD(U) shaping the state’s political landscape. Since 1990, these two stalwarts of the JP movement have kept national parties on the sidelines. Ahead of the 2025 elections, however, a new narrative is emerging. Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj is attempting, perhaps for the first time, to challenge the decades-old socialist discourse and offer an alternative vision for Bihar.Kishor-led Jan Suraaj has opened the doors to a third-front contest, challenging both Nitish Kumar-led NDA and the Mahagathbandhan, now fronted by Lalu’s son, Tejashwi Yadav . Notably, Jan Suraaj may be the only Bihar-based party contesting all 243 seats.Could this be the start of a new political mood in Bihar? The party is staking its claim on issues like employment, education, and migration, moving away from the traditional caste-centered politics that have dominated the state for decades. Jan Suraaj can be now viewed as a party of parallel politics or alternative politics, offering voters a local option beyond the familiar two fronts.On being asked byabout Jan Suraaj chief Kishor’s efforts and whether he could challenge Bihar’s two-horse race, political analystsaid: ""Prashant Kishor has emerged as a significant factor in Bihar elections.Wherever he fields Muslim-Yadav candidates, he will dent the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, and wherever he fields upper-caste candidates, he will impact the NDA. He will certainly be a strong factor for both factions.""On whether his issues will translate into votes, Vijay added: ""The issues he is raising are reaching the masses, but how they convert into votes remains to be seen on the D-Day.""Addressing Kishor’s decision not to contest the polls, Vijay drew a parallel with current CM Nitish Kumar, who also doesn’t contest assembly elections and remains an MLC: ""His exit won’t really affect Jan Suraaj’s experiment or harm its prospects. It doesn’t carry much weight. People in Bihar are politically aware; they will decide quietly, and it’s difficult to gauge public mood on the roads.""This time, Kishor is himself in the fray as the leader of the party he launched last year, Jan Suraaj, aiming for an upset akin to AAP’s shock victory in Delhi in 2015.That may sound far-fetched, yet PK can hardly be faulted for lack of effort. He has travelled across Bihar, drawing on his years of campaign experience for others, and launched an ambitious drive that takes direct aim at the entrenched political class.Fed up with Congress rule in the early 1990s, Bihar turned to Lalu Prasad and RJD, reshaping politics under the influence of Mandal-era dynamics. Lalu-Rabri’s tenure of over a decade entrenched the family-first ethos, but was often criticised for corruption and poor law-and-order, earning the nickname “jungleraaj.”Then came Nitish Kumar, who emerged as Bihar’s longest-serving CM. Yet, despite reforms and initiatives, the state remained one of India’s most backward, struggling with GDP per capita, poverty, and development indicators, creating fertile ground for voters seeking alternatives.A recent C-Voter survey revealed that Prashant Kishor is the second most preferred leader for the chief ministerial post, behind Tejashwi Yadav and ahead of Nitish Kumar, signalling significant public confidence in his leadership potential.Prashant Kishor confirmed he will not contest the upcoming assembly elections, saying this was for the “greater good” of his party. Speaking to PTI, he said,“If I were to contest, it would distract me from necessary organisational work.”He added that Chanchal Singh will contest against Tejashwi Yadav in Raghopur instead.Kishor’s own prediction is audacious: “I can say with certainty that we will either win handsomely or receive a drubbing. I have been stating on record that I expect a tally of either fewer than 10 seats or more than 150 seats. There is no possibility of anything in between.”Despite stepping aside, he exudes confidence: “We will either win handsomely or face a complete drubbing. There’s no middle ground. A tally below 150 will be a defeat for me.”The reactions from rival parties have been scathing. RJD claimed Kishor has “accepted defeat for his Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield,” while BJP said, “Kishor realised he would not win elections.” JD(U) called it a “humiliation for his party workers.”RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary said, “Kishor’s tyre has been flattened,” BJP’s Niraj Kumar added, “his bubble burst even before the elections,” and JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar said, “He has run away before the electoral battle.” Union minister Giriraj Singh mocked the venture as “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne,” calling Jan Suraaj a “vote katwa” and “RJD’s B team.”Observers note that PK’s Brahmin background and leadership style could appeal to upper-caste youth who feel excluded in Bihar politics. Yet the state’s political structure remains largely bipolar, meaning Jan Suraaj risks being seen as a spoiler rather than a serious contender.A top poll strategist-turned-politician has surprisingly opted out of contesting his party’s first election, raising questions about his approach.While NDA has mostly finalised seat-sharing, the Mahagathbandhan’s candidate announcements remain a bit indecisive on some seats over seat-sharing discussions.Bihar now faces not just an RJD vs JD(U)/NDA battle, but a potential challenge from Jan Suraaj, testing voter appetite for a new political alternative.","Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj is attempting, perhaps for the first time, to challenge the decades-old socialist discourse.

Can NDA hold its fort?

BJP's development push for the region

Ministers, stars in the polls fray

Mahagathbandhan's resistance

NEW DELHI: In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, despite the consecration of the Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost the Faizabad seat to the Samajwadi Party . However, it retained all the seats in Bihar's Mithilanchal, considered the paternal home of Sita, Lord Ram’s wife.As Bihar gears up for the assembly elections, Patna may hold the throne, but the two Maithili-speaking regions — Tirhut and Mithilanchal — remain crucial.Bihar can be divided into five regions: Tirhut, Mithilanchal, Kosi-Seemanchal, Magadh, and Bhojpur. Tirhut and Mithlanchal send about 80 MLAs to the 243-member assembly.The Mithilanchal region consists of Madhubani, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Saharsa, and Supaul districts, where Maithil Brahmins, Yadavs, Extremely Backward Caste communities, Dalits, and Muslims are the key communities.Mithilanchal is considered a bastion of the NDA, which secured a narrow victory in 2020 due to its strong performance in this region. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, BJP and JD(U) outperformed RJD and Congress, claiming all seven Lok Sabha seats in the region.However, in the 2015 assembly polls, JD(U), as an ally of the RJD-Congress Mahagathbandhan, had won the maximum seats in this region with 19 seats, followed by RJD with 14, while Congress managed 11.The rest were won by other parties. BJP had won 18 seats in this region.Ahead of the upcoming elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has long focused on this region, emphasising developmental policies. In August this year, Union Home Minister Amit Shah laid the foundation stone and performed Bhumi Pujan for the new Mata Janki Temple at Punauradham in Sitamarhi, which will be completed at a cost of more than Rs 883 crore across 67 acres.He also flagged off the New Delhi–Sitamarhi Amrit Bharat Express train.In 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation for a new civil enclave at Darbhanga airport, with Rs 912 crore allotted for its development.In the 2025 Union Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the setting up of a Makhana Board in Bihar to support production, processing, and global marketing. Interestingly, the nine key districts in the Mithila region that are major Makhana cultivation hubs are Darbhanga, Madhubani, Purnea, Katihar, Saharsa, Supaul, Araria, Kishanganj, and Sitamarhi.In 2024, PM Modi also laid the foundation stone for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Darbhanga, the second AIIMS facility in Bihar after the state capital, Patna. AIIMS Darbhanga will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 1,264 crore on 187 acres of land.Cabinet ministers are in the poll fray from this region, including Jibesh Mishra from Jale, Sanjay Saraogi from Darbhanga, Krishna Kumar Mantoo from Amnour, and Bijaendra Prasad Yadav from Supaul. Meanwhile, fresh face like folk singer Maithili Thakur has also been fielded by BJP from Alinagar in the region. She has been fielded from Alipur seat.On the other hand, the Mahagathbandhan is actively campaigning to improve its prospects in the region. Congress and RJD’s Voter Adhikar Yatra covered a major part of Mithilanchal, where leaders campaigned against chief minister Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister Modi. However, the campaign suffered a dent after abuses were allegedly hurled at PM Modi during the final leg of the yatra in Darbhanga, leading to a political showdown.RJD's Rabri Devi has also demanded statehood for the Mithila region. The creation of a “Mithilanchal” state is a demand raised intermittently by cultural activists of the region, though it has received only tepid support at times.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections . The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","Mithilanchal is considered a bastion of the NDA, which secured a narrow victory in 2020 due to its strong performance in this region. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, BJP and JD(U) outperformed RJD and Congress, claiming all seven Lok Sabha seats in the region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation for a new civil enclave at Darbhanga airport.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124663567,imgsize-1650361,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Left's striking show in 2020



Muslim & communist: Bihar's own Zohran Mamdani



Raising alarm on SIR



NEW DELHI: In Bihar’s ever-colorful political arena, where alliances shift as swiftly as monsoon clouds, the 2020 Assembly elections offered a rare sight — a showdown between saffron and red. The state, known for its complex caste equations and coalition compulsions, witnessed an unexpected surge from the Left, shaking up the familiar power equations.In 2020, the Left parties, particularly the CPI(ML), emerged as a formidable force, almost matching the BJP ’s strike rate and outperforming the larger allies within the Mahagathbandhan.Five years later, as Bihar heads to the polls again, the Left finds itself in a familiar spot, pushing for a fairer share in seat distribution, even as negotiations within the alliance remain uncertain. With no seat-sharing deal announced yet, CPI(ML) released a list of 20 candidates, with its general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya expressing that they ""deserved more"".But is their demand for greater seat-share is justified?With a strike rate of 63.2%, CPI (ML) was not far behind the BJP, which had a strike rate of 67.3%. It won 12 of the 19 seats it contested. Moreover, the Communist Party of India (CPI) had a strike rate of 33.33%.CPI and CPM contested six and four seats respectively, and one two each.The Left parties, undoubtedly gave a tough fight to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The then CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury had expressed that the Left would have performed better had it been given higher number of seats.The Left parties contested on 29 of 243 seats and won 16, pulling off a combined strike rate of over 50%.Five years later, one would wonder that the Mahagathbandhan would ensure a ""dignified"" seat share for the Left parties. With no announcement on the same yet, the situation doesn't look promising this time as well.Dipankar Bhattacharya said the party has fielded 20 candidates in the ""spirit of the coalition"", however, they wanted at least 24.""We have maintained the spirit of coalition. Although we deserved more seats this time, we finally decided to contest only 20 assembly segments. We wanted to contest at least 24 seats this time, but it could not be materialised,"" he said.Moreover, similar sentiments were expressed by CPI leader D Raja noting the party's ""great history in Bihar"".""We will try to get more seats. If other parties are demanding, our party has a great history in Bihar and it has a widespread presence and organisational strength and our party can decide the political course in different district. So we should get reasonable number of seats,"" he had said.Muslim, communist and the poorest of them all, CPI (ML)'s Mahboob Alam was everything a mainstream party avoids its candidate to be. Alam went on to bag Balrampur seat emerging victorious with one of the highest vote margins.The five-time MLA's success, however, did not translate into a tangible result, as this year, BJP did not include a single Muslim in its 101 candidate list. Moreover, its ally JD(U) too distanced itself from Muslim voters as it named only four minority candidates in its list.CPI(ML)-Liberation has been vocal about the SIR (Special Intensive Revision) exercise, arguing that the deletions from the voter list reveal a disturbing pattern of social exclusion. According to the party’s general secretary, Dipankar Bhattacharya, the cuts disproportionately affect vulnerable sections such as women, the poor, migrant workers, Dalits, and Muslims.He pointed out that the districts with the highest number of deletions — Gopalganj, Kishanganj, and Purnia — include Muslim-majority and Dalit-dominated areas, suggesting that these were not mere technical errors but a deliberate pattern of marginalization.","The Left parties contested on 29 of 243 seats and won 16, pulling off a combined strike rate of over 50%. The then CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury had expressed that the Left would have performed better had it been given higher number of seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124661416,imgsize-1390354,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Pakistan army chief Asim Munir on Saturday repeated his anti-India rhetoric amid its ongoing border tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan.

The resulting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculations of the perpetrators of chaos and instability,"" he said.After a wave of warnings, Munir placed ""onus of ensuing escalations"" on India saying, ""The onus of ensuing escalations, one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond, will squarely lie with India.""""Settle the core issues with Pakistan as per the international norms on the basis of equality and mutual respect. We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively beyond proportions to even a minor provocation without any qualms,"" he said.India has repeatedly warned of Operation Sindoor 2.0 against Pakistan-based terror groups in case of any aggression from the other side. During the May 7 military operations, India targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists.The Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22.However, this is not the first time that Munir has made unprovoked statements against India. In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one. Muslims are distinct from Hindus in all aspects of life – religion, customs, traditions, thinking and aspirations.""","Pakistan army chief Asim Munir repeated his anti-India rhetoric amid its ongoing border tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan.

Jitan Manjhi

, Bihar NDA’s ‘Mountain Man’?

NEW DELHI: Since November 2005, Bihar has had only two chief ministers — Nitish Kumar and Jitan Ram Manjhi. The office has become almost synonymous with Kumar, who has now held it continuously for nearly 20 years.Yet, when Kumar temporarily stepped aside — for only nine months, as it turned out — he chose Manjhi as his successor. Today, the two no longer share that closeness, the trust, or a party, but remain in the same alliance. And Manjhi, a regional party leader whose support can still tilt the balance in favour of the state’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), continues to matter.The 81-year-old is a seasoned politician whose career spans over four decades. He began in 1980 with the Congress and later joined the Janata Dal, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and Janata Dal (United) before founding his own party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) [HAM(S)].A former seven-time MLA, Manjhi has served in multiple Bihar governments and currently represents Gaya in the Lok Sabha. He is also the Union Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in the BJP-led NDA’s central government.However, his biggest political breakthrough came in 2014, when he became the chief minister of Bihar.In February 2015, Manjhi had a bitter fallout with Kumar and the JD(U). Kumar had resigned as Bihar CM in May 2014, taking responsibility for the party’s poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections, where it won only 2 of Bihar’s 40 seats.However, within months, Manjhi was asked to step down to allow Kumar’s return. He initially resisted, but after being expelled from the JD(U), he tendered his resignation days later. Soon after, in May 2015, he launched the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) .Since then, the two leaders have been on-and-off allies, primarily within the NDA.The party has contested four elections so far - three as an NDA constituent and one as an ally of the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (part of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance nationally).The party has been given 6 seats to contest in the upcoming elections, significantly fewer than the 15 seats it had initially demanded.Though the HAM(S) has a relatively small vote share, under 2 per cent, Manjhi’s position as a sitting Mahadalit Union minister could give the NDA a crucial advantage in a closely contested election dominated by just two major alliances, and in a state where caste dynamics remain decisive. In 2020, fewer than 12,000 votes separated the winners (NDA: 125 seats) from the runners-up (Mahagathbandhan: 110 seats).Manjhi’s identity and influence among Mahadalits could help the NDA gain ground against the RJD-Congress-Left alliance, which has already announced a 10-point manifesto for Extremely Backward Classes ahead of its full election agenda. He belongs to the Musahar community, part of the Mahadalit category (within the Dalits) introduced in 2007. According to the 2022 Bihar caste census, Dalits account for roughly 20 per cent of the state’s 13 crore population.Beyond caste-based support, he could also bolster the ruling alliance's prospects in the Magadh region, where he represents the Gaya Lok Sabha seat. This region includes 26 assembly constituencies, six of which fall under Gaya, giving him potential influence over multiple seats.For the NDA, every percentage point counts. And in a state where caste equations can tilt outcomes, Jitan Ram Manjhi’s modest but strategic influence could well prove the difference between holding power and losing the mountain.The Bihar assembly elections are scheduled for November 6 and 11, with vote counting on November 14.","The 81-year-old is a seasoned politician whose career spans over four decades.

NEW DELHI: A video showing the challenges of walking on Indian footpaths, especially for parents and pedestrians, has gone viral on social media.The 32-second clip, posted on Thursday by Canadian content creator and podcaster Caleb Friesen, shows him navigating a baby stroller along a footpath and highlighted the reality of being a pedestrian parent in India.In the video, Friesen struggles to manoeuvre the stroller around obstacles including electrical poles, power junction boxes and other common footpath obstructions.Sharing the video on X, he sarcastically listed the “descending order of importance” for things found on Indian footpaths, placing pedestrians and parents with strollers at the bottom. The list goes as:Friesen confirmed that the location was a footpath on 100 Feet Road in Bangalore. Explaining the issue further, he told one user that the problem was not the bollards, which prevent two-wheelers from entering the footpath, but the massive power junction boxes occupying half the space.The post has drawn widespread attention, garnering over 230K views. Many users empathised with Friesen’s experience, sharing their own struggles navigating uneven or blocked footpaths in Indian cities.One user wrote, “It’s brave of you to do this experiment. Last week in Pune, my father tried to roll a suitcase on the footpath and slipped because it got stuck in a pothole.Tier-1 cities don’t even provide a seamless 100m path.”Another user cautioned him, “For your kid’s safety, please avoid walking on the footpath. Better safe than sorry.”This is not Friesen’s first post highlighting footpath hazards. Last month, he shared a video of his 2.4 km walk from Majestic bus stand to a nearby Starbucks, pointing out obstacles such as tunnel juice, barbed wire, desire paths, bushwhacking, pavement pudding and a stairwell into a drain.Despite his wry commentary, he emphasised that his intention is not to criticise India but to raise awareness.

Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India. Don’t damage the country’s relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties',"" Congress posted on X.Trump claimed on Wednesday that PM Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after he imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican leader added.Meanwhile, Russia remains India's single-largest source of oil, accounting for 34% of inbound shipments in September, although volumes have slipped 10% in the first eight months of 2025, according to commodities and shipping markets tracker Kpler.The agency’s latest report pegs India’s crude imports in September at more than 4.5 million bpd (barrels per day).This is an increase of 70,000 barrels over August but flat when compared to the year-ago period, says the report, adding Russian oil accounted for a tad under 1.6 million bpd, or 34% of crude imports. India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Maritime Operations Centre and Communication Centre to be located there



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave go ahead to the Naval Headquarters to commence its Rs 450 crore strategic project ‘Nausena Bhawan, Maritime Operation Centre and Communication Centre’ in Delhi Cantonment area after Central Empowered Committee (CEC) cleared it saying even though the land is in Morphological Ridge area, it has no trees.The defence ministry through additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati assured a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria that the project was of strategic importance and is designed as an environmentally sustainable one. “The ministry of defence has assured that all necessary precautions will be taken by adopting the latest sustainable construction practices,” she said.CEC after scrutinizing the project documents and visiting the site reported to the SC that the ministry of defence may be permitted to utilize 1.9 hectares of the land falling in Morphological Ridge area for the project subject to depositing Rs 22.5 crore with Delhi Ridge Management Board for ‘plantation, conservation, and development of Delhi Ridge.”It said the authorities must get environmental clearance from the ministry of environment forest and climate change and plant at least 500 trees of indigenous species in and around the 750 metre perimeter and ensure proper upkeep to facilitate their survival and growth into mature trees. It must implement rainwater harvesting, measures for safe waste disposal and energy conservation, the CEC said.","The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave go ahead to the Naval Headquarters to commence its Rs 450 crore strategic project.

Supreme Court makes DMRB a jumbo body; asks it to demarcate morphological ridge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-makes-dmrb-a-jumbo-body-asks-it-to-demarcate-morphological-ridge/articleshow/125264614.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday revamped the Delhi Ridge Management Board (DMRB) to eliminate confusion caused by multiple authorities tasked to protect Delhi Ridge and directed the Board to remove all encroachments from the forested and morphological Ridge and file six monthly reports with the court on their health.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran recast the DMRB by making it a 13-member body headed by Delhi chief secretary and members including DDA vice-chairman, representatives of MoEF and Department of Forest, MCD Commissioner, NDMC chairperson, Director General of CPWD, Delhi Police Commissioner’s representative and members of NGOs nominated by Delhi govt.The SC also constituted a standing committee, which will be headed by a representative of the Central Empowered Committee, for looking after day-to-day affairs of DMRB and said committee members, apart from officials, must be experts in the field of conservation. It said DMRB shall act as a single-window authority insofar as Delhi Ridge and the Morphological Ridge is concerned.Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, “The core functions of the DRMB must be directed towards conservation of the existing Ridge Forests and removal of existing encroachments from the Ridge.” SC lamented that though a preliminary notification was issued in May 1994 identifying 7,777 hectares of land as reserved forest, only 103 hectares have been notified as forest in the next three decades.CEC told the court that 5% of the Ridge is under encroachment, 4% already diverted for non-forest purposes, and only 1.33% has been notified as forest.“The very purpose of the DRMB is to preserve the integrity of the Ridge, as a morphological and ecological feature. Therefore, the DRMB should focus on preservation of existing Ridge forests and further improving the areas through scientific conservation measures. The DRMB should also ensure that fragmentation of Ridge Forests is prevented,” he said.The SC tasked DMRB to ensure preservation of the Ridge, including the morphological Ridge, in its pristine glory by removing all encroachments and steps to improve the Ridge, including protection, scientific management, ecological restoration, afforestation and habitat conservation.Directing DMRB to submit reports every six months on the status of the Ridge, the bench directed all authorities in Delhi to act in aid of discharge of duties of the Board.",The Supreme Court revamped the Delhi Ridge Management Board (DMRB) to eliminate confusion caused by multiple authorities tasked to protect Delhi Ridge.

Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK: AI171 Crash Survivor Vishwaskumar Ramesh Speaks Out

AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad airport has undertaken a large-scale wildlife management operation to reduce the risk of bird and animal strikes around the airfield, five months after London-bound AI-171 crashed after take-off on June 12, killing all 241 people on board.In association with the forest department, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport has begun relocating several species of birds and mammals found in and around the premises to areas at least 50–100 km away from the city.Officials said a major translocation drive involving 1,000 large fruit bats is currently underway. The bats, which roost in large numbers near Kotarpur, close to the airport along Sabarmati riverbank, are being captured and released in Polo Forest, a protected habitat about 150 km away.“Giant fruit bats became a particular concern,” said a source. “During night-time inspections, blood stains were often found on the runway or near aircraft, but there would be no feathers, hinting at bat strikes. Following these findings and based on recommendations from the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the decision to translocate certain species was taken during a series of joint review meetings,” added the source.Other species being relocated include the red-wattled lapwing, yellow-wattled lapwing, black kite, Eurasian thick-knee, and blackheaded ibis. Species commonly found around SVPIA — such as the rock pigeon, cattle egret, house crow, Indian roller, and common mynah — continue to be monitored as part of ongoing wildlife hazard management, an official said.","Ahmedabad airport has undertaken a large-scale wildlife management operation to reduce the risk of bird and animal strikes around the airfield.

From Bhutan, PM Modi Issues Big Warning After Delhi Red Fort Blast, Promises Swift And Full Justice

The UK government has updated its travel advisory for British nationals following Monday’s deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort area, which claimed 12 lives and left several others injured.In its latest guidance, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) advised British citizens in Delhi to remain cautious and follow instructions from local authorities.“There has been an explosion at the Red Fort (Lal Qila) Metro Station, New Delhi,” reads the FCDO update for India. “If you’re in the immediate area follow the advice of the local authorities and monitor local media,” it adds.The advisory also reiterates existing guidance against all travel within 10 km of the India-Pakistan border -- except for the Wagah border crossing -- and maintains warnings for Jammu and Kashmir as well as Manipur due to security concerns.The FCDO noted that the country-based advisory serves as a ""guidance on travel"" rather than an enforced restriction. It aims to help citizens make ""informed decisions"" and cautioned that ignoring such advice could affect travel insurance validity.The explosion took place around 6.52 pm on Monday when a Hyundai i20 car caught fire near the Red Fort Metro Station, resulting in nine deaths and over 20 injuries. The toll rose to 12 by Tuesday after three more victims succumbed to their injuries, according to police.The city remains on high alert as Delhi Police, invoking the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), continue their probe into the blast. Forensic and intelligence findings suggest possible terror links behind the incident.","The UK government has updated its travel advisory for British nationals following Monday's deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort area.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has made it mandatory to include a dedicated analysis based on datasets from the National Database for Emergency Management (NDEM) in the preparation of all highway project reports. This decision comes amid increasing instances of roads, particularly in hilly areas, being washed away due to heavy rain and landslides.NDEM has been developed and maintained by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and the portal serves as a comprehensive geospatial platform for disaster management, risk assessment, and infrastructure planning. It hosts multi-temporal satellite data, thematic layers, and decision support tools for monitoring natural hazards such as floods, landslides, droughts, and cyclones.In a communication to all states and highway agencies, the ministry has said the dedicated analysis based on NDEM datasets must include use of floodplain, digital elevation models (DEMs) and land use layers to identify optimal alignment to minimise exposure to natural hazards while deciding alignments. These must integrate flood extent and river basin layers to plan adequate cross-drainage structures and prevent future inundation issues, and landside risk mapping in case of hill roads.“All alignment approval proposals to be placed before the different committees shall invariably indicate if the analysis on NDEM has been carried out and to place the results of the analysis for consideration of the committee,” the ministry said.Separately, the ministry has also directed that while preparing project reports for highway projects in hilly areas, topographical surveys should be carried out for a 300-metre-wide strip. It said the base plan prepared using topographical data should be superimposed with the Indian Landslide Susceptibility Map. “The landslide inventory of past incidents should be collected and studied. Further, slope movement (in mm/year) should be analysed from DEMs using InSAR or similar satellite imagery and historical data available through online resources developed by the National Remote Sensing Agency,” the ministry added.The ministry stated that additional land should be acquired at culvert and structure locations to channelise hillside streams for the construction of catch-water drains, enabling effective interception and disposal of runoff that can cause erosion, slope instability, and pavement deterioration.To address the issue of identifying dump sites for muck disposal, it said that for new roads, the preferred approach is to design them in such a way that excavated material can be fully utilised in constructing embankments and fill slopes within a short distance from the source location.","The road transport ministry has made it mandatory to include a dedicated analysis based on datasets from the National Database for Emergency Management.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR after the city's air quality slipped into the 'severe' category.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said the decision was taken after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) surged from 362 on Monday to 425 on Tuesday morning, due to calm winds, a stable atmosphere, and unfavourable weather conditions that allowed pollutants to accumulate near the surface.The Stage III curbs, which include a ban on non-essential construction and the closure of stone crushers and mining activities, build upon the measures already enforced under Stages I and II of the GRAP.Classes up to Class 5 are required to shift to hybrid mode under Stage 3. Parents and students have the option to choose online education wherever available.Under Stage 3, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt.Several parts of the city registered alarming pollution levels with AQI readings crossing the 400-mark.As per CPCB data, Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 412, Alipur reported 442, and Bawana registered the highest level at 462. Chandni Chowk recorded an AQI of 416, while RK Puram and Patparganj logged 446 and 438, respectively.Sonia Vihar also recorded a 'severe' AQI of 433, indicating hazardous air conditions across the city.During winters, the Delhi-NCR region enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorises air quality into four stages - Stage I (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage II (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage III (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage IV (Severe Plus, AQI above 450).Hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during the winter are caused by unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicle emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers, and other local sources of pollution.",The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR.

Lucknow Doctor Tasked By JeM To Form Women’s Terror Wing In India, Police Link To Delhi Blast Probe

NEW DELHI: Dr Umar Un Nabi, who has emerged as the prime suspect behind Monday's suspected car blast near Red Fort, was the most radicalised member of the Faridabad module, which included the arrested Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, Dr Adeel Majeed Rather, and Dr Shaheen Shahid, sources connected with the investigation said on Tuesday.Shaheen, during her interrogation in Srinagar on Monday night, conceded that Umar would passionately speak of ""unleashing multiple terror attacks in the country"" every time they met after work at the Al-Falah Medical College. Sources told TOI he, along with Muzammil and Adeel, had been amassing fertiliser-based explosives like ammonium nitrate for almost two years, purportedly for use in pan-India terror attacks on behalf of terror outfit Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM).Muzammil, Adeel and Shaheen were earlier arrested by J&K police in coordinated action with UP police and Haryana police. Umar, who was teaching at Al-Falah Medical College in Faridabad, however, managed to slip away and is believed to have gone underground, only to resurface as a suspected car bomber. He is suspected to have packed an i20 car with commercially available explosives like ammonium nitrate and detonators.Questioning of the arrested doctors in J&K points to a wider Jaish network. Shaheen revealed that her brother, Parvez Sayeed, was also radicalised and part of the same chat group as Muzammil and Adeel. A J&K police team on Tuesday visited Lucknow and picked up Parvez but could not make any significant recoveries. ""It is possible that he got rid of the explosives, anticipating arrest,"" said an officer. A Gurugram-based ammonium nitrate supplier has also been identified and may soon face raids and arrest.Source said the raids in Faridabad and the Delhi blast have exposed a network of clerics engaged in indoctrination, including a Shopian-based maulvi, Irfan Ahmad Wagay, who was directly in touch with Pakistan-based Jaish handler Umar bin Khattab, alias Harjulla. Another cleric, Mewat-based Hafiz Mohd Ishtiyak, was providing logistics to the terrorists. These clerics were using social media platforms to radicalise highly qualified professionals like doctors for carrying out pan-India terror attacks on behalf of JeM. ""Medicine being a noble profession offered the doctors a perfect cover for their conspiratorial agenda,"" an officer noted.This is not the first time that a Kashmiri doctor has been found engaged in terror activities. In Nov 2023, J&K LG Manoj Sinha had dismissed Dr Nisar Ul Hassan, assistant professor (medicine) at SMHS Hospital, Srinagar, over terror links. Hassan was a self-styled president of DAK, which was supposedly used by him as a cover to orient medical professionals in J&K towards secessionism, under the patronage of Pakistani proxies.""It is a matter of investigation if Hassan had any role in radicalising the Kashmiri doctors arrested in Faridabad or involved in the Delhi blast,"" said an officer.","Dr Umar Un Nabi has emerged as the prime suspect behind Monday's suspected car blast near Red Fort.

Bihar Exit Polls 2025: Poll of Polls Show NDA Poised For Majority, MGB Trails, No Impact of JSP

Exit polls have had a patchy record in India



Exit polls released Tuesday were unanimous that NDA will win Bihar and do so with a much more comfortable majority than five years ago. Some even projected that it could get close to a two-thirds majority in the 243-member assembly.The polls also concurred that Prashant Kishor's fledgling outfit, Jan Suraaj, will have at best a limited impact, at least in terms of winning assembly seats.If the exit polls prove correct, chief minister Nitish Kumar would have shown that a near 20-year run in the job with a brief 9-month gap has not rubbed the sheen off his popularity, a remarkable feat by any standards. It would also mean a significant booster for NDA, heading into crucial assembly polls next year.Dainik Bhaskar projected that NDA would win between 145 and 160 seats with the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan trailing way behind at 73-102 and ""others"" winning between five and 10 seats.The Matrize-IANS poll had very similar numbers with the NDA projected to win 147-167, the MGB 70-90 and others two to six seats. People's Pulse had only slightly different projections with the NDA slated to win 135-159, the MGB 75-101 and others two to eight seats.The majority mark in the Bihar assembly is 122 while 162 represents the two-third mark. That mark has been achieved by the winning coalition twice in the last two decades. The NDA in 2010 won 206 seats while the Mahagathbandhan in 2015 - which included RJD, JD(U) and Congress - won 178 seats. In 2020, the NDA won 125 seats while the MGB won 110.Exit polls have had a patchy record in India with some spectacular successes interspersed with projections that have been way off the mark. Two major pollsters - Axis My India and Today's Chanakya - are to reveal their projections on Wednesday. The results will be known Friday.","Exit polls released Tuesday were unanimous that NDA will win Bihar and do so with a comfortable majority.

Delhi: 8 Killed In Multiple Red Fort Blasts; Explosion Shakes 3 KM Area Radius Of Indian Capital

NEW DELHI: There is mystery over the kind of explosive or chemical used in Monday's blast with the forensics and NSG's explosive wing yet to submit their report. However, prima facie assessment points towards the use of military-grade explosives, given the scale of damages and casualties.Sources said investigators on Tuesday sought an opinion from forensics on whether PETN, semtex or RDX could have been used. The initial assessment also points towards the possible use of ammonium nitrate fuel oil and detonators. The nitrate oil is used both industrially and in improvised explosive devices due to its easy availability and cost-effectiveness.The forensic teams have collected roughly 42 exhibits from the site and put them through lab testing. The exhibits include the i20 car's tyres, chassis, CGC cylinder and parts of the bonnet, besides other residues and traces of powder found at the site. They will help determine the types of high-exposure materials used in the explosion.Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, is a major ingredient of semtex and belongs to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. One of the most powerful explosives, it is preferred by terrorists because its colourless crystals are hard to detect.A very small quantity of this explosive is required to carry out a blast in comparison to other chemicals. For example, the explosive substance used in the foiled transatlantic air freight bomb plot in 2010 was concealed in a printer cartridge.""PETN is quite stable and detonated either by heat or a shock wave. A car can be destroyed in around 100 grams. Most importantly, neither PETN nor semtex inherently require pellets or shrapnel to act as an explosive and the material itself is enough to cause immense damage through detonation,"" said an officer.On the other hand, ammonium nitrate fuel oil produces a supersonic shock wave rather than a subsonic burn, which means energy is released at an extremely high rate, creating a powerful shock effect.In the Delhi High Court blast of 2011, the initial opinion of forensic experts, including that of National Security Guard, was that a mix of ammonium nitrate with PETN was used. However, the home ministry had said later that RDX was used in it.Sources said there would be complete clarity on the explosive used in Monday's blast in a few days.Investigators suspect a proper detonation system was in place to blow the car, which was rigged with high-end explosives. A watch and its small button batteries may have been used for building the circuit and triggering the bomb.","Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, is a major ingredient of semtex.

'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate

Winds may help improve air quality slightly today

NEW DELHI: It's official. The capital's air quality reached emergency levels on Tuesday and was the worst in nearly 11 months. With the noxious morning smog thickening amid dipping temperatures, Delhi recorded its first 'severe' air day of the year, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to enforce Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) across NCR.The city's average AQI on Tuesday stood at 428 on a scale of 0 to 500, the worst since Dec 19 last year, when the index touched 451. The last 'severe' AQI in Delhi was logged on Dec 23, 2024, at 406.The sharp rise in AQI, from 362 on Monday, followed a night of calm winds and plummeting temperatures that allowed pollutants to accumulate near the surface, creating a dense smog blanket over the region. Visibility dropped to 600 metres at Safdarjung and 700 metres at Palam around 6.30 am.Winds started to drop on Monday and were almost calm through the night. We also have dipping temperatures, which led to significant accumulation of pollutants,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet, adding that winds picked up only post noon on Tuesday, touching around 12 km/hr. ""As per forecasts, we can expect winds to stay consistent on Wednesday, so there are chances of marginal improvement,"" he said.The stage III of Grap implemented on Tuesday would be effective across Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddh Nagar. It includes a ban on construction and demolition (C&D) activities and restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers, except those used for essential services.Non-essential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles and BS-IV light commercial vehicles (LCVs) registered outside Delhi are also prohibited from entering the capital till the curbs remain in force.Delhi's directorate of education directed all schools to conduct classes up to Class V in hybrid mode. The Commission also advised Delhi and NCR govts to stagger office timings for public and municipal employees to cut down vehicular congestion in peak hours. Similar directions were issued to the Centre for offices located in Delhi-NCR.Most construction activities are banned, which is likely to hit thousands of daily-wage labourers across NCR.""All implementing agencies shall keep strict vigil and intensify measures of the extant schedule of Grap,"" said CAQM, directing that all actions under Stage I, II, and III will continue simultaneously.Although conditions turned sunny in the late morning and visibility improved to around 2,000m, haze persisted through the day. Delhi's minimum temperature fell to 10.2°C at Safdarjung, the lowest this season and about four degrees below normal. It was 10.4°C on Monday. The maximum stood at 27.7°C, two notches below normal. As per IMD's forecast, shallow fog in the early hours and winds up to 20 km/hour may blow on Wednesday, which may aid in slight dispersion of pollutants.CPCB data at 9am, when stage III was invoked, showed 33 of Delhi's 39 monitoring stations in the 'severe' category. Bawana (463) recorded the worst air, followed by Wazirpur (460).Among the most polluted areas were Alipur, Bawana, Burari, Chandni Chowk, ITO, and Jahangirpuri, where early-morning PM2.5 levels touched 600 g/m³.Experts attributed the spike to meteorological inversion, a phenomenon where a layer of warm air traps cooler air - and pollutants - close to the ground. Forecasts by the Centre's Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) suggest the capital's AQI is likely to improve marginally to 'very poor' on Wednesday and remain at that level till at least Friday.","The city's average AQI on Tuesday stood at 428 on a scale of 0 to 500, the worst since Dec 19 last year, when the index touched 451.

Police lapses made crucial proof invalid

NEW DELHI: In one of the most dramatic reversals in legal history, 2006 Nithari serial killings accused Surinder Koli , who was sentenced to death by various courts in 13 murder cases and nearly executed twice, is set to walk out of prison a free man after 19 long years.After being convicted and awarded death sentence by the trial court, Allahabad HC and the Supreme Court - which had dismissed his appeal as well as review plea - the apex court on Tuesday cured the mistake in a curative petition filed by Koli in the last case pending against him. A curative petition is the final judicial resort for an accused to seek justice.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai, Justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath granted relief to Koli in the Rimpa Haldar murder case on the ground that the court had held the same evidence inadmissible in 12 other murder cases in which he had been acquitted.SC had in 2011 upheld Koli's conviction and death sentence in the Haldar case and dismissed the review petition in 2014.\In July, SC had upheld Allahabad HC's Oct 2023 judgment acquitting Koli in 12 Nithari murder cases of Noida on the ground that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Armed with July's order, Koli in Sept invoked curative jurisdiction of SC and contended that the nature of evidence in all 13 cases were similar and two set of outcomes - acquittal and conviction - resting on the same evidentiary foundation cannot lawfully coexist.Allowing his plea, the court said, ""When final orders of this court speak with discordant voices on an identical record, the integrity of adjudication is imperiled, and public confidence is shaken. In such a situation, intervention ex debito justitiae (as a matter of justice) is not an act of discretion but a constitutional duty. We therefore entertain this petition to preserve the purity of this Court's process and to vindicate the rule of law.""The bench noted that the apex court had already held that Koli's confession which led to the conviction was legally tainted and not admissible and that would be applicable in the Haldar case too.""To allow a conviction to stand on evidentiary basis that this court has since rejected as involuntary or inadmissible in the very same fact matrix offends Article 21 of the Constitution. It also violates Article 14 of the Constitution, since like cases must be treated alike. Arbitrary disparity in outcomes on an identical record is inimical to equality before the law,"" the bench said.It said the offences in Nithari were heinous, and the suffering of the families was beyond measure but it was a matter of deep regret that despite prolonged investigation, the identity of the actual perpetrator had not been established in a manner that met legal standards.""Criminal law does not permit conviction on conjecture or on a hunch. Suspicion, however grave, cannot replace proof beyond reasonable doubt. Courts cannot prefer expediency over legality. The presumption of innocence endures until guilt is proved through admissible and reliable evidence, and when the proof fails the only lawful outcome is to set aside the conviction even in a case involving horrific crimes,"" it said.It said numerous loopholes were common to all Nithari cases. ""These gaps were central to the acquittals in the 12 cases. They are equally present here,"" the court said.","Surinder Koli was sentenced to death by various courts in 13 murder cases and nearly executed twice.

‘Never Heard Such an Explosion’: Locals Recall Shock and Panic After Delhi Blast

'Blast was carried out in panic by Jaish member'





NEW DELHI: Confirming that Monday's blast near Red Fort was a terror attack, Delhi Police has filed an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The initial intel assessment is that the blast was set off by a Jaish-e-Muhammed module wanting to avenge the damage inflicted on the Bahawalpur HQ of the outfit during Operation Sindoor.As reported by TOI on Tuesday, Umar Un Nabi, a member of the ""doctor module"" who had escaped during raids by J&K police, has been confirmed as the man present in the car who carried out the 'lone wolf fidayeen attack'.The initial investigation indicates that the handlers were based in Turkiye and Nangarhar in Afghanistan. They were in touch with Umar and other members of the module.Sleuths suspect that Umar panicked after the arrest of his associate and the main accused in the Faridabad module, Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, and hit the road with the car with explosives to escape arrest. He was on the move continuously suspecting that the cops were on his trail.Some investigators believe that Umar may have tried to dispose of or hide the explosives or the car. Having failed to do so, he set off the blast.But there is largely a consensus that the blast was carried out with proper planning and the detonation may not have been accidental. ""More corroborative evidence is needed to arrive at a conclusion. The probe is at an early stage,"" said an officer.Though Umar has been described as the bomber who died in the attack, a DNA match will fully confirm his identity, cops said. Only an arm, supposedly his, was found near the vehicle. Sources said Tuesday that he was probably the lone occupant of the car at the time of the blast. A CCTV has captured him at one spot sitting alone in it.The official blast toll stands at nine. There are two-three body parts which have not been linked yet and a DNA analysis will establish if they were of different people. In that case, the toll may reach 12.The Delhi blast was carried out in panic and desperation by a member of a Jaish module after raids by alert security agencies successfully busted its hideouts and bases across J&K, Haryana and UP, according to sources in the security establishment.""Raids by security agencies across multiple locations in Delhi-NCR and Pulwama, which led to the recovery of nearly 3,000kg of explosives, are believed to have forced the suspect to act hastily under mounting pressure,"" a senior officer of the central security establishment told TOI.Sources said the haste was confirmed by the fact that the bomb used for the blast was loosely assembled and not fully developed, thus limiting the impact. The explosion did not create a crater and no shrapnel or projectiles were found.""Dr Umar, a member of the module, changed his location from Al Falah Medical College campus following the crackdown on other members of his module. He is the one who was driving the car used in the blast, as corroborated by CCTV footage. The blast was caused by the very same explosives that were found in Faridabad hideouts,"" said an officer.""Whether this blast was premeditated or accidental is a matter of investigation,"" the officer added. Sources said a few factors, however, pointed to an unintended explosion, including the fact that the vehicle was moving amid traffic and was not driven into a crowd, a common strategy used in vehicle-borne IED attacks to maximise casualty. The possibility of the explosives getting activated while being transported from point A to B is also not being ruled out.While describing the loss of deaths as tragic, officials said a major strike could not be carried out because of the alertness shown by cops in taking cognisance of the Jaish posters in J&K and the subsequent efforts of intelligence and police forces.The officer said demolition of the Jaish module responsible for the Delhi blast displayed the country's alertness levels against terror. ""This is a success of our intelligence agencies, security apparatus and law enforcement officers,"" the officer added.As reported by TOI on Monday, the origins of the Jaish module case investigation lay in a few objectionable posters that had come up in Srinagar. An FIR was registered in the case on Oct 19.",Delhi Police has filed an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Initial intel assessment is that the blast was set off by a Jaish-e-Muhammed module wanting to avenge the damage inflicted on the Bahawalpur HQ of the outfit during Operation Sindoor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125259870,imgsize-1206397,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-86.jpg"

Doctor’s Car Leads To Chilling Terror Trail, Face Of Suspect Revealed

NEW DELHI: Initial investigations into the car explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort suggest that the blast was not a typical suicide attack, but may have been triggered prematurely in panic by the suspect, news agency ANI reported citing sources.According to the sources, the suspect did not follow the usual pattern of a suicide car bombing — he neither rammed the vehicle into a target nor appeared to aim for maximum casualties. “The blast near the Red Fort did not follow the typical modus operandi of suicide bombers, who generally seek to inflict large-scale damage,” they said.The improvised explosive device (IED) was likely premature and underdeveloped, as the explosion created no crater and no shrapnel or projectiles were recovered from the site. The car was still moving when the device detonated, indicating that it was not designed for a high-impact collision.Investigators also believe the suspect may have acted hastily under pressure, as security agencies have been conducting nationwide raids on terror-linked networks. Significant quantities of explosives have been recovered from Faridabad, Saharanpur, Pulwama, and other locations, officials said.The explosion, which ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 near the Subhash Marg traffic signal by the Mughal-era monument on Monday evening, killed at least eight people and left several others injured. If confirmed as a terror attack, it would mark the first such incident in Delhi since 2011.Meanwhile, the Centre on Tuesday handed over the investigation to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), with Union Home Minister Amit Shah directing the agency to submit its report at the earliest. Shah also instructed the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to examine and match all material samples collected from the site and deliver a comprehensive report without delay. Chairing a high-level security review meeting at his residence, Shah directed agencies to leave no angle unexplored and to “hunt down each and every culprit” behind the incident.“Chaired review meetings on the Delhi car blast with senior officials. Instructed them to hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident. Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,” Shah posted on X (formerly Twitter).The meeting was attended by senior officials including Union home secretary Govind Mohan, Intelligence Bureau Director Tapan Deka, NIA Director General Sadanand Vasant Date, and Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golchha.The NIA is expected to conduct a comprehensive probe into the nature of the explosives, the suspect’s identity, and possible links to terror outfits, as authorities work to piece together the sequence leading to the blast.","Initial investigations into the car explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort suggest that the blast was not a typical suicide attack.

From Bhutan, PM Modi Issues Big Warning After Delhi Red Fort Blast, Promises Swift And Full Justice

Bhutan king

leads special prayer for victims of blast

NEW DELHI: Indian agencies will get to the bottom of the conspiracy behind the Delhi blast and the perpetrators will not be spared, PM Narendra Modi said shortly after landing in Bhutan where he participated in the birthday celebrations of 4th Bhutanese king Jigme Singye Wangchuck. While he delivered his remarks on the occasion in Hindi, the PM switched to English to assert that ""all those responsible will be brought to justice"".PM Modi had earlier this year too, at a rally at Madhubani in Bihar days after the Pahalgam attack, switched language to convey to the world that India would identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers.The PM's remarks in Bhutan effectively confirm that the govt sees the Delhi blast as a terrorist attack. India's response will be watched closely by the international community as the govt had said after Operation Sindoor, which followed the Pahalgam attack, that any act of terrorism would be considered an act of war.Bhutan's king Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck led a special prayer at Thimpu in the presence of PM Modi Tuesday for the victims of Delhi blast. Thousands of Bhutanese joined the prayer offered by their king at the Changlimethang Stadium.The king told the gathering: ""Let us come together and pray for India, pray for PM Modi. May all your (PM Modi's) aspirations, vision and service to India bear fruit. May you overcome each and every single obstacle and may your dream of a even brighter, stronger and prosperous India be fulfilled.""He added, ""But above all, we would like to take a moment and pray for people who sadly lost their lives in Delhi.

The Pulwama link

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor from Uttar Pradesh has emerged as a key suspect in a widening terror investigation that began with what officials describe as a ""white-collar"" terror network spanning multiple states and intensified by Monday's deadly car blast near Delhi's Red Fort.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al Falah University in Faridabad, was allegedly tasked with setting up the women’s recruitment wing of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in India. The wing, called Jamaat-ul-Mominat, was meant to attract educated women and professionals into the group's network, news agency PTI reported quoting sources.Shaheen was among eight people, including three doctors, arrested after agencies busted an interstate terror module operating across Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, seizing nearly 2,900 kg of explosives, including ammonium nitrate.The arrests came just hours before the Red Fort blast, which killed at least 12 people and injured 20 others on Monday evening. Investigators now believe the blast and the module are linked.Officials said the nature of the blast indicates a well-coordinated operation and that the role of JeM and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind operatives in organising a professional, educated terror network is being closely examined.""This was a white-collar terror setup — with doctors and educated youth being radicalised for logistical and operational roles,"" an intelligence officer told PTI.Preliminary findings in the Red Fort blast have found that Dr Umar Nabi, a medical professional from Lethpora in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, was driving the Hyundai i20 that exploded near a traffic signal outside Red Fort. Nabi, also connected to Al Falah University, is believed to have died in the blast.Officials suspect that Umar carried out the explosion after learning that several of his associates — including Shaheen — had been detained. Police sources said the vehicle contained ammonium nitrate, fuel oil, and detonators, and a suicide attack has not been ruled out.Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha confirmed that multiple agencies, including the NIA and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), are probing the incident. The Home Minister has been briefed regularly, he said.Jammu and Kashmir Police have taken DNA samples from Umar’s mother to match with remains recovered from the blast site. Investigators have also arrested Tariq, another Pulwama resident who allegedly provided the car used in the attack.Teams from Delhi Police, NIA and intelligence agencies have fanned out across Delhi, Kashmir and Haryana, detaining at least four more individuals for questioning. Footage from multiple CCTV cameras near the Red Fort and Laal Qila Metro station is being analysed.Following the explosion, Delhi has been placed on high alert, with vehicle checks intensified at all entry points and key transit hubs. The Red Fort Metro station has been closed, and traffic diversions have been enforced around the area.Police said the blast killed 12 people, including residents of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. Among the victims were Ashok Kumar (34) of Amroha and Amar Kataria (35) of Delhi.The NIA has registered a case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Explosives Act, covering conspiracy and execution of a terror attack.","Dr Shaheen Sayeed was allegedly tasked with setting up the women’s recruitment wing of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in India.

Kashmiri Doctor Arrested: First lead to terror plot came from Jaish posters in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-lead-to-terror-plot-came-from-jaish-posters-in-kashmir/articleshow/125235085.cms,"Security personnel on guard in Anantnag following the arrest of Kulgam resident Dr Adeel, accused in an interstate terror module

300-Kg Explosives, Weapons, Timers: J&K Police Stop Deadly Terror Plot Targeting North India In Time

NEW DELHI: The first lead in J&K police’s investigation into Jaish e Mohammad’s multi-state terror network involving Kashmiri doctors — now busted with nine arrests and a massive haul of over 2,900 kgs of explosives, bomb-making material and 2 AK-series weapons so far — was as innocuous as a few Jaish posters that had come up secretly in Nowgam, Srinagar in mid-October.The Jaish posters threatening attacks on security forces — common until 2019 but a rare occurrence now — fuelled the curiosity of Srinagar SSP G V Sundeep Chakravarthy, who had also led the J&K police component in Operation Mahadev that neutralised the three Pahalgam attackers. He insisted on finding out who put up the posters; and CCTV camera footage nailed three overground workers with a history of stone-pelting. They were arrested and their interrogation led the police to a cleric in Shopian, Maulvi Irfan Ahmad. Irfan’s questioning would, over the next 2-3 weeks, unveil a sinister Jaish plot — with links across J&K, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh — leading to a string of arrests.Those arrested so far include Kashmiri doctors working at Faridabad’s Al-Falah University, Muzammil Ganaie hailing from Pulwama; Adeel Ahmad Rather, originally from Qazigund but picked up from Saharanpur; and Dr Shaheen Sayeed hailing from Lucknow and Muzammil’s purported girlfriend.A fourth doctor, Dr Umar, who hails from Pulwama, is however absconding; an look out circular has been opened against him.Also in custody are the three overground workers behind the Nowgam posters; Hafiz Mohd Ishtiyak, a Mewat cleric who arranged the logistics in Faridabad; Maulvi Irfan and his aide from Ganderbal Zameer Ahmad Ahanger alias Mutlasha who led the J&K police to Muzammil.All the accused arrested in Haryana or UP have been brought to J&K and are being interrogated.Though Maulvi was not talking initially, a mobile device picked up from his house showed a Telegram channel operated by Pakistan-based Jaish terrorist Umar bin Khattab, confirming that he was in touch with Irfan. One of Irfan’s terror recruits, Mutlasha, also came under the scanner for being part of another pan-India terror chat group by the name Farzandan e Darul Uloom Deoband. Irfan eventually said he had seen an AK-47 in the house of a doctor he had radicalised. Mutlasha confirmed the identity of the doctor as Dr Muzammil Ganaie. Muzammil was traced to Al-Falah University in Faridabad, Haryana, where he was working with Dr Adeel and Dr Umar. The module was amassing explosives like fertiliser-based ammonium nitrate and bomb-making material including timers, detonators, batteries etc and storing them in two separate houses in Faridabad. Ishtiaq had the key to one of these houses.While one house was found stocked with 358 kg of explosives, the other held 2,563 kg of explosive material packed in 88 bags. An AK-47 was recovered from Adeel’s locker in GMC Srinagar and another from Dr Shaheen. Muzammil had hidden the gun in her car but she panicked after his arrest and threw it in a dustbin in Faridabad; it was later recovered by the police.Though interrogation is underway to establish how these explosives were to be used, investigators suspect a conspiracy to carry out terror attacks in the hinterland, with Delhi an obvious target given its proximity to Faridabad. “Idea was to use the cover of being medical professionals to escape suspicion. Given the massive quantity of explosives and other bomb-making material, it seems they were collected over two years,” an officer connected with the investigation told TOI.","The first lead in J&K police’s investigation into Jaish e Mohammad was a few Jaish posters that had come up secretly in Nowgam, Srinagar in mid-October.

NEW DELHI: A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed a two-judge bench's order directing Maharashtra to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT), comprising police officers belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities, to probe two crimes related to the 2023 communal riots in Akola.Appearing for Maharashtra, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria that police personnel lose their religious identity once they don the uniform, and a directive to set up the SIT based on the faith of members would violate the principles of secularism that governs the functioning of forces.He said the state is duty bound to conduct a free and fair probe and constitute an SIT - as was directed on Sept 11 by the bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and S C Sharma. On Nov 7, the same bench gave a split verdict on Maharashtra govt's petition seeking review of the part of the order where govt had been directed to choose police personnel for SIT based on their personal faith.Mehta said the CJI, being from Maharashtra, must be aware that the state has many competent police officers. ""Without taking instructions from the state, I can say that the state would not object if the CJI chooses the police officers who would form the SIT for a probe into the two incidents,"" he said.Staying the part of the two-judge bench's order that was related to the composition of the SIT, CJI-headed bench issued notice to the petitioner at whose request SC had earlier passed the order. ""We cannot pass any order without hearing the complainant,"" the bench said.In deciding the review petition, Justice Sharma had said, ""In the considered opinion of this court, as review and recall has been sought of the judgment to the limited extent that 'it directs or mandates the composition of the SIT on the basis of religious identity' requires consideration and, therefore, let notice be issued to the respondents, returnable within two weeks.""But Justice Kumar dismissed the review petition and said the directive for including police officers belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities in the SIT was issued because of laxity on part of the police to register FIRs and investigate the two crimes relating to the communal riots.Given the split verdict, the matter was posted before a three-judge bench.","A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed a two-Judge bench's order directing Maharashtra to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) The SIT was to probe two crimes related to the 2023 communal riots in Akola.

Venu Srinivasan reappointed as V-C of flagship Tata Trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/venu-srinivasan-reappointed-as-v-c-of-flagship-tata-trust/articleshow/125262726.cms,".

MUMBAI: TVS Motor Company chairman emeritus Venu Srinivasan has been reappointed trustee and vicechairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) for a period of three years. The move, SDTT said, was made “in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. ”On Oct 24, Srinivasan had been appointed permanent trustee of SDTT after his earlier term expired. However, this appointment did not comply with the recently amended Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, which came into effect on Sept 1. The amendment introduced provisions on the appointment of tenure and permanent trustees, including a cap that limits permanent trustees to one-fourth of a public charity’s total board strength.Currently, Noel Tata is the only permanent trustee at SDTT, which has a board strength of seven. To have two permanent trustees, it needs eight board members. Since the amended law supersedes any resolution passed after Sept 1 that does not conform to its provisions, the Oct 18 resolution appointing Srinivasan as a permanent trustee was deemed procedurally invalid.According to sources, Tata Trusts sought advice from multiple senior counsel and a top law firm on the issue and were advised that the Oct 18 resolution was void.Consequently, since Srinivasan could not be considered a trustee from Oct 24 until this week, the board decided to reappoint him.At SDTT’s Tuesday meeting, the board “decided to appoint Srinivasan as trustee for a period of three years with effect from Nov 12, 2025, in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and to designate him as vice chairman of SDTT,” read the press statement from Tata Trusts.Section 30A of the Act states that trustees with fixed tenures should step down when their term ends unless they are ‘unanimously’ reappointed by the remaining trustees. The reappointment, according to the Act, will be applicable for ‘up to five years’ if the trust deed does not specify the duration for reappointment.The Act also states that a tenure trustee whose term expires can only be appointed as a permanent trustee to fill a vacancy of a permanent trustee arising from death, insolvency, physical incapacity, permanently leaving India or conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude.SDTT, which operates according to a deed, and Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT), which operates according to a will, do not specify the duration of a trustee’s appointment.This may be why former Tata Trusts chairmen JRD Tata and Ratan Tata, along with several other trustees like R K Krishna Kumar and Jamshed Bhabha, were permanent trustees of SDTT and SRTT. Tata Group veterans said Ratan Tata had introduced the concept of appointing trustees with fixed tenures. Past trustees with fixed tenures included Keki Dadiseth, Nasser Munjee, and Mehli Mistry.The number of trustees at SDTT and SRTT is seven and six respectively.According to the Act and the existing board strengths, the number of permanent trustees has to be one at each Trust.Noel Tata is the only permanent trustee of SDTT (Noel was reappointed as a trustee for life in Jan this year, much before the Act came to effect). At SRTT, Noel, his half-brother Jimmy Tata, and Jehangir Jehangir are permanent trustees, it is reliably learned. This indicates that SRTT will need to structure its board to comply with the Act. To have three permanent trustees, SRTT will need a board strength of 12 trustees.","TVS Motor Company chairman emeritus Venu Srinivasan has been reappointed trustee and vicechairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) for a period of three years.

NEW DELHI: With 75% of new human diseases originating in animals, India is stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between human, animal and environmental health. Govt is set to launch 'National One Health Mission', a Rs 383 crore cross-ministerial initiative to build coordinated surveillance, research and response systems to prevent outbreaks like Covid, Nipah, scrub typhus, avian influenza, reports Anuja Jaiswal.Cleared by the Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC), the mission will be implemented by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It recognises that zoonotic and vector-borne diseases are not just public health threats but also challenges to food security, environment and economic resilience.The first major milestone will be the National One Health Conclave from Nov 20-21 in Delhi, which PM Modi is expected to attend to underline India's commitment to the 'One Health' approach. ""'One Health' is not a theoretical concept but a public health necessity for India,"" said Prof Umesh Kapil, president, Epidemiology Foundation of India. He stressed that collaborative surveillance, evidence-based diagnostics and strong institutional linkages are key to preventing future outbreaks.Officials said the framework also targets antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused by misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and agriculture. Coordinated policies involving ICMR, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, National Centre for Disease Control, FSSAI and CPCB will help curb AMR - one of India's gravest long-term health threats - in line with a national action plan.","75% of new human diseases originating in animals.

To promote connectivity, PMModi also said that Gelephu and Samtse in Bhutan will be connected to India's extensive rail network.""Once completed, this project will provide Bhutanese industries and farmers with easier access to India's large markets,"" the Prime Minister said, adding that connectivity creates opportunity and opportunity creates prosperity.The two countries also signed three MoUs in the fields of renewable energy, mental health services, and healthcare to further strengthen bilateral cooperation. The king also conveyed condolences on the loss of lives in the Delhi ""tragedy"" in the meeting with PM Modi.""Along with rail and road connectivity, we are rapidly progressing on border infrastructure,"" said PM Modi, while endorsing the king's vision of Gelephu Mindfulness City.The PM announced that India would establish an immigration checkpoint near Gelephu to further facilitate viMODIsitors and investors visiting the place.On energy cooperation, PM Modi said Bhutan currently produces 100% of its electricity from renewable energy. ""Taking this progress forward, another major step is being taken today. A new hydroelectric project of over 1,000 MW is being launched which will increase Bhutan's hydropower capacity by nearly 40%. In addition, work is also being resumed on another hydroelectric project that has been stalled for a long time,"" said the PM, adding the progress and prosperity of India and Bhutan are closely linked.""In this spirit, last year Govt of India announced a contribution of Rs 10,000 crore to support Bhutan's Five-Year Plan. These funds are being utilized across all sectors - from roads to agriculture, from finance to healthcare, helping improve the ease of living for the people of Bhutan,"" he said.","PM Narendra Modi and Bhutanese king Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck jointly inaugurated the 1020MW Punatsangchuu-II hydroelectric project.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has restrained Patanjali Ayurved from issuing advertisements terming other chyawanprash products as ""dhoka"" or ""deception"" and asked it to take them down from all electronic, digital and print media.In the Nov 6 interim order on a plea by Dabur India, Justice Tejas Karia said, ""Anybody who manufactures an ayurvedic product by following the statute and the scriptures as enlisted in the statute cannot be denigrated as deceptive when the statute considers it to be as good and permissible ayurvedic drug, that is, chyawanprash in the present case.""Dabur India was aggrieved by the 25-second ad issued by Patanjali titled ""51 herbs. 1 truth. Patanjali Chyawanprash!""The high court said that for an average viewer of the ad featuring Ramdev, a well-known authority on yoga and Vedic practices, his assertion that only his product is genuine chyawanprash is likely to create a strong impression. ""Such a statement would naturally lead viewers to accept it as true and disregard other brands of chyawanprash. In evaluating the overall impact of the impugned advertisement, it is necessary to consider factors such as the stature and influence of the endorser,"" the court noted.The high court, while granting an ad-interim injunction, restrained Patanjali from issuing, broadcasting, telecasting or disseminating in any form the advertisement in any media forms. It also directed the removal, blocking, or disabling of the advertisement from all media within three days.","Dabur India was aggrieved by the 25-second ad issued by Patanjali.

BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court awarded an enhanced compensation of Rs 22.5 lakh to the family of a deceased schoolgirl, noting that her income must be calculated under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act.The bench, partly allowing the appeal filed by Lt Col Rajinder Singh Shekhawat and his wife Vanitha, was led by Justice Umesh M Adiga who observed that the Supreme Court had, in Hitesh Nagjibai Patel case, laid down this principle.On Nov 10, 2018, Diya Shekhawat (15), a class X student at Poornaprajna Education Centre, Bhadravathi, succumbed to injuries sustained in an accident. Her schoolbus hit an electric pole due to the driver's negligence near Southikere of NR Pura taluk.Diya's parents, claiming they lost their only daughter who was a bright student and good at sports, sought Rs 78 lakh in compensation. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Shivamogga awarded them Rs 16.8 lakh in its order dated March 20, 2021. Dissatisfied, the parents and Sriram General Insurance Company filed separate appeals before the high court.The insurer of the offending bus argued the compensation was excessive, citing Supreme Court decisions in which awards ranged from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in fatal accident cases involving minors.Diya's parents, on the other hand, contended the tribunal had failed to consider her prospects in computing the award.After perusing the materials on record, Justice Adiga noted the Supreme Court had directed compensation to be calculated based on prevailing minimum wages. The bench directed the insurer to pay an additional amount of about Rs 5.6 lakh with 6% interest to the claimants, over and above the compensation awarded by the tribunal, and dismissed the appeal filed by the insurance company.","Diya Shekhawat (15), a class X student at Poornaprajna Education Centre, Bhadravathi, succumbed to injuries sustained in an accident.

CHANDIGARH: A ""victim's absolutely normal mental state"" after an alleged Pocso case offence raises serious doubts about the credibility of allegations, Punjab and Haryana High Court said in a recent order while suspending the five-year sentence of a teacher convicted of molesting a student.HC noted the Class VIII student attended a PTM with her parents the day after the alleged offence, took photographs at school, and posted them on Instagram with the caption ""School Mein Maje"".""Such behaviour cannot reasonably be anticipated from a minor who was subjected to sexual molestation by her teacher at school merely a day prior,"" Justice Namit Kumar said in the order, passed on a petition by the teacher.On Nov 8, 2024, a fast-track special court in Chandigarh convicted the teacher in a Pocso case registered on Nov 2, 2022, awarding the maximum sentence of five years. His appeal against conviction was admitted by High Court in Nov last year.The prosecution alleged the teacher called the student, engaged in obscene talk and touched her inappropriately on Nov 2, 2022. Out of fear, she left school but narrated the offence to her father after arriving home.The teacher, on the other hand, claimed the girl harboured a grudge against him as he had caught her in a ""compromising position"" with a boy and reprimanded her around a month earlier.""The teacher had only called the girl to the staff room to question her over the use of a mobile phone during school hours, instructing her to bring her parents and the phone the next day for the PTM,"" his counsel said.The bench observed the mental state of the survivor remained ""absolutely normal"" even after the alleged offence, casting serious doubt on the veracity of her allegations and indicating the offence did not take place. HC said any child who experienced such an incident must have been mentally traumatised for a while.""The conduct and demeanour of the prosecutrix subsequent to the alleged incident does not inspire confidence in the prosecution version, and the behaviour of the prosecutrix exhibits no sign of fear, trauma, and emotional distress that would ordinarily be expected from a victim of such a grave offence,"" High Court said. The sentence shall remain suspended till the appeal against conviction is decided.","Punjab and Haryana High Court suspended the five-year sentence of a teacher convicted of molesting a student.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission's response to petitions filed by political parties and politicians from ruling dispensations in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry opposing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls of their states as part of the pan-India exercise.After hearing senior advocate Kapil Sibal for petitioners from DMK and TMC, a bench of CJI-designate Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi wondered as to why the petitioners were opposed to correction of electoral rolls and said they can make suggestions to improve SIR. ""You all should endeavour to make the SIR exercise reach every voter,"" it said.However, when Sibal pressed for a stay on the ongoing SIR, it asked Election Commission to respond to the interim stay sought by the petitioners by Nov 24 and posted the matters for hearing on November 26.Sibal articulated the opposition to SIR saying the state always gets heavy rain during Nov and Dec when north-east monsoon is active. ""Because of this, the common people will be preparing for the same and the revenue officials who are enlisted as BLOs/EROs/AEROs will have to manage the flood reliefs as well. Hence, practically, this period of time is not conducive for conducting SIR,"" he said.As an additional ground to oppose SIR, he said Dec and Jan are harvesting seasons when most agriculturists and farmers would not be available at their homes to participate in the voter enumeration exercise under SIR.This would be followed by Christmas holidays and Pongal; thus, people would not be available from December 24 till Jan 18, he added.An MP from TMC, who has challenged SIR in West Bengal, told the bench through senior advocate Kalyan Banerjee that many areas of the state do not have 4G/5G mobile services making it difficult for the citizens to upload their data on the EC website or access the website for corrections.Appearing for Election Commission, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said it is surprising that when it comes to correction/revision of voter lists, the states are competing to show how backward they are.Sibal also termed the enumeration form as incomprehensible for the commoners and pointed out the departures from the Bihar-SIR to the pan-India exercise apart from accusing the Election Commission of squeezing the schedule to just a month when similar exercises earlier were carried out on a much longer period. ""This would result in lakhs of voters getting disenfranchised,"" he said.For an NGO, which had challenged Bihar SIR and now expanded its scope to challenge pan-India SIR, advocate Prashant Bhushan said EC has a software to erase duplication of voters but is not using it. SC asked EC to respond whether it could use such software to delete duplicate entries in the state voter lists.It also acknowledged the importance of Bhushan's plea for supply of acknowledgement slips to voters by EC against submission of voter enumeration forms. However, the SC was unsure whether it could direct the EC to upload machine-readable voter lists, given the earlier direction of SC contrary to it. Instead, it asked Bhushan to consider whether individual voters could be given OTP access to his own data in the voter list.","The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission's response to petitions filed by political parties and politicians from ruling dispensations in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry.

While 62.8% male voters participated in the polling, the turnout among female voters was recorded at 71.6%.

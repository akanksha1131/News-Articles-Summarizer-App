"'You are tubelights': Owaisi’s swipe at BJP after Nishikant Dubey's remark on SC, CJI Khanna",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-are-tubelights-owaisis-swipe-at-bjp-after-nishikant-dubeys-remark-on-sc-cji-khanna/articleshow/120447169.cms,"NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi mocked BJP leaders as ""tubelights"" on Sunday, following controversial remarks by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey against the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India.Owaisi reminded the BJP of Article 142 of the Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.""You people (BJP) are tubelights... Do you even know what Article 142 is? It was framed by Dr. BR Ambedkar,"" Owaisi said, accusing the BJP of threatening the judiciary with religious warfare.You people are in power and have become so radicalised that you're now threatening the court with a religious war. Modi ji, if you don't stop these people, the country will become weak. The country won’t forgive you, and tomorrow, you won’t be in power,” he added.This comes in response to Nishikant Dubey’s comments suggesting that Parliament should stop functioning if the apex court acts like a law-making body.Taking aim at the Supreme Court, Dubey said, “Kanoon yadi Supreme Court hi banayega to Sansad Bhavan band kar dena chahiye” (If the Supreme Court is going to make the laws, then the Parliament should be shut down).Targeting the Chief Justice of India, he added, “Sanjiv Khanna is responsible for all the civil wars happening in this country.”Echoing similar sentiments, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma said, “There is an apprehension among the public that when Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote the Constitution, the roles of the Legislature and the Judiciary were clearly defined. According to the Constitution, no one can direct the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and the President has already given her assent to the law. No one can challenge the President, as the President is supreme…”These remarks come at a sensitive time, as the Supreme Court is currently hearing multiple petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, which was passed by Parliament in early April.In response to the court’s concerns, the Centre has agreed to temporarily hold off on implementing certain controversial provisions of the law until the next hearing.Meanwhile, the BJP has “outrightly rejected” and distanced itself from the remarks made by its MPs, and members have been cautioned against making such statements in the future.“The statements made by BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Dinesh Sharma regarding the judiciary and the Chief Justice have no connection whatsoever with the Bharatiya Janata Party . These are their personal views. The BJP neither agrees with nor endorses such statements. The BJP outrightly rejects them,” BJP national president J.P. Nadda said in a post on X.“The Bharatiya Janata Party has always respected the judiciary and has wholeheartedly accepted its orders and suggestions. As a party, we believe that the Supreme Court, along with all other courts in the country, is an integral part of our democracy and a strong pillar in safeguarding the Constitution. I have directed both of them—and everyone else—to refrain from making such statements,” he added.","Owaisi reminded the BJP of Article 142 of the Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.

The meeting with the Prime Minister is expected to cover progress on the India-US trade agreement and ways to deepen ties between the two countries. PM Modi is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia on April 22–23, so his schedule is tight.

On April 22, they will visit famous sites in Jaipur, including Amer Fort (also known as Amber Fort), a Unesco World Heritage Site.

In the afternoon, Vice President Vance will speak at the Rajasthan International Centre, where he is expected to talk about India-US relations under the Trump administration. Diplomats, Indian officials, academics, and policy experts are likely to attend.

The next day, April 23, the Vance family will travel to Agra to visit the iconic Taj Mahal and Shilpgram, an open-air market showcasing Indian art and crafts. They will return to Jaipur later that evening.

The Vances are scheduled to fly back to the US from Jaipur on April 24.

NEW DELHI: US Vice President JD Vance will arrive in India on Monday for his first visit to the country, along with his Indian-origin wife Usha Chilukuri Vance and their three children. The family will be in India for four days.This trip comes amid President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade moves, including a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods, as part of broader tariff announcements affecting countries worldwide.The Vances will be welcomed in Delhi by a senior Union minister.In a statement, the White House said, “Vice President J D Vance and the Second Family will travel to Italy and India from April 18 to 24.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday wrote a letter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , informing him that he has directed his legal team to begin drafting the Rohith Vemula Act - legislation aimed at curbing caste-based discrimination in educational institutions .The announcement comes after Siddaramaiah’s statement on Friday, affirming his government's commitment to enacting the law at the earliest. This came after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi urged the Karnataka government to introduce the Act, citing the need to eliminate caste discrimination in education.In his letter, Siddaramaiah responded to Gandhi’s April 16 message that referenced an incident faced by Dr BR Ambedkar. ""The reference in your letter dated 16th April 2025, to the incident faced by Dr B R Ambedkar, as narrated by him is indeed a sad reality even to this day. No child or adult must face the shame and stigma faced by Babasaheb,"" Siddaramaiah wrote.Reiterating his administration’s commitment to equality, Siddaramaiah added, ""We must join hands to bring the Dalits , Adivasis and Backward classes into the main stream. That the oppressed classes must no more face any discrimination in our educational system.""""I have instructed my legal advisor and team to prepare a draft of the Rohith Vemula Act, a legislation that will act as a deterrent against discrimination in educational institutions,"" he said.In his earlier letter, Rahul Gandhi had drawn attention to the systemic discrimination faced by marginalized communities. ""It is a shame that even today millions of students from Dalit, Adivasi and OBC communities have to face such brutal discrimination in our educational system,"" Gandhi wrote.He also invoked the tragic deaths of students like Rohith Vemula, Payal Tadvi, and Darshan Solanki as examples of institutional discrimination. ""The murder of bright young people like Rohith Vemula, Payal Tadvi and Darshan Solanki is simply not acceptable. It is time to put a firm end to this. I urge the Karnataka government to enact the Rohith Vemula Act so that no child of India has to face what Dr B R Ambedkar, Rohit Vemula and millions of others have had to endure,"" he said.Rohith Vemula, a Dalit PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad, died by suicide in 2016, a case that sparked national outrage and became a symbol of caste-based discrimination in academia.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

'Hero' neighbours among 1st responders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hero-neighbours-among-1st-responders/articleshow/120446701.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the dust settled and the cries for help grew louder, a remarkable tale of humanity unfolded. Neighbours and rescuers scrambling among the rubble turned heroes digging out people to safety.Taslim and Salman were among the first to respond to the collapse of the building on Street No. 1 in Shakti Vihar , Mustafabad. They rushed to the disaster site to see how they could help. They had no rescue equipment but plenty of determination and worked tirelessly, ultimately saving at least six lives.Taslim recalled the harrowing scene, ""For 15-20 minutes, there was only white dust, from which one could hear cries for help. We began lifting the broken cement blocks, working alongside others to rescue trapped people."" The six people they pulled out were sent to hospitals.Soon the professional rescue teams arrived on the scene, but that early intervention by the do-gooders proved crucial. The rescuers faced challenges in operating in the congested area, especially since the building had collapsed like a pancake, limiting the use of their equipment. According to Mohsen Shahedi, DIG (Operations), NDRF, such a collapse significantly reduces survival chances due to floors collapsing onto each other leaving little possibility of voids.Rescue teams typically use specialised equipment like wall detectors to locate trapped survivors. However, on this occasion, a rescue official explained, ""We couldn't use wall detectors due to significant disturbances since they rely on thermal waves. The movement of people was also a hindrance. Instead, we had to rely on cutters and drill machines.""According to NDRF officials, the narrow lane forced them to park their vehicles far from the spot, making it difficult to bring in dumpers to move debris and aid in the search. Fire tenders were parked at a distance and only one JCB excavator could be deployed. A canine squad was called to the spot to assist in the search and help the personnel pinpoint spots where the victims could be lying trapped.Two neighbouring buildings were also damaged and its residents had to be evacuated. ""If those buildings hadn't been affected, we would have had more space for rescue work,"" a fire officer said.According to rescuers, an empty space nearby was useful for throwing the debris. ""Because of space constraints, we had no other option but to stand on the rubble and work, which is not desirable because victims might be lying below at that spot. Even while using the drilling machine, we had to be very careful,"" said a rescuer.","Neighbours and rescuers scrambling among the rubble turned heroes digging out people to safety.

'His attack on the Supreme Court is not acceptable'

BJP defends Nishikant's remark

NEW DELHI: After Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar questioned Supreme Court , a BJP leader has added fuel to the fire, saying Parliament should stop functioning if the apex court acts like it. Targeting Chief Justice of India, he said, ""Sanjiv Khanna is responsible for all the civil wars happening in this country.""Taking aim at Supreme Court on Friday, seasoned BJP parliamentarian Nishikant Dubey in a cryptic post on X wrote, ""(Parliament should be closed down if the Supreme Court has to make the laws).""Later today, Dubey said that the Supreme Court is responsible for inciting religious wars in the country. ""The Supreme Court is going beyond its limits. If one has to go to the Supreme Court for everything, then Parliament and State Assembly should be shut,"" he added.""How can you give direction to the appointing authority? The President appoints the Chief Justice of India. The Parliament makes the law of this country. You will dictate that Parliament? How did you make a new law? In which law is it written that the President has to take a decision within three months? This means that you want to take this country towards anarchy. When the Parliament sits, there will be a detailed discussion on this,"" he further said.The BJP leader also criticised the apex court over Article 377, saying, ""there was an Article 377 in which homosexuality is a big crime. The Trump administration has said that there are only two sexes in this world, either male or female. Whether it is Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, all believe that homosexuality is a crime. One fine morning, the Supreme Court said that we abolish this case.""""Article 141 says that the laws we make, the judgments we give, are applicable from the lower court to the Supreme Court.

""Constitutional functionaries, ministers, BJP MPs are speaking against the Supreme Court as the Supreme Court is saying one thing that when a law is made, you should not go against the basic structure of the constitution and if the law is against the constitution, we will not accept it. Deliberately, the Supreme Court is being targeted as in many issues like electoral bonds, the Supreme Court has said that what has been done by the government is unconstitutional,"" he added.""This is a defamatory statement against the Supreme Court. Nishikant Dubey is a person who continuously demolishes all other institutions. Now, he has attacked the Supreme Court. I hope that the Supreme Court judges will take this into notice as he is not speaking in Parliament but outside it.

If someone does not understand this, then it is a matter of great sadness.""AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, ""He has made a very shoddy statement. I hope that tomorrow only, the Supreme Court will initiate suo-moto contempt proceedings against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and send him to jail. Whenever any judge gives a judgment in favour of the BJP, they are sent to the Rajya Sabha , and now, when a judge gave an instruction that the law should be followed and governors should not sit indefinitely on bills, the BJP has used all its resources to defame the judges and attack the Supreme Court.""BJP's Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra said, ""On the Manipur issue, the Supreme Court took a suo motu cognisance, but we are seeing that several parts of West Bengal are burning, but the eyes of the Supreme Court are closed. The entire country is looking at the Supreme Court that the SC would give direction to the Govt to impose President's rule in West Bengal, but the Supreme Court is silent.""Dubey's remarks came amid hearings on several pleas ongoing in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act. Parliament passed the Bill in the first week of April.Meanwhile, Centre has decided not to implement some of its contentious provisions till the next date of hearing after court raised several concerns over them.The timing of Dubey's remark is also noteworthy as Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar recently voiced strong disapproval of Supreme Court's judgement after it set a timeline for the President to take decision on the bills sent to her.“We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis?” Dhankhar questioned SC while speaking to the sixth batch of Rajya Sabha interns at the Vice-President’s Enclave on Thursday.""There is a directive to the President by a recent judgement. Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not. We never bargained for democracy for this day. President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, becomes law,"" Dhankhar added.""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" he further said.However, opposition parties lauded court's observation over the Waqf Act and direction to President.",BJP MP Nishikant Dubey says Parliament should stop functioning if Supreme Court acts like it.

Indi-Chini boys in US mount legal challenge against MAGA strike on foreign students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indi-chini-boys-in-us-mount-legal-challenge-against-maga-strike-on-foreign-students-f1-visa-termination-us-trump/articleshow/120437509.cms,"Image credit: AP

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

A group of three Indian and two Chinese students on Friday mounted a legal challenge against the Trump administration for disrupting the academic pursuit of hundreds of foreign students and academics in the US, often on minor grounds such as traffic and parking violations.In a class action lawsuit filed before the US District Court in New Hampshire, the five students, through their attorneys, alleged that the Department of Homeland Security has unilaterally terminated F-1 student status of ""hundreds, if not thousands,"" of foreign students and Optional Practical Training (“OPT”) participants throughout the US. They sought reinstatement of student visas that have been terminated, including theirs, and a halt to detentions and deportations.The three Indian plaintiffs Manikanta Pasula, Likhith Babu Gorrela, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli, are students at Rivier University in New Hampshire, and the two Chinese plaintiffs Hangrui Zhang and Haoyang An, are graduate students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. Indians and Chinese the two largest foreign groups in the US academia, with more than half million students between them.In the lawsuit, Pasula, now in the third semester of a computer engineering master's program, described being arrested and charged with driving without a valid US license while he had his Indian driver’s license. New Hampshire permits the use of an International Driving Permit for up to 60 days after foreign student’s arrival in the United States, and while Pasula was driving within that 60-day window, he pled guilty, paid a $248 fine, and immediately obtained a valid U.S. driver’s license.Earlier this month, Pasula received an email from Rivier University that the State Department revoked his visa. He separately received an email from the U.S. Consulate General, Mumbai, that confirmed that his visa was revoked and that “remaining in the United States without a lawful immigration status can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation.”The two other cases involving Indian students are similar. Thanuj was charged with speeding and a traffic misdemeanor for failing to carry a valid US driver’s license. Although he had a valid international driving permit at the time, he was outside the 60-day window in which the international driving permit is allowed in New Hampshire. Gorrela too had an international driving permit but was using it beyond the 60-day window. Although both paid fines and subsequently got their US licenses, the DHS nixed their student status, putting them on track for visa revocation and deportation.Of the two Chinese students, the lawsuit says Haoyang was charged with a misdemeanor for driving without an active insurance policy in Massachusetts, and Hangrui was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor in an episode stemming from a misunderstanding. Although both cases were subsequently dismissed in court, their student status was also revoked in the DHS crackdown that now extends to infractions that go far beyond political activism.Attorneys for the students said the Trump administration's ""unilateral and unlawful terminations"" have severely disrupted the educational opportunities of students who are in the middle of their studies (and in the middle of a semester) and who are simply trying to obtain, often at considerable expense, an education in the US while following all the rules required of them.""These injuries are real.... Their graduation is unpredictable and unlikely unless this Court intervenes,"" the lawsuit said, describing the students' situation. Linkhith Babu Gorrela’s graduation date for his Master’s program is May 20, 2025, and without a valid F-1 student status, he may not obtain his Master’s degree. Nor can he participate in the OPT program after graduation.Similarly, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli and Manikanta Pasula have only one semester left before they can complete their Master’s degrees and participate in the OPT program. Hangrui Zhang’s only source of income, the lawsuit said, is his research assistantship which has been cut off in light of the termination of his F-1 student status. Haoyang An will have to abandon his Master’s program despite having already invested $329,196 in his education in the US.","Group of three Indian and two Chinese students mounted a legal challenge against the Trump administration.

NEW DELHI: In what could be another dramatic churn in Maharashtra politics , Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday expressed willingness for a political tie-up with his estranged cousin Raj Thackeray Uddhav Thackeray's remark suggesting thaw with his brother, who parted ways and formed his own Maharashtra Navnirman Sena party, comes when the election at India's biggest municipal body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), is due to be held this year.""I am ready to come together (with Raj Thackeray). I am ready to come forward in the interest of Maharashtra, keeping aside minor incidents. I have put an end to all fights. The interest of Maharashtra is my priority,"" Uddhav Thackeray, who is also Maharashtra's former CM, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI during his address at the 57th annual general meeting of Bharatiya Kamgar Sena.Raj Thackeray echoed a similar sentiment, saying that ""coming together is not difficult"" and that differences between cousins are ""proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and Marathi people"".""The disputes and fights between Uddhav and me are minor -- Maharashtra is much bigger than all that. These differences are proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and the Marathi people,"" Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency IANS.He further said: ""Coming together is not difficult, it’s a matter of will. It’s not just about my desire or selfishness. We need to look at the bigger picture. All Marathi people across political parties should unite and form a single party.""The MNS chief further distinguished his past political decisions from the Eknath Shinde-led rebellion, saying: ""I left Shiv Sena when MLAs and MPs were with me. Even then, I chose to walk alone because I couldn't work under anyone except Balasaheb Thackeray. I had no objection to working with Uddhav.

I don’t let my ego get in the way of such matters,” he added.Uddhav Thackeray’s move to ride the new political wagon comes at a time when the Maha Vikas Aghadi , formed to counter the BJP, has been reeling from a crisis ever since its humiliating loss in the Maharashtra assembly elections last year.Raj Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray, two key figures in Maharashtra politics, share a long and complex history shaped by the towering legacy of the late Bal Thackeray , their uncle and father, respectively, who founded the Shiv Sena. Their political journeys, once aligned under the same saffron banner, gradually diverged into rivalry and competing visions.While both were groomed in the party’s ranks, Raj was long seen as the natural heir due to his oratory style and aggressive street politics that mirrored Bal Thackeray’s persona. However, in the early 2000s, Balasaheb chose Uddhav, his quieter and more organisationally minded son, to lead the party, ""sidelining"" Raj.This decision created a rift, culminating in Raj’s exit from Shiv Sena in 2005.He soon launched his own party, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), with a similar pro-Marathi ideology, but it failed to match the dominance of the original Sena. Since then, Raj and Uddhav have often found themselves on opposing sides of Maharashtra’s political battles, with sporadic talk of reconciliation but no real unity.While Uddhav led Shiv Sena into an alliance with ideologically divergent parties like the Congress and NCP under the MVA to keep the BJP out of power, Raj oscillated between supporting the BJP and positioning himself as an independent force, often attempting to reclaim his relevance through hardline rhetoric against Hindi and north Indian migrant workers in Mumbai or issue-based campaigns.Their relationship today remains politically distant, shaped more by competition and legacy than by family ties.","Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray expresses willingness for a political tie-up with his estranged cousin Raj Thackerays.

'horrific and unacceptable': NCW

NEW DELHI: BJP leader Amit Malviya on Saturday claimed that Hindu families in West Bengal's Murshidabad district were systematically targeted during recent violence linked to protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.In a post on X, Malviya said that homes belonging to Hindu residents were marked with ink and kept under watch before being torched. He further alleged that two local Muslim residents helped attackers identify Hindu-owned houses and shops.""Shocking details emerging from Murshidabad! Before the arson attacks began, homes belonging to Hindu families were marked with ink and kept under close watch. After days of surveillance, these properties were systematically torched,"" Malviya wrote, adding that such targeted violence is reported to occur frequently, especially on Fridays.""Reports suggest that two local Muslim residents supplied key information to the attackers, helping them pinpoint Hindu-owned houses and shops. Disturbingly, similar targeted violence is said to occur regularly—particularly on Fridays,"" he added.The BJP IT cell head also accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of ""encouraging demographic change in border districts just to remain in power.""The incident that triggered these allegations occurred on April 11 during protests over the Waqf Act in Murshidabad, where a father-son duo — Harogobindo Das and Chandan Das — were found murdered with multiple stab wounds at their residence in the Jafrabad locality of Shamsherganj.Earlier today, West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose met the grieving family, assuring them of justice and support. ""I will look into your requests, There are three to four suggestions. They have asked for BSF postings in the locality. I will take up the matter with the appropriate authorities. Some proactive action will definitely be taken,"" he said, adding that the family has been provided the ‘Peace Room’ helpline number to reach out directly to Raj Bhavan.Many visuals showed the victims' family members breaking down in front of the governor, falling at his feet and pleading for justice.

They want justice, and they will get justice.""The incident has also drawn strong condemnation from the National Commission for Women . Commission member Archana Majumdar, who visited the affected area, described the violence as ""horrific and unacceptable,"" urging the state government to take responsibility. ""Some woman lost their husband, some lost their son. People were dragged out of their homes and butchered. This is horrific. I don't know if such incidents have ever happened in West Bengal.

""The suffering these people are going through is inhuman. We will put their demands in front of the government,"" she said.Meanwhile, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal staged protests across the country, including in Hyderabad, targeting the Mamata Banerjee-led government for its alleged inaction.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal accused the state government of allowing extremist forces to operate unchecked. ""We cannot let the country be on the verge of terrorism, and we will protect the Hindus from every danger. Mamata Banerjee herself acknowledged that foreign people were involved in the Murshidabad violence. If such is the case, was she sleeping? Why didn't she demand an NIA investigation?"" he said.Bansal further claimed that the Trinamool Congress government is acting against the interests of Hindus. ""We will remove this government of 'invaders'. Mamata Banerjee has been continuously supporting 'jihadis'.

Bengaluru/Shivamogga: The principal and a second-division clerk of a Bidar college were dismissed on Saturday after a student was allegedly barred from answering the Common Entrance Test (CET) maths paper for coming to the examination hall wearing a janivara (sacred thread).A district commissioner's report revealed that the exam staff at Bidar's Sai Spoorthi PU College had mistaken the janivara for a metallic accessory, leading to a misapplication of the CET dress code. The student was later allowed to write the biology paper in Thursday's afternoon session.A similar incident was reported in Shivamogga too following which two home guards have been booked under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), prompting statewide debate over the handling of religious symbols in exam halls. The report found college principal Chandrasekhara Biradara and inspection staffer Satish Pawar negligent.The chief invigilator, Moddasir, was also informed about the incident but failed to resolve the issue or notify KEA, the report added.Based on the findings, the departments of pre-university and higher education recommended their dismissal, which Sai Spoorthi PU College formalised. However, it remains unclear if the affected student will be given a re-exam. The matter is expected to be discussed with the chief minister, said sources.In a similar incident in Shivamogga, three students at Adichunchanagiri PU College were reportedly asked to remove their janivaras Wednesday. One student refused but was still allowed to take the exam, while two others complied. The matter came to light after a complaint by Natraj Bhagavath of Karnataka Brahmin Sabha.Police registered an FIR and two of the home guards involved were suspended.A senior police officer said that when questioned college authorities said they only provided the premises and had no role in conducting or facilitating the exams. They also stated that the staff did not ask students to remove their sacred threads, but only the Kashi dhara (sacred thread worn around the wrist).Deputy commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said CCTV footage did not show sacred threads being discarded in a dustbin, indicating the student may have removed it voluntarily. ""The issue stemmed from the security guards' poor judgment rather than any deliberate action against the sacred thread,"" he noted.Home minister G Parameshwara condemned the incident, saying, ""It is a grave mistake, and I can't accept such things.""In Hubballi, Union minister Pralhad Joshi termed the incident ""an attack on the Janivara belief"", calling for clearer instructions from the state.",A student was allegedly barred from answering the Common Entrance Test (CET) maths paper for coming to the examination hall wearing a janivara.

The general (UR) cutoff is 93.1, while it is 80.38 for EWS, 79.43 for OBC, 61.15 for SC, and 47.90 for ST categories.To ensure transparency and fairness, NTA implemented extensive measures, including live CCTV surveillance, biometric verification, AI-based video analytics, and 5G mobile jammers. Despite this, 110 candidates were found using unfair means, and their results have been withheld. Another 23 candidates face delays due to identity verification issues.In the PwBD (person with benchmark disability) category, Harshal Gupta from Chhattisgarh topped with an outstanding NTA score of 99.96. A total of 4,314 PwBD candidates appeared in the exam, with additional organisational support provided to them as per govt norms.As candidates now set their sights on JEE Advanced 2025, Saturday's result concludes one of India's largest and most competitive engineering entrance processes - a gateway to institutions such as NITs, IIITs, and the coveted IITs.To be eligible for JEE (Advanced) 2025, candidates must fall within the top percentile cutoffs based on their category in JEE Main 2025 (Paper 1). Additionally, only those who appeared in both or either session of JEE Main 2025 and meet age, attempt, and academic requirements as specified by the IITs are allowed to apply.Over the past four years, the cutoff trend for JEE (Advanced) eligibility based on JEE Main scores has shown a steady upward trajectory across all categories, reflecting growing competition and improved academic performance among aspirants. This consistent rise suggests increased access to coaching resources, broader outreach of STEM education, and possibly more aspirants opting for multiple attempts to maximise their scores. It also signals that even reserved category candidates are performing at higher levels, narrowing historic gaps in achievement.","The Joint Entrance Examination Main 2025 was conducted in two phases with the best score being considered for those who attempted both.

Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientists had received specialised training from the organisation.Suthirto Dutta, WII senior scientist and coordinator of the GIB project at the Jaisalmer Bustard Breeding Centre, said this was the third chick born entirely through artificial methods under this project, marking a historic achievement for India. This groundbreaking development was not just a success of a biological experiment but a milestone in giving new life to this rare bird on the brink of extinction. Dutta said the Bustard Recovery Programme achieved this remarkable feat through artificial insemination. The scientific team procured semen from a male at the Sam Conservation Breeding Centre and artificially inseminated a four-year-old female at the facility.“Project Great Indian Bustard reached a new milestone as the 11th chick of 2025 hatched on April 17 from an egg laid by the female ‘Sharky’ on March 26 in Sam Centre, after being artificially inseminated on March 20 with semen from the male ‘Suda’ housed in Ramdevra Centre, taking the GIB tally in the national conservation breeding programme to 55. This also marked the third success in artificial insemination for the species,” said Dutta.Suthirto Dutta said the procedure involved collecting male bustard sperm for artificial insemination, culminating in the birth of a vigorous chick. WII’s endeavours proved fruitful, with the artificial breeding centre demonstrating its efficacy. Specialists verified the chick’s robust health condition.","India becomes the world’s first country to achieve success in the artificial breeding of the Great Indian Bustard.

MUMBAI: Heart tumours are rare, with an incidence of less than one case per one million population. Dombivli resident Yogesh Mehta , 67, not only had a myxoma or benign heart tumour , but also had a blockage in one of the heart's main arteries.""It is rare to find a right atrial myxoma and even more rare to have a concomitant coronary artery disease in the same patient,"" said cardiac surgeon Dr Bijoy Kutty, who performed an emergency surgery on Mehta to fix the twin problems.Mehta, who used to manage a hardware business, had peculiar symptoms that never seemed like a ""heart-related problem"" to him. He experienced loose motions and weakness, prompting doctors to check his digestive system.Even the most telling symptom - he would get breathless or pass out as soon as he lay down on the bed - was not interpreted as a heart problem. ""These unique symptoms were missed by multiple doctors he consulted in the last two months,"" said Dr Kutty. In hindsight, the tumour grew to such an extent that it pressed down on his heart and blood vessels, thus affecting blood flow that resulted in dizzy spells. ""When we removed the tumour, it was the size of a small orange,"" said the surgeon.Mehta's wife, Trupti, said he had diabetes and hypertension for many years, but the family had no inkling about a heart problem until March 23 when he fell in the bathroom. ""It took us some time to revive him,"" she said. His son, Paras, rushed him to the nearby Om Hospital, which referred him to the heart-specialty Icon Hospital in Dombivli.Dr Kutty, who checked Mehta at Icon Hospital, found the tumour as well as the blockage in scans. ""However, I requested the family to transfer him to our bigger sister hospital, Platinum Hospital in Mulund,"" said the doctor. On March 26, Mehta underwent cardiac surgery to remove both the tumour and the blockage in his left anterior descending artery. The operation lasted five hours, and doctors said the tumour would not recur. The main concern with heart tumours, whether benign or malignant, is the risk of embolization - say, a piece of the tumour breaks off and travels through the bloodstream, blocking an artery and causing a stroke or other complications.Mehta, who has three sons, is grateful his ""double heart problems"" were sorted out. ""I have got a second life,"" he said.","Dombivli resident Yogesh Mehta, 67, not only had a myxoma or benign heart tumour, but also had a blockage in one of the heart's main arteries.

Among these toppers, there's only one girl.Of the 24 students with 100 NTA scores across both sessions, Rajasthan leads with 7, followed by Maharashtra (4), Telangana (3), and UP (3).Among the 10 candidates with a 100 percentile, one belongs to the general-EWS category and one to the OBC-NCL (Non-Creamy Layer) category. None is from SC or ST categories, highlighting continued gaps in representation despite growing participation across social groups.The JEE Main 2025 was conducted in two phases with the best score being considered for those who attempted both. Nearly 15.4 lakh unique candidates registered, and almost 14.8 lakh appeared across the sessions. The April session alone saw over 10.6 lakh registrations, with 9.9 lakh candidates appearing for the test, held in 13 languages across 300 Indian cities and 15 international locations, including Dubai, Singapore and Munich.For candidates aspiring to qualify for JEE Advanced, NTA announced category-wise cutoff percentiles . The general (UR) cutoff is 93.1, while it is 80.38 for EWS, 79.43 for OBC, 61.15 for SC, and 47.90 for ST categories.To ensure transparency and fairness, NTA implemented extensive measures, including live CCTV surveillance, biometric verification, AI-based video analytics, and 5G mobile jammers. Despite this, 110 candidates were found using unfair means, and their results have been withheld. Another 23 candidates face delays due to identity verification issues.In the PwBD (person with benchmark disability) category, Harshal Gupta from Chhattisgarh topped with an outstanding NTA score of 99.96. A total of 4,314 PwBD candidates appeared in the exam, with additional organisational support provided to them as per govt norms.As candidates now set their sights on JEE Advanced 2025, Saturday's result concludes one of India's largest and most competitive engineering entrance processes - a gateway to institutions such as NITs, IIITs, and the coveted IITs.To be eligible for JEE (Advanced) 2025, candidates must fall within the top percentile cutoffs based on their category in JEE Main 2025 (Paper 1). Additionally, only those who appeared in both or either session of JEE Main 2025 and meet age, attempt, and academic requirements as specified by the IITs are allowed to apply.Over the past four years, the cutoff trend for JEE (Advanced) eligibility based on JEE Main scores has shown a steady upward trajectory across all categories, reflecting growing competition and improved academic performance among aspirants. This consistent rise suggests increased access to coaching resources, broader outreach of STEM education, and possibly more aspirants opting for multiple attempts to maximise their scores. It also signals that even reserved category candidates are performing at higher levels, narrowing historic gaps in achievement.","The JEE Main 2025 was conducted in two phases with the best score being considered for those who attempted both.

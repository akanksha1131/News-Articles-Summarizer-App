How hypersonic missile works



NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) on Saturday conducted a flight trial of a long-range hypersonic missile from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha.The hypersonic missile that the DRDO tested is designed to carry various payloads for ranges greater than 1500 km for all the services of the Indian armed forces.The missile has been indigenously developed by the laboratories of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex, Hyderabad along with various other DRDO laboratories and Industry Partners.The flight trial was carried out in the presence of senior scientists of DRDO and the armed forces.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO on the successful flight trial of the missile, calling it a ""major milestone"" for the nation.""India has achieved a major milestone by successfully conducting flight trial of long range hypersonic missile from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island, off-the-coast of Odisha. This is a historic moment and this significant achievement has put our country in the group of select nations having capabilities of such critical and advanced military technologies. I congratulate Team DRDO, our armed forces and the Industry for stupendous achievement,"" Rajnath Singh wrote on X.Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound in the upper atmosphere - or about 6,200 km per hour (3,850 mph). This is slower than an intercontinental ballistic missile, but the shape of a hypersonic glide vehicle allows it to manoeuvre toward a target or away from defences.Combining a glide vehicle with a missile that can launch it partially into orbit - a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) - could strip adversaries of reaction time and traditional defences mechanisms. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), by contrast, carry nuclear warheads on ballistic trajectories that travel into space but never reach orbit.","The missile has been indigenously developed by the laboratories of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex, Hyderabad. The flight trial was carried out in the presence of senior scientists of DRDO and the armed forces. Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO on the successful flight trial of the missile.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115376217,imgsize-2788590,width-400,resizemode-4/115376217.jpg"

PUNE: Union minister Nitin Gadkari slammed the Congress party over the "" Constitution campaign "" and accused the party of ""altering"" the Constitution during the Congress government under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi Addressing an election rally in Pune's Wakad, Gadkari attacked the Congress party and alleged that only sloganeering statements were made of ' Garibi Hatao ,' and that the poor continue to suffer under the Congress rule.""During the Congress regime, various programs like the 8-point, 20-point, and 40-point initiatives were launched with the slogan 'Garibi Hatao,' but unfortunately, poverty persisted among farmers, labourers, dalits and muslims. Despite the promises, only announcements were made, and the poor continued to suffer. However, our country's adoption of new economic policies has led to significant growth and development,"" he said.He accused Congress of propagating false information about the BJP amending the constitution and claimed that Congress altered the constitution during Indira Gandhi's administration when her election was pronounced invalid by the Allahabad Court.""During the last Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party spread misinformation that the BJP would change the constitution if they won more than 400 seats. However, the constitution is a solid foundation of India's democracy and no one dares to change it. The BJP's policies and leadership are focused on developing the country and making it a 5 trillion economy. When Indira Gandhi's election was declared invalid by the Allahabad Court, the Congress Party, for their gain, altered the Constitution, which Baba Saheb Ambedkar had created. Now, those who once broke the Constitution are using it to spread misinformation during elections and confusing people,"" he said.""The Bharatiya Janata Party does not engage in caste politics, and I'm a daredevil who doesn't let delegations influence me. In front of 10,000 Muslims, I said, 'I am chaddiwala. If you want to vote, vote; if not, I'll still work for you.' I believe a person's qualities, not their caste, define them. I'll never be casteist."" he added.According to the Union minister, India's automobile business is worth Rs 22 lakh crore and ranks third in the world, whereas it was ranked eighth and Rs 7 lakh before 2014.""In 2014, India's automobile industry was worth Rs 7 lakh crores and we ranked eighth globally. However, through the power of growth and technological advancements, we've surged past Japan and secured the third position worldwide. Today, the industry is valued at Rs22 lakh crores, with the United States and China leading the way. This remarkable progress has created employment opportunities for approximately four and a half crore youth.

Netflix’s growing sports entertainment strategy

As Jake Paul and Mike Tyson face off this Friday, Netflix has its own stakes to consider. This marks the streaming giant’s biggest live sports event yet, with potential impact on future NFL and WWE deals.Streaming live from AT&T Stadium, it will be available to Netflix’s 280 million subscribers at no extra cost. Delayed due to Tyson’s medical emergency, Netflix has kept expectations under wraps, what does this mean for their future in live sports? Keep reading to find out.JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth stands firm in his belief that the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could set a new record as the most-watched boxing match in history. While surpassing Muhammad Ali's iconic bouts, which drew an estimated one billion viewers globally, may be a lofty goal, the 4.6 million viewers from the 2015 Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight might be within reach.Anmuth explains “We believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX’s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,"" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. He also notes that Netflix’s increasing focus on sports entertainment and live events, especially with NFLX’s growing negotiating leverage, will only enhance its reach. (via: Independent)Netflix has already begun utilizing live sports as complementary programming to its popular documentaries and series. A prime example is the three-part documentary series Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson, which has quickly climbed the ranks, securing the second spot among Netflix's most-viewed shows.In addition, the platform’s recent ventures, such as last November’s Netflix Cup pairing Formula 1 drivers with PGA golfers demonstrate its expanding sports portfolio. Their March exhibition match featuring Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz was tied into promotional content for upcoming documentaries. This continued push into live sports is evident, with the NFL even partnering with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader, thanks to the global success of series like Quarterback and Receiver.Also Read: Patriots provide major update on DT Christian Barmore after blood clot diagnosis before Rams matchup Netflix’s sports strategy isn’t stopping with boxing and football. Starting January 5, Netflix will become the home of WWE’s Raw series in select regions, marking a significant milestone in the platform’s sports expansion. The platform will carry WWE events globally, excluding the U.S., including major live events like WrestleMania and SummerSlam.According to media consultant Patrick Crakes, Netflix’s push into live sports is a smart ""dry run"" for handling larger volumes of live events, adding,“It could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.” As Netflix continues to grow its sports entertainment presence, the stakes are high and so are the expectations.","Streaming live from AT&T Stadium, it will be available to Netflix’s 280 million subscribers at no extra cost.

Vulgar booklets

promoting rape culture

Even as doctors protest across the country for safety inside hospitals, fresh entrants in several medical colleges are being forced by seniors to memorise and read aloud from booklets filled with vulgar abuses, lauding sexual violence against women in general - and against their female classmates and nurses in particular - in the name of ragging. These 'ragging' sessions and booklets are described by experts in gender violence as grooming in rape culture.Freshers are told to learn the content in the booklets titled 'medical sahitya' or 'personality development programme' and always keep the copies with them. These encourage freshers to look at women of all ages as sex objects.For instance, in the list of acronyms is BHMB (badi hokar maal banegi), and that's the only expansion in the list that is just about printable!According to freshers, they are forced to read aloud from the booklet and if they stumble or laugh, they have to start over. There are descriptions of stages of breast development comparing them with fruits or vegetables, starting from 0-15 age group. There are disrespectful references to cadavers.Every reference to women, including their classmates, is about violent, forceful sexual acts and description of genitalia in the crudest possible terms and nurses are consistently portrayed as 'being available' and willing, indeed craving, to be sexually assaulted by doctors.Jasmeen Patheja, founder of Blank Noise which is working on a project called 'Campus of Belonging' in colleges, describes it as encouraging rape culture.A senior female doctor said, ""Joking about patients' bodies when they are lying unconscious on the operation table is some of the cheapest things that I have seen male anaesthesiologists and surgeons do. This kind of grooming produces doctors who would do such things.""Another doctor recounted her college experience, and said, ""As students, we stood around male doctors asking young women to take off their clothes while they showed us how to do a 'breast examination'. The women were touched without consent and unnecessarily.""Sunita Sheel Bandewar of Forum for Medical Ethics Society said: "" Seniors who indulge into such gross ragging practices might be a threat to women colleagues across the spaces.""",Freshers are told to learn the content in the booklets titled'medical sahitya' or 'personality development programme' The booklets encourage freshers to look at women of all ages as sex objects.

(With inputs from BB Goswami in Silchar)

GUWAHATI: Manipur's valley districts plunged into violence Saturday as protesters torched property and attacked homes of ministers and MLAs in Imphal, following the discovery of six bodies - three women and three children - in the Barak river in conflict-ridden Jiribam over the past two days. Security forces drove away a mob that tried to target CM N Biren Singh's vacant ancestral home outside Imphal.State government imposed a curfew in Imphal East, Imphal West and Bishnupur districts from 4.30pm indefinitely and suspended internet and mobile data services in Imphal East, Imphal West, Bishnupur, Thoubal, Kakching, Kangpokpi, and Churachandpur to curb the spread of hate speech and inflammatory videos on social media. The bodies are suspected to be that of six missing inmates from a camp for displaced Meitei people near the site where security forces killed 10 Hmar men on November 11. While the forces described the slain men as militants, the Kuki-Zo community claims they were village volunteers.The six Meitei victims were a 25-year-old woman and her two young children, a 31-year-old woman and her daughter, and a 60-year-old woman. They were allegedly abducted by Kuki militants. The bodies have been sent to Silchar Medical College and Hospital in Assam for autopsy.Protesters accused the ministers and MLAs of failing to curb the escalating violence. They also opposed the re-imposition of AFSPA in several areas. Residences of BJP legislators, including CM Biren Singh's son-in-law Rajkumar Imo Singh, Raghumani Singh, and Sapam Kunjakeswor, were attacked. Independent MLA Sapam Nishikanta's house was also targeted. Protesters stormed the homes of health minister Sapam Ranjan and consumer affairs minister L Susindro Singh in Imphal.The Union government Saturday acknowledged the “fragile” security situation in Manipur. “Armed miscreants from both communities in conflict have been indulging in violence, leading to unfortunate loss of lives and disruption in public order,” it said, directing security forces to restore peace.Biren Singh’s government requested home ministry to review and withdraw its Nov 14 decision whereby parts of five districts under six police stations were designated as disturbed and AFSPA was reinstated in these areas. Meitei Heritage Society (MHS) condemned abductions and killings in the strongest terms. “We are shocked beyond words, and nothing less than an exemplary capital punishment would do justice for victims.

"Air India Baggage Policy: Now, pay more for checking-in second bag to Europe & UK on Air India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-pay-more-for-checking-in-2nd-bag-to-europe-uk-on-air-india/articleshow/115363712.cms,"NEW DELHI: Passengers will now have to pay may more to check-in a second bag on Air India flights to and from Europe and the UK. AI has from October 17 introduced fare families where the lowest economy fare allows one check-in of 23 kg to these two places. Those who wish to check in two bags will need to opt for the higher economy fares, the difference starting at about Rs 4,000 (one-way). Most big Western airlines like Lufthansa allow one check-in bag to economy flyers and extra charges have to be paid for the second bag. British Airways starts with a handbag-only economy fare and then has higher economy fare levels that allow two bags of upto 23 kg each.Earlier this year, AI had done the same with domestic where the base category of economy fare now allows baggage allowance of upto 15 kg — down from earlier 25 kg but in line with all other Indian carriers. In its pre-divestment days (before 2022), state-owned AI used to offer higher baggage allowance to woo passengers and make up for its dilapidated cabin product and poor punctuality.Now with the Tatas investing billions of dollars in improving AI and hopefully the result will show in coming years across the fleet, the baggage allowance is getting in sync with big global airlines. While passengers understand that, they wonder if AI should have dome that once its wide body product had improved (something expected to happen over next two years) along with its punctuality. AI still allows two bags of upto 23 kg each in economy on North American routes. How long that stays remains to be seen.“Air India has restructured its fare families on Europe and UK routes to better align the same with market trends and offerings. AI now offer travellers a more affordable ‘value’ fare option that provides one piece of checked baggage weighing 23kg with limited travel flexibility. Travellers who seek more baggage allowance and higher travel flexibility can opt for the ‘classic’ and ‘flex’ fares that continue to offer two pieces of checked baggage weighing 23kg each in economy. ‘Value’ fares are available only for economy class bookings,” AI had said in a statement recently while announcing new fare families across cabins. AI has 264 weekly flights to and from Europe and the UK.A Delhi-based CA who is booking a ticket for his son in Europe to come home this Christmas said: “The fare difference between the one and two check-in bags fare is Rs 8,000. A leading Gulf carrier is cheaper by Rs 20,000 and is offering 35 kg baggage allowance. But taking that will mean increased travel time of five hours due to the connection at its hub.”As AI improves — overall in terms of cabin product and on time performance — and IndiGo spreads its wings on longer-range planes, foreign airlines with hubs in places like the Gulf, further West Asia, Europe and south/southeast Asia that have historically carried a lion’s share of traffic between India and rest of them world will have to offer lower fares to wean away passengers from the nonstop convenience that these two desi carriers will provide.A senior AI official said: “The difference is not much between our one and two check-in bags economy fares for Europe and UK flights. For instance it could be about Rs 4,000 (one-way) for a, say, Delhi-Frankfurt flight. The idea was why should a person travelling with one check-in pay the same as someone doing so with two check-in bags.”","Air India has from October 17 introduced fare families where the lowest economy fare allows one check-in of 23 kg to these two places.

Musk’s SpaceX to help India launch heavyweight satellite on Tuesday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/musks-spacex-to-help-india-launch-heavyweight-satellite-on-tuesday/articleshow/115369165.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk , who supported Donald Trump in his victory in the US presidential election, will now bail out India. Musk-owned American space company SpaceX will launch one of India’s heaviest communication satellites, Gsat-20 , weighing 4,700 kg.Confirming this to TOI, Isro chairman S Somanath said, “SpaceX’s Falcon-9 will launch Isro’s Gsat-20, also called GSAT N-2, on Nov 19.”Isro’s heavy lifter LVM-3, popularly known as ‘Bahubali’ or ‘Fat Boy’, can lift satellites weighing up to four tonnes into the geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). However, as Gsat-20 weighs more than four tonnes, Isro is seeking help from SpaceX for launching its satellite with its heavy-lifter Falcon-9 rocket, which can launch payloads of 8300 kg or 8.3 tonnes to GTO.Isro was till now dependent on Arianespace to launch its heavier satellites, but the European space rocket at present lacked commercial slots for the Gsat-20 launch. This is because Arianespace’s Ariane-5 rocket retired last year and commercial satellite slots for the next few launches of its successor Ariane-6 are already booked. With Russia engaged in the Ukraine conflict and China’s commercial services never considered by India, SpaceX is the only reliable option for India.The Gsat-20 or GSAT N-2, a continuation of the Gsat series of communication satellites, is funded, owned and operated by Isro’s commercial arm New Space India Ltd. The satellite, which has a mission life of 14 years, features a Ka-band high-throughput communications payload with 70 Gbit/s throughput utilising 40 beams offering HTS capacity of nearly 48Gpbs. Each beam will have two polarisations, effectively making them 80 beams.The satellite is intended to add data transmission capacity to the communication infrastructure required by the Union govt’s Smart City mission. It will also help enable in-flight internet connectivity.The satellite was initially expected to be launched on an Isro’s LVM-3 rocket, but was later shifted to Falcon-9 due to the satellite being 700 kg overweight.As India lacks a launcher for over four-tonne satellites, Isro has now fast-tracked the development of its Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV). The Rs 8,240-crore NGLV program is designed to enhance payload capacity threefold compared to the current LVM3, while its cost will be only 1.5 times more. NGLV is designed to have a maximum payload capability of 30 tonnes to the Low Earth Orbit and will also have a reusable first stage. It will also be able to carry payloads around 10 tonnes to GTO.","Isro’s heavy lifter LVM-3, popularly known as ‘Bahubali’ or ‘Fat Boy’, can lift satellites weighing up to four tonnes into the geostationary transfer orbit.

Based on the observations, the district collector denied NOC.While considering the petition, HC emphasised that the state must strike a delicate balance between safeguarding religious freedom and upholding secularism when issuing guidelines in such matters. It held that objections raised by a handful of individuals from other faiths cannot serve as valid grounds to restrict rights guaranteed under Articles 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) and 26 (the right to form and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes) of the Constitution.

NASHIK/KOLHAPUR: AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said PM Modi speaks of late Balasaheb Thackeray during his rallies, but he ""backstabbed his son (Uddhav)."" She also challenged Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to conduct the caste census and remove the 50% cap on reservation.Priyanka was addressing campaign rallies in Shirdi and Kolhapur for the assembly election in Maharashtra on Saturday when she took on the PM and BJP .

Earlier, speaking in Shirdi, Priyanka said that their (Congress) political ideology was different from the late Balasaheb's in the past. ""But Balasaheb, Rahul, or any Congress politician would not tolerate the way BJP and Modi have insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,"" she said while referring to the statue collapse in Sindhudurg, removal of the Maratha king's statue from Parliament and non-completion of the warrior king's statue for which Modi had laid the foundation stone seven years ago in the Arabian Sea, off Mumbai.Priyanka referred to the recent speech of PM Modi at Shivaji Park in Mumbai in which he attacked her brother Rahul Gandhi. She dared Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to conduct a caste census and remove the 50% cap on reservations. ""Both of them are spreading lies that Rahul is against reservation. In Mumbai's speech, he (Modi) said Rahul Gandhi was against reservation. Rahul Gandhi walked for 4,000 km, led Nyay Yatra from Manipur to Mumbai. Everywhere, he was raising the issue of the caste-based census and doing away with 50% cap on reservations. They lie because they are scared...,"" she added.She then attacked BJP by saying that it has made a ""mockery of the Indian Constitution by stealing the elected govt"" of Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra.""The country's Constitution empowers the electorate to elect a govt of their choice by exercising their franchise. In Maharashtra, in 2019, the voters elected MVA to form govt. But BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and his party colleagues used money and the central agencies to steal the publicly-elected govt. It is nowhere written that a govt can be formed by such unfair means,"" Priyanka said.She asked aloud how BJP could use such a huge amount of money to topple MVA government. ""Did BJP use the money meant for development projects in Maharashtra to get rid of MVA government?"" she questioned.Accusing Modi of taking away industrial investments from Maharashtra, Priyanka said former PMs Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi were not partisan when it came to the implementation of big projects during their tenures. She questioned why Mahayuti had not implemented the Ladki Bahin Yojana soon after it was formed two and a half years ago. She said Modi had no respect for Maharashtra since in the midst of an important election, the PM left the country. Priyanka also said PM Modi's recent speeches had disappointed her because she could not see any truth in them. ""It feels as if they are saying one thing and doing another,"" she said.",Priyanka was addressing campaign rallies in Shirdi and Kolhapur for the assembly election in Maharashtra on Saturday.

AGRA: A bride walked out of her wedding after the groom refused to perform the main rituals unless his demand for Rs 30 lakh dowry was met at the venue. Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride’s father, a sub-inspector posted in Ghaziabad.The dowry demand was allegedly made shortly after the groom’s party arrived and the garland exchange (varmala) ritual was performed. When the bride’s family expressed their inability to give such a huge amount, an argument ensued between the two parties.Realising that her knight in shining armour wasn’t what he had initially shown her to be, the bride refused to marry him, terming his actions unacceptable. Khandauli SHO Rakesh Singh Chauhan said a case under BNS section 352 (intention insult) and sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was registered against Ravi Kumar.“The groom was arrested, but released on bail later after being served a notice,” said SHO Chauhan.A member from bride’s side said, “Her father had already spent lakhs of rupees on the wedding. Also, household goods and other appliances worth several lakhs of rupees were given. Still, the groom demanded Rs 30 lakh in cash on the wedding night.”","Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride's father.

& AI: Vaishnaw

NEW DELHI: Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Saturday highlighted the critical issue of fair compensation for traditional media, underlining how it is financially disadvantaged as news consumption is ""rapidly shifting"" from the conventional modes to the digital space.During his address on National Press Day, hosted by Press Council of India, the minister argued that substantial investment in traditional journalism - including training, editorial processes, and verification - has been undermined by digital platforms' unequal bargaining power.While the investment that goes behind creating a team of journalists, training them, having editorial processes and methods to check the veracity of news, and taking responsibility for the content is huge both in terms of time and money, they are becoming irrelevant since these platforms are having a very unequal edge in terms of bargaining power vis-a-vis conventional media,"" Ashwini Vaishnaw said while adding that efforts made by the conventional media in creating content must be suitably compensated.The minister called for a balanced approach to ensure that traditional media remains viable while holding digital platforms accountable for the content they disseminate. ""It's time for a collective effort to redefine these provisions and safeguard the future of journalism,"" he said.He identified three other pressing challenges facing media and society today: fake news and misinformation, algorithmic bias, and the impact of artificial intelligence on intellectual property.Vaishnaw emphasised the need to revisit the ""safe harbour"" provision which shields intermediaries and internet service providers from liability for third-party content hosted on their platforms and has allowed tech companies to act selectively, often prioritising their interests over public accountability. ""So, the question is, who will take the responsibility for the content published on these platforms,"" he asked.Further, Vaishnaw stressed upon the ethical imperative of protecting creators' rights amid AI advancements. ""AI models today can generate creative content based on vast datasets they are trained on. But what happens to the rights and recognition of the original creators who contributed to that data? Are they being compensated or acknowledged for their work?"" he asked. ""This is not just an economic issue, it is an ethical one too.""","Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw highlighted the critical issue of fair compensation for traditional media.

CBSE also coming up with reward system for teachers

NEW DELHI: With learning gaps increasingly being linked to ineffective teaching practices in schools, CBSE plans to launch an 'assessment centre' by June next year to address the challenge, focusing on aligning teaching with student outcomes, elevating education quality, and improving student evaluation.Findings of studies, such as the education ministry's National Achievement Survey, Annual Status of Education Report, and CBSE's Structured Assessment for Analysing Learning, unanimously agree on one point: that the fault of dissatisfactory teaching in schools lies with teachers. The studies have been repeatedly revealing ""significant"" learning gaps and achievements between board scores and actual skills as well as indicating that students are increasingly relying on external assistance like private tuitions or coaching for academic preparation.The way you assess will shape the way you teach, CBSE chairperson Rahul Singh said about the initiative that will directly impact 15 lakh CBSE teachers and is likely to assist teachers from state board schools as well.On the issues pointed out by different studies, he said the proposed centre is a response to these concerns. It aims at supporting teachers in designing effective assessments that not only evaluate academic performance, but also identify individual student competencies. ""The assessment centre will develop state-of-the-art tools capable of creating question papers, administering assessments, scanning responses, and tracking individual student progress. Teachers will have personalised pages on the platform to design assessment items of varying difficulty, tailored to evaluate multiple competencies.""To foster innovation and motivation among educators, CBSE will introduce a reward system for teachers who develop high-quality assessment items. This initiative also seeks to address the challenges faced by teachers in Tier-3 cities, where salaries are often limited between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000.One of the core goals is to instil a sense of healthy competition within classrooms. Teachers will receive training to ensure that their assessment methods drive better teaching practices. The tools for preparing question papers, as well as the assessment tools will also be opened to teachers of other educational boards for free use.","CBSE also coming up with reward system for teachers who develop high-quality assessment items.

People want Mahayuti to rule for another 5 years: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-want-mahayuti-to-rule-for-another-5-years-pm-modi/articleshow/115370043.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , on Saturday, asserted that the people of Maharashtra are highly impressed with the performance of the ""Mahayuti"" government over the last two-and-a-half years and they are desirous for its continuation. This sentiment, he noted, resonated throughout the state.During a virtual interaction with BJP workers in Maharashtra as part of the 'Mera Booth Sabse Mazboot' program, Modi compared the Mahayuti government 's achievements with that of the previous Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) administration, stating, ""Everywhere I've been, I've witnessed the affection and support for Mahayuti. The people of Maharashtra desire this government to continue for another five years.""He highlighted that the state government has been making efforts to empower every section of society, a stark contrast to the Aghadi government's approach, which he said, people have clearly felt.To ensure success in the upcoming November 20 assembly elections, Modi encouraged BJP booth workers to strengthen grassroots support by organising strategic meetings with women, youth, and farmers, and by sharing videos that highlight the BJP-led government's achievements.Modi urged them to counter what he described as ""misinformation"" spread by the opposition MVA alliance.""You people are direct representatives of Modi. People feel reassured by sharing their hopes and aspirations with you,"" he emphasised, underlining the crucial role of BJP members in connecting the public with the government.Modi also critiqued the Congress, alleging it historically thrived on dividing voters. ""Until the SCs, STs, and OBCs were kept in the dark, Congress used to form a government with a full majority at the Centre,"" he said and added, ""However, since these communities have become more aware and united, the Congress's position has weakened. Now, they aim to fragment these communities further to diminish their collective power to challenge Congress.""The interaction was interactive, with Modi addressing queries from party workers. A worker from Pune inquired about strategies to engage urban voters more effectively. Modi suggested leveraging social media and local influencers, highlighting digital outreach as the new frontier in political engagement.Another query from Kolhapur concerned rural connectivity, to which Modi responded by detailing ongoing initiatives to enhance digital infrastructure in remote regions, ensuring every booth and worker could communicate efficiently.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the people of Maharashtra are highly impressed with the performance of the ""Mahayuti"" government.

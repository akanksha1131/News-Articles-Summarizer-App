NEW DELHI: The United Nations General Assembly has unanimously adopted a resolution declaring December 21 as World Meditation Day . Spearheaded by a core group of countries, including India, Liechtenstein, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mexico and Andorra.“A day for comprehensive well-being and inner transformation! Glad that India, along with other nations of the core group, guided the unanimous adoption of the resolution on the declaration of December 21 as World Meditation Day,” India’s permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said in a post on X.Harish pointed out the significance of the date, coinciding with the Winter Solstice , which marks the beginning of 'Uttarayana' in Indian tradition. “December 21 is an auspicious time of the year, especially for inner reflection and meditation,” he said, adding that the date also falls exactly six months after the International Day of Yoga , celebrated on June 21.India’s permanent mission to the UN emphasised the universal benefits of meditation, describing it as “an effective tool to achieve inner transformation and peace in the modern day.” The mission stated, “Modern science attests to the numerous benefits of meditation, including significant stress reduction and enhanced cognitive and physical functions.”Ambassador Harish also drew attention to India’s role in promoting global wellness, recalling the success of the International Day of Yoga, which was declared in 2014. “In a decade, it has become a global movement, leading to common people across the globe practicing yoga and making it part of their daily lives,” he noted.The resolution was introduced by Liechtenstein and co-sponsored by India, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Burundi, the Dominican Republic, Iceland, Luxembourg, Mauritius, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Portugal and Slovenia.It is aimed to promote meditation as a practice for fostering harmony between mind and body, human and nature, and achieving comprehensive human well being, especially in a time of global conflicts and rising tensions.India's role in the initiative aligns with its civilizational dictum of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam , or ""the world is one family."" “This declaration reflects our commitment to human wellness and global peace,” Harish said.","The United Nations General Assembly has unanimously adopted a resolution declaring December 21 as World Meditation Day.

India to raise delay in S-400 missile systems & spares during Rajnath's visit to Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-raise-delay-in-s-400-missile-systems-spares-during-rajnaths-visit-to-russia/articleshow/116062183.cms,"INS Tushil

NEW DELHI: India is expected to raise the major delay in delivery of the two remaining squadrons of S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems as well as supply of spares for several crucial weapon platforms during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s three-day visit to Russia next week, which will also see him commission the first of the two guided-missile stealth frigates being built there.Measures to strengthen the already expansive defence collaboration will be discussed during the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meeting, which will be co-chaired by Singh and his counterpart Andrey Belousov in Moscow on December 10.The two sides will review ongoing military-technical projects as well as collaboration in areas of strategic interest in the run-up to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India in early-2025 after a gap of three years.With the IRIGC-M&MTC also not having met after 2021, India wants to press Russia to ensure proper maintenance support and timely supply of spares for weapon systems ranging from S-400 missile systems to Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets and T-90S main-battle tanks.“Supply of spares has become a major problem for the Indian armed forces with the entire Russian defence industry diverted for the ongoing war with Ukraine,” a source told TOI.India has its own strategic imperatives in striking a balance between Russia and the US, despite a pronounced tilt towards Washington in recent years. The tightening Moscow-Beijing clinch, for one, remains a major concern for New Delhi.Though India has cranked up indigenous defence production, while increasingly turning to western countries for military hardware and software over the last decade, Russia still remains its main weapons supplier, accounting for over 36% of its arms imports.Singh will travel to Kaliningrad first on December 9 to commission India’s latest 3,900-tonne multi-role frigate as INS Tushil (the protector shield), which is packed with sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles. The second frigate, in turn, will be commissioned as INS Tamal early next year.TOI had last month reported that the delivery of two S-400 squadrons is likely to be delayed till 2026 and the lease of a nuclear-powered attack submarine (called SSN) till 2028 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine.Under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan. The over $3 billion (Rs 21,000 crore) deal to lease the SSN for 10 years, in turn, was inked in 2019.The 125-metre long INS Tushil has undergone extensive trials, during which the warship clocked a speed of over 30 knots. “The frigate will reach India in a near combat-ready condition ready to deliver from the word go,” an officer said.India in October 2018 had inked the umbrella agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates, with the first two to be imported from Russia for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore, with the first being “launched” as Triput in July this year. These four warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted in the Navy from 2003-2004 onwards.",India is expected to raise the major delay in delivery of two remaining squadrons of S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s three-day visit to Russia next week.

Ayodhya verdict did not uphold secularism: Ex- SC judge RF Nariman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayodhya-verdict-did-not-uphold-secularism-ex-sc-judge-rf-nariman/articleshow/116061807.cms,"EX-SC judge RF Nariman (File photo from SC website)

NEW DELHI: Former Supreme Court judge and noted jurist Justice R F Nariman has expressed disappointment over the top court’s verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case and said it did not do justice to the principle of secularism. He also said the Places of Worship Act , which was upheld in the 2019 Ayodhya verdict , should be strictly enforced to scotch disputes over religious places which are “popping up every day” across the country and causing communal tension.Delivering the inaugural lecture of Ahmadi Foundation established in the memory of former CJI A M Ahmadi, Justice Nariman pointed out how a special CBI judge, Surendra Yadav, who acquitted all accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, got a post-retirement job as depu ty Lokayukta in Uttar Pradesh. “This is the state of affairs in this country,” he said while speaking on ‘Secularism and Indian Constitution ’.“In my humble opinion, a great travesty of justice was that secularism was not given its due by these judgments,” he said while referring to various orders passed by the apex court relating to the decades-old dispute on which final verdict was passed on Nov 9, 2019, by a five-judge bench. He disagreed with the reasoning given by the court to grant the disputed land for Ram Mandir despite holding that demolition of the mosque was illegal.Referring to the 2019 verdict, Justice Nariman said there was a silver lining in it as it upheld the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which was dealt with in five pages of the order. Expressing anguish over the multiple suits being filed across the country raising disputes over religious structures, he said the 1991 law should be enforced and it should be read in every trial court where suits are filed to claim religious places of other communities.“Today, we find hydra heads popping up all over the country. Suit after suit is being filed all over the place concerning not only mosques but also against dargahs. All this, according to me, could lead to communal tension and disharmony, and is contrary to what is envisaged in the Constitution and the Places of Worship Act. The only way to scorch and cauterise all these hydra heads is by applying these five pages in this very judgment and having it read out in every district court and high court. Because these five pages are a declaration by the Supreme Court which binds each of them,” he said.",Ex-SC judge RF Nariman expressed disappointment over the top court’s verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case. He said it did not do justice to the principle of secularism.

PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-why-you-should-apply-for-new-pan-card-with-qr-code-top-5-benefits-explained/articleshow/115888220.cms,"Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards those without QR codes should apply for PAN 2.0. (AI image)

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Also Read | PAN 2.0 for free! How to get PAN Card with QR code with address update online; step-by-step guide Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""","Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

Delhi Family Murder: Throats slit on wedding anniversary: How aspiring south Delhi boxer executed chilling plot to wipe out family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/throats-slit-on-wedding-anniversary-how-aspiring-south-delhi-boxer-executed-chilling-plot-to-wipe-out-family/articleshow/115988892.cms,"Motives rooted in property and resentment



A well-planned deception



The crime scene and method: Throats slit, stab wounds



A boxer with grudge



Digital footprints under scrutiny



NEW DELHI: In a chilling case that has shocked the capital, a 20-year-old Delhi University student, Arjun Tanwar , has been arrested for the brutal murder of his father, a retired Army officer , his mother and his sister at their home in Neb Sarai .The murders, committed early Wednesday—his parents’ wedding anniversary—were allegedly driven by a deep-seated grudge over property disputes and familial resentment. Police say Arjun carefully planned the crime, even attempting to mislead authorities by feigning innocence.According to investigators, Arjun believed his father, Rajesh Kumar (51), was planning to transfer their family property to his sister, Kavita (23).This, combined with his father’s stern disapproval of Arjun’s boxing ambitions and repeated public humiliation, ignited his fury.“He told us he opted for slitting their throats as he knew it would prevent them from screaming. He was so enraged with his father that he stabbed him in the head,” said the police.Arjun followed his regular routine, heading out for an early morning run at 5.30 am to stage a facade of normalcy.Upon returning, he ran to his gym and informed the owner that his parents had been murdered. He then alerted neighbours and relatives in a bid to avert suspicion.However, a police investigation uncovered inconsistencies in his account. ""When we questioned Arjun, he started giving different answers and there were multiple contradictions,"" said Sanjay Kumar Jain, joint commissioner of police (South).Rajesh’s lifeless body was discovered upstairs, while his wife Komal (46) and daughter Kavita were found in separate rooms on the ground floor.The victims bore horrifying injuries—throats slit, stab wounds aplenty. In a grim detail, clothing had been placed around their necks, likely in an attempt to stem the flow of blood.Arjun reportedly began his killing spree with his sister, who tried to fight back, as evidenced by the injuries on her body.He then moved to his father, attacking him in his sleep. Lastly, his mother, who had gone to the bathroom, was ambushed as she returned.Arjun used his father’s Army knife to carry out the murders, a weapon chosen for its lethal precision.Arjun, a political science student and a trained boxer who had won a silver medal representing Delhi, harboured a profound grudge against his family.He resented his father for supporting his sister, who was pursuing a master’s degree and for frequently reprimanding him about his studies and routine.“Arjun felt neglected and isolated,” police revealed. “He also suspected his father planned to hand over their property to his sister.”Rajesh’s treatment of Arjun, including physical reprimands in public, further fuelled his rage. Sources disclosed that tensions escalated during his sister’s birthday on December 1, when Rajesh allegedly assaulted him again.Police are now examining Arjun’s digital devices to determine if he sought inspiration online to execute the heinous crime.The case, cracked by a team under ACP Abhinendra Jain, exposes the chilling depths of resentment and anger that culminated in a tragedy tearing apart an unsuspecting family.","Arjun Tanwar, 20, has been arrested for the brutal murder of his father, a retired Army officer, his mother and his sister at their home in Neb Sarai.

NEW DELHI: Though Mahayuti 2.0 began to unravel soon after Thursday's opulent oath-taking ceremony in Mumbai's Azad Maidan, some knots in the alliance still seem to remain intact as Shiv Sena leader Bharat Gogavale on Friday said Eknath Shinde has pitched for home ministry , which the BJP might not be willing to accommodate conveniently.""When Devendra Fadnavis was the deputy chief minister (in Shinde-led government), he also held the home department. Saheb (Shinde) has demanded the home and talks (on portfolio allocation ) are in progress,"" Gogavale told news agency PTI.Gogavale, one of few from Shinde's close circles, also said that cabinet expansion is likely to take place between December 11 and 16, just ahead of the winter session of the state legislature.The winter session of the legislature will start in Nagpur, the state's second capital, on December 16.When asked to whom Shinde has made the pitch for crucial home ministry, Gogavale said it was probably Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah .The MLA from Mahad in the Raigad district maintained that ""attempts are being made to change the portfolios held by the Shiv Sena in the previous Mahayuti government"".Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the chief minister of Maharashtra for the third time with a paradigm-shattering mandate as the BJP has won 132 out of the 148 seats it fought in the recently concluded state poll.After the oath-taking event, Shinde, who switched roles with Fadnavis, said that earlier when he was CM he considered himself a common man but now that he was deputy CM, he would consider himself a ""dedicated to common man"".The BJP emerged as the largest party with 132 seats in the 288-member House.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday asked Pakistan to take strong action against wanted terrorist Masood Azhar , who is also the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief infamous for plotting and promoting terrorist activities on behalf of Pakistan's intelligence wing Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Masood Azhar, a long-time terrorist proxy of the Pakistan military and orchestrator of the 2019 Pulwama attack , was designated a "" global terrorist "" by the United Nations in the same year.New Delhi has consistently maintained Azhar's presence in Pakistan, which Islamabad has always disputed, however, the JeM chief's recent speech in a public gathering reportedly at Bahawalpur in Pakistan's Punjab province has again laid bare ISI's backing to Azhar.Responding to reports on Azhar's speech, ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Friday said, ""If the report is correct, then it has exposed Pakistan's 'duplicity' in containing terrorist activities.""""We demand that strong action be taken against him (Azhar) and he should be brought to justice. There has been denial that he is not there in Pakistan,"" Jaiswal said.Azhar, who Pakistan claims is in hiding in Afghanistan, is also among India’s most wanted and has – in the recent past – hit India hard.In December 2001, members of his terrorist group, Jaish-e-Mohammed (literally, army of the Prophet) – JeM – attacked the Indian Parliament. After the audacious attack, the then-Atal Bihari Vajpayee government amassed an army at the border in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation that lasted several months.In February 2019, the Narendra Modi government redrew its security response and conducted air strikes into Pakistani territory in Balakot. The response was an answer to Jaish’s suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama that killed 40 soldiers.Azhar was born to a poultry farmer in Bahawalpur. He studied at the Jamia Islamia at the Binori mosque in Karachi. There, he met students who were under the influence of leaders of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), a terrorist organisation active in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Deeply influenced by the HuM, Azhar was 21, when he crossed over into Afghanistan to train as a terrorist.","Masood Azhar is a long-time terrorist proxy of the Pakistan military and orchestrator of the 2019 Pulwama attack.

NEW DELHI: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri will be visiting Bangladesh on December 9 to hold meeting with his counterpart, said ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Misri will hold several other meetings during his visit, which comes amid tension between the two countries over ongoing violence against Hindu and minority communities.The unabated atrocities against minorities in Bangladesh began after Sheikh Hasina was ousted as the PM and forced to flee nation on August 5.Following Hasina's departure to India to seek shelter, Muhammad Yunus-led interim government has been handling the affairs of Dhaka.""Foreign Secretary is scheduled to visit Bangladesh on the 9th of December and he will meet his counterpart and there will be several other meetings during the visit. Foreign Office consultations led by the Foreign Secretary is a structured engagement between India and Bangladesh. We look forward to this meeting,"" Jaiswal said in a press briefing on Friday.Earlier, Bangladesh ""urgently"" recalled the mission heads of Agartala and Kolkata high commissions to Dhaka, a move indicating of the deepening tension between the Yunus government and New Delhi.The acting deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh in Kolkata, Shikdar Md Ashrafur Rahman, and the assistant high commissioner in Tripura, Arifur Rahman, were instructed to return to Dhaka on an urgent basis last Tuesday, reported Prothom Alo citing sources.The political instability in Bangladesh has coincided with a series of mob attacks, intensifying concerns for the safety of the Hindu minority community.The tension rose further after the arrest of prominent Iskcon priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, a vocal advocate for minority rights. Das was detained at Dhaka airport in October on charges of allegedly disrespecting the Bangladeshi flag during a rally. The specifics of the allegations remain vague, and Das has been denied bail.In response to the atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh, demonstrators allegedly broke into the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala.The high commission breach took place after an Agartala-Kolkata bus travelling via Dhaka on Saturday reportedly faced an attack in the Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh.","Vikram Misri will visit Bangladesh on December 9 to hold meeting with his counterpart.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs issued a travel advisory cautioning Indian citizens against travelling to Syria and recommending immediate departure for those currently present in the country.""In view of the situation prevailing in Syria, Indian nationals are advised to avoid all travel to Syria, until further notification,"" it said in its advisory.""Those who can, are advised to leave by the earliest available commercial flights and others are requested to observe utmost precaution about their safety and restrict their movements to the minimum,"" the MEA further added.Urging those currently in Syria to stay in contact with the Embassy, the MEA also issued helpline numbers for assistance. ""Indians currently in Syria are requested to remain in touch with the Indian Embassy in Damascus at their emergency helpline number +963 993385973,"" it said.This comes as MEA confirmed earlier that approximately 90 Indian nationals reside in Syria, including 14 working with UN organizations. The ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal assured that the Indian mission is maintaining communication with citizens to ensure their safety.""We are closely following the situation. Our mission remains in close contact with our nationals for their safety and security,"" Jaiswal said.Recent attacks by Syrian rebel groups have resurged the previously quiet civil war. The rebels' successful seizure of Hama and their push towards Homs poses a significant risk of dividing territories under President Bashar al-Assad's control. United Nations reports indicate that the conflict, which began in 2011, has resulted in more than 300,000 civilian casualties and forced millions to flee their homes across the surrounding areas.","The ministry of external affairs issued a travel advisory cautioning Indian citizens against travelling to Syria.

HYDERABAD: Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching 'Pushpa: The Rise' three years ago, so much so that neighbours nicknamed him 'Pushpa'.As Sritej battled for life in a Hyderabad hospital on Thursday and his mother's body lay in a mortuary, an inconsolable Bhaskar wondered if 32-year-old Revathi lost her life by putting family above self, as always.She died in the stampede at a city theatre the previous night during the premiere of the sequel to the 2021 'Pushpa' film.""She gave me life, and now she's gone,"" the 40-year-old said. Revathi donated part of her liver in 2023 when he needed a transplant. Her last moments, too, were about making the children happy, he recalled.Sritej and his younger sister Sanvi had been pestering their parents to take them for a show of 'Pushpa 2: The Rule'. Wednesday was supposed to be a special movie night for them, with Arjun being in attendance at the premiere in Sandhya Theatre. Revathi was with Sritej when the stampede broke out, trapping both in a melee of frantic feet. Bhaskar had moved away with Sanvi earlier because the girl started crying amid jostling by fans desperate for a glimpse of the film star.""I decided to drop Sanvi at my in-laws' home in the lane next to the theatre. By the time I returned, my wife and son weren't where I left them. When I called, Revathi said they were inside the theatre... That was the last I heard her voice,"" Bhasker said, breaking down.The bereaved husband believes Revathi was fatally injured in trying to protect their son as the unruly crowd scrambled to escape a police baton charge.Even as he waited outside Gandhi Hospital mortuary, Bhaskar worried about his son who is in a hospital room a few kilometres away, having suffered ""severe hypoxia and potential lung injury"". ""I remember someone showing me a video where Sritej was being carried in a stranger's arms, then being taken in a patrol car that stopped at Chikkadpally police station. He was motionless as they drove him to KIMS Hospital,"" said the anxious father.""I didn't get any updates about Revathi until 2.30am Thursday. That's when some cops broke the news to me, and my world crashed.""Bhaskar has since being trying to convince himself to ""stay strong"" for Sanvi. The little girl, a family member said, was still in a state of disbelief about losing the person she was closest to - her mother.","Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching 'Pushpa: The Rise' three years ago. Revathi donated part of her liver in 2023 when he needed a transplant. Her last moments, too, were about making the children happy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116025145,imgsize-929750,width-400,resizemode-4/116025145.jpg"

MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis ’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stating he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs reached Raj Bhavan only at 2.30 pm Thursday, barely three hours before the actual swearing-in, as there was uncertainty until afternoon about whether Eknath Shinde would agree to be sworn in as deputy CM.Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Shinde till Thursday morning; Shinde has been insisting on portfolios of his choice. However, in the morning, Shiv Sena ’s Uday Samant, Bharat Gogawale, Ravi Phatak and Sanjay Shirsat persuaded him to join the government as deputy CM, stating that the row over allotment of portfolios could be resolved at a later stage. Following their marathon meeting, Shinde agreed to take oath as deputy CM and a letter signed by Shinde was given to Fadnavis.It was then that Fadnavis sent his letter to the governor. Fadnavis could have sent his own name and that of Ajit Pawar on his own to the governor, but he waited for Shinde’s confirmation, sources said.Atop bureaucrat told TOI that the oath-taking event was confirmed only after written communication was received from CM-designate Fadnavis stating he along with Shinde and Ajit would take oath.Elaborating on what had happened earlier, the bureaucrat said that after the meeting of BJP legislature party Wednesday, a delegation comprising Shinde, Ajit and Fadnavis had called on the governor to stake claim for forma tion of the government. The delegation submitted a list of 237 MLAs supporting the Mahayuti. In addition, separate letters were given by BJP legislature party, Shiv Sena legislature party and NCP legislature party pledging support to Mahayuti government. Shinde and Ajit had earlier been elected as legislature party leaders of Sena and NCP, respectively.But in view of reservations expressed by Shinde over portfolios, no letter was given to Raj Bhavan stating Fadnavis would be leader of Mahayuti legislature party. During the interaction with media in the presence of Fadnavis and Ajit, Shinde was non-committal on whether he would join Mahayuti government as deputy CM. “There is no hurry, media will know by evening,” Shinde had said when asked if he would take oath as deputy CM.Sources said Shinde was hopeful he would get the portfolios of his choice and he was reluctant to join the government as deputy CM in the absence of any assurances in this regard.“All formalities were completed after Raj Bhavan received Fadnavis’s letter around 2.30pm, and the oathtaking took place as scheduled. Certainly it was a piquant situation, but there was no embarrassment, and the event passed off peacefully,” the bureaucrat added.Later at a presser, Fadnavis said about Shinde, “I am telling you 100% he wasn’t upset. Once I appealed to him, he accepted. When I was asked to be deputy CM after being CM, I was also reluctant. But I understood that without taking the post in an alliance government, there is a lack of coordination between the party & the government.”",Devendra Fadnavis’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stated he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs. Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Eknath Shinde till Thursday morning.

Special investigation team steps in

Broader context of women’s safety in Bengal

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday praised a POCSO court in Baruipur for awarding the death penalty to Mostakin Sardar , convicted of the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl in Joynagar , South 24 Parganas . The verdict came just 62 days after the crime, a pace Banerjee described as “unprecedented” in the state’s history.Taking to X, Banerjee lauded the state police and prosecution team, stating, “Conviction and capital punishment in such a case in just over two months is remarkable. The government has zero tolerance towards offences against women and will ensure justice is neither delayed nor denied.”The Class IV student went missing on October 4 while returning from tuition classes. Her body was discovered the next day near a police outpost in Kultali, sparking public outrage. The sole accused, Mostakin Sardar, was arrested shortly after.The case gained national attention, with protests erupting over alleged police inaction. The child’s parents had to petition the Calcutta High Court for a magisterial autopsy, which was conducted at Kalyani JNM Hospital by AIIMS doctors.Responding to public anger, the state government formed a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to expedite the probe. Banerjee also set a three-month deadline for the police to resolve the case, emphasizing that ""a criminal has no identity"" and urging immediate action.The incident occurred less than two months after the rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, a case currently under investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Opposition parties criticized the Trinamool Congress government, alleging a failure to curb crimes against women.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee praised a POCSO court in Baruipur for awarding the death penalty to Mostakin Sardar.

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha on Friday witnessed an interesting role switch with opposition members pressing for normal functioning of the House as BJP MPs vociferously demanded an investigation into the recovery of a wad of Rs 500 notes from the seat of senior Congress MP and leading lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi .As opposition MPs argued that protests were unnecessary as an investigation had already been ordered, BJP members, even ministers, pointed out that Congress itself never practised what it was preaching now.Soon after leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said taking the MP’s name was not right before the probe was completed, Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “When a matter is under investigation we should not be making a debate of it. I would greatly appreciate it if this is followed. I find this breach virtually every day, everything under investigation is subject to more investigation in our debates.”Amid the uproar, leader of the House JP Nadda accused the opposition of raising some issues with high intensity and ignoring others. As some opposition MPs urged the chairman to take up zero hour, Nadda said, “Today, you have so much concern for zero hour. Good sense should always prevail over the opposition."" He added, “Whether LoP's plea for restraint reflects an intent to pre-empt the investigation is something that must be kept in mind. The investigation should continue.”Responding to minister Piyush Goyal’s observation that a rule should be made that the opposition will allow the House to function smoothly and will not raise any matter that’s under investigation, Kharge said, “I only referred to the investigation ordered by the chairman.

Rijiju backs Dhankar naming Singhvi

NEW DELHI: A new issue riveted Rajya Sabha on Friday as Chairman of the House, Jagdeep Dhankar , said ""a ward of currency notes"" was found at the seat alloted to Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi , a claim which Singhvi said left him ""quite astonished"" Dhankar said that during the ""routine anti-sabotage check"" of the chamber after the adjournment of the House on Thursday, a wad of currency notes was recovered by the security officials from seat number 222 which is presently allotted Singhvi.The latest charge against Shinghvi opened a new front of verbal tirade between the ruling BJP and the Congress as both the parties resorted to claims and counter claims.While the Congress called the incident a ""diversion tactis"" by the BJP to dissuade from the discussion on issue of industrialist Gautam Adani 's US indictment, the BJP sough detailed probe into the matter lebelling the issue ""abnormal"" and ""of a serious nature"".Shinghvi's party colleague and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh came out in his defence, alleging that the BJP is not letting the Rajya Sabha run as part its strategy to settle scores with the opposition, which has been tough with the government in Lok Sabha on Adani indictment issue.""This is BJP's strategy, a diversionary tactic. The issues we are raising, farmer issues, the Chairman himself has raised it and these are many big issues. We want a discussion on the bribery allegations in the Modani scam .

We are giving constructive cooperation... The government does not want any discussion in Rajya Sabha.""BJP chief and Rajya Sabha MP JP Nadda said the incident hurts ""the dignity of the House"" and sough detailed investigation into the matter.""This incident is abnormal and is of a serious nature. It doesn't mean to get divided in the ruling or opposition party. This incident hurts the dignity of the House... Sir, I have faith in your ruling that a detailed investigation will be conducted and everything will be cleared,"" Nadda was quoted by ANI.Taking a dig at the Congress party BJP's Rajya Sabha MP, Sudhanshu Trivedi said: ""Congress leaders have so much money that they don't even bother to take account of the money which is left (on the bench in Parliament).""He further alleged, ""Since no leader came to collect the money, it raises doubts on many sources of the money that people know whose money it is but they don't come to collect it. This incident should be investigated.Accusing Congress of ducking accountability, Trivedi said: ""Congress, which used to question everything, is today refusing to give an account of the case recovered from Parliament.""Dhankar, as Rajya Sabha Chairman, disclosing Singhvi's name left Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge livid as he objected the Chair naming his Rajya Sabha colleague when the probe in under way.""I am not going beyond that, I know that you will not allow us.

'Diversionary tactic': Congress responds



NEW DELHI: Chaos erupted in Rajya Sabha on Friday after chairman Jagdeep Dhankar announced that ""wad of currency notes"" were found from a seat allotted to Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi during checks in Rajya Sabha.""I here by inform the members that during the routine anti-sabotage check of the chamber after the adjournment of the House yesterday. Apparently, a wad of currency notes was recovered by the security officials from seat number 222 which is presently allotted to Abhishek Manu Singhvi, elected from the state of Telangana..The matter was brought to my notice, and I made sure an investigation takes place and the same is underway,"" Dhankar said.Congress leader Singhvi responded to the charge, stating he carries only one Rs 500 note to Rajya Sabha and was hearing about this incident for the first time.""Heard of it first time now. Never heard of it till now! I carry one 500 rs note when I go to RS. First time heard of it. I reached inside house at 1257 pm yday and house rose at 1 pm; then I sat in canteen till 130 pm with Sh Ayodhya Rami Reddy then I left parliament!"" Singhvi said in a post on X.Meanwhile, Kharge urged the chair to not name the MP in Parliament until the investigation is completed.""I request that until the investigation is done and the authenticity of the incident is established, a member should not be named,"" Kharge said.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju objected to Kharge's request and demanded a ""serious investigation"" into the matter.""As per the routine protocol, the anti-sabotage team checked the seats just to wind up the proceedings and the house. During that procedure, the note was found and the seat numbers were deciphered and the members also signed that day. I don't understand why there should be an objection that the Chair should not take the name of the member. The Chairman has rightly pointed out the seat number and the member who occupies that particular seat number. What is wrong with that? Why there should be an objection?"" Rijiju asked.""Don't you think that while we are going towards digital India, carrying a bundle of notes in the House is appropriate? We don't carry note bundles in the house. I fully agree with the observation of the Chairman that there must be a serious investigation and the concerns raised by the members are also very genuine,"" he added.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Friday called the recovery of currency notes on a seat allotted to senior leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi in the Rajya Sabha a ""diversionary tactic"" by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to derail critical parliamentary discussions.""This is a diversionary tactic to distract from the issues we are raising. We have raised the farmers' issue, and the Chairman (of Rajya Sabha) himself has raised that issue. There are many other issues too, like the 'Modani' (Modi-Adani) scandal which we want to have a debate on.

KOZHIKODE/THRISSUR: Home minister Amit Shah criticised Kerala government for an alleged delay in submitting the assessment memo on the Wayanad landslide , in a note sent in response to the representation made by MPs from the state, led by Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra , on Wednesday.They had requested Centre to expedite release of funds for rehabilitation of Mundakkai Chooralmala landslide victims. “State govt inordinately delayed in complying with assurances of PM and didn’t send any assessment memo even after 3.5 months of the incident,” Shah said in the note.He said the memo was submitted only recently, with an estimate of Rs 2,219 crore for recovery and reconstruction works. Centre immediately constituted an inter-ministerial central team to probe it, and appropriate assistance will be provided, Shah added.Posting Shah’s reply on her social media handles, Priyanka said disasters should not be about politics, and efforts to support victims of disasters should prioritise humanity and compassion. “The people of Wayanad are looking towards the state and central govts with hope; they don’t need excuses, they need urgent help to be able to rebuild their lives,” she said.","Home minister Amit Shah criticised Kerala government for an alleged delay in submitting the assessment memo on the Wayanad landslide.

CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: Three men fatally stabbed a 28-year-old software engineer as he tried to prevent them from beating up a waiter at an eatery at Jhalta Phata in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar rural over payment for a bottle of soft drink around 3.30am on Friday.Police said the trio attacked Santosh Raju Petti, who was accompanied by his driver, suspecting that he was the eatery owner.An officer said Chikalthana police detained two of the attackers from Nashik district based on CCTV footage from the eatery located on the highway to Jalna. ""The third suspect is a resident of the city's Begampura area and is on the run,"" the officer said.The officer said Petti's brother, sister, and parents were returning to the city from Hyderabad - where they had gone to attend a marriage ceremony - after being informed about the incident.Preliminary investigations revealed that Petti's family was originally from Hyderabad. His father had opened a dairy outlet in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar city. Since then, the Pettis were living in this city, police said.Additional superintendent of police Sunil Lanjewar said trouble started when the three men reached the eatery and forced the staffers to open the outlet and serve food. At the time of leaving the eatery, the prime suspect took a soft drink and got infuriated when the waiter asked him to pay the bill.""He went to his car, brought a sharp-edged weapon, and started threatening the eatery staffers.

NEW DELHI: Agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday assured that all (marketable surplus) produce of farmers will be purchased at minimum support price (MSP) - an indication that the procurement of all farm produce, whose MSPs are announced, would happen with further increasing its footprints beyond popular crops, including paddy and wheat.His remarks came on a day Congress MP and leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on social media said the govt should immediately implement all the demands of farmers, including a legal guarantee of MSP . His party later demanded that the PM invite farmers for talks.Reaffirming his govt commitment, Chouhan underlined that the govt will not only continue to fix MSP at more than 50% of the production cost, but also procure produce from farmers.Chouhan's assurance came in Rajya Sabha while he was responding to supplementaries during the Question Hour on the issue of MSP to farmers.At present, the govt announces MSPs of 22 crops and fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugarcane. But procurement mainly happens for a select few, including paddy, wheat, cotton and sugarcane.In case of other crops, including pulses and oilseeds, the procurement is not as robust as the ones for paddy and wheat.Referring to the Congress-led UPA govt, the minister said, ""You did not purchase farmers' produce, we will purchase that and fix a higher MSP... When Congress was in power, they never purchased farmers' produce at MSP and farmers shed tears of blood, but for me 'kisan ki sewa' (service to farmers) is like 'bhagwan ki pooja' (worship to god).""Congress's Jairam Ramesh then recalled that Rajya Sabha chairman and Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, while speaking at a ceremony to mark the centenary of ICAR-CIRCOT in Mumbai, had asked the minister about the promises made to farmers.Dhankhar, however, on Friday praised in the upper house the minister's commitments towards farmers' welfare, noting that the man (Chouhan) revered as the brother of 'ladli' (beloved) sisters will now also be cherished as the 'ladla' (brother) of farmers.Expressing his confidence that the ""energetic"" minister will fulfil his responsibilities in accordance with his name 'Shivraj', Dhankhar said, ""From today, I have given you a new name - Kisano Ke Ladle"".","Agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan assured that all (marketable surplus) produce of farmers will be purchased at minimum support price.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Paradise Lost

An age of recklessness is always countered by one of stringent discipline in history . This duality is echoed in the Sangam literature , where Purananuru — a collection of valorous poems — sheds light on the violent conflicts of kings. These rulers ruthlessly vanquished their enemies and waged wars against fellow Tamil kings. Conversely, the tender verses of Akananuru offer delicate expressions of love, so subtle that one might easily overlook the profundity.Many poets contributed to both genres, illustrating the perennial duality of human nature which transcends cultures. Japanese artists employ Suminagashi, or 'ink floating,' to create ethereal works in colours that appear to shimmer with light. The subtlety and tenderness employed is reflective of Japanese character, but the country’s history reveals that cruelty was also a part of the psyche -- the atrocities committed by the Imperial Army were unspeakable during World War II.In Milton’s, a beautiful exchange occurs between God and Adam. As Adam revels in the beauty of light in his new universe, God urges him to welcome the darkness of night as well. Initially, Adam hides, but as the evening unfolds, night flowers bloom, the stars and the moon emerge, and the tender evening breeze envelops him. Grateful, Adam thanks God for the beauty of the night.Life teaches us to recognise duality. To deny either the positive or the negative is to forsake half of existence. Focusing solely on the positive blinds us to life's complexities; fixating on the negative obscures fleeting moments of beauty.Every time I visit the Murugan temple at Palani, the ‘kavadi’ or balance carried by devotees as they climb the hill fascinates me. Whenever I go through difficult times, I picture myself walking a path with two pots balanced on my shoulders. One is a pot of gratitude, relief and positive emotions. In the other, I carry all the grief, anger and negative emotions. I tell myself that in order to keep walking, I have to carry both for balance.Likewise, we have to acknowledge the competing forces within us. We are fierce yet compassionate, driven yet weary, forgiving yet tempted towards vengeance. This internal conflict is perfectly normal. As leading scientists affirm, even the matter in our universe exists in a state of duality — wave and particle.Valluvar , too, contemplated this duality of existence ultimately declaring that the wise hold the perfect balance. They know that pain and pleasure can only co-exist. Hence, they do not seek pleasure and are not affected by pain.Inbaththul Inbam Vizhayaadhaan ThunbaththulThunbam Urudhal Ilan“He who never exulted in joy , will not beDepressed by sorrow”Understanding and embracing this duality allows us to navigate the complexities of our ever-evolving lives. By recognising that joy and sorrow coexist, we glean invaluable insights into our shared human experience. The duality emerges from the very fabric of life itself—a dance of opposites, interwoven with yin and yang. Without balance, yang devolves into aggression, while yin can lead to complacency. Great masters remind us to embrace both sides — two faces of the same coin. Darkness enhances our appreciation of light.Through the lens of duality, we uncover the richness of existence, wherein light dances with darkness, crafting a harmonious narrative that defines our journey.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/47529300.jpg"

HYDERABAD: Legal and behavioural experts have raised red flags over a purported ""bonding"" session under surveillance between around 15 ""rescued"" children and couples accused of paying child traffickers in Delhi and Pune Rs 5-8 lakh each to facilitate their adoption. Based on the interaction, these couples could be allowed to take home the kids they were separated from six months ago.The children, who are between seven months and four years old, have been in state-run shelters since a crackdown on the racket led police to their adoptive parents' doorsteps in Hyderabad.Medchal-Malkajgiri child welfare committee (CWC) decided to organise the bonding session after Telangana high court gave it the responsibility of deciding the 15 kids' future. ""The children and the couples will be put in a room. If we see an emotional connection, we will send them home together,"" said the committee's chairperson, A M Raja Reddy.The exercise is scheduled for the weekend in a govt office at Alwal, a Hyderabad suburb.""The decision is based on humanitarian grounds. These children have already stayed with the adoptive families, a few for as long as three years. But we need to evaluate the parents' behaviour before taking a call.""According to lawyers, the move is fraught with legal risks given the fact that the police investigation revealed money changing hands between traffickers and the adoptive parents.""We understand the need for these children to grow up in a family environment, but are we setting the right precedent by rewarding those who were on the wrong side of law in the first place? This could be misused in the future,"" said a district magistrate.Akshay Mehra of the Commission for Child Protection and Rights said the legal complexities were hard to ignore.""To a layperson, this (letting the kids reunite with those who illegally adopted them) might seem like the best solution. CWC's role is to ensure what's good for the children, but courts need to step in to address the broader legal implications and set clear guidelines for future cases,"" he said.""Will they treat future cases of child trafficking in a similar manner?""CWC officials said the adoptive parents were being charged only for failing to adhere to adoption procedures, not for trafficking.When TOI reached out to some of the couples, they claimed to have acted in accordance with the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA).""These children were handed to us by their biological parents because they couldn't care for them. We followed all legal formalities under HAMA. My daughter is four years old, and we have raised her as our own. The last six months without her have been unbearable,"" one of the adoptive parents said.They jointly filed a petition in the high court recently, seeking custody of the kids that were separated from them.Behavioural expert Shazia Gilani said determining the bond between parents and children in such cases could be challenging.""Attachment in children is formed through consistent caregiving, comfort, and security. However, this bond can be influenced by various factors, such as the length of separation, changes in their environment, and the emotional state of both the child and caregiver,"" she said.""Children might also show some confusion or distress when reunited with parents they haven't seen in months. These nuances make it difficult to assess the true nature of the bond, based on a brief interaction. Ideally, such evaluations should be done over a longer period in a supportive and controlled environment.""","Couples accused of paying child traffickers in Delhi and Pune Rs 5-8 lakh each to facilitate their adoption.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday sought Union govt's response on a PIL alleging that members of internal complaints committee (ICC) face vindictive action if they rule against the top brass of a private company while deciding a complaint of sexual harassment at workplace.To discharge their duties freely to provide a safe environment for women employees in a private company, ICC members must be accorded protection from harassment and job security to decide sexual harassment complaints without fear & favour, Mumbai-based petitioners Janaki Chaudhry and Olga Tellis said.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan issued notices to women and child development ministry, corporate affairs ministry and National Commission for Women and sought responses in four weeks.Parliament had enacted Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act in 2013, nearly 16 years after SC laid down guidelines and provided for ICCs to inquire into complaints of sexual harassment of women at workplace. Chaudhry informed the bench that as a former corporate executive and head of prevention of sexual harassment committee, she had ""first-hand experience of unreasonable and biased behaviour that may be meted out to a member of ICC"".""During her tenure as an ICC member, she realised the hardships and challenges that were faced by her and her colleagues (in ICC) who shouldered the responsibilities of protecting the rights of those wronged (through sexual harassment) but unfortunately, they ( ICC members) were given no right of protection against arbitrary behaviour (from management),"" the petition said.""Lack of adequate protection for ICC membersraises concerns about effectiveness & fairness of complaint resolution process, contributing to a culture of fear and reluctance to address sexual harassment in organisations,"" it added.""If they take a decision that goes against the will of senior management, they are susceptible to victimisation and retaliation, such as unfair termination and demotion,"" the petition said, arguing that ICC members in private companies must be treated akin to judges and their decisions in sexual harassment complaints should never be permitted to be the trigger for management to take vindictive action.","Supreme Court sought Union govt's response on a PIL alleging that members of internal complaints committee (ICC) face vindictive action if they rule against the top brass of a private company.

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai on Friday offered a rare glimpse into his personal journey, sharing deeply emotional memories of his family’s struggles and sacrifices during an event organised by the Nagpur district court bar association.Gavai, who became the 52nd CJI last month, choked up with visible emotion in his eyes as he recalled how his parents shaped his path in life and law.“I wanted to be an architect,” the CJI revealed, “but my father had different dreams for me. He always wanted me to become a lawyer, a dream he could not fulfil himself,” according to news agency PTI.Gavai spoke about his father’s dedication to BR Ambedkar’s cause and the burden his family carried. “My father gave himself to the service of Ambedkar. He wanted to be an advocate himself, but couldn’t fulfil that wish as he was arrested for being part of the freedom movement,” he said.Raised in a joint family, Gavai recalled how his mother and aunt bore the responsibilities of the household after his father’s imprisonment.In a moving tribute, the Chief Justice remembered how his father, when his name was recommended for judgeship, said, “If you remain a lawyer, you will only go after money, but if you become a judge then you will walk on the path laid down by Ambedkar and do good for society.”Gavai added, “My father always thought that one day I would become the Chief Justice of India. Sadly, he passed away in 2015. But I am glad my mother is there to see this.”The emotional moment was briefly lightened by Gavai’s recollection of a celebrity case. He joked about the day a cheque bounce case involving actor Hema Malini brought a large crowd to court, recalling, “There was so much crowd in the courtroom that day to get a glimpse of Hema Malini… but we couldn’t help but enjoy the moment.”Looking ahead, he hinted at writing his memoir post-retirement in November this year.",Chief Justice of India Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai choked up as he recalled how his parents shaped his path in life and law.

"BJP misusing agencies, FIR baseless: AAP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-misusing-agencies-fir-baseless-aap/articleshow/122122478.cms,"NEW DELHI: Alleging ""blatant misuse"" of agencies to defame its leaders, AAP on Thursday questioned why the first information report filed against former Delhi ministers Saurabh Bharadwaj and Satyendar Jain was being kept under wraps and ""selective"" press notes were being leaked to the media.Bharadwaj, who is Delhi AAP convener, alleged that only two former ministers were named in the case without any reasonable cause while all the officers of the health and public works departments, who were actually responsible for executing the hospital projects, were spared. ""Is the FIR so baseless that BJP fears it will become a national joke if released publicly?"" AAP asked.The party issued a press statement saying the anti-corruption branch admitted in its own documents that the projects in question were sanctioned in 2017-18 and the health information management system was announced in 2016-17, much before Bharadwaj assumed office in 2023. ""On June 24, 2025, LG Vinai Saxena issued a press note, and today, Delhi ACB head Madhur Verma also issued a press note to the media. The LG and ACB are deliberately withholding the FIR because it would expose the mockery of law being orchestrated by BJP govt,"" Bharadwaj said, claiming that releasing the FIR to the media in criminal cases was a ""standard practice"".Jain alleged that both the LG and the ACB head in their press notes mentioned different time periods when the projects were sanctioned. ""There is, as yet, no evidence to suggest that these project sanctions were marred by corruption. Moreover, all these sanctions predate Saurabh Bharadwaj's tenure. How can a minister be held liable for actions taken two to five years before assuming office? Is this some kind of joke?"" Jain questioned.Bharadwaj claimed there was not a shred of evidence to suggest corruption in the announcement of the projects and the hospital management system, and holding him responsible for the alleged crimes was ""beyond comprehension"".","AAP questions why the first information report filed against former Delhi ministers Saurabh Bharadwaj and Satyendar Jain was being kept under wraps.

IIT-Madras eyes global top 50 with major expansion plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-madras-eyes-global-top-50-with-major-expansion-plans/articleshow/122122083.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian Institutes of Technology and IISc are unlikely to break into the list of world’s top 50 universities unless they run full-fledged medical colleges, IIT-Madras director Professor V Kamakoti has said, revealing that the institution is considering setting up a medical college to overcome this gap in its portfolio.In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Kamakoti said IIT-M has already begun internal discussions on establishing a medical college, which would be integrated with its engineering and science departments, as part of its long-term vision, and is looking for a large hospital.Further, the institution has planned a global outreach through its proposed research centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany and a sustainability campus in Puducherry, another important parameter for global rankings that Indian institutions lag on. In what’s an unconventional move, IIT-M has formalised a platform to help its students prepare for civil services exams.“If you want to come into top 50 (in global rankings), you must have a medical school,” Kamakoti stressed, adding, “The top-ranked universities all have global campuses, deep-research collaborations, and, critically, medical schools”.He added: “This is not just about rankings — it’s about enabling convergence in areas like AI in healthcare, biomedical engineering, and public health.A medical college will amplify our research depth and societal impact”.On the plan for developing a sustainability-focused campus in Puducherry, the director said, “This campus will be a living laboratory for climate, water, and energy research”. Explaining the move, he added: “Sustainability is now a global benchmark in rankings. That’s why we’ve started School of Sustainability under School for Interdisciplinary Studies. It’s aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Every project must resonate with these goals — from green tech to zero-emission housing. Auroville collaborations in Puducherry are a part of this vision”.To expand global footprint, the institution will go for research collaborations and set up satellite centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany. These will encourage Indian researchers to work on global problems and offer Indian students cross-border learning.“It’s called IITM Global,” Kamakoti said, detailing the vision behind the international outreach. “If you solve an issue for India, you’ve solved it for the world. Our IITM Global will take these to Malaysia, Germany, Dubai (by this academic year), and beyond.”Kamakoti also highlighted IIT-M’s initiative to nurture engineers for civil services. To enable this, institute has created Pragati, a platform to guide and support UPSC aspirants on campus. “We want our students to start early — during BTech or MTech — with structured preparation, peer interactions, and access to faculty and civil servants who’ve walked that path,” he said.“We’re not just a tech school anymore — we’re shaping India’s future in several ways,” Kamakoti summed up.",Indian Institutes of Technology and IISc are unlikely to break into the list of world’s top 50 universities unless they run full-fledged medical colleges.

What should students take away from these rankings?

The question matters now more than ever, as students across the globe weigh their future amid rising tuition fees, stricter immigration policies, and an increasingly competitive job market.Not everyone is lucky enough to be born in a country with a world-class education system and for millions of students, especially in developing nations, studying abroad is more than a dream; it’s a lifeline to opportunity, independence, and personal growth.According to the latest 2024 CEOWorld global education rankings, here are the top 10 countries that are acing the education game, based on two key indices: Quality and Opportunity.Home to Oxford, Cambridge, and a long tradition of academic excellence, the UK tops the 2024 rankings. With a robust public education system, global research powerhouses, and generous scholarship opportunities, it’s no surprise the UK continues to attract students from over 200 countries.According to the UK's Department for Education, the country ranks second globally in academic citations. Faculty credentials across Russell Group universities are among the highest in Europe and QS consistently ranks multiple UK institutions in the top 10 worldwide.The UK Parliament’s education review confirms that over 5% of GDP is allocated to education. With a 99% literacy rate and inclusive higher education access, the UK continues to offer opportunities for both domestic and international learners.The US holds its ground at #2, thanks to its unrivaled higher education ecosystem, which includes Ivy League institutions, STEM innovation, and expansive endowments. Despite its high cost, the US remains a top choice due to its research output and career-building opportunities post-graduation.According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the US leads the world in Nobel laureates, academic research funding, and publications. Seven of the world’s top 10 universities are located here.The Council for Higher Education Accreditation notes the US has over 4,000 accredited colleges. A 99% youth literacy rate, coupled with strong federal aid programs, ensures higher education access despite rising costs.Australia punches above its weight with eight universities in the global top 100. Its vibrant international student culture, generous post-study work rights, and strong linkages to industry make it a preferred destination in the Asia-Pacific region.According to the Australian Department of Education, universities here are heavily research-oriented and backed by industry partnerships, especially in climate science, medicine, and tech.The department also reports that nearly 6% of GDP is dedicated to education. With a literacy rate of 96%, the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system also provides vocational routes to higher education, expanding access across socioeconomic lines.With a wide range of English-taught programs and a progressive education model, the Netherlands has emerged as a European education hub. It balances academic freedom with strong employability prospects, particularly in design, engineering, and sustainability studies.The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science reports that Dutch universities are globally ranked and focus on interdisciplinary research in fields like sustainability, water management, and social innovation.With a 99% literacy rate and nearly 5.3% of GDP invested in education, according to Eurostat, Dutch institutions boast high postgraduate completion rates and a focus on employability.Sweden’s education model is built around innovation, student welfare, and gender equity. The country also invests heavily in public education and research, while maintaining one of the highest literacy rates globally.According to Statistics Sweden and the European Research Council, Sweden ranks among Europe’s highest in research publications per capita, especially in environmental and gender equity fields.The Swedish Ministry of Education and Research confirms a 100% literacy rate and over 6.8% of GDP allocated to education. Sweden ranks among the world’s highest in per-student investment.With prestigious institutions like Sciences Po and Sorbonne, France blends cultural richness with academic depth. Despite language barriers in some public institutions, France’s appeal lies in its affordability and growing number of English-medium programs.The French Ministry of Higher Education and Research highlights the academic leadership of CNRS and the influence of grandes écoles in global disciplines such as literature, law, and politics.France maintains a 99% literacy rate and spends about 5.5% of GDP on education, according to National Education Ministry data. English-medium programs and scholarship options have expanded for international students.Denmark’s approach to education emphasises collaborative learning, social equity, and creativity. While tuition is free for EU students, non-EU international students are increasingly looking toward Denmark for its work-life balance and research-driven campuses.The Danish Agency for Higher Education reports high-quality faculty and leading research in green tech, life science, and renewable energy.According to the Ministry of Children and Education, tuition is free for EU students, and most domestic students benefit from state-funded education. Denmark spends around 6.3% of GDP on education.Known for safety, inclusivity, and multicultural campuses, Canada continues to be a top destination for Indian and Asian students. Strong university-industry linkages and favourable immigration pathways make it a pragmatic choice for long-term settlement.Universities Canada and QS report that Canadian institutions rank consistently in the global top 150 and offer applied programs in AI, healthcare, and sustainability.According to Statistics Canada, with a 99% literacy rate and 5.9% of GDP dedicated to education, Canada provides a strong support system and career prospects for international students.Zero or low tuition in public universities, a strong emphasis on engineering and applied sciences, and robust technical education pathways help Germany stand out in the global education landscape.According to the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, institutions like those in the TU9 alliance are global leaders in engineering and applied sciences.Germany maintains a 99% literacy rate and robust dual education models, merging classroom and workplace learning. Education spending stands near 5% of GDP.Switzerland rounds out the top 10 with its elite institutions like ETH Zurich and EPFL. The country also ranks high for scientific research output, multilingual programs, and industryAccording to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, ETH Zurich and EPFL regularly lead in global scientific output. Switzerland has among the highest R&D spends per capita in the world.With a 99% literacy rate and around 5.2% of GDP allocated to education, Switzerland’s multilingual and vocational education systems offer flexibility and high employability.The CEOWorld 2024 rankings, based on feedback from over 196,000 respondents across academia, business, and policymaking, reflect both perception and performance. While rankings alone shouldn’t determine where to study, they do provide an important starting point for evaluating return on investment, academic quality, and career prospects.While countries like the UK, US, and Australia remain dominant due to their reputation and infrastructure, emerging destinations such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden offer an excellent balance of affordability, innovation, and inclusivity.Ultimately, the best education system is one that aligns with your goals, supports your career aspirations, and offers an environment where you can thrive academically and personally.Choose wisely, not just where education is best rated but where it best fits you.","The CEOWorld rankings reveal the top 10 countries with the best education systems, based on quality and opportunity.

India's time in space: Axiom-4 lifts off; how Dragon will put Shubhanshu Shukla inside ISS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-time-in-space-axiom-4-finally-takes-off-shubhanshu-shukla-becomes-first-indian-to-cross-karman-line/articleshow/122078919.cms,"Poll What do you think is the most exciting aspect of Shubhanshu Shukla's mission? First Indian to reach the ISS Boosts India's space journey toward 2035 goals

As night enveloped Cape Canaveral, India entered a new dawn when the Falcon-9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2.31am ET (12.01pm IST). In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's group captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space - ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme"" - reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph. Nose cone deployed. Navigation instruments and docking sensors exposed as the spacecraft begins its precision chase of International Space Station.Grace circles Earth once every 90 minutes. The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window. Onboard systems track position in real-time using GPS, radar, and sensors, continuously updating Grace's path against that of the ISS.F inal approach begins Thursday. Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate. Engineers on Earth conduct pressure and leak checks before approving crew transfer.Aboard are four Axiom-4 astronauts and a fifth member - Joy, a soft, white baby swan toy serving as the mission's zero-gravity indicator. Joy carries personal meaning: chosen with Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's six year old son, Kiash, fondly called Sid - in mind.""Our first ideas all included animals,"" said mission specialist Tibor Kapu. ""We have one kid with the crew, Shux's kid Sid, who basically just loves animals. We wanted dinosaurs and lions, but we couldn't find the right one. We were extremely happy when we found Joy.""","Shubhanshu Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984.

They took me to the guards' room forcefully, undressed me and raped me,"" her complaint said, adding that the accused recorded videos of the act and threatened to circulate them if she went to cops.She tried to fight back and escape but was hit with a hockey stick, she said.She was allowed to leave only after she complained she was having a panic attack and was short of breath.She pleaded that they take her to a hospital, a request that was denied; but she was allowed to use the inhaler she had in her bag, she added.She was finally allowed to leave around 10.50 pm, when she called her father who came and took her home.The woman lodged the complaint with Kasba cops on Thursday. ""The preliminary medical examination was done at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital,"" joint commissioner of police (crime & traffic) Rupesh Kumar said, adding that witnesses had been examined and their statements recorded. Additional commissioner of police Santosh Pandey and South Suburban Division deputy commissioner Bidisha Kalita visited the scene of crime on Friday evening.Mishra and Ahmed were arrested around 7.30 p.m. on Thursday near the Kasba P.S.; Mukherjee was arrested from his residence just after midnight on Friday. Cops have seized the trio's mobile phones, suspecting the sexual assault may have been filmed, and have secured the crime scene for forensic investigation. The accused were produced at Alipore court on Friday and sent to police custody till July 1. ""The medical evidence corroborates the woman's version,"" public prosecutor Sourin Ghosal submitted in court.The principal of the college said the college could not evade responsibility though the incident happened more than three hours after classes gave over. Calcutta University vice-chancellor Santa Datta De said the college teacher-in-charge had been asked to submit a detailed report and the university would set up a fact-finding committee by Tuesday.Kolkata Police later issued a social media statement, commending the local police station's ""swift and decisive response"" to the complaint.""The investigation is being pursued with seriousness, professionalism and sensitivity. We appeal to the public and digital platforms to refrain from circulating unverified or misleading content that could hinder the judicial process and compromise the dignity of the survivor,"" it added.","Law student allegedly gang-raped at campus security guards' room on Wednesday.

Poll Do you believe that the investigation into the Air India Dreamliner crash will uncover the true causes within a month? Yes, the investigation will be thorough. No, it will take longer.





NEW DELHI: Data from a black box of the Air India Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been downloaded at Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau lab, govt said Thursday. Intitial information about causes leading to the accident is likely to be known in the next seven to 10 days.With the black boxes being examined locally, the final report is expected to be out in a month, instead of the six-month time frame given earlier, sources said. Civil aviation ministry said the crash protection module from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on Wednesday, the memory module was accessed.While the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of AI-171 which crashed within minutes of take-off was recovered on June 13, the Flight Data Recorders (FDR) were found in the debris three days later.Like the earlier practice, this time too, there were plans to send the black boxes to the US for examination, especially as it involved the first Dreamliner crash. But on the suggestion of the top leadership, it was decided to send them to the AAIB lab, sources said.As a result, the two were flown to Delhi in separate Indian Air Force planes last Tuesday.“The analysis of CVR and FDR data is under way. These efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences. All actions have been taken in full compliance with domestic laws and international obligations in a time-bound manner,” the official statement said.Information about the causes is being expected in record time, in less than a month, as this is the first example of the data of a plane that crashed in Indian territory being examined in the country’s labs itself, said a senior official. The lab is compliant with international standards.A team of over 20 experts from National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US, who arrived in Ahmedabad on June 13, are now in the Capital, examining the data with Indian experts.The delay in announcing the composition of the team probing the AI-171 crash a fortnight after the accident has raised questions about the investigation. The govt statement defended the process followed.“Following the unfortunate accident (on June 12), AAIB promptly initiated an investigation and constituted a multi-disciplinary team on June 13, 2025, in line with prescribed norms. The team, constituted as per international protocol, is led by DG AAIB, and includes an aviation medicine specialist, an air traffic control (ATC) officer, and representatives from NTSB which is the govt investigating agency from the state of manufacture and design (US), as required for such investigations,” it said. Apart from DG AAIB GVG Yugandhar, names of others on the probe panel have so far not been made public.","Data from a black box of the Air India Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been downloaded at Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau lab, govt said Thursday.

In India, health insurance is generally often an afterthought, something you purchase for tax benefits, or workplace compliance. And many of us assume that having a policy means being protected. Sure, there’s protection, but is it enough?Imagine this scenario: a family member is hospitalised, and there’s a comforting thought:But as bills arrive, comfort gives way to confusion. There are deductions for choosing a certain room, charges for procedures that aren’t included, and diagnostic costs that must be paid out of pocket. Suddenly, what looked like full protection feels anything but that.This isn’t just one person’s story, it’s increasingly common. And it raises a critical question: is your health insurance truly designed for the way healthcare works today?Healthcare has evolved dramatically over the last decade. There are more treatment options, earlier interventions, and a broader focus on prevention and recovery. With that has come a rise in costs, even for everyday care.Yet not all insurance plans have kept pace. While many policies offer a dependable foundation, some still have limitations that can leave policyholders exposed.Let’s take a closer look at what this means in real life.Imagine your policy has a room rent cap of ₹4,000. You’re admitted to a hospital and opt for a private room that exceeds the cap by ₹1,000 a day. Because of this, your entire claim; doctor’s fees, medicines, procedures, and tests; is reimbursed at only 80-90% on the claim.That one small upgrade leads to proportionally lower payouts across your bill. Plus, non-medical items like admission kits and registration fees aren’t covered; leaving you to cover the gap out of your pocket.These are part of your everyday healthcare journey. Having a policy that covers it all is crucial.Out-of-pocket healthcare spending in India continues to be high. Even with insurance, individuals often bear a significant share of healthcare costs.As health needs become more complex, insurance cover should reflect that shift. A good comprehensive health plan is structured around how people actually seek and receive care across hospitals, clinics and homes.Take, for example, a couple planning a family. A comprehensive plan would ensure maternity benefits are accessible, newborn care is covered from day one, and even vaccinations are included in the first year.Similarly, someone undergoing surgery should have access to pre-operative diagnostics, a second opinion if needed, and rehabilitation support post-discharge.A coverage that supports the entire spectrum, from pre-hospitalisation to post-recovery, secures both health and finances. A thoughtfully designed health policy not only responds to illness but anticipates life’s medical milestones. These features are what define meaningful coverage:Covering medical expenses before admission and after discharge helps manage the full treatment arc.Especially valuable for critical illnesses, this provides clarity and confidence before proceeding further.If the full coverage amount is used, it’s automatically restored for future use in the same year.Often overlooked, certain policies offer support for acute dental or eye-related treatments.Good comprehensive plans cover both the recipient’s treatment and the donor’s hospitalisation, including complications.Some plans offer home care; useful for post-surgery recovery, chronic illnesses or conditions that require clinical supervision without hospitalisation.For couples facing fertility challenges, some plans offer financial support for assisted reproductive procedures, helping make parenthood more accessible.Covers delivery expenses (normal or caesarean), congenital conditions, and early vaccinations for your baby.If recommended for obesity-related health issues like diabetes or cardiac risks, this is included after a waiting period.Some health plans now reward healthy habits with wellness points that are redeemable for renewal discounts.Select plans also include free expert teleconsultations and AI-based face scan to track vitals making preventive care digital-first and accessible.Regular check-ups are often included as part of the cover, encouraging preventive care and early detection of potential health issues.If you’re unsure whether your plan is truly comprehensive, use this checklist.It’s easy to treat health insurance as a box to tick. But when life takes a turn what matters is whether your cover holds up. Taking the time to reassess your plan is not only prudent, but essential. The right cover is the one that stands by you through the full spectrum of health: hospital, home, recovery, and beyond.That’s why it helps to go with an insurer that has seen it all. With over 19 years of experience and 1 crore+ claims settled, STAR Health has shaped its policies around the realities people face every day.Because in healthcare, the true cost is not what you pay for a policy; It’s what you pay when your policy falls short.","Maternity care often comes with a long waiting period or may not be included at all. dental and ophthalmic treatments are typically excluded, even though they’re common medical needs. Modern procedures such as robotic surgeries or organ donor-related costs may fall outside the scope of the cover.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122069514,imgsize-50028,width-838,resizemode-4/122069514.jpg"

The United States deployed its B-2 Spirit bombers in Sunday's strikes on three key nuclear facilities in Iran. The aircraft, sometimes also referred to as the “Stealth” bomber, has an Indian connection - a naturalized US citizen from India was involved in the development of the plane's propulsion system.The engineer, Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia, was later sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China, with which Beijing developed a cruise missile exhaust system to make Chinese cruise missiles resistant to detection.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Gowadia, now 81, was first arrested in October 2005 on a criminal complaint which alleged that he ""wilfully communicated"" national defense-related information to a person ""not entitled to receive it.""As per information produced during the trial, Gowadia worked with Northrop Grumman Corporation - the makers of B2 bombers - for almost 20 years, from approximately 1968 to 1986. During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu. In January 2011, he was handed a jail term of 32 years.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia was sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China.

MUMBAI: Uddhav and Raj Thackeray will hold a joint protest march of their parties here on July 5 against what they allege is the imposition of Hindi in Maharashtra's schools from Class 1 through the new three-language policy.This will be the first time that the two will come together on a political platform after Raj's decision to quit Shiv Sena to form MNS nearly two decades ago.There has been speculation of a possible reunion of the estranged cousins for the coming civic polls; the protest march is being seen as the first step in that direction.Initially, Uddhav and Raj had on Thursday announced two separate marches: on July 6 and 7 respectively.According to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut, Raj dialled him Friday and said it would not be good to hold two marches for the Marathi language in this way and a joint movement could have a big impact. Raut said he then spoke to Uddhav, who agreed ""without hesitation."" The march will mostly be from Girgaum Chowpatty to Azad Maidan. Both parties have said it will be non-political and no party flags will be displayed.MNS functionary Sandeep Deshpande and Sena (UBT) MLA Varun Sardesai also met on Friday at a restaurant in Dadar (W), further fuelling speculation that the parties would come together not just for the protest but for the BMC polls too.Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray also met Deshpande at an event on Friday, where they greeted each other; Deshpande has fought the 2024 assembly polls against Aaditya from Worli and lost.Marathi language expert Deepak Pawar, who had called for a protest on July 7, said Marathi language activists will join the July 5 protest and continue protests on July 7 if govt doesn't roll back its three-language policy. The opposition and several groups have criticized the state govt, alleging it is trying to impose Hindi as the third language, though the govt has said Hindi is not mandatory.After issuing a GR on June 17 on the third-language policy, the govt took two steps back this week, first by saying it would have wide-ranging consultations before finalizing the policy and second by saying the third language would be taught via the play-way method, only orally, in Class 1 and 2, with no textbooks for students and no tests or exams.Raut said Raj initially told him he had no idea about the UBT Sena's march.When he discussed Raj's message of having one march with Uddhav Thackeray , Raut said that ""he said he too was not in favour of a separate march but as July 6 is Ashadhi Ekadashi, it would be difficult to reach the people. I conveyed this to Raj Thackeray. After talking to Uddhav Thackeray, we suggested July 5 as the date. Raj Thackeray agreed to it after talking to his colleagues... This march will be without any political agenda. Through it, govt will see the strength of the Marathi people.""Education minister Dada Bhuse had met Raj on Thursday to explain the govt's stand, but Raj had said the govt's view wasn't acceptable. Deshpande said, ""Raj Thackeray took the initiative and called Sanjay Raut and the date of the march was decided. We are inviting all parties, including Marathi-loving office-bearers of BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena.""It's a good thing the Thackerays are keeping aside political differences and coming together as Marathi manoos. They will decide if they will come together politically. For now, we are focusing on the march.""The protest will change the political direction of Maharashtra. The protest is not Raj or Uddhav Thackeray's, it belongs to the Marathi manoos.""Sardesai said there was dialogue between Sena (UBT) and MNS. ""We are asking everyone to join the protest, so we met to plan the march,"" he said.MNS functionaries said they were reaching out to Congress, NCP and NCP (SP) netas along with other parties and organisations to invite them for the march.",Uddhav and Raj Thackeray will hold a joint protest march of their parties on July 5.

NEW DELHI: In a major development, Mumbai-based defence shipyard Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited is poised to acquire a controlling stake in Sri Lanka's largest shipyard, Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDPLC), in a deal worth almost $53 million.The move marks the first international acquisition by India's largest shipyard that builds submarines, warships and other vessels, and will provide it with a 'strategic foothold' in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).China, of course, has made deep strategic inroads into Sri Lanka. Chinese Navy's expanding presence in IOR, along with its hunt for additional logistical hubs in the region, has emerged as a major security challenge for India.The $53 million investment will be carried out through a combination of primary infusion and secondary share purchases, including the acquisition of shares from Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd, the current majority shareholder.Upon completion, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDPLC) will become a subsidiary of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL). Mazagon Dock chairman and managing director Capt Jagmohan told TOI that the proposed acquisition of a controlling stake in CDPLC, which has been approved, is a ""gateway"" towards achieving the shipyard's ambition of transforming into a regional maritime player first and then into a global shipbuilding enterprise.""With CDPLC's strategic location at Colombo port, proven capabilities, and strong regional presence, this step will position MDL as a key player in South Asia and lay the foundation for our emergence as a global shipyard,"" Capt Jagmohan said.CDPLC has more than five decades of experience in shipbuilding, ship repair and heavy engineering. ""It has a track record of delivering complex offshore support vessels, cable-laying ships, tankers and patrol boats for clients across Japan, Norway, France, the UAE, India and several African nations,"" another MDL official said.CDPLC is currently pursuing a pipeline of orders over $300 million, which includes cable-laying ships, multi-purpose utility ships and newbuild fleet support vessels.""With MDL's support, particularly in technology sharing, access to Indian supply chains, and entry into Indian and allied maritime markets, CDPLC is well positioned for a financial turnaround and long-term growth,"" the official said.MDL, on its part, continues to do well in India. In partnership with German company ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), MDL is on course to bag the mega project to build six new stealth diesel-electric submarines for the Navy. The initial cost of these submarines, with both land-attack cruise missiles and air-independent propulsion (AIP) for greater underwater endurance, was estimated to be around Rs 43,000 crore when it got the 'acceptance of necessity (AoN)' by the defence ministry several years ago. It will now be around Rs 70,000 crore, as reported earlier by TOI.Another major contract for MDL in the pipeline is the proposed construction of another three French-origin Scorpene submarines with AIP at a cost of around Rs 38,000 crore. These three new submarines, if approved, will add to the six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines already built at MDL for over Rs 23,000 crore.","Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited is poised to acquire a controlling stake in Sri Lanka's largest shipyard.

NEW DELHI: The medical examination of the 24-year-old law student, who was gang-raped inside South Calcutta Law College allegedly by an alumnus and two senior students, has confirmed signs of brutal sexual assault including “forceful penetration, bite marks and nail scratches on her body,” a Kolkata Police officer told PTI.The incident took place on the evening of June 25 inside a guard’s room adjacent to the student union office, police said, after the woman was reportedly assaulted for rejecting a marriage proposal from the main accused.The three men, including a practising criminal lawyer and two senior students have been arrested and remanded to police custody for four days. Forensic experts have sealed the crime scene and seized mobile phones of the accused for further investigation.According to the complaint filed at Kasba police station, the student had visited the college to fill out exam forms when she was asked to stay back. She alleged that after refusing a marriage proposal from the prime accused, she was physically assaulted, dragged into a room, and raped while the other two accused stood guard. The ordeal allegedly lasted over three hours, from around 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm.The survivor further told police that she was filmed during the assault and threatened with the release of the footage.She was also warned against informing anyone, with threats made against her boyfriend and family, police sources told PTI.“We are trying to find out whether the footage was forwarded to other numbers,” the officer added.Chief Public Prosecutor Sourin Ghosal told PTI that, “According to a Supreme Court judgement, all persons in a group involved in cases of gang rape must be held liable, even if all of them did not commit the act of rape.

So this is a case of gang rape, and they are also accused in the case.”The prime accused, a former student of the law college, had been hired as temporary non-teaching staff for 45 days. His social media profiles claimed he was a former president of the college's Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) unit and a current office-bearer of the south Kolkata wing of the TMC’s student body. Photos circulating online also show him alongside senior leaders of the ruling party.The Trinamool Congress has denied any current link with the accused and demanded ""severe punishment"" if he is found guilty.The case has triggered political uproar and street protests. Supporters of the SFI-DYFI clashed with police outside Kasba police station on Friday. Protesters from the BJP, Congress and AIDSO were also detained following separate demonstrations.Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has warned of escalating protests, while both the BJP and Congress have announced agitation programmes for Saturday.TMCP president Trinankur Bhattacharya distanced the organisation from the accused, saying the student union at the college has been defunct for years.State Minister Shashi Panja, addressing a press conference, said, “The state government stands firmly with the victim and her family. Instead of making the victim a battleground for politics, her pain must be understood, she must be respected, and justice must be ensured – swiftly and unconditionally.”The National Commission for Women has taken suo motu cognisance of the case and directed Kolkata Police to submit a detailed report within three days.The case has drawn comparisons with the August 2023 rape and murder of a medical intern at RG Kar Medical College, which also sparked widespread outrage and calls for better campus safety measures across West Bengal.(With inputs fro agencies)","The 24-year-old law student was allegedly gang-raped inside South Calcutta Law College.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

Neutral expert backed Indian projects

Significance of IWT

What is Indus Waters Treaty?

India Will Talk To Pakistan Only On Terror, No Indus Water For Now: Jaishankar's BIG WARNING

NEW DELHI: India on Friday dismissed the Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty as illegal, firmly rejecting its authority.The ministry of external affairs snubbed the “supplemental award” by the ""illegal"" Court of Arbitration for asserting its authority to hear the Kishenganga and Ratle hydropower cases in Jammu and Kashmir.The ministry also highlighted that the court was constituted in violation of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.Supplemental award issued by the Court of Arbitration refers to a follow-up decision specifically on whether the tribunal has the legal authority (competence) to hear the case about India’s Kishenganga and Ratle projects -- not on the projects themselves, but on the court’s jurisdiction.""India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,"" the MEA statement said.After the dastardly Pakistan-backed terrorist attack in Pahalgam, the government placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.In a strong statement, the foreign ministry said the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" ceases its support for cross-border terrorism.""Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under it,"" the statement said.""India, therefore, categorically rejects this so-called supplemental award as it has rejected all prior pronouncements of this body,"" the issue read.Calling the move a ""charade at Pakistan’s behest"", the government called the ""supplemental award"" another desperate attempt by Islamabad to escape accountability for its role as the global epicentre of terrorism.""Pakistan's resort to this fabricated arbitration mechanism is consistent with its decades-long pattern of deception and manipulation of international forums,"" the ministry added.This year in January, a neutral expert upheld India's stand after seven questions were raised in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects on matters related to the Indus water treaty.""India welcomes the decision given by the neutral expert under Paragraph 7 of Annexure F to the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960. The decision upholds and vindicates India’s stand that all seven (07) questions that were referred to the Neutral Expert, in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, are differences falling within his competence under the Treaty,"" MEA said after the decision.""It has been India’s consistent and principled position that the Neutral Expert alone has the competence under the treaty to decide these differences. Having upheld his own competence, which comports with India’s view, the neutral expert will now proceed to the next (merits) phase of his proceeding. This phase will culminate in a final decision on the merits of each of the seven differences,"" it added.In 2017, the World Bank, which is the facilitator of the treaty, had said that India was allowed to construct hydroelectric power facilities on tributaries of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers with certain restrictions under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).IWT was signed between India and Pakistan for sharing of waters of the Indus Basin. Under the treaty, the total waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - was allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - was allocated largely to Pakistan.India is, however, permitted to use the water of western rivers for domestic use, irrigation and generation of hydro-electric power. But India has not been fully utilising its legal share due to lack of storage capacity.Though India has right to create water storage capacity up to 3.6 million acre-feet on western rivers as per IWT, not enough storage capacity has been created. Besides, out of estimated power potential of 20,000 MW, which can be harnessed from power projects on western rivers, only 3,482 MW capacity has been constructed.","India rejects the Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty as illegal.

Poll Should the international community take a stronger stance against TTP activities? Yes, to curb terrorism effectively No, current measures are sufficient

NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said. The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “India-sponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in South Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan.

He was not declared a defaulter by the Cibil report, or by any other agency, and therefore the order cancelling his appointment as a defaulter was illegal and liable to be set aside, his counsel said.Opposing the plea, SBI submitted that one stipulated eligibility criteria was that candidates with records of default in repayment of loans, adverse reports by Cibil or other external agencies were not eligible for appointment. Since the petitioner gave a false declaration, his appointment was cancelled, SBI counsel C Mohan said. The petitioner's Cibil report revealed an adverse credit history in repayment of loans and credit card usage, and therefore the petitioner was found ineligible under Clause 1(E) of the eligibility criteria, he added.Concurring with the submissions, the court dismissed the petition.",Madras high court confirmed State Bank of India's decision cancelling the appointment of a circle-based officer (CBO) due to a poor Cibil score.

"Shubhanshu Shukla floats, Isro digs in at Houston to watch & learn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shubhanshu-shukla-floats-isro-digs-in-at-houston-to-watch-learn/articleshow/122119846.cms,"Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla may be astronaut number 634, but he is far from the only Indian drawing value from the Axiom-4 mission.While Shukla orbits Earth aboard the International Space Station, a contingent of Isro engineers and doctors stationed in Houston is immersed in a parallel mission — one rooted not in weightlessness, but in quiet learning. For them, this is not just a spectacle; it’s a field laboratory where decades of preparation for India’s human spaceflight future are converging into real, tactile understanding.“This is the first time we’re seeing these operations up close—till now, it was all just documentation,” said a senior Isro official closely involved with the mission. “For us, this hands-on exposure is valuable. Add to this the science Shux will do at ISS, and it only gets better.”Part of Isro’s delegation are eight engineers, Isro doctors and one doctor from IAF’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), which was involved in the initial screening and selection of astronauts for India’s Gaganyaan On Thursday, the team got rare observational experience spread across the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and Axiom’s Mission Control in Houston. These individuals aren’t simply shadowing American counterparts; they’re embedded observers in restricted environments where much of the true know-how of human spaceflight resides.For instance, on the day the Dragon capsule docked with the ISS, the Isro team was not just allowed into the JSC to watch operations unfold live. “We were on the audio loop, listening to mission control discussions. We saw what control operations did, how many docking attempts were made, what kind of error parameters were being monitored. These are not things you’ll find in any public webcast or document,” the official said.While Nasa does publish mission sequences, the real-time judgement calls, procedural fluidity, and console data are generally inaccessible to the outside world — unless, as in this case, you’re a partner with boots on the ground.Isro’s access will deepen further. “They’re setting up a dedicated conference room for us, where live console data will flow in,” the official said. There’s more than docking being studied.With Gaganyaan planning to carry out multiple docking ops in the years ahead — and with India’s future space station on the horizon — Isro engineers are keen to absorb the choreography of mission ops in real environments.“We’ve done one docking so far. But a space station will require many. Watching this from inside Nasa's systems gives us critical learning that we can’t replicate in India just yet.”Medical operations, too, are under the Isro lens. Two doctors from the agency are part of the Houston team and are already participating in alternate-day medical conferences with Shukla aboard the ISS.“It’s a private medical conference link—used routinely by Nasa and Axiom—and our doctors are now involved in that process. This is how they’ll learn the medical rhythms of human spaceflight,” the official said.As part of India’s learning curve in astronaut rehabilitation and post-flight recovery, the doctors will also observe Shukla’s reconditioning phases, both immediately after his return and during follow-up weeks in the US.The team is split between Axiom’s control centre and JSC’s, depending on the operation. While JSC largely handles docking and mission dynamics, Axiom leads crew management, flight surgeon coordination and private astronaut interfaces.Axiom’s mission centre is where people from Hungary and Poland are stationed too but because they don’t have Nasa agreement like Isro does, they don’t have JSC access like the Indian space agency.

"Now a star in orbit, Shubhanshu Shukla was always a natural in the sky",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-a-star-in-orbit-shubhanshu-shukla-was-always-a-natural-in-the-sky/articleshow/122118986.cms,"BENGALURU: He was the kind of cadet who didn’t just learn to fly — he belonged in the sky. Years before Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to board the International Space Station (ISS), he was already turning heads in the cockpit of a Super Dimona aircraft at the National Defence Academy (NDA).Back then, he was just another cadet from the Hunter Squadron — call sign not yet famous, dreams still earthbound. But to the instructor watching closely from the co-pilot’s seat, one thing was clear: the young man had wings.“He had a natural flair for flying,” recalled Group Captain (retd) Anupam Banerjee, Shukla’s first flying instructor at NDA. “In just the first few sorties, we could tell. Some cadets struggle with the feel of the controls or spatial awareness. Not Shukla. He was confident, intuitive — a very natural flier.”It was 20 years ago. The aircraft was an Austrian-built HK-36TC Super Dimona, used for ab-initio flying exposure at NDA before cadets move on to formal pilot training at the Air Force Academy.Shux, as Banerjee recalled, aced those initial flights — an early indication of the career that lay ahead: Jaguars, test pilot school, and finally, a ride to low-Earth orbit on Axiom-4 (Ax-4).But what truly stood out, Banerjee said, wasn’t just skill. “He was sincere, extremely hardworking, and that’s a rare combination when paired with ability. I told him then — you’ll go far if you keep this up.”Years later, when Shukla was preparing for spaceflight, he sent Banerjee a message. He hadn’t forgotten the words. “He told me he remembered what I’d said: that it’s not enough to be a good flier or officer — you must be a good human being. That stayed with him. And when he told me that, it meant a lot.”Banerjee had flown with Shukla only seven or eight times, but the connection endured. “He always stayed in touch. Not many do. Whenever he reached a big moment in life, he’d send a message. That says a lot about the man he’s become.”Before launch, the two had one last conversation. “I knew he was about to enter quarantine, so I wished him luck. I told him life had already prepared him for what was coming. And that, a part of me was going to space with him.”Watching Shukla dock with the ISS, Banerjee says he felt something beyond pride. “It’s still unbelievable to me — that someone I trained, someone who first flew with me, is now in space. It’s not just about reaching orbit. It’s about who he is as a person. That matters even more.”In a way, Shukla’s story is a flight path traced not just in the sky, but in character. “When your students do well, you feel proud. But when they turn out to be fine human beings too — that’s greater joy.”So yes, Shux may now be astronaut number 634. But long before he floated weightlessly in a pressurised module, he was already soaring — on skill, sincerity, and the sort of quiet steel that can’t be taught.","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to board the International Space Station (ISS) He was already turning heads in the cockpit of a Super Dimona aircraft at the National Defence Academy (NDA) His instructor, Anupam Banerjee, says he was confident, intuitive and a very natural flier.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122119024,imgsize-416194,width-400,resizemode-4/122119024.jpg"

With this, the former J&K chief minister’s ambitious plan to provide an alternative political force in the UT now seems like a closed chapter.In the past few months, Azad himself has not shown any interest in reviving his party as he has not held any meeting.Former ministers Taj Mohiuddin and Ghulam Nabi Saroori, who were among the first to leave Congress and join DPAP in Aug 2022, rejoined Congress at the party headquarters in Srinagar. Regretting his earlier decision to leave the party, Mohiuddin said: “Congress has always been my home. Leaving it was a painful and unfortunate decision.” Saroori described his return as a “ghar wapsi” (homecoming).Both Saroori and Mohideen, who had been with Congress for decades before they parted ways, had been planning their return for the past few months. “Congress is like an ocean,” Mohiuddin said.J&K Congress president Tariq Hameed Karra said the return of the two ex-ministers would strengthen the party.“There are others also who want to rejoin, and we are considering each case one by one,” Karra said. Last month, DPAP Kashmir president, Mohammad Amin Bhat, had rejoined Congress.On April 14, Azad had announced the dissolution of his party organisation as part of a restructuring exercise, but there was no development thereafter. The move came nearly six months after DPAP’s rout in the Oct 2024 Assembly polls despite Azad’s intensive campaigning across J&K. The party contested 23 out of 90 seats, but could not secure a single victory.After Azad founded DPAP, nearly 90 per cent of Congress representatives in J&K joined him, leaving the grand old party virtually defunct in the UT. However, most of them have returned to the Congress fold.

A local court in south Kashmir’s Anantnag on Friday rejected the bail application of a man accused of raping a 70-year-old Maharashtrain tourist in Pahalgam over two months ago, stating that the “revered” and elderly guest “was treated so shockingly in a land of saints and seers”, that she would forever regret her choice to visit Kashmir.“It is not an isolated act to be ignored, but a reflection of a highest degree of depravity and sick mentality prevailing in the society, which must bow its head in shame and invites a serious introspection as to what it stood for, and how that has now collapsed,” principal sessions judge Tahir Khurshid Raina said.The alleged crime occurred on April 11. The prosecution told the court that the woman was alone in her hotel room in Pahalgam when the accused barged in, gagged her using a blanket, and raped her before fleeing through the window of the room.“This court, which every day witnesses the reflection of the probity level of this society, expresses its concern that it is hopelessly getting eroded on various fronts,” the judge said. The sooner the “sheet-anchors, conscious keepers, watchdogs, and philanthropists of this society” rise to the occasion to check what is going wrong in the moral front of the society, the better it will be for saving Kashmir as the “paradise on earth in its truest sense”, he said.“Mere meadows, mountains, lush green fields, forests, springs, rivers, rivulets and gardens will not come to the rescue of Kashmir as a desired tourist destination,” Raina added.The judge said Kashmir’s rich cultural values, combined with hospitality par excellence, have attracted tourists from across the world. These tourists, in turn, have enriched the culture and value system of Kashmir to a level that matches the global standard of civilisation.Raina said the crime has “cast a shadow over the said legacy of Kashmir” and also relates to Pahalgam, which is not known in the world today for good reasons, contrary to the status it enjoyed in the past.",A local court in south Kashmir’s Anantnag on Friday rejected the bail application of a man accused of raping a 70-year-old tourist.

A day after gunning down a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist in Basantgarh in J&K’s Udhampur district, a joint team of security forces continued combing the rain-soaked forests of Bihali in the upper reaches Friday to track the slain ultra’s three trapped associates.“After a night’s pause, the search operation resumed on Friday morning, with the cordon further strengthened by additional reinforcements to cut off escape routes. Aerial surveillance using drones is underway. Sniffer dogs have also been roped in to assist the search,” an official said.Monsoon rain, while slowing troop movement, is helping forces restrict the terrorists’ range and pin them within the forest. “The weather is bad in Basantgarh. Once it clears, the situation will become more evident,” Jammu range IG Bhim Sen Tuti had said on Thursday, adding that the four terrorists were likely part of a group that police had been tracking in the Jammu region for nearly a year.Basantgarh falls on the traditional infiltration route for Pakistani terrorists, who cross over the international border in Kathua, and travel to Udhampur via higher reaches to proceed towards Doda and Kishtwar districts in Jammu region, to further move into Kashmir Valley. With help from overground workers affiliated with numerous proscribed outfits, these infiltrators move from one place to another, taking cover in forests and natural caves. The belt has witnessed several encounters and terror attacks in the past, and security forces have arrested many overground workers for providing logistic support to ultras.","A day after gunning down a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist in Basantgarh in J&K’s Udhampur district, a joint team of security forces continued combing the rain-soaked forests of Bihali in the upper reaches.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122118692,imgsize-2524795,width-400,resizemode-4/122118692.jpg"

Russia’s Rosatom ships reactor vessel for Kudankulam N-plant unit-6 to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russias-rosatom-ships-reactor-vessel-for-kudankulam-n-plant-unit-6-to-india/articleshow/117345475.cms,"NEW DELHI: The VVER-1000 reactor vessel for the sixth unit of the Tamil Nadu-based Kudankulam nuclear power plant (KNPP), which is being built in India according to a Russian design, is being transported to the construction site. The equipment weighing 320 tonnes was manufactured at Atommash plant, the Russian atomic energy corporation Rosatom's machine-building division, and shipped to the customer.A reactor vessel is a thick steel container that holds nuclear fuel in a nuclear reactor. It's also known as a reactor pressure vessel.Before sending the reactor vessel on a sea voyage, the equipment was delivered by a special automobile transport to the plant pier, where it was loaded onto a river vessel, the destination of which was the sea port of Novorossiysk. Then, in the port, the reactor vessel was placed in the hold of a sea vessel to cover a 11,000-km route to India.A set of four steam generators for the sixth unit of the Kudankulam N-plant will be shipped in 2025.At present, four new power units are being built at the Kudankulam NPP according to the Russian design. The design of the station, construction and supply of equipment are carried out by divisions of the engineering division of Rosatom State Corporation . Contracts for the design and supply of equipment were concluded between JSC Atomstroyexport and ICAEL (Atomic Energy Corporation of India).“We are developing and making our work more perfect both in terms of equipment design, ensuring an unprecedented level of safety, and in terms of the economic efficiency of our products. We are currently developing a reactor installation for nuclear power plants with increased power characteristics, more modern operational properties, and improved technical and economic indicators for use in Russia and abroad,” noted Valery Kryzhanovsky , general designer of OKB Gidropress.KKNPP is scheduled to have six VVER-1000 reactors built in collaboration with Atomstroyexport, the Russian state company and Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), with an installed capacity of 6,000 MW of electricity.The first reactor of the plant attained criticality in July 2013 and was connected to the grid three months later. It started commercial operation from Dec 31, 2014. The second unit achieved criticality on July 10, 2016 and was connected to the grid in Aug.Construction of units 3 and 4 with similar VVER-1000 power units began in 2017. Units 3 and 4 are 73% complete. They have a cost overrun of nearly 73% and a time overrun of 72 months, according to a project summary released in August 2024 by the Union govt. Units 5 and 6 are almost a third complete and have not run into any cost or time overruns, according to the project summary.","The equipment weighing 320 tonnes was manufactured at Atommash plant, the Russian atomic energy corporation Rosatom's machine-building division.

Fast growing composites industry is shaping India’s future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fast-growing-composites-industry-is-shaping-indias-future/articleshow/117345052.cms,"The Indian composites materials market was estimated at USD 1.8 billion in 2024 and is likely to grow at a healthy CAGR of 7.8 per cent over the next six years, reaching USD 2.8 billion in 2030.Composites materials are revolutionising various industries in India, driving innovation, and contributing to the country’s economic growth. These advanced materials, composed of two or more constituents with distinct physical and chemical properties, offer exceptional strength, lightweight characteristics, durability, and resistance to environmental factors.The renewable energy sector benefits significantly from composites, especially in wind and solar energy. Lightweight, durable wind turbine blades and solar panel structures made from composites are key to India’s shift to sustainable energy. In 2024, India’s installed wind energy capacity was approximately 48 GW, the fourth largest globally. India’s installed wind energy capacity is expected to reach 140 GW by 2030, driving substantial growth in the composites industry, as turbines are about 30 per cent composite by weight. Another emerging application is in lightweight high-pressure vessels, enabling efficient hydrogen storage without excess weight.In the aerospace and defence sectors, composites are essential for manufacturing lighter, fuel-efficient aircraft, drones, and military vehicles. These materials enhance performance and reduce operational costs, supporting India’s goal of achieving self-reliance in defence production. Composites are extensively used in the HAL Tejas aircraft, developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL). Additionally, ISRO relies heavily on composites for satellite structures and launch vehicles, enabling more efficient space missions and bolstering India’s global position in space technology.Composites materials are most widely used in the building and construction industry, accounting for 30 per cent of total usage. They are found in a range of products, including roofing, facades, light poles, decorative items, portable toilets, doors, swimming pools, railings, and furniture. As India’s economy grows, all of these applications, and the use of composites is expected to grow substantially.In infrastructure, composites are used in bridges, pipelines, and construction projects, offering corrosion resistance and reduced maintenance costs, essential for smart city initiatives.Composites are integral to the development of lighter and more fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs) and high-speed trains, helping reduce carbon emissions.In the automotive sector, composites are used for manufacturing the body parts of buses, EVs, and rickshaws. Additionally, they are increasingly being utilised for high-voltage battery casings due to their superior electrical insulation properties.In railways, composites are used in various components, including luggage racks, window blinds, toilet cabins, passenger seat shells, and tables, making train coaches both lightweight and durable. Government initiatives such as the National Rail Plan (NRP) 2030, Make in India, and Atmanirbhar Bharat aim to modernise India’s railway system by promoting the adoption of innovative materials like composites in train manufacturing.Currently, India is entirely reliant on imports for carbon fibre. The FRP Institute, India’s premier composites association, organises the International Conference and Exhibition for Reinforced Plastics (ICERP) biennially. ICERP is the largest show for composites in India and second largest in Asia. The 11th edition of this event, scheduled for next week in Mumbai, will showcase the latest advancements in the Indian composites industry.","The Indian composites materials market was estimated at USD 1.8 billion in 2024. It is likely to grow at a healthy CAGR of 7.8 per cent over the next six years, reaching USD 2.8billion in 2030.

The other half of success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-other-half-of-success/articleshow/117332916.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

L&T's chairman recently sparked a firestorm of controversy with his startling suggestion that employees should work 90 hours weekly, including Sundays, to remain competitive. His dismissive quip, ""How long can you stare at your wife?"" created waves of outrage on social media .

Several such incidents of the past make us reflect upon the deeper malaise in Indian corporate culture – one of the most recent being the tragic death of Anna Sebastian, a 24-year-old professional, a stark reminder of corporate excess. It's a sobering reality that Indians have the longest average workweek among the world's ten largest economies.

Having witnessed the corporate landscape, I can attest to its often-toxic environment. Like delicate flowers in harsh soil, employees wither under daily instances of humiliation from aggressive supervisors. When aggression flows from the top, it cascades down unchecked and is often celebrated rather than condemned. Talents don't abandon ships; they flee toxic captains. If not valued in one setting, they will surely shine in another like precious gemstones.

But beyond the corporate dynamics lies a more profound question: If a man is at home, can’t he reduce his wife’s burden, even if he is bored of her face. Maya Angelou's poem ‘Woman Work’ resonates with domestic life:

‘I've got the children to tend. The clothes to mend. The floor to mop. The food to shop. Then the chicken to fry. The baby to dry… Shine on me, sunshine… Fall softly, dewdrops… And cool my brow again…’

Beware, a man who does not even see the face of his wife could end up as another Vachaspathi Mishra, the 10th century scholar who spent decades on his scholarly pursuits. So immersed was he in writing a commentary on the Brahma Sutra that he saw only his wife Bhamati’ hands - that served him food and lit his lamp each evening. One night, as the lamp flickered, and she came to add oil, he looked at her aged face and asked her who she was. Struck by the thought of the lost years, he immortalised her sacrifice by naming his masterwork ‘Bhamati’.

If I were Bhamati, I would have preferred work-life balance over a book named after me.

Now, coming to the moot point – can his wife’s face bore a man if he is at home?

One’s eyes, those mystical windows to the soul, hold universes of unspoken understanding. We learn life’s deepest mysteries through eye contact. As the great Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar beautifully captured in his couplet:

""Kannodu Kann Inai NokkuOkkin, VaaiChorkkal

Enna Payanum ila""

“When the eyes meet in love’s silent discourse and are locked in the gaze

Words become superficial vessels”

A man might carve his name on stone with his accomplishments, but how does he compensate for the precious moments lost with his beloved? The poets of ages past didn't write countless verses about fleeting glances without reason; they understood that in these shared gazes lie life's deepest mysteries and most profound connections.

This controversy can help serve as a clarion call for corporate India to reimagine its understanding of success . True leadership recognises that sustainable achievement blossoms from a balance or professional excellence and personal fulfilment. Perhaps it's time to remember that the most meaningful accomplishments often happen in those quiet moments when we pause long enough to truly see the ones we love.

"Startups, venture capital firms seek tax benefits",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/startups-venture-capital-firms-seek-tax-benefits/articleshow/117344086.cms,"MUMBAI: Startups and venture capital (VC) firms are seeking an easier tax regime and measures to boost availability of domestic capital in the upcoming Budget.Parity between foreign and domestic funds in terms of taxation is required to attract foreign investors to Indian alternative investment funds (AIFs), said Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital and co-chair of regulatory affairs committee at Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA).""If foreign investors see foreign funds enjoying better tax treatment in India, they will prefer these foreign vehicles instead of Indian AIFs. This parity will also attract investors and fund managers to GIFT IFSC ,"" said Pai.Insurance companies, banks and pension funds should be encouraged to invest along with govt through fund of funds schemes to fuel growth of AIFs, said Padmaja Ruparel, co-founder at Indian Angel Network (IAN). This will enable expansion of domestic capital for startups, Ruparel said. AIFs are pooled investment vehicles for investing in assets like startups. Current norms do not allow insurance companies and pension funds to invest in startups directly; they can only do so via fund of funds which are allowed to invest in AIFs.India requires a sovereign-backed fund of funds anchored by SIDBI which allows contributions from banks, insurance companies and global sovereign wealth funds, said Anirudh A Damani, managing partner at ArthaVenture Fund. ""With SIDBI as the anchor, this approach will create a much-needed pool of patient capital catering to startups across stages,"" said Damani, adding that the government should also expand the definition of startups to allow more businesses to get backing. The current DPIIT startup classification limits eligibility to companies up to 10 years of age or with a turnover of less than Rs 100 crore.Startups are seeking some relaxation in Esop ( employee stock ownership plan ) tax regime. Treating Esops akin to shares with simplified tax structures would make them a viable wealth-creation tool, helping startups to retain and attract top talent, said Mayank Kumar, co-founder at upGrad. The fintech sector continues to bat for implementation of a tiered merchant discount rate regime for UPI transactions.","Parity between foreign and domestic funds in terms of taxation is required to attract foreign investors to Indian alternative investment funds (AIFs) Insurance companies, banks and pension funds should be encouraged to invest along with govt through fund of funds schemes to fuel growth of AIFs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117344123,imgsize-1298106,width-400,resizemode-4/117344123.jpg"
"Supreme Court pulls up MCD on trash management, asks government to step in",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-pulls-up-mcd-on-trash-management-asks-government-to-step-in/articleshow/117343614.cms,"SC shocked it will take another 4 years to clear Ghazipur dumpsite

NEW DELHI: Pulling up Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) for non-compliance of its order on solid waste management , with 3,000 tonnes of waste being dumped untreated on a daily basis, Supreme Court on Friday said it would be forced to pass a drastic order against it, and asked the Centre to intervene and sort out the problem.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said the central government cannot remain silent on the sorry state of affairs prevailing in the national capital, and expressed its anguish over MCD's statement that the Ghazipur dumpsite would be cleared only by Dec 2028.Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for MCD, said approximately 71.7 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of legacy waste has been successfully bio-mined at the Bhalswa dumpsite and approximately 27.7 lakh MT at the Ghazipur landfill.To clear the remaining balance of approximately 45 lakh MT of legacy waste, a new tender was awarded on 06.12.2024 for the Bhalswa dumpsite. Similarly, to clear the remaining balance of approximately 45 lakh MT of legacy waste at the Ghazipur dumpsite, tender had been called, the technical bid opened on 08.01.2025 and it is under evaluation. It is expected that the remaining waste will be completely cleared by Dec 2028, in accordance with the plans and timelines submitted before the SC,"" MCD said in its affidavit.Expressing shock that it will take another four years, the bench said, ""What is the stand of the Union of India? How can they remain silent? If they are not performing, then action should be taken."" The court said if the situation remains the same, then it would order banning all construction work in the city. Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, assured SC that she would take instruction from the urban development ministry and brief the court.Senior advocate Aparajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told SC that one of the reasons for the problem is lack of coordination between the Centre and the Delhi govt. ""We will make them coordinate. It is a very very serious issue. It is happening in the capital city and we are concerned about it,"" the bench said. Only 8,000 tonnes of solid waste is processed out of the 11,000 tonnes generated every day in Delhi, which had failed to implement the 2016 law on processing of solid waste.","Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said the central government cannot remain silent on the sorry state of affairs prevailing in the national capital.

Arya's announcement of candidacy

Past stance on key issues

The father of Indian-origin MP Chandra Arya said he never expected his son to run for the position of Prime Minister of Canada following Justin Trudeau 's resignation.K Govindaiah told news agency PTI that neither they nor Arya had anticipated this move. He also recalled that his father-in-law had once predicted Arya would become a great politician, a prediction now being fulfilled.""We never expected, and he too never expected, that he will run for Prime Ministership. My father-in-law said he will become a great politician, and it is coming true,"" he said.Arya, the MP from Nepean, Ottawa, was born in Karnataka.Srinivasa Govindaiah, Chandra Arya's brother, said that Arya was the only person to have been elected as an MP within a short period of arriving in Canada. He also revealed that Arya was the first from their family to go to Canada without any contacts. Even after being elected for the first time, there was an anti-government wave, so Arya began working for his constituency from the very next day, as per Srinivasa.""...he is the only person to have been elected as an MP, within a short period of entering Canada. There are many Indian-origin MPs who are settled there for generations. But he was the first person from our family to go there, and he did not have any contacts over there. He worked honestly... Even after getting elected for the first time, there was an anti-government wave happening there. So from the next day, he started working for the constituency. He was never doing any other business apart from politics at that time.

Arya, who represents the riding of Nepean in Ottawa, made the announcement via social media platform X.In his campaign pledge, Arya said, ""I am running to be the next Prime Minister of Canada to lead a small, more efficient government to rebuild our nation and secure prosperity for future generations."" His platform includes transforming Canada into a sovereign republic, raising the retirement age, implementing a citizenship-based taxation system, and recognizing Palestine's statehood.Arya stressed the struggles faced by many Canadians, particularly younger people, with affordability and the challenges encountered by the working middle class. He emphasized the need for leadership that is unafraid to make significant decisions to rebuild the economy, restore hope, create equal opportunities, and secure prosperity for future generations.Arya's positions have not always aligned with government policies. In 2023, he supported a petition urging the Liberals to review their proposed foreign agent registry plans following reports of foreign interference in Canadian politics . Although the registry legislation was approved, its implementation is still pending.As an advocate for Hindu Canadian interests, Arya has had disagreements with fellow parliamentarians, including NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and Liberal colleague Sukh Dhaliwal, regarding Ottawa-New Delhi relations and the activities of Sikh separatists in Canada.During a personal visit to India last year, Arya met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Global Affairs Canada clarified that Arya's journey was on his own initiative and did not represent the government of Canada.Arya also opposed a motion seeking to categorize the 1984 anti-Sikh riots as genocide, claiming to be the sole MP present in the House of Commons who prevented its passage through opposition.","Indian-origin MP Chandra Arya announced his candidacy for the Liberal leadership following Justin Trudeau's resignation.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Friday announced a Rs 2,500 monthly allowance for eligible women under Mahila Samridhi Yojana while unveiling the first of its three-part manifesto ahead of Feb 5 Delhi polls.It also promised Rs 21,000 and six nutritional kits for expecting mothers along with Rs 5,000 for the first child and Rs 6,000 for the second; Rs 500 subsidy on LPG cylinders, Rs 2,500 per month as pension for senior citizens, and implementation of Ayushman Bharat Yojana in the city.BJP president J P Nadda said all existing public welfare schemes will continue if the party is voted to office. AAP govt currently offers several such schemes, including free electricity up to 200 units a month, 20,000 litres of water and free travel passes for women on DTC and cluster buses. In its poll manifesto, AAP has pledged Rs 2,100 a month for women.BJP president J P Nadda said that in the first cabinet meeting after forming the govt, the promises in the manifesto would be executed.He said, ""Under the Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojna, we have given around 4.73 crore women Rs 5,000 for the delivery of the first child and Rs 6,000 for the second child.""While talking about the direct cash transfer scheme, Nadda said that the BJP was successful in delivering the scheme in several other states. ""In Madhya Pradesh, 13 million women are being given Rs 1,250 each as part of a women's welfare scheme. Similarly, Maharashtra provides Rs 1,250 monthly to 24 million individuals, Chhattisgarh gives Rs 1,000 per month to 7 million sisters, and Haryana provides Rs 2,500 per month,"" he said.He also took a dig at AAP and said AAP, during its 2021 Punjab campaign, promised Rs 1,000 monthly to women but failed to deliver. In the 2024 Delhi Lok Sabha elections, similar promises were made, but the schemes were never implemented, he said.Stating that the party will ensure the govt's flagship Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi, Nadda said AAP prevented 5.1 million people from benefitting from this scheme in Delhi. The BJP assures that if it forms the govt in Delhi, it will approve the scheme in the first cabinet meeting and add an additional Rs 500,000 health cover for residents, providing a total coverage of Rs 1 million.The implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme has been a major flashpoint between AAP and BJP, with the latter stating that it has better schemes being run by the state govt. Earlier, AAP announced the Sanjeevani scheme for people aged above 60, including private hospitals. Nadda said that BJP also promises an additional Rs 500,000 health cover for senior citizens over 70. ""If this scheme was implemented in 2017-18, Delhi residents would have benefitted, but it has remained inactive under AAP. The BJP aims to approve it after the Feb 8 decision,"" he said.MP and manifesto committee chairperson Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the guarantees that the BJP has given in the first part of the manifesto will change the lives of Delhi. ""The manifesto announcements show how much PM Narendra Modi cares for every section of society. The BJP will take the manifesto to every household and each voter, and all of them will vote for BJP so that the BJP makes the promises land on the ground,"" he said.""The promises Arvind Kejriwal made in Delhi were hollow promises because, though Kejriwal made rides for women free in buses, he did nothing to improve the fleet of buses in Delhi,"" he said. Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva said BJP will resume pensions for senior citizens withheld by the Kejriwal govt. He said that the party has also announced the Atal Canteen Scheme , aimed at providing affordable meals for labourers and residents of slum areas, offering full meals at Rs 5. Union Minister Harsh Malhotra said that the declarations made by BJP are firm commitments and that the party is determined to achieve them.","BJP announces Rs 2,500 monthly allowance for eligible women under Mahila Samridhi Yojana.

Here’s a quick guide, calculations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/8th-pay-commission-news-how-much-salary-hike-can-central-government-employees-expect-heres-a-quick-guide-calculations/articleshow/117324025.cms,"The current salary structure, based on the 7th Pay Commission's guidelines, was implemented from January 1, 2016.

Poll Do You Believe Government Employees Should Have Higher Salaries Than Private Sector Employees? No, Private Sector Should Be Paid More Yes, They Should Be Compensated More

8th Pay Commission: How much salary hike to expect?

8th Pay Commission: What is the fitment factor?

The fitment factor serves as a multiplication coefficient employed to determine the revised compensation for central government staff and retirees. It represents an essential element of the Pay Commission, utilised when implementing salary and pension increases following new commission guidelines.

The variation in grade pay assessment and irregular spacing between pay bands directly influences the quantum of fitment benefits. This inconsistency led numerous stakeholders to advocate for the implementation of a uniform fitment factor applicable across all employee categories.

The 7th Pay Commission established a standard fitment benefit of 2.57 applicable to all central government employees. This factor resulted in raising the minimum basic pay to ""Rs 18,000"" monthly from the previous ""Rs. 7,000"" (2.57 times the basic remuneration under the 6th Pay Commission).

A practical demonstration helps explain how public sector workers can determine their revised salary using the fitment factor set by the 8th Pay Commission. Consider a scenario where your current basic pay is Rs 40,000 monthly, and let’s assume that the 8th Pay Commission suggests a fitment factor of 2.5. This calculation would raise your basic salary to Rs 1 lakh per month.

Initially, dearness allowance remains excluded, as per typical pay commission guidelines. The dearness allowance component gets incorporated into the salary structure during subsequent years, following pay commission recommendations. Additional allowances might undergo modifications based on the pay commission's directives.

8th Pay Commission latest news : In good news for central government employees, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission. With this, central government employees can look forward to a salary hike.PM Modi shared on X: ""We are all proud of the efforts of all Government employees, who work to build a Viksit Bharat. The Cabinet's decision on the 8th Pay Commission will improve quality of life and give a boost to consumption.""The decision comes months after the dearness allowance for central government employees crossed 50% of central government employees' basic salary. From July 1, 2024, central government staff and pensioners have been receiving 53% of their basic pay as dearness allowance/relief, with the next adjustment scheduled for January 2025.The current salary structure, based on the 7th Pay Commission's guidelines implemented from January 1, 2016, will be updated after the 8th Pay Commission recommendations. ET consulted experts regarding potential salary increases, considering historical pay commission recommendations.Krishnendu Chatterjee, TeamLease Vice President, was quoted as saying, ""The Last Pay Commission was established in 2016, which recommended the minimum pay jump from 7,000 per month to 18,000 per month with a fitment factor of 2.57 times of basic pay. The maximum ceiling is 2.5 lakhs per month. Considering the inflation factor, there are indications that the fitment factor may stay between 2.5- 2.8 times, which will give a significant boost to employee salaries between Rs 40,000 and Rs 45,000. There are also suggestions of Performance based pay hike which are still under deliberation.""Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: Cabinet approves constitution of 8th Pay Commission; central government employees eye pay hike According to Rohitaashv Sinha from King Stubb & Kasiva, ""Pay commissions are in most cases established every 10 years to assess and provide changes to the remunerations of central government employees. The last pay commission, i.e. the 7th pay commission took effect in January 2016 and gave a raise on the minimum basic pay from Rs 7000 to Rs 18000 using the fitment factor 2.57. In the 8th Pay Commission, it is believed that the increase the minimum basic pay will be an astonishing 186%. This may make the minimum basic pay to INR 51,480 per month. It seems that the fitment factor for it is 2.86. The changes are likely to be implemented through the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2025 and may lead to enhanced pension and other retiral benefits such as EPF, Gratuity etc. and recommend changes in salary structures for government employees.""SKV Law Offices' Senior Associate Nihal Bhardwaj explains that historical data suggests central government staff might receive a 25-30% pay rise under the 8th Pay Commission. The 6th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2006, covering the period 2006–2016) utilised a 1.86 fitment factor, delivering a 40% increase in wages, whilst the 7th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2016, covering the period 2016–2026) employed a 2.57 fitment factor, yielding approximately 23-25% higher salaries.Staff associations are currently pushing for a fitment factor between 3.0 and 3.5, which could potentially elevate the minimum basic salary from Rs 18,000 to roughly Rs 25,000–Rs 26,000. Such adjustments would result in substantial improvements across all pay grades, he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission.

BJP Labels Congress ‘New Muslim League’ for Backing Places of Worship Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-calls-congress-new-muslim-league-for-backing-shrines-act/articleshow/117342132.cms,"Poll Is Political Rhetoric Around Religion a Cause for Concern? No, It’s Part of Democratic Discourse Yes, It Fosters Division

NEW DELHI: BJP Friday said Congress moving Supreme Court in support of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was a declaration of ""open war against Hindus"" and the party was now the ""new Muslim League "". ""Congress has approached SC seeking to deny Hindus their fundamental constitutional right to legal remedies for addressing historical injustices. It has urged the top court to dismiss petitions challenging the Places of Worship Act , 1991, under the pretext of 'safeguarding secularism',"" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said on X.BJP had opposed the Places of Worship Act right since the Narasimha Rao-led govt's move to enact it in the face of the movement for construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The bill, passed amid vehement opposition from BJP, sought to freeze the character of all places of worship, save the disputed site in Ayodhya, as it existed on Aug 15, 1947. It was meant to pre-empt a Sangh Parivar bid for Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque and Mathura's Shahi Eidgah.But this is a first in recent times that BJP has reiterated its stance: something which raises the excitement over the stand the Centre might take in SC over the law.Congress has moved SC to oppose pleas challenging the Act claiming that it is violative of Articles 14 (equality before law and equal protection), Article 15 (prohibition of discrimination on the ground of religion), Article 25 (right to profess and practice one's religion), Article 26 (right of a community to manage their religious affairs) and Article 29 (protection of cultural rights of citizens) as well as on the basis of the argument that neither Hindu law nor Shariat allows for construction of mosques on sites of temples that were destroyed by invaders.The petitioners and Sangh Parivar have maintained that the Varanasi mosque was built after demolishing the legendary Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, site of one of the 12 Jyotirlings, and the Mathura Eidgah has come up on the birthplace of Lord Krishna.BJP's stand is interesting also because of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's caution that there was no need to look for temples under every mosque - a stand which has been rejected by prominent Hindu religious figures and appears to be at odds with Uttar Pradesh govt's effort to ""reclaim"" properties and temples belonging to Hindus which they were forced to abandon after losing many lives in the 1978 riots.""Congress consented to India's Partition along religious lines. Following this, it introduced the Waqf law, enabling Muslims to claim properties at will and establish mini-Pakistans across the country. It later enacted the Places of Worship Act, effectively denying Hindus the right to reclaim their historical and religious sites. Now, Congress has declared an open war against Hindus,"" Malviya said.Congress moved SC in support of the Places of Worship Act and said the law was ""essential to safeguard secularism in India"" which was a basic feature of the Constitution and was needed to ensure communal harmony .","Congress moving Supreme Court in support of Places of Worship Act is a declaration of ""open war against Hindus,"" says BJP.

NEW DELHI: A war of words erupted between the Aam Aadmi Party chief and the Bharatiya Janata Party shortly after the saffron party released its freebie packed manifesto for the upcoming Delhi elections.With the AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal calling out on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accept that free handouts are good for development to BJP chief Virendraa Sachdeva explaining the former difference between ""revadi and development"", the two parties attacked each other for resorting to appeasement politics.Targeting PM Modi, who has warned against ""revadi culture"" at several occasions, Arvind Kejriwal questioned BJP's free handout schemes announced in the manifesto.""...Today, BJP's national president announced that they too would offer 'free ki revri' like Kejriwal did...So, I would like to tell him - Prime Minister should come forward and announce specifically that he agrees with this and he should say that what Modi ji said earlier was wrong,"" he said.""PM Modi said so far that freebies are not good. He should now say that he was wrong and Kejriwal was right.

The drive to Lilavati

Saif’s kurta was soaked in blood

In the early hours of Thursday morning, a routine drive turned into a critical moment for 47-year-old auto-rickshaw driver Bhajan Singh Rana . He found himself transporting Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra following a stabbing incident at the actor's residence.Rana was near the Satguru Darshan building , where Saif resides, when he heard urgent calls for help. “I was driving my rickshaw and suddenly heard someone shouting, ‘Rickshaw ruko (stop the rickshaw),” Rana recalled.A woman and others flagged him down. “The person whose white kurta was soaked in blood got in the auto. I noticed he had neck and back injuries but did not see the hand injury,” he added. “At first, I thought it was a regular assault case,” he recalled.Saif, visibly injured, approached the rickshaw and entered. “He walked towards me himself and sat in the auto. He was in an injured state. A small child and one more person were with him,” said Rana.Despite stab wounds to his neck, back, and stomach, Saif remained composed. “He asked, ‘Kitna time lagega (How much time will it take to reach the hospital)?’” Rana recounted.Initially, the plan was to go to Holy Family Hospital, but the passengers decided on Lilavati Hospital instead. Rana drove swiftly, reaching the hospital in about 10 minutes. “I just took a U-turn and stopped the auto at the gate,” he said.Upon arrival, Saif revealed his identity. “It was only when we reached the hospital gate that he called the guard to fetch a stretcher, saying he was Saif Ali Khan,” said Rana.In his injured state, Saif refused to use a wheelchair. “A wheelchair was brought for him, but he refused to sit on it. Then stretchers were brought, and he lay down on one before being taken inside,” said Rana.Saif’s white kurta was soaked in blood, but he managed to walk on his own. “There were three people in total — Saif, a kid, and a young man. He seemed normal while I was taking him to the hospital,” Rana added.The journey ended around 3 am. “His white kurta turned red, and there was a lot of blood loss. Even after getting out of the rickshaw, he walked on his own. I didn’t take any fare,” he said.Rana admitted to feeling scared about the situation, fearing potential trouble. No police statement has been taken so far.","Auto-rickshaw driver Bhajan Singh Rana was transporting Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra.

To ensure transparency for both the victim and accused, Shah asked the police to provide information about individuals detained for interrogation, details of seizures made and cases sent to courts, on an electronic dashboard.While reviewing implementation of the three laws and current status of provisions related to police, prisons, courts, prosecution and forensics with the Madhya Pradesh chief minister in the presence of DGs of NCRB and BPRD, Shah called for 100% rollout of BNS, BNSS and BSA in the state at the earliest. He directed review of the progress on this front on a monthly basis by the chief minister, fortnightly basis by the chief secretary and on a weekly basis by the DGP.Shah stressed on initiation of ' trial in absentia ' in national security-related cases, against fugitives who have been absconding from the country for a long time. Section 355 and 356 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) allow trial and pronouncement of judgment in the absence of the accused in the interest of justice, which was not provided under the erstwhile Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).Shah noted during the review that the essence of the new criminal laws lies in the provision of delivering justice within three years, from the filing of an FIR till verdict of the Supreme Court.The home minister told Yadav that conversion of 'zero FIRs' into regular FIRs should be continuously monitored, and transfer of FIRs between two states ensured through CCTNS (crime and criminal tracking network & systems). Amit Shah added that at least one forensic science mobile van should be deployed in every district and adequate number of cubicles constructed in hospitals and jails to facilitate recording of evidence via video conferencing.Terming legal aid to poor undertrials as the govt's responsibility, Shah emphasised on the need for a robust legal aid system to ensure justice for the underprivileged, along with necessary training for this purpose.On the provisions for electronic evidence in the new laws, Shah suggested that the state's home and health departments provide post-mortem and other medical reports electronically.Union home minister also urged establishment of a system where officials from other states can visit Madhya Pradesh to understand the successful implementation of e-summons there.To upgrade its forensic capabilities, the home minister suggested that the state govt sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Forensic Science University to create adequate, trained forensic manpower.",Home minister Amit Shah held consultations with Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on the full rollout of new criminal laws.

MUMBAI: Nearly 48 hours after the incident, the intruder who attacked actor Saif Ali Khan and his domestic staff during a burglary attempt remained untraced. Teams formed by Bandra police and Mumbai Crime Branch were yet to disclose details about the investigation when reports last came in, but Maharashtra’s minister of state for home Yogesh Kadam ruled out involvement of organised gangs.Khan, who suffered stab wounds on his spine, neck, and hands, was “doing well” post-surgery, according to doctors.He walked around and ate regular meals at the hospital on Friday. He was moved from the ICU to a special room, said doctors. Depending on progress, he may be discharged on Monday.A suspect, who resembled the person seen in the CCTV grab at Khan’s apartment in Bandra, was picked up from south Mumbai. During interrogation it was found he was a drug abuser who was home at the time of the crime. He was released on Friday afternoon.At least 20 teams have been formed so far to trace the assailant. Several, including two carpenters who had carried out furniture work in the actor’s home two days ago, were questioned. Khan’s wife Kareena Kapoor gave her statement to police on Friday. Police are also tracking mobile data to check on the presence of new numbers in the locality at the time the incident occurred.Bandra police have registered the case based on the domestic help, Eliyamma Phillip’s statement. According to Philip, she was the first to spot the intruder near the room where the actor’s son was sleeping. She made sure the child was safe before confronting the man. Her screams alerted the others. During the confrontation with the burglar, despite being stabbed with a knife, Khan managed to gather everyone behind him in the corridor and pull the door of the room to trap him inside.An investigating officer said Khan managed to gather everyone behind him in the corridor and pulled the door of the room to trap the intruder inside, but in the commotion, failed to lock the door from outside. This helped the intruder escape when Khan, his wife, their children and the staff rushed out to get help.Police are not yet conclusive about the route taken by the intruder after leaving the building. Bandra police believe he took the fire escape stairwell to reach Khan's 11th floor residence. ""There's a second image of the intruder, his face covered with a mask. It was captured on the sixth floor. And after the attack, he left by the same route. His face was not covered while leaving the building,"" said a source.The intruder's image was captured only on the stairs in the building. There are not many CCTVs in the locality. The domestic help told police that there are no CCTVs on the floor leading to the actor's flat nor any inside the flat.""His arrest will tell us how he managed to enter the flat. If he used a tool to pick the door lock or take some other route to enter the toilet,"" said police.

Several clues emerged after a CCTV footage of the suspect was released with the investigators believing that the intruder may have changed clothes before escaping.""Police have formed 20 teams and launched a search for the accused,"" an official said.Meanwhile, the footage recorded at 2.33am reveals the young suspect's face. He is seen wearing a collared brown T-shirt and a red scarf while descending the stairs from the sixth floor. The actor resides on the 12th floor of the building.Police officials said that the intruder did not break into the actor's flat or force his way in, but likely sneaked in at some point during the night with the intention of committing a robbery.They have taken statements from nurse Eliyama Philip, the house staff, and the building guard, while also questioning additional individuals as part of their investigation.In her statement, Philip described how the intruder first entered the room of Saif and Kareena Kapoor-Khan's younger son, Jeh, demanding Rs 1 crore when confronted. As she attempted to protect the child, the man, armed with a wooden stick and a long Hexa blade, pushed her aside. Another nanny was also sleeping in the same room.Hearing Philip's screams, Khan and Kareena rushed out of their room, but the intruder, described by Philip as being between 35-40 years old, attacked Khan with a knife.

Opposition attacks government over 'law and order'

NEW DELHI: Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan, who sustained injuries during a violent break-in at his Bandra residence, has been shifted out of the ICU to a normal room at Lilavati Hospital.Dr Nitin Dange, chief neurosurgeon at the hospital, confirmed that Saif’s condition has improved significantly. He said,""Saif Ali Khan is better now. We made him walk, and he walked well. Looking at his parameters, his wounds and all the other injuries, he is safe to be shifted out of the ICU. He has to take several precautions. He has to take rest and his movement has been restricted for a week.""Dr Uttamani said that he was the doctor who met Saif within the first hour of his injury. He said, ""He had blood all over. But he walked in like a lion with his young child. He is a real hero. He is doing well currently."".Meanwhile, Mumbai Police informed that the person earlier brought to Bandra police station for questioning is not related to the Saif Ali Khan attack case. No one has been detained in Saif Ali Khan attack case asof now.Mumbai Police said that they have taken possession of the portion extracted from Saif Ali Khan’s back while a part of the blade is still to be recovered.Mumbai police have formed 20 teams to apprehend the intruder who attacked Saif at his Bandra apartment. Police are leveraging their network of informants and scrutinising CCTV footage from the building, which showed the assailant fleeing after the attack.Mumbai Police earlier disclosed that Saif’s residence lacked surveillance cameras, leaving investigators reliant on footage from the building’s common areas. The suspect’s image was captured on CCTV as he fled via a fire escape. Authorities suspect he entered through a duct, as there were no signs of forced entry.Philip, a house help employed by the family, recounted the terrifying ordeal. She awoke to find the attacker approaching the bed of Saif’s youngest son, Jeh. Attempting to intervene, she was injured in the scuffle. The intruder demanded Rs 1 crore, threatening violence. Hearing her screams, Saif and Kareena rushed out, leading to the violent confrontation.CCTV footage captured the suspect wearing a red scarf, t-shirt, jeans, and carrying a backpack. Police have described him as a slim man in his late 30s with a dark complexion. His movements were recorded as he fled down the building’s stairwell, even looking directly at the camera at one point.The incident occurred at around 2:30 am at Saif’s 11th-floor flat in the upscale ‘Satguru Sharan’ building. According to police, the attacker confronted a maid inside the residence before a violent altercation broke out. Saif, attempting to de-escalate the situation, was stabbed multiple times. The assailant fled the scene armed with a wooden stick and a long Hexa blade, which he used during the attack.The actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Doctors revealed that the attack caused a severe injury to Saif’s thoracic spinal cord, necessitating a procedure to remove a 2.5-inch knife lodged in his spine and to repair a leak in his spinal fluid. Although Saif is now out of danger, he remains under intensive care and close observation.Hours after the attack, Saif’s wife and actor Kareena Kapoor Khan described the incident as “incredibly challenging,” requesting privacy for her family.“We are still processing the events that have unfolded. The constant scrutiny is overwhelming and poses a significant risk to our safety. We kindly request the media and paparazzi to give us the space to heal,” the statement read.The attack has sparked a political outcry, with opposition leaders criticising the state government over deteriorating law and order. NCP leader Sharad Pawar said, “If celebrities are unsafe, what about common citizens?” Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal also extended his wishes for Saif’s recovery while calling for stronger measures to ensure public safety.","Saif Ali Khan has been shifted out of the ICU to a normal room at Lilavati Hospital.

His company Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) was later sold to JSW group for Rs 19,350 crore after banks filed applications under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to recover loans.The banks, after recovering Rs 19,350 crore, still suffered a loss of about Rs 28,000 crore. ""Accordingly, ED continued investigations for recovery of assets dissipated by erstwhile BPSL promoters. With the present provisional attachment of the house property at Amrita Shergill Marg, the total value of attachments done in this case is Rs 4,938 crore out of which Rs 4,025 crore stands restituted under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The investigating agency intends to restitute the remaining assets to the banks under the provisions of PMLA,"" the agency said.The property on Amrita Shergill Marg was owned by Aarti Singal, the then director of erstwhile BPSL. The ED said its investigations found that BPSL and its promoters diverted bank funds to private investments in the form of shares and properties. ""The books of accounts were fudged to show fake expenses/purchases/capital assets and thereby bank funds were taken out in the form of cash. Cash was also generated from out of book sales and the same was utilised for acquiring assets in the name of family members,"" the agency alleged.The unaccounted cash was then brought into the books of various beneficially owned benami companies held through employees/dummy directors and the same was utilised for investments in the form of shares and immovable properties.""The bank funds were dissipated towards acquisition of private assets and held in such a way that the banks should not be able to recover the loan amounts,"" the ED said.The main promoter Sanjay Singal was arrested by ED in Nov 2019 and a chargesheet has been filed against him and other key employees.

Supreme Court: PMLA accused in jail for over a yr without chargesheet can be given bail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-pmla-accused-in-jail-for-over-a-yr-without-chargesheet-can-be-given-bail/articleshow/117342491.cms,"Affidavit not vetted through proper channel, something ‘fishy’ in way it was filed, says ED

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday said an accused who had spent one year in jail and charges had still not been framed in the money laundering case against that person could be considered for bail as per its verdict in the Senthil Balaji case .SC has been granting bail to accused in money laundering cases after reading down the stringent bail provisions of PMLA by ruling that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds for grant of bail. But till now, it had not specified the period beyond which a PMLA accused could not be kept in custody. The time-frame of one year will help bring uniformity for courts to deal with bail pleas.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan clarified the one-year period while hearing the bail plea of Arun Pati Tripathi , an accused in the Chhattisgarh excise case who was arrested by ED on Aug 8 last year. As he has spent only around five months in custody, the court expressed reservation in granting bail.Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora and advocate Mohit D Ram, appearing for the accused, pleaded that he had actually spent 18 months in jail as Enforcement Directorate (ED) had taken him in custody in Aug and before that, he was in jail for a predicate offence. However, the bench said it could not be considered for grant of bail and agreed to examine the issue on Feb 5.The apex court's verdict in the Senthil Balaji case had held that stringent provisions such as Section 45(1)(iii) of PMLA could not become a tool to incarcerate accused without trial for an unreasonably long time and it did not confer power on the state to detain an accused for a prolonged period.The hearing witnessed an unexpected turn at the outset as additional solicitor general S V Raju, appearing for ED, told the bench that an affidavit filed by the agency in court was not vetted through the proper channel. He said there was something ""fishy"" in the way the affidavit was filed and asked the ED director to hold an inquiry.The court expressed surprise that the agency could disown its own affidavit and questioned the role of the advocate-on-record through whom documents are filed in SC. However, the senior law officer clarified that the AoR filed what he was given by the department and the fault lay within the agency. The court thereafter asked ED's AoR to appear before it.Later, Raju said while the person handling filing work, being new to the job, may not have followed the procedure fully, the affidavit contained all valid arguments and grounds. The ASG and solicitor general Tushar Mehta gave a clean chit to the AoR.","SC has been granting bail to accused in money laundering cases.

NEW DELHI: Highlighting the potential of the middle class and youth in fuelling car sales, PM Narendra Modi on Friday asked the auto industry to focus on both ""economy and ecology"" as he sought to push green mobility through electrics, hydrogen fuel cells , and biofuels .Inaugurating the second edition of Bharat Mobility Global Expo , Modi told industry players they should not only make in India for the domestic market but also look to export across the globe. ""Our mobility solutions should be common, connected, convenient, congestion-free, charged, clean and cutting-edge. Our focus on green mobility is part of this vision,"" Modi said, with auto industry CEOs in attendance.His pitch was also linked to India's economic strategy. ""We are building a mobility system that supports both economy and ecology. A system that reduces our import bill of fossil fuels. Therefore, we are focused on development of green technologies such as EVs, hydrogen fuel and biofuels,"" the PM said.Modi said govt has been pushing the sales of EVs with its focus on promoting sustainable solutions. ""We are constantly taking policy decisions to expand electric mobility in the country, (and) supporting the industry."" The PM said campaigns like National Electric Mobility Mission and Green Hydrogen Mission were initiated with these goals in mind.He said various measures have resulted in giving a push to sales of EVs.""For the last few years, India has witnessed rapid growth in electric mobility. In the last decade, electric vehicle sales have increased 640 times. Ten years ago, only around 2,600 electric vehicles were sold in a year, but in 2024, more than 16.8 lakh vehicles were sold. That is, today twice as many electric vehicles are being sold in a single day as were sold in a whole year 10 years ago. It is estimated that by the end of this decade, the number of electric vehicles in India can increase up to 8 times. This shows how much the possibilities are increasing for you.""Speaking about the demand in the automobile sector, he said that a young population will fuel the demand for new vehicles. ""Needs and aspirations are very important for the development of the auto industry. And fortunately, both are vibrant in India today. India is going to remain the youngest country in the world for the next several decades. This youth is your biggest customer.""He said that the middle class is another key enabler for sales. ""In the last 10 years, 25 crore Indians have come out of poverty. This neo middle class is buying its first vehicle. As progress happens, they will also upgrade their vehicles. And the auto sector is sure to benefit from this.""He said the auto industry grew by 12% last year. ""India's largest youth population, the ever-growing scope of the middle class, rapid urbanisation, modern infrastructure being built in India, affordable vehicles from Make in India, all these factors are going to push the growth of the auto sector in India, are going to give it new strength.""He said exports are also increasing. ""The population of many countries of the world is not as much as the number of vehicles being sold in India every year. Nearly 2.5 crore vehicles being sold in a year. It shows how the demand is constantly increasing. This shows why India is being looked up to with so much hope when it comes to the future of mobility.""The PM said govt is focused to deal with the challenge of global warming and climate change, and thus is promoting solar power and alternative fuel.""India has emphasised a lot on a green future during its G-20 presidency. Today, along with EV, work is going on at a very large level regarding solar power in India...

No import allowed of refurbished medical devices: Regulator,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-import-allowed-of-refurbished-medical-devices-regulator/articleshow/117341984.cms,"Poll Do You Believe Refurbished Devices Can Maintain Quality? No, They Lack Reliability Yes, With Proper Regulations

NEW DELHI: Import of second-hand or refurbished medical devices is not allowed, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has said. In a letter sent to the office of the principal commissioner of Customs recently, it has asked Customs dept to not release such devices from the port of entry.The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, said there is no specific provision for regulation of refurbished medical devices under the Medical Devices Rule, 2017.Hence, it said, no licence is issued for import of such devices, and it cannot be imported into the country for sale and distribution.While proponents of this policy said import of refurbished equipment help keep cost of care in check, those against it are of the view that the policy poses serious risks to patient safety and reliability of the tests performed.According to the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry , nearly 60% of the Rs 40,000 crore of imports of medical electronic equipment is estimated to be of pre-owned equipment. ""A stop to import of refurbished medical equipment is a true policy intervention that will guard domestic industry against dumping of equipment with uncertain quality and will help patients in receiving appropriate medical care. This is a welcome and much awaited long due intervention,"" said MD of AMTZ, Visakhapatnam, Dr Jitendra Sharma.Founder-partner of City Imaging & Clinical Labs, Dr Aakaar Kapoor, said refurbished machines have significant concerns regarding radiation emissions, which can pose harm to patients. The newer imaging systems are designed to emit significantly lower radiation, addressing concerns around exposure during scans, Kapoor added.While med-tech companies favoured the move, saying it would promote local manufacturing and the use of updated machines, hospitals and diagnostic facilities said it could increase investment and, therefore, the cost of care. ""Cost of imaging tests is lower in India as compared to developed nations. One of the reasons behind this is the utilisation of refurbished machines. Instead of banning their use, govt should bring in regulations to ensure that devices are up to date,"" said the owner of a Delhi hospital .",The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has asked Customs dept to not release such devices from the port of entry.

Paradise to peril

Coastal crisis deepens

Beachcombing was synonymous with Sujith's childhood in the sun-kissed shores of Shankumugham in Thiruvananthapuram. The beach was a magnet for family gatherings for shindigs on a sprawling stretch of ochre sand. The Indian Coffee House was an added bonus.The lapping of waves against Kerala 's sandy shores once promised timeless beauty, often the backdrop of postcards and a favoured retreat for travellers.Fast forward to 2025, and the state's idyllic beaches are under siege, with Shankumugham shrinking to a mere patch in 30 years since Sujith's playtime days.Today, these shores tell a tale of relentless erosion, rising sea levels, the ravages of sand mining, and communities struggling to hold onto their seafront homes. Over 55% of Kerala's 590km coastline is now ""vulnerable to erosion"".Two major studies in recent years, one by the National Centre for Coastal Research and another by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), have painted a stark picture of Kerala's coastal future.According to INCOIS, more than 300km of the state's coastline fall into high and medium vulnerability categories, with some areas experiencing erosion at rates as high as six metres a year. This rapid erosion threatens not only the natural landscape but the livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3 million people spread across nine coastal districts.In regions like Kannur, Kochi, Alappuzha, and Kasaragod, the encroaching sea is a daily reminder of vulnerability. Beaches in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Malappuram, and parts of Thrissur have already vanished or are in the process of disappearing.This accelerating loss is exacerbated by the warming Arabian Sea, which has led to an increase in cyclonic events and sea surges, particularly from May to Aug, with a peak in June and July.The human cost of this environmental crisis is immense. Many coastal communities have been displaced, their homes swallowed by the sea, leaving behind a trail of economic and emotional distress.For as long as anyone can remember, fishing communities along Alappuzha's coast have lived by the saying ""Kadalamma chatikkilla"" - the sea mother won't deceive. But as the shoreline erodes, that ancient faith is faltering. Sand mining, the silent thief, has stripped the beaches, forcing many to abandon their ancestral homes. Over 600 houses have crumbled into the sea's maw, and poverty grips the fisherfolk tighter each day.""I know no life but fishing,"" said Kalesh, a fisherman from near Thottappally harbour, watching the sea that once nurtured his community now gnaw at it. His parents live next door in a house built after the 2004 tsunami swept away their old one, but even this home bears the scars of erosion.""The catch has dwindled,"" Kalesh's mother Sura said. ""And there's no beach left to haul our boat ashore."" Their blue boat rests awkwardly in their yard, a silent testament to the changing tides.K C Sreekumar from Alappad recalled a time when the coastal stretch from Azheekkal to Vellanathuruth spanned 89sq km in 1955. By 2004, it had shrunk to a mere 7sq km. The once-thriving Alappad market, where small ships anchored, is now a shadow of its former self, as the sea continues its relentless advance.Many families have been forced to relocate, some never returning to their original homes. Others, constrained by financial limitations or fear of starting anew elsewhere, have chosen to stay, clinging to what remains of their lives along the coast.Businesses dependent on tourism are struggling to stay afloat. Aneesh, who runs Jeevan Beach Resort in Kovalam, said: ""Earlier, the beach had a width of 30m. Now, it is only 10m and hasn't been restored fully for the past two years. It affected the inflow of tourists, especially foreigners. Now, they come and check out the very next day. Earlier, they used to stay here for three months. Kovalam has lost its glory.""The waves have ""swallowed the walkway"" and tourists are vanishing, leaving local business owners like Senthil K, Jose Franklyn and Biju to struggle with plummeting sales. ""My sales have dropped by 70%,"" souvenir shop owner Senthil said. The once ""vibrant spot"" is now deserted, prompting desperate calls for urgent govt action to ""save the beach and our businesses"".Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) recently highlighted the scale of the crisis. From 2012 to 2021, the state experienced 223 sea surge events, with Alappuzha facing the highest number at 105, followed by Ernakulam (64) and Thrissur (54).Central Kerala, the hub of marine trade and tourism, is particularly vulnerable, experiencing an average of 12 hazard events for every 10km. Areas such as Eriyad, Azhikode, Chellanam, Ambalappuzha, Purakkad, Kuzhupilly, and Vadanapilly are now categorised as high-hazard zones due to a combination of sea surge inundation, sea-level rise, and severe erosion.""South and central Kerala are more susceptible because of their sandy coasts, unlike the rocky shores in the north,"" said Girish Gopinath, head of climate variability and aquatic ecosystems at KUFOS.The primary reasons cited for these changes are inadequate scientific planning of coastal infrastructure and the effects of climate change.More than 50% of Kerala's coastline is lined with artificial structures such as groynes, various types of seawalls and fishing harbours, in addition to ports. Groynes typically consist of wooden or concrete barriers, built perpendicular to a shoreline to prevent erosion, trap sand, and protect beaches from the impact of waves and tides.However, such structures have proved counter-productive, particularly in the south, where sediments are often washed away by littoral currents that flow parallel to a shoreline. According to Gopinath, this structural interference with natural sediment flows has intensified erosion, leaving areas like Cherthala and Ponnani exposed to the sea's relentless encroachment.""There is a phenomenon where seawater overtops into the shore, bringing with it large amounts of sediment. Unfortunately, due to choked and encroached canals, there is no way for the water and mud to flow back, exacerbating the problem,"" he said.Kerala University geology professor E Shaji pointed to the acute shortage of sediment supply from rivers, exacerbated by dredging, sand mining and sediment trapping by dams, as a major contributor to the problem. ""It would take at least five years to revive a beach,"" he said.As Kerala battles against nature and neglect, experts agree that an aggressive coastal management plan is critical. Without swift and coordinated action, the state's once-pristine beaches could be lost to history.Senior scientist K K Ramachandran emphasised the need for precise and up-to-date data to guide coastal development and conservation, ensuring that interventions are based on accurate tracking of erosion and accretion. ""Only a handful of projects use the latest data. We require a year's worth of data before proceeding with building any structures,"" said consultant at National Centre for Earth Science Studies.(Inputs from M K Sunil Kumar, T C Sreemol, Jaikrishnan Nair, Krishnachand K)","Erosion threatens livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3m across 9 Kerala coastal dists.

Delivering the judgment on Wednesday, Justice Urmila Joshi-Phalke discharged the accused, Vaibhav Mawale , who was charged after his former partner died by suicide in 2020.The case involved the suicide of a woman from Buldhana district , allegedly driven by the accused's decision to end their nine-year relationship. A suicide note left by the deceased detailed her emotional distress and the accused's refusal to marry her. Following this, the woman's father lodged a complaint, and a case of abetment of suicide was registered against Mawale under Section 306 IPC .The court, however, dismissed the allegations, observing evidence did not support the charge. Justice Joshi-Phalke stated the relationship ended in July 2020, while she died by suicide five months later. The judge emphasised the ""temporal gap between the two events negated any proximate connection between the accused's actions and victim's decision to take her life.""Justice Joshi-Phalke observed, ""Mere refusal to marry, even after a prolonged relationship, cannot be construed as abetment of suicide unless there's concrete evidence of instigation or intentional aid to commit the act.""The judgment clarified that emotional distress resulting from a breakup, while unfortunate, cannot automatically translate into criminal liability. The judge added that evidence indicated the woman remained in contact with the accused after their breakup, further weakening the claim of provocation.","Vaibhav Mawale was charged after his former partner died by suicide in 2020.

They, however, seem to have been followed more in the breach. Section 306 IPC appears to be casually and too readily resorted to by the police. While the persons involved in genuine cases where the threshold is met should not be spared, the provision should not be deployed against individuals only to assuage the immediate feelings of the distraught family of the deceased,"" Justice Viswanathan, who penned the verdict for the bench, said.

It is time investigating agencies are sensitised to the law laid down by this court under Section 306 so that persons are not subjected to the abuse of process of a totally untenable prosecution. Trial courts also should exercise great caution and circumspection and should not adopt a play it safe syndrome by mechanically framing charges, even if the investigating agencies in a given case have shown utter disregard for the ingredients of Section 306,"" the bench said.Referring to earlier verdicts of the apex court, the bench said the intention of the accused to aid or to instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide was a must for attracting Section 306. It also said a word uttered in a fit of anger and emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow could not be said to be instigation.""In order to bring a case within the purview of Section 306 IPC there must be a case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of abetment by the person charged with the said offence must be proved and established by the prosecution before he could be convicted under Section 306 IPC,"" it said.The court passed the order while discharging a person and noted that exchanges between the accused and the deceased were heated but it wasn't with intent to leave the deceased with no other option but to commit suicide.

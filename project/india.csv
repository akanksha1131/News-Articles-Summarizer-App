Details to follow...

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has announced plans to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls across the country. In an order dated June 24, the poll stated it is undertaking the revision as part of its constitutional duty to safeguard the integrity of the voter lists.""The Commission has now decided to begin the Special Intensive Revision in the entire country for the discharge of its constitutional mandate to protect the integrity of electoral rolls,"" the order read.""Maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll is fundamental for the conduct of free and fair elections; the electoral machinery, eligibility conditions, manner and procedure for preparation of electoral rolls are provided under the RPA 1950 and the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960 (""RER, 1960""), framed under the RPA 1950,"" the order read.The detailed schedule for the nationwide exercise will be released in due course, the Commission added.The announcement comes amidst uproar by the Opposition over SIR in Bihar. Former Bihar deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav has on several instances slammed the process and has hinted at boycotting the upcoming polls in the state.The chaos has also reached the Parliament with the protests disrupting the proceedings of the monsoon session for four straight days.The Election Commission had earlier said that the revision aims to remove duplicate and ineligible voters, especially those registered at both permanent and current addresses. Migrants need not worry—descendants of voters listed in 2003 require no ancestry proof.","The Election Commission has announced plans to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls across the country.

"Operation Sindoor: Govt says strike was 'measured, non-escalatory’; ceasefire held after Pakistan reached out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-govt-says-strike-was-measured-non-escalatory-ceasefire-held-after-pakistan-reached-out/articleshow/122894077.cms,"Kirti Singh (left), parliament (ANI, PTI)

The ministry of external affairs on Thursday informed Parliament that Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation to ""barbaric"" assault carried out by ""Pakistan-sponsored terrorists,"" and with the aim to destroy terrorist infrastructure and eliminate terrorists who were believed to be preparing to infiltrate into India.Ministry of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh,in a written response to questions asked in Rajya Sabha also said India's actions were ""focussed, measured and non-escalatory"".Samajwadi party MP Ramji Lal Suman, asked the ministry of external affairs whether Operation Sindoor was launched “under international pressure,” and the “factual position” in the same.He also went on to ask about the possible impact on the morale of armed forces in the view of ""sudden announcement of ceasefire in Operation Sindoor,"" while the Indian military was ""achieving significant success"", but suddenly ""declaring ceasefire was against their morale and the sentiments of the people of the country"".Union MOS Singh in his response said, Operation Sindoor was launched to a ""barbaric cross-border terror attack"" by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. It focussed on dismantling terrorist infrastructure and neutralising terrorists likely to be sent across to India"".He added, although India’s response was “focused, measured, and non-escalatory,”but “Pakistan, however, attempted targeting Indian civilian areas, in addition to some military facilities.""These provocations and escalatory actions by Pakistan were met with a strong and decisive response from the Indian armed forces, inflicting significant damage on the Pakistani military. Subsequently, on 10 May, 2025, the director general of military operations of Pakistan approached his Indian counterpart to request for cessation of firing and military activities, which was agreed to later that day,"" the statement read.As part of Operation Sindoor, India destroyed nine terrorist camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) through precise pre-dawn strikes on May 7. The operation was launched to avenge the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam.In response to a question on whether India had attempted to ""alienate"" Pakistan internationally, the MEA clarified that the selection of chairs and vice-chairs for UN security council bodies is part of its routine annual process.For 2025, Pakistan, along with Russia and France, has been appointed a vice-chair of the UN counter terrorism committee. Singh noted that India had chaired this committee in both 2011-12 and 2022.He stated, ""the government of India has been sensitising all concerned interlocutors on the menace of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan. Due to India’s persistent efforts, the global community has a greater understanding of India’s concerns on cross-border terrorism.""These efforts, he added, have led to the listing of several Pakistan-based terrorists under the UNSC 1267 sanctions committee and contributed to Pakistan’s FATF grey listing. The UNSC also ""strongly condemned"" the Pahalgam terror attack and stressed accountability for its perpetrators.MOS added, several world leaders have backed India’s counter-terrorism efforts post-Pahalgam, with the US recently designating The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, as a foreign terrorist organisation.Responding to a separate query about if the government has ""formally raised concerns"" with the US over ongoing military aid and arms supplies to Pakistan that could be ""misused against India"", Singh in a written response said that India had ""formally raised concerns"" with the US over its military aid to Pakistan and monitors all regional security developments closely.He stated, ""India has consistently conveyed its concerns in this regard to the United States, with a view to ensuring that these developments do not compromise India's security or regional stability.""Reiterating India’s stance, he said Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh ""are, have been, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India.""On India-US counter-terrorism cooperation, he added, ""counter-terrorism remains a vital pillar of the India-US comprehensive global strategic partnership,"" with both countries working closely on designations, legal assistance, and extraditions.","Ministry of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said India's actions were ""focussed, measured and non-escalatory"" Samajwadi party MP Ramji Lal Suman asked whether Operation Sindoor was launched “under international pressure,” and the “factual position” in the same.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122894205,imgsize-1429319,width-400,resizemode-4/122894205.jpg"

Jeju Air Crash: Pilots shut off wrong engine; probe finds clear evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/jeju-air-crash-pilots-shut-off-wrong-engine-probe-finds-clear-evidence/articleshow/122811341.cms,"



South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike, a source familiar with the probe said on Monday.The investigation, led by South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), has found that the left engine, which was less damaged, was shut off instead of the right engine, which had been more seriously affected by the bird strike.The source told Reuters that cockpit voice recordings, computer data, and a physical engine switch recovered from the wreckage support this conclusion.""The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,"" the source said, speaking anonymously as the official report has not yet been released.The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operating a flight from Bangkok, crashed while attempting to land at Muan Airport on 29 December 2024. Of the 181 people on board, only two survived, making it the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.An examination of the recovered engines confirmed there were no defects before the bird strike and the crash, according to a government source.Investigators reportedly shared these findings with the victims' families during a private briefing on Saturday.A third source, who was present at the meeting, said the families were told the right engine had suffered greater damage, but the left, less-damaged, engine was shut down instead.The ARAIB has not officially commented on the findings. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, directed queries to ARAIB. Engine manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran, has not responded to requests for comment.Jeju Air said it is actively cooperating with the investigation and is awaiting the official release of the results.While a preliminary report issued in January confirmed the presence of duck remains in both engines, it did not specify the extent of damage. A scheduled media briefing on Saturday was cancelled after victims’ families objected to the report being made public, saying it unfairly focused on pilot error and failed to consider other factors.The Jeju Air flight overshot the runway during an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment. The collision caused a fire and a partial explosion, Reuters reported.Victims’ families and the pilots’ union have urged the investigation team to also examine the embankment’s role in the severity of the crash. Aviation experts believe the structure may have contributed to the high death toll.The pilots’ union has criticised ARAIB for “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine, even though bird remains were found in both engines. The union accused the investigators of making the pilots scapegoats and not providing enough scientific evidence to prove the aircraft could have landed safely with just the left engine running.The union also said the investigation has so far failed to address possible organisational responsibility. A group representing the bereaved families added that the language in the planned press release made it appear as if a final conclusion had already been reached. They have called for all facts surrounding the crash to be fully examined and clarified.Under international aviation rules, a final accident report is expected within a year of the incident.","South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike.

NEW DELHI: Just three days after Jagdeep Dhankhar created a flutter by quitting as vice president on health grounds, political circles appear to have settled into its ""business-as-usual"" rhythm. As govt and opposition trade volleys over a whole range of issues, with the usual routine of ""disruptions"" in Parliament proceedings thrown in, few seem to be lamenting the absence of the loquacious former Rajya Sabha chairman.The anger in the governing quarters with him for accepting opposition-sponsored motions for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma has given way to preoccupation with who gets to succeed him as VP. Opposition, even as it leverages the dramatic episode to seek to embarrass the government, is not mourning his abrupt exit, leaving the former VP marooned in a political no man's land.At an informal meeting of INDIA bloc parties, Rahul Gandhi and other participants are known to have argued with Dhankhar, who allegedly ""tormented"" them during his three year-tenure by his ""partisanship"".As they agitate over revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, the former VP hardly seems to be a hot priority for Parliament's monsoon session, relegating the resignation saga to the bottom of their list of priorities with a handful of opposition members being sympathetic to him.NDA parties have maintained, barring PM Narendra Modi's curt post on X, a ""radio silence"" over Dhankhar's impending departure from the Vice President's Enclave. They did not even share PM Modi's "" Dhankhar ji has got many opportunities to serve the country in various capacities, including as vice president of India. Wishing him good health"", X post.While govt officials are exploring a Type-VIII bungalow to shift Dhankhar, the developments preceding his resignation suggest that he was left with no choice but to quit as BJP and its allies were preparing to bring a no-confidence motion against him a day after he accepted the notice against Justice Varma signed by 63 opposition MPs.Sources said that the way Dhankhar accepted opposition's notice against Justice Varma even after govt had decided to bring the motion in LS with the signature of members from all parties, top members of the governing alliance were perturbed and angry and responded to the ""betrayal"" by rushing to collect signatures of MPs in the Parliament office of defence minister Rajnath Singh to bring a no-confidence motion against Dhankhar in Rajya Sabha the next day. no confidence motion against the VP can be passed with a simple majority and NDA has more than the required numbers.Sources suggested a message was conveyed to Dhankhar by an RS secretariat functionary Monday that ""either quit immediately, else face no confidence motion next day."" Instead of confronting, Dhankhar reached the Rashtrapati Bhawan, handed over his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu and made it public through a post on X.After accepting opposition MPs' signed letter against Justice Varma and passing a ruling from the chair, Dhankhar had become ""inaccessible"" to the senior government functionaries who tried to reach him, leading them to to skip the evening BAC meeting.Sources said the notice of LS MPs seeking removal of Justice Varma was given to speaker Om Birla by a delegation of MPs led by senior BJP functionary Ravi Shankar Prasad, who scrambled after getting to know that Dhankhar had opened channels with the opposition MPs seeking a notice in the case from them.","Political circles appear to have settled into its ""business-as-usual"" rhythm.

Any departure from this standard, even in the name of reform or adolescent autonomy, would amount to rolling back decades of progress in child protection law, and undermine the deterrent character of laws like Pocso Act , 2012, and BNS,"" it said.Centre said the constitutional framework unequivocally supported the legal presumption that a person below 18 years of age was incapable of giving valid and informed consent to sexual activity. ""Loosening age-based protections could open avenues for abuse (rape) under the guise of consensual (sexual) activity,"" it said.In a comprehensive written submission settled by additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, the Centre detailed how the age of consent increased from 10 years in Indian Penal Code, 1860; to 12 years under the Age of Consent Act, 1891; 14 years in an amendment to IPC in 1925 and Sharda Act (Child Marriage Restraint law) of 1929; to 16 years in a 1940 amendment to IPC and 18 years in 1978 through amendment to Child Marriage Restraint Act which has remained in force till date.""The age of consent under Indian law, fixed at 18 years, represents a carefully considered legislative choice aimed at creating a non-negotiable protective framework for children. This flows from the inherent protection provided to children envisaged under the Constitution of India,"" govt said.It added that the judiciary, on a case-by-case basis, could exercise discretion, including the close-in-age exception for those nearing 18 years and engaged in adolescence romance. ""The legislative framework governing child sexual offences, particularly under Pocso Act, 2012, is premised not only on the vulnerability of the child due to age, but also on the recognition that a majority of such offences are committed by persons within the child's immediate environment of trust, including family members, neighbours, caregivers and teachers. Such perpetrators have a strong influence on the authority and agency of the minors,"" Centre said.It said data collated by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and NGOs like Save the Children and HAQ Centre for Child Rights, indicated that over 50% of sexual offences against children were perpetrated by persons known to the child or those who were trusted by the minors.Lowering the age of consent from 18 years, under the guise of adolescent romance, would be legally unsound and provide a defence to the abusers, who exploit the minor's emotional dependence or silence, govt said.""A child's inability to report or resist is exacerbated when the perpetrator is a parent or close family member. In such cases, presenting 'consent' as a defence only victimises the child, shifts the blame onto them, and undermines the very object of Pocso Act to protect children from exploitation regardless of whether they were 'willing,"" it said.Govt said the existing age of consent (18 years) must not be tinkered with by the court as it was specified in several legislations to ""protect the bodily integrity of children and uphold the constitutional and statutory safeguards accorded to them"".",Union government tells Supreme Court that the age of consent for sex cannot be lowered from 18 years.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented a tree sapling to King Charles III during a visit to the monarch’s Sandringham Estate on Thursday, as part of his “Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam” initiative promoting environmental consciousness in tribute to mothers.The Buckingham Palace confirmed the meeting in a statement, noting that “during their time together, His Majesty was given a tree to be planted this Autumn, inspired by the environmental initiative launched by the Prime Minister.”Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the sapling will be planted on the estate during the upcoming planting season. The gifted tree, a Davidia involucrata ‘Sonoma’, commonly known as the Sonoma dove tree, is an ornamental species admired for its early and abundant flowering. Its distinctive white bracts resemble fluttering handkerchiefs or doves, making it a visual spectacle in late spring.PM Modi and King Charles are known to share a long-standing interest in holistic approaches to environmentalism, with Yoga and Ayurveda expected to have figured in their conversation.The royal audience came after Prime Minister Modi and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer met at Chequers, where the two leaders finalised the much-anticipated India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA).The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) aims to boost bilateral trade and investment.“At Chequers, PM Keir Starmer and I saw an exhibition which gave a glimpse of the strong economic linkages between India and the UK.

"India develops personnel sphere, completes welding on submersible after 700 trials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-develops-personnel-sphere-completes-welding-on-submersible-after-700-trials/articleshow/122867246.cms,"MATSYA-6000

NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement for India’s Deep Ocean Mission, Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000, designed to carry humans up to 6,000 metres (6km) below the ocean surface, by completing a critical welding process after 700 weld trials.‘Samudrayaan', a project under the Deep Ocean Mission of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), aims to strengthen India’s capabilities in deep-sea exploration. The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), under MoES, collaborated with Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) to design and fabricate the spherical crew compartment. The Deep Ocean mission will allow scientists to explore unexplored deep-sea areas, assess mineral resources like nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements, and study marine biodiversity. The mission is expected to be realised by 2026.Central to the Samudrayaan effort is the creation of a human occupied vehicle (HOV) that can withstand extreme pressure and temperature conditions on the seafloor. “At the heart of the HOV is a titanium personnel sphere, a 2,260mm diameter enclosure with 80mm thick walls, made from a high-strength alloy. Designed by VSSC, the sphere is built to endure pressure up to 600 bar and temperatures as low as -3°C,” Isro said Wednesday.One of the biggest challenges scientists faced in creating this weld lay in the properties of titanium as a metal. While titanium is known for its strength, it can be difficult to weld. The technical challenge was developing a reliable electron beam welding process capable of fusing thick (80-102 mm) titanium plates. Isro’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Bengaluru, took charge of augmenting its welding facility from a 15kW to a 40kW EBW capacity.LPSC developed the process and infrastructure for the welding process and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). While LPSC had the expertise to carry out welding up to 20mm thickness, it augmented the EBW machine from a 15kW rating to 40kW, while also making alterations to the chemical cleaning and handling equipment to accommodate the increased size and mass.Over 700 weld trials were conducted to optimise the process parameters, ensuring high quality and structural integrity. For quality assurance, Isro enhanced its X-ray radiography capability, one of the highest energy levels used in India, allowing detailed non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of the welded joints.The breakthrough came with the successful completion of the first high-penetration weld on the actual sphere hardware. This involved 80mm thick welds over a 7,100mm length, achieved in a continuous 32-minute operation, “a national first in scale and precision” as per Isro.The milestone marks a significant leap for India’s underwater exploration ambitions and brings Matsya-6000 closer to sea trials. Once complete, the vehicle will be among the very few human submersibles in the world capable of reaching such depths, opening new frontiers for deep sea science, resource exploration and technology development.","Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly raised issues like the need to shun double standards on terrorism, presence of Indian economic offenders in the UK and Khalistan extremism in his meeting with counterpart Keir Starmer, saying those who use democratic freedom to undermine democracy must be held accountable.Thanking Starmer for his strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, Modi said that the two leaders were united in their view that there can be no place for double standards in the fight against terrorism.Modi also said that Indian and British agencies would work together for the extradition of economic offenders, in what was seen as a clear message to fugitives such as Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi and Sanjay Bhandari that government intends to get them back to face legal action in the country.Although government has got assistance, Mallya and Nirav Modi have been seeking to prolong their stay in the UK by using multiple forums for appeal.While the formalisation of India-UK free trade agreement was the highlight of Modi's visit to the UK, another significant takeaway was the launch of a Vision 2035 roadmap for boosting ties in areas like defence, technology, education, clean energy and people-to-people contacts.The leaders adopted a blueprint for defence industrial cooperation to promote, as the Indian government said, collaboration in co-design, co-development and co-production of defence products to meet the growing demand in both countries as well as for the world market.On the issue of Khalistan extremism, which he was expected to raise with Starmer, Modi said there was agreement between India and the UK that forces with extremist ideologies must not be allowed to misuse democratic freedoms. ""Those who misuse democratic freedoms to undermine democracy itself must be held to account,"" said the PM, in his joint press statement with the UK PM.""On the matter of extradition of economic offenders as well, our agencies will continue to work together in close coordination and cooperation,"" added Modi, who sought the UK's cooperation in bringing the fugitives to justice. India and the UK also reached an agreement between the CBI and the UK's National Crime Agency to jointly fight organised crime.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said that the leaders committed to strengthen the global fight against terrorism. ""While noting that extremism and radicalisation pose threat to both societies, they agreed to further enhance bilateral cooperation to deal with the menace,"" said the official.Modi said that Vision 2035 will serve as a roadmap for a strong, trusted, and ambitious partnership in the areas of technology, defence, climate, education, and people-to-people connectivity. ""It is our commitment that, from AI to critical minerals, semiconductors to cyber security, we shall create the future together,"" he said, while inviting Starmer to visit India soon. Starmer accepted the invitation. Amid concerns over the erratic US trade policies, both sides also sought to promote a fair, non-discriminatory and inclusive trading system.According to the roadmap, India and the UK reaffirmed their shared commitment to a rules-based international order and to strengthening multilateralism through meaningful reform. Importantly for India, the roadmap focuses on reform of the United Nations, including the security council, and other multilateral institutions such as the Commonwealth, WTO, WHO, IMF, and the World Bank, ensuring these bodies ""reflect contemporary global realities and are equipped to address emerging challenges"".","India, UK unveil road map to boost defence, tech, energy ties.

Skylight Hospitality, a firm in which Vadra held 99% shares, purchased land measuring 3.5 acres worth crores of rupees.The sale deed falsely declared that Rs 7.5 crore had been paid, when in reality no payment was made as the cheque was never cashed. The money was paid at a later stage to avoid stamp duty, and this was corroborated by key witnesses, the counsel submitted.The land was later sold to DLF for a higher amount, and this aspect was still being scrutinised, ED told the court. The central probe agency further argued that money laundering and enjoyment of proceeds of crime continued even today.The ED chargesheet, filed on July 17, names 11 individuals and entities as accused, including Vadra, his company Skylight Hospitality, Onkareshwar Properties — which sold the land to Vadra’s firm — and its promoters/directors Satyanand Yajee & K S Virk.",ED: It’s a ‘clear and classic case of money laundering’ as proceeds of crime were used to acquire immovable properties.

She lodged a complaint at the Sankarapuram police station claiming Arivazhagi, the president of S Sellampattu panchayat, along with her husband and others, unlawfully entered her house with the intention of grabbing her land and assaulted her and her son. Since no action was taken on the complaint, Lakshmi moved HC seeking a transfer of the probe to a different agency.When the case came up for hearing in HC, the petitioner's advocate pointed out the prosecutor had previously stated the complainant, who was injured in the assault, was discharged from hospital on July 3. Based on this information, the Kallakurichi principal sessions court granted anticipatory bail to the accused. However, the complainant submitted that she was discharged from hospital only on July 9.The director of prosecution submitted before HC that the prosecution had informed the sessions court that the victim was discharged from hospital on July 3 based on information provided by the investigating officer, a point reiterated by the government prosecutor. Recording the submissions, Justice Velmurugan directed Irusan Poonguzhali, principal sessions judge of Kallakurichi, to appear before HC on July 28 along with relevant documents and provide an explanation about the grant of anticipatory bail to the accused.","Madras high court on Thursday summoned the principal sessions judge of Kallakurichi to explain the grant of anticipatory bail to an accused in an attempt to murder case.

NEW DELHI: Early on Thursday, the ED swooped in on more than 35 premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani and at least 50 entities associated with his Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) across Mumbai in a larger money laundering investigation targeted at him based on multiple FIRs registered by CBI and other agencies over the last few years. The searches have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off.The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years. A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.Sources said ED was probing an alleged loan fraud ofRs 14,000 crore involving Reliance Communications Ltd and other associated entities. In response to a question in Lok Sabha on Monday, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said SBI has ""classified Reliance Communications Ltd along with promoter director Anil Ambani as 'fraud' on June 13"".This has also been communicated to Bombay Stock Exchange.""Based on information received from Sebi, ED has found Reliance Infra has diverted large sums of money disguised as ICDs to group companies of ADAG (Anil Ambani group) through 'C Company', an undisclosed related company,"" a source told TOI.Reliance Infra did not disclose 'C Company' as its related party in order to avoid having to take proper approval from shareholder and audit committees, the source added. It was also hidden presumably to circumvent checks and balances imposed on related party transactions as per laws.Besides, there is an investigation in the alleged diversion of loans of over Rs 10,000 crore by Reliance Infra. ED's probe is looking at why Reliance Infra took a haircut of Rs 5,480 crore, receiving only Rs 4 crore in cash, while agreeing to settle the remaining Rs 6,499 crore through transfer to certain discoms, which have neither been operational nor done business for many years.The agency is already probing Ambani and his entities in a case of Rs 3,000 crore received from Yes Bank where he is alleged to have bribed the former CEO of the bank, Rana Kapoor, through his wife's company for Rs 225 crore. In another case of alleged misappropriation of bank funds, the agency is probing Reliance Communications for a loan default ofRs 1,050 crore to Canara Bank.Sources said more than 25 individuals, including Ambani and his close associates, are targets of the search operations which started on Thursday morning in a probe initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.ED is being assisted by multiple agencies, including National Housing Bank, Sebi, National Financial Reporting Authority and Bank of Baroda among others.The alleged loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore from Yes Bank pertains to the period between 2017 and 2019. ED is investigating alleged quid pro quo in sanction of loan as a Reliance Anil Ambani entity had transferredRs 225 crore into the accounts of RAB Enterprises, in which Rana Kapoor's wife Bindu Kapoor had 100% stake.These are all part of an FIR registered by CBI and now being investigated by ED. The FIR also alleged that credit approval memorandums were back dated, and the proposed investments lacked due diligence, not meeting the bank's credit policy.Sources said preliminary investigation found that these loans were diverted to many group entities and shell companies, in many cases there was no proper documentation to loans issued.

UK pact comes amid tariff turmoil created by Trump

LONDON/NEW DELHI: More than three years after they began negotiations, and amid intense uncertainty in the global trade ecosystem, India and the UK finally signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which slashes duties on both sides. It also makes it more predictable for investors and business workers to get visas, and allows access for audit and accounting firms in the two countries as part of efforts to more than double bilateral trade from the current $56 billion by 2030.Consumers can look forward to cheaper British-made cars, cosmetics, medical devices and Scotch, as govt has agreed to slash average tariffs from 15% to 3%. The zero duty import list also includes silver - the largest item in the UK's export basket ($2.1 billion last fiscal). But all the changes won't happen overnight, with some duty cuts planned over 10 years, allowing Indian industry time to adjust.In return, govt got the UK to allow zero duty import on 99% of product lines. ""This is more than just an economic partnership; it is also a blueprint for shared prosperity. It paves the way for enhanced market access in the UK for Indian textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, seafood, and engineering goods. It will also unlock new opportunities for India's agricultural produce and processed food industry. Above all, this agreement will be especially beneficial for India's youth, farmers, fishermen, and the MSME sector,"" PM Modi said.Govt has, however, managed to keep several agricultural products such as oats, apples, edible oil and sensitive seeds, as well as dairy outside the ambit of tariff reduction.""We're living through a new and more dangerous global era... we believe building stronger partnerships is the best response... today we are confirming this approach in our new deal with India - the biggest and most economically significant trade deal for the UK since leaving the EU,"" said British PM Keir Starmer.The India-UK trade agreement, announced on May 6, but formalised at Chequers, the official country residence of British PM, came amid tariff turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's moves, prompting countries to not just rush to Washington to strike deals but also speed up negotiations on other treaties.India is ready to roll out treaty with European Free Trade Association, comprising Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, from Oct, while seeking to finalise the agreement with EU after 18 long years of talks. FTAs with New Zealand, Oman and several other countries are in the pipeline. But the CETA with the UK is unlikely to be implemented for at least a year as it requires British legislative approval.The pact with the UK, which was in the making for three-and-a-half years, required significant give-and-take, with India managing to keep a bilateral investment treaty out of the current deal, just as the UK did not agree to carve-outs on carbon tax for Indian products.India also claimed victory in getting a more predictable visa regime for business and professional visitors, but the bigger gain is in the form of a Double Contribution Convention, which will ensure that Indian workers in the UK for up to three years do not have to contribute to the National Insurance (NI) system there, while also seeing deductions towards Employees' Provident Fund Organisation. But it did offer some major concessions. Trade research body GTRI argued that govt's promise for ""adequate remuneration"" to patent holders when compulsory licensing provisions are invoked risks delays.In addition, govt opened an estimated 40,000 central contracts above a certain value to UK businesses, who would be granted local contractor status with 20% or more domestic content.","India and the UK have signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.

NEW DELHI: Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports. The new trade pact promises zero- or near-zero tariffs on textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - relief the government says will make Indian exports far more competitive.Government said 99% items of trade (called tariff lines), comprising 100% of India's exports, are covered in the deal.In textiles, for instance, there are 1,143 items on which zero-duty market access will be provided to Indian goods, blunting the duty advantage that Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have so far enjoyed. So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports.

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated duty cuts for Scotch and gin is not happening overnight. While import duty will come down from 150% to 75%, it is unlikely to happen until at least the second half of 2035.That's because the agreement will take at least a year to be ratified by the British Parliament and there is a gradual tariff reduction roadmap starting with duties in India dropping to 110% in the first year of implementation. The UK government said customs duty will reduce to 40% over the next decade.What's more, govt has got the UK to agree to a minimum import price which means, whisky, gin or any other drink that costs under $5 in a one litre bottle or $6 in a 750 ml bottle will get the tariff benefit and the MIP will be indexed to inflation.However, industry officials say that despite halving import duty, the actual reduction of consumer prices will not be more than 10%. ""The share of customs duty to the overall structure of MRP is hardly 15-20%, depending on the category. The rest comprises state govrnment taxes, and distribution margins. So actual consumer prices will come down by only 8-10%,"" an official said.The reduction in import duty will be a benefit for manufacturers of Indian Made Foreign Liquor.Around 80% of imported scotch is in bulk form, which is used for bottling in India and for blending by local whisky brands.But the industry cheered the move. Sanjit Padhi, CEO of International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), said the agreement paves the way for a more balanced and equitable trade environment, particularly as Indian alcohol exports to the UK have zero import duties.""We laud the Indian and British governments for formalising this historic treaty which will boost bilateral trade and positively impact the accessibility of premium Scotch whisky in India, reigniting growth and increased choice for Indian consumers,"" Praveen Someshwar, MD and CEO of Diageo India, said.","The much-anticipated duty cuts for Scotch and gin is not happening overnight.

NEW DELHI: Government has agreed to cut tariffs on thousands of products imported from UK - from chocolates and cosmetics to cars, silver and Scotch - but reduction and elimination of customs duties will not translate into the entire benefit being passed on to consumers.To begin with, customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an Indian seller. On top of that are local levies - GST or excise - which even an Indian manufacturer has to pay. And, this can be a significant portion of the final price.Take the case of alcohol, for instance, where the landed price of a bottle of the popular Johnnie Walker Black Label is estimated at around Rs 350, which at 150% customs duty sees a levy of Rs 525. On top of that, there is a 200% margin for the importer, the company, in most cases - which means an addition of around Rs 750 - taking the landed price to Rs 1,275. Then comes excise of 85% or Rs 1,084 and VAT of 25% (Rs 590), taking the wholesale price to Rs 2,950. Then comes the retail margin, pushing the cost in a market like Delhi to over Rs 3,000 a bottle.The actual price reduction for a customer will only be Rs 200-300 a bottle, a top industry executive told TOI while predicting a higher margin for companies.That's especially true for Made-in-India whisky, which blend anywhere between 1% and 25-30% Scotch imported in bulk form. ""Going forward, for several MNCs operating in India, bottling in India may not be a great idea and they will simply import bottles of blended whisky,"" the source said.A similar situation is likely to play out in other sectors such as cosmetics too, where companies will see improved margins, said marketing executives. There is no mechanism for govt to ensure the full benefit is passed on. Although it tried to ensure the window is no longer available under GST and in any case, companies dragged authorities to court, questioning the calculations.In segments such as automobiles, competition from players will drive pricing behaviour, as will other trade agreements. For instance, with the EU deal in the pipeline, a German carmaker or Tesla may just lower domestic prices significantly to grab a bigger pie of the market.With duty reduction in several segments staggered over 10 years, price cuts are not on the immediate horizon.","Customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an Indian seller.

NEW DELHI: The continuing opposition stir against SIR of Bihar's electoral rolls forced a whitewash of business in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha again on Thursday, with the Upper House managing only the customary farewell for retiring members.On the fourth day of Parliament's monsoon session, Congress parliamentary party chairperson and Rajya Sabha member Sonia Gandhi joined the mass of opposition MPs who demonstrated outside Parliament building, raising slogans and holding placards denouncing the EC exercise.While the Rajya Sabha was adjourned for the day shortly after reassembling for the post-lunch session amid din, Lok Sabha proceedings were adjourned by Speaker Om Birla after opposition MPs raised slogans and entered the well of the House with placards.Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal , in the Lower House, questioned the opposition for not allowing discussion on the bill which seeks to provide seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Goa legislative assembly.Earlier, Birla had asked the protesting members to go back to their seats and assured that as per rules, they will be given opportunities to raise issues. He mentioned the name of Congress' K C Venugopal and said it was not the culture of his party to indulge in sloganeering in the House.",Opposition stir against SIR of Bihar's electoral rolls forced a whitewash of business in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha again on Thursday.

"Rahul Gandhi's 'vote theft' claim an afterthought, says EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-vote-theft-claim-an-afterthought-says-ec/articleshow/122890580.cms,"NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Thursday said leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi 's allegations of ""vote theft"" during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka appear to be an afterthought, given that Congress neither filed a single appeal with election officials after publication of the state's final electoral roll in Jan 2024 nor did it challenge the results in state high court through an election petition.Talking to reporters in Parliament complex, Rahul claimed that Congress has ""concrete 100% proof"" of ""cheating in an LS seat"" in Karnataka and warned that ""if you (EC) think you are going to get away with this... you are mistaken... we are going to come for you"". The Congress MP said opposition would ensure that EC is held accountable.Dismissing his charges as ""baseless"" in a statement, EC said: ""It is highly unfortunate that rather than filing an election petition as per section 80 of Representation of the People (RP)Act, 1951, or if filed, awaiting verdict of HC, he has not only made baseless allegations but also chosen to threaten EC, which is a constitutional body.""With his allegations coming more than a year after the LS polls result, EC said it was wondering why ""such baseless and threatening claims were being made against it and the CEC, and that too now.""It added that the losing Congress candidates did not file a single election petition to challenge the result, despite Representation of the People Act, 1951 allowing this within 45 days of declaration of result. Others, however, did file 10 election petitions in HC.Countering Rahul's ""unwarranted threatening statements"", the Karnataka chief electoral officer (CEO) on X said copies of the draft and final electoral roll for the state's 224 assembly seats were provided to recognised parties, including Congress, on Oct 27, 2023, and Jan 22, 2024, respectively. Between publication of the draft and final roll, around 9.2 lakh claims and objections were received and settled across 34 districts. Neither Congress nor any other entity avail the two-stage appeal option available under Representation of the People Act, 1951, the post said.Meanwhile, backing RJD functionary Tejashwi Yadav suggested possibility of boycotting Bihar elections over the special revision of electoral rolls issue, Congress' K C Venugopal said a political party's biggest weapon in a democracy is the voters' list and if that is compromised, with names being deleted and lists not being clean, then you are challenging democracy. ""Let there not be an election and there be one party. Let Election Commission rule that. That is what Yadav meant by his comment about boycotting,"" Venugopal said.","Congress leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi's allegations of ""vote theft"" during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka appear to be an afterthought, Election Commission of India says.

NEW DELHI: India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars with the UK trade deal paving the way for customs charges to come down from the highs of 100%+ to as low as 10%, benefitting ultra-luxury car brands such as Jaguar and Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Aston Martin.However, the government has delayed the import duty concessions when it comes to electrics and other green cars, the measure being initiated to protect the domestic players who are looking to produce high-value clean cars. “There are no concessions given to electrics, hybrids, and hydrogen-powered vehicles in the first five years,” an official said.In petrol and diesel categories, the lower tariffs can be enjoyed for a limited number of vehicles as the government has imposed quotas and limits to protect the domestic makers and also curb mass-scale shipments.For large-engine petrol cars above 3000 cc and diesel cars over 2500 cc — traditionally luxury imports — India has committed to lowering the current 100%+ customs duty to 10% over 15 years, within a quota starting at 10,000 units and rising to 19,000 in year five, according to a review document of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).For mid-sized cars (1500–2500 cc diesel / up to 3000 cc petrol), a 50% in-quota duty applies initially, falling to 10% by year five.Small cars under 1500 cc follow a similar tariff reduction path with a growing quota. “These in-quota vehicles enjoy sharply reduced duties, while out-of-quota imports still face tariffs ranging from 95% to 50%, depending on vehicle size and year,” GTRI said.In electrics, market access has been given mostly in the high price segment of vehicles priced above £80,000 (around Rs 94 lakh). “For vehicles priced below £40,000, no market access provided, ensuring complete protection for the mass-market EV segment in which India seeks global leadership,” the official said.While the duty cuts will happen only once the UK Parliament approves the agreement (possibly by the middle of next year), analysts believe that the duty reduction with the UK may pave the way for similar measures with other countries and trading blocs as well. “This is India’s first-ever auto tariff concession in any FTA, and it’s likely to trigger similar demands from Japan, the EU, South Korea, and the U.S.,” GTRI said.“By year five, up to 37,000 UK-built ICE vehicles could enter India annually at just 10% duty — far below the current base rate of 110%. This creates a preferential entry path for high-end British brands… but also for other UK-based exports. While the measure is capped in volume and spread over 15 years, the policy sets a precedent in opening India’s tightly controlled automobile market to bilateral trade partners—potentially triggering similar demands in future FTAs. ”",India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars.

NEW DELHI: Putting all speculation to rest, LJP (Ram Vilas) chief and Union minister Chirag Paswan has said that there will be no repetition of 2020 when his party went solo in the last assembly election in Bihar. He said his party considers all NDA candidates as their own and hence LJP (RV) is ready to put in its entire effort in securing victory for them in all 245 seats in the state.In response to a question on the sidelines of the curtain raiser event of World Food India 2025, Chirag said, “I am reiterating that when I say LJP (RV) will contest all 243 seats, I honestly feel that till you don’t treat all alliance candidates as your own nominees, you can’t achieve the target for which you are working. The NDA alliance is working to win more than 225 seats out of 243. I feel that the candidates of JD(U), BJP and others in the alliance are my candidates. If anyone is feeling happy or enthused that I will repeat the role that I played in 2020 (last assembly election), then there is no reason within the alliance that I get back to that role. The NDA is contesting as a united force.”Responding to another question on whether Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor was hijacking his ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ plank, the minister said none can hijack or copy the idea of another leader.However, he appreciated Kishor for “making honest efforts” in the interest of Bihar.“Prashant ji is playing an honest role in Bihar politics, which I appreciate. I welcome all who appeal to people to go beyond caste and communal politics...There is nothing wrong when people have more options,” he said.It can be recalled that Chirag had gone solo in 2020 assembly polls and had put up a brave fight in all seats where JD(U) had its candidates.

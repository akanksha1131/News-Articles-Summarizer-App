UCC criticism

What is the implementation process?

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand is set to make history on Monday by becoming the first state in post-independence India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami will officially launch the UCC portal and issue a notification marking the adoption of the civil code, following the completion of government employee training, mock drills, and dry-run sessions.""The UCC's implementation represents a significant milestone, making the Himalayan state the first in the country to adopt this progressive legislation since independence,"" Dhami said.CM Dhami said that the UCC was drafted after extensive consultations with experts, locals, and representatives from various communities, with the goal of bringing uniformity in society and empowering women.The UCC addresses various societal issues, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships. Key aspects of the law include the registration of marriages, divorces, and live-in relationships to ensure equal property rights and protect children's rights, with penalties for non-compliance.UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions. The move has sparked both support and criticism, with proponents arguing for equality and opponents warning of potential societal divisions.The UCC clarifies legal requirements for marriage, stating that only mentally capable individuals aged 21 (for men) or 18 (for women) who are not already married may enter into a union. Marriages can be performed according to religious customs, but registration will be mandatory to ensure legal recognition.The law also addresses issues related to the creation and cancellation of wills and codicils under testamentary succession. Marriages solemnized before March 26, 2010, or those outside the state will be eligible for registration if legal requirements are met.Opposition leaders have criticized the UCC, arguing that it may lead to societal division along religious lines and might be impractical and overly ambitious.The debate surrounding the UCC extends beyond Uttarakhand, as Article 44 of the Indian Constitution advocates for a uniform civil code across the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has referenced the Supreme Court's direction on the need for a common code, stressing that fulfilling the vision of the Constitution's framers remains a national goal.Uttarakhand's implementation of the UCC is likely to set a precedent, with other states potentially following suit. The success of the law's implementation will depend on its ability to balance individual rights and social harmony.As Uttarakhand stands at the forefront of this legal revolution, the coming weeks will offer a clearer picture of how the UCC will be received, both in the state and across India. The state's experience with the UCC will undoubtedly shape the future of personal law reform in the country.Shailesh Bagauli, secretary (home), stated that the government will issue two notifications: one for the implementation of the UCC and another for the rules and regulations, officially launching the UCC in the state.Dhami had promised to implement the UCC if re-elected during the 2022 state polls. After becoming CM, he appointed a five-member committee led by Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai to draft the code, which received feedback from over 2.3 lakh people, representing nearly 10% of Uttarakhand's families.The 740-page draft was presented to the chief minister on February 2, 2024, approved by the cabinet on February 4, tabled in the assembly on February 6, and passed the following day. Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) approved the bill on February 28 and President Droupadi Murmu subsequently signed it on March 11.","UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions.

NDA has option to fill 4 more nominated seats

NEW DELHI: NDA will further improve its tally in the Upper House of Parliament as resignation of one more YSRCP Rajya Sabha member, V Vijayasai Reddy - the fourth since the party's rout in 2024 assembly elections - would give the BJP-led alliance one additional seat in the imminent by-election. Reddy, leader of the party in the House, resigned on Saturday.Earlier, three resignations had helped NDA partner TDP open its account last Dec with two seats in Rajya Sabha. Its strength had reduced to zero after its dismal performance in the previous assembly polls in 2019. One of the three vacant seats went to BJP, which currently has 98 MPs in Rajya Sabha.Though NDA has already crossed the majority mark in the Upper House with the help of two Independents and six nominated members, gain of an extra seat will further cement its position in the Rajya Sabha whether it goes to TDP or its partner in the state assembly Jana Sena Party or BJP.Besides, the ruling alliance at Centre still has an option to get four more nominated members on board if govt decides to fill those four vacant seats under the nominated category.Nominated members invariably go with govt during passing of any legislation or resolution. There are provisions of 12 nominated members in Rajya Sabha.Since two — Gulam Ali and Satnam Singh Sandhu — of the eight nominated MPs in the current House had joined BJP after being nominated by the President, they are counted under the party’s head in the list and have to go by its whip.Another round of vacancies will arise in June-July when two Rajya Sabha members from Assam (one from BJP and other from AGP) will retire in June and six members from Tamil Nadu (three from DMK and one each from AIADMK, PMK and MDMK) will retire in July.BJP will retain its seat from Assam while DMK may improve its tally by gaining one extra seat in by-election in June/July. AIADMK will also be able to retain its seat.","V Vijayasai Reddy, leader of the party in the House, resigned on Saturday.

Ajit Pawar announces free treatment for GBS

PUNE: The Maharashtra health department reported Sunday what is suspected to be the first death linked to the Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) outbreak concentrated in Pune as the caseload spiked to 101 with 28 more confirmed infections, based on updated surveillance data, reports Steffy Thevar. The daily bulletin said the suspected GBS death occurred in Solapur but did not give details.Sixteen of the patients diagnosed with this rare but treatable condition are currently on ventilator support. Around 19 of those with symptoms are below nine, while the 50-80 age group accounts for 23 cases.A patient hospitalised on Jan 9 is suspected to be the first GBS case within the Pune cluster. Tests have revealed the Campylobacter jejuni bacteria in some biological samples drawn from hospitalised patients. C Jejuni causes about a third of all GBS cases worldwide and is also responsible for the most severe infections.Authorities are sampling Pune's water, especially in areas that are reporting cases. Test results released Saturday showed that a well near Khadakwasla Dam, Pune's main water reservoir, had high levels of the bacterium E. coli. But officials said it was unclear if the well was being used at all. Residents have been advised to boil water and heat their food before consumption.Health department officials said 25,578 homes had been surveyed till Sunday as part of a surveillance exercise meant to find more patients within the community and pinpoint the trigger for the surge in GBS cases, which otherwise don’t exceed more than two a month.GBS occurs when the body’s immune system, while reacting to a bacterial or viral infection, mistakenly attacks the nerves that carry brain signals to parts of the body, leading to weakness, paralysis or other symptoms. Doctors said 80% of affected patients regain their ability to walk without assistance within six months of hospital discharge, but some may take up to a year or more to regain full use of their limbs. GBS treatment is also very expensive.Patients will typically need a course of immunoglobulin (IVIG) injections. A family TOI spoke to earlier said their 68-year-old relative, who was admitted on Jan 16, needed an IVIG course of 13 injections, with each shot costing about Rs 20,000.Three major hospitals in the city sent out alerts to local health authorities earlier this week after they found a higher-than-usual number of GBS patients —26 on Jan 10 — among newly admitted patients. By Friday, the number soared to 73.Speaking about rising cases in Pune, Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar announced, “The treatment is expensive. After discussions with officials from the district administration and municipal corporation, we have decided to provide free treatment. Those from Pimpri-Chinchwad will be treated at YCM Hospital, while patients from Pune Municipal Corporation areas will receive treatment at Kamla Nehru Hospital. For citizens from rural areas, free treatment will be provided at Sassoon Hospital in Pune.”","Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) outbreak concentrated in Pune.

Poll Is Compensation Necessary for Passengers Facing Inconvenience? No, It’s Not Sufficient Yes, It’s Fair for Affected Passengers

CHENNAI: An elderly couple's traumatic experience aboard a 10-hour Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt, where they endured wet seats and dripping water for a large part of the journey, has led to a Chennai court penalising the airline for deficient service. The ordeal extended beyond the flight, with delays and mishandling disrupting their journey and causing financial and emotional distress.Joju Dominic, 69, and his wife Jasmine, 65, had booked round-trip tickets from Chennai to Vancouver via Frankfurt for Rs 3.5 lakh. Their trouble began on June 12, 2023, when their Chennai-Frankfurt flight was delayed by 90 minutes for cleaning, leaving them waiting in the aerobridge.Upon boarding, they discovered their seats were soaked, with water dripping from the overhead compartment. Joju claimed they received no help, and a cabin crew even threatened to deplane him when he complained. ""The staff blamed the issue on Chennai's climate and suggested we use a blanket to deal with the dripping water,"" he said. After prolonged inconvenience, they were offered alternative seats.At Frankfurt airport, delays and lack of priority assistance caused them to miss their connecting Air Canada flight to Vancouver. Following arguments with airline staff, they were eventually accommodated on a later flight, but the delay caused them to miss their scheduled ferry in Canada.The return journey was equally harrowing. Shortly after take-off, the aircraft reported a fuel leakage and returned to Frankfurt. At Frankfurt airport on Oct 3, 2023, the couple was directed to a service centre, where Joju alleged they were treated harshly. Despite their age, their request for accommodation till the rescheduled flight was initially denied. Later, they had to walk nearly 2km to reach the lodging as they were also denied pre-booked wheelchair assistance.Joju alleged inadequate meal provisions during the delay and said they ran out of essential medicines.The couple sought Rs 3.5 lakh in compensation, equivalent to the cost of their tickets. The airline was ordered to pay Rs 55,000 for mental agony and legal costs. The commission said alternative arrangements were provided to the couple, which justified the limited compensation. Dissatisfied with the ruling, Joju has appealed to the state consumer commission, seeking higher compensation for their ordeal.","Joju Dominic, 69, and his wife Jasmine, 65, had booked round-trip tickets from Chennai to Vancouver via Frankfurt for Rs 3.5 lakh.

‘Brain’ loss puts Reds in leadership crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brain-loss-puts-reds-in-leadership-crisis/articleshow/117584754.cms,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The number of alive and active CPI (Maoist) politburo members, as per documents maintained by Chhattisgarh police, has depleted to barely four - general secretary Namballa Keshava Rao alias Basavraju, Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy, Mallajulla Venugopal Rao alias Sonu, and Misir Besra - from 16 in 2004 on account of killings, arrests, surrenders and deaths due to illnesses.While Keshava Rao is around 67 years old, Ganpathy is a ripe 75, Sonu 62, and Besra 64.The other key decision-making body of the CPI (Maoist) - central committee - now comprises no more than 11-12 active members, as per Chhattisgarh police documents accessed by TOI. Apart from the four politburo members who are also members of the central committee, the documents mention Thippari Tirupathi alias Devji (64); Kadari Satyanarayana Reddy alias Kosa (72), Ganesh Uike (60) and Pullari Prasad Rao alias Chandranna (60) as its active and alive members. Patiram Manjhi alias Anil da, believed to be in hiding in Jharkhand, Modem Balakrishna and Gajarla Ravi, all central committee members, somehow do not figure in the Chhattisgarh police's list of ""active/alive"" top Maoist leaders.A senior officer of the central intelligence establishment said the CPI(Maoist) central committee undergoes new additions from time to time, with some leaders getting added by virtue of being in charge of special zonal committees and state committees. However, these are mostly armed, military-trained tribal commanders with little or no education, unlike the old leadership that had kept the Naxal movement alive with their ideological heft and commitment derived from high education in institutions like REC, Warangal, and a well-read background.According to the officer, more than the loss of Maoist boots on the ground in stepped-up operations, what may be dealing a body blow to Left-wing extremism is the 'brain' loss on account of advanced age, arrests, killing and natural deaths of top CPI(Maoist) leaders. The second-rung leadership largely comprises members high on guerrilla tactics and mostly hailing from Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, but low on ideological thought.Over the years, several politburo members have died due to illness or have been arrested and even expelled by the CPI(Maoist). For instance, Prashant Bose alias Kishen Da was arrested in 2021, while Katakam Sudharshan died of illness in 2023. Kobad Gandhy was arrested in 2019, but he was expelled from the party. Pramod Mishra too was arrested in 2023 and Sumanand, last year. Much earlier, Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad was killed in 2010 and Mallojula Koteshwara Rao alias Kishen ji in 2011. Sushil Rao and Narayan Sanyal died of illness in 2014 and 2017, respectively.The central committee has shrunk from 32 members in 2004, including 16 politburo members. Non-politburo members who died include Ramanna (2019), Yapa Narayan (2021), Bansindhar Singh (2020), Akkiraju Rajgopal (2021), Lakhmu (2021), and Mallaraji Reddy (2023). Members killed in anti-Naxal operations include Deepak 'Milind' Teltumbde in Gadchiroli in (2021), and recently, Ramachandra Reddy in Chhattisgarh. Arrested members include Sheela Marandi (2021), Sanjay Deepak Rao (2023), Vijay Krishnamurthy (2021), Mithilesh Mehta (2022), Arun Bhattacharjee (2019), and Balraj (2010).","The number of alive and active CPI (Maoist) politburo members has depleted to barely four.

ROORKEE/DEHRADUN: Making a mockery of the law, two senior politicians in Uttarakhand - Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion , former MLA from Khanpur and a BJP member, and the independent MLA from the same seat, Umesh Kumar - went at each other with loaded weapons, even as their supporters clashed, spreading fear and panic in the region on Sunday.A video of the incident, which evoked widespread condemnation, showed Champion, along with more than two dozen supporters, storming the camp office-cum-residence of Kumar in a gang-war style shootout, firing gunshots, heckling the MLA's staff and beating up people. Champion could be seen in the footage loading an assault rifle, firing shots and walking around Kumar's office premises with a rifle in one hand and a pistol in the other.A member of Kumar's staff, Rao Imran, allegedly sustained head injuries in the scuffle and was taken to hospital. Before cops could arrive, Champion and his supporters had left the spot. Later in the day, Kumar's personal secretary, Zubair Kazmi, lodged a complaint against Champion at Roorkee's Civil Lines police station alleging that around 100 rounds were fired, of which 70 empty bullet covers had been recovered. The ex-MLA and four of his supporters were subsequently arrested from Dehradun. Doon SSP Ajai Singh told TOI that they were in the process of being handed over to Haridwar police under whose jurisdiction the area falls.Meanwhile, soon after the attack at his camp office, Umesh Kumar, who was not present during the altercation, reached the spot.Police officers had also reached by then. The already-tense situation intensified when Kumar’s supporters began shouting slogans against Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion, and Kumar attempted to rush toward Champion’s residence, barely 300 metres away from his place, wielding a pistol.Police officers had to intervene and restrain him physically, all of which was captured on video.The incident, coming barely days before the scheduled visit of PM Narendra Modi to attend the opening ceremony of the 38th national games in Dehradun on Tuesday, has stirred up the political environment in the hill state, where such brazen acts of violence amongst lawmakers are rarely seen.Both Champion and Kumar have been engaged in bitter rivalry since 2022 when Kumar wrested the Khanpur seat from the control of the BJP legislator, who had represented it for four terms, and had fielded his wife against Kumar in the assembly polls.The duo had often been engaging in verbal slug-fests on social media besides fighting cases against each other in court. A couple of days ago, Champion had put up a post referring to Kumar as “an illegitimate child”.Soon after, Kumar and his supporters stormed into Champion’s ancestral home in Landaura, hurling abuses and challenging him to come outside and face them.After his arrest from Nehru Colony in Dehradun, Champion told mediapersons that he was forced to react since Kumar had “challenged him”.","Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion, former MLA from Khanpur and a BJP member, and the independent MLA from the same seat, Umesh Kumar - went at each other with loaded weapons.

Skywatchers are in for a celestial treat as six planets—Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—align in a rare astronomical phenomenon. This spectacular display will be visible from January 21 to January 31.An official told the news agency PTI, that Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn will be visible to the naked eye, creating a stunning formation in the evening sky.The official explained that while Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn will create a visible spectacle observable without equipment, viewing Neptune and Uranus will require optical aids such as binoculars or telescopes.Parade of planets is a phrase people use when two or more planets are visible in the night sky. However, Nasa has specified that it is not an astronomical term. So why is the term is used?The presence of bright planets like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus in a single viewing makes this particular event particularly rare and distinctive. Jupiter shines brightly, while Venus and Mars are reaching their peak brilliance in the post-sunset sky for the first time in years.With Saturn still prominently visible and Mercury making occasional appearances, four or five planets can easily be spotted with the naked eye, creating a captivating celestial spectacle.Space.com explains that all planets in our solar system follow orbital paths around the sun along a specific plane known as the ecliptic. This results in planets appearing in a linear formation when viewed from Earth. Although these linear arrangements are regular occurrences in our sky, they are typically classified as planetary alignments.In India, astronomers across India have prepared for events where people can witness the planets.

They criticised India’s policies, particularly allegations of human rights violations in Punjab and the treatment of minority groups.Meanwhile, a significant number of Indian supporters, waving the Indian tricolour and chanting patriotic slogans like ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" and ""Vande Mataram,"" gathered in counter-protest. They expressed their unity with India, emphasising the country’s territorial integrity and national pride. The two groups were separated by a significant police presence to avoid any escalation of violence.The Khalistani protesters accused the Indian government of suppressing Sikh voices and called for international intervention. However, supporters of India rejected these claims, stating that such protests disrespected the importance of Republic Day, which celebrates India's unity and democratic values.One Indian supporter at the High Commission in London told ANI, ""Vande Bharat! Bharat Mata ki Jai! We came here for the 76th Republic Day celebrations. When we came outside after flag hoisting, we saw that some Khalistani demonstrators were insulting our National flag. We just want to say that we are not affected by their actions...""Another supporter added, ""We had come to the Indian High Commission for flag hoisting on the occasion of 76th Republic Day. We saw some Khalistanis had gathered outside and they were insulting our national flag. I want to let them know that their actions do not make a difference to us or our country. Although we are less in number here our spirits are higher than theirs. We will fight till our last breath.""","Pro-Khalistan supporters staged a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London.

Both groom, bride have moved on in life: SC

NEW DELHI: A groom's greed for dowry gold tore apart his marriage within three days, entailed dowry harassment prosecution for 19 years, incarceration for three months, and now the Supreme Court has asked him to pay a compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the bride, who has since married another and settled abroad.The marsriage took place on Feb 3, 2006. The parents of the bride presented her 60 sovereigns of gold and the groom 10 sovereigns.But the groom, an infotech professional, acted pricey and demanded an additional 30 sovereigns for him to participate in the post-marriage ceremonies at the bride's place.Midway through the reception, the groom's father took him away from the 'mandap' accusing the bride's parents of not presenting the 100 sovereigns. The woman, a corporate executive, could take no more of her husband's greed-based tantrums and decided to lodge a complaint under Section 498A of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prevention Act. The trial court at Saidapet (TN) convicted the groom under provisions of IPC and DP Act and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment with a fine of Rs 3,000 under Section 498A of IPC and a sentence of one year under Sec 4 of DP Act. An additional sessions judge upheld the conviction and sentence.Madras HC confirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to two years. When the groom appealed against the HC verdict in SC, he was asked to surrender and lodged in jail for nearly three months before SC granted him bail.Noting that the groom had already undergone three months of incarceration during the trial and after the HC judgment, the bench said, ""The marriage was solemnised on March 31, 2006, and the couple lived together for three days. As noticed from the HC order, the de facto complainant (bride) is married and settled abroad. The case was prolonged for nearly 19 years. Both the groom and bride have moved on in life.""Reducing the sentence to the period of incarceration already undergone, court directed the man to deposit Rs 3 lakh within four weeks before the Saidapet trial court and directed the court to ensure this money was paid to the woman for the harassment she suffered at the hands of the groom. SC said if the money is not paid, then the case would be listed again for further hearing.",A groom's greed for dowry gold tore apart his marriage within three days.

Hakim’s comments

Parents' allegations

Background

NEW DELHI: West Bengal minister Firhad Hakim on Sunday accused the parents of the RG Kar hospital victim of maligning Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for political motives. His remarks followed similar allegations by Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Kunal Ghosh, who claimed that the parents were being ""used"" by groups aiming to discredit the Mamata Banerjee government.Speaking at a Republic Day event, Hakim expressed sympathy for the parents but criticized their statements against the chief minister. ""I share the parents’ pain and anguish but targeting the CM without reason is unacceptable. The CM was elected by popular mandate, not by those using the parents as puppets for their agenda,"" said Hakim, who also serves as the mayor of Kolkata.He further alleged that the parents were ""mouthing scripted lines"" provided by vested interests.The victim's parents have publicly accused the Kolkata Police and hospital authorities of attempting to destroy evidence in their daughter’s rape and murder case . They also criticized the CBI for failing to uncover a larger conspiracy behind the crime.""We believe the CM has utterly failed. We have every right to express our feelings,"" the victim's father said at a meeting organized by the 'Abhaya Manch' platform.The case concerns the rape and murder of a 31-year-old post-graduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in August last year. Her body was found in a seminar hall. On January 20, a trial court sentenced Sanjay Roy, the lone convict, to life imprisonment.While the victim's family continues to demand justice and allege systemic failure, ruling party leaders have dismissed their claims as politically motivated.","West Bengal minister Firhad Hakim accused parents of maligning Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

One has to work hard on the ground. There has always been a demand for govt support to the cooperative sector, but nobody gave thought to it before PM Narendra Modi,"" Shah said at a rally in Malegaon.

"‘Indigenous’ bullet trains to run on Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, till Japanese Shinkansens arrive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharats-to-run-on-bullet-train-corridor-till-japanese-shinkansens-arrive/articleshow/117441558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid inordinate delay in finalising the deal for procurement of Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains for India’s first high-speed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor , the railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow “indigenous trains”, with a maximum design speed of 280 kmph, to run on this section.Though the ministry had earlier claimed that Shinkansen trains would make their debut on the Surat-Bilimora section by Aug 2026, now it is clear that these high-speed specialised trains may not be a reality before 2030. The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two “indigenous” high-speed trains by the end of 2026. These trains will have the Vande Bharat base and will be designed to run on standard gauge tracks.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains , which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even, when our own high-speed trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the indigenous trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, would meet the expectation of passengers.","The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two ‘indigenous’ high-speed trains by the end of 2026.

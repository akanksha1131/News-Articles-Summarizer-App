'Bharat ki baat sunata hoon': Congress vs Congress? Manish Tewari's cryptic post after being dropped from Operation Sindoor debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bharat-ki-baat-sunata-hoon-congress-vs-congress-manish-tewaris-cryptic-post-after-being-dropped-from-operation-sindoor-debate/articleshow/122965624.cms,"Manish Tewari (left), and Gaurav Gogoi

""Poorab and Pashchim""

NEW DELHI: Amid reports that Congress MPs who were part of the multi-party delegation for the government's global outreach on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism may not be allowed to speak in the Lok Sabha debate on the Pahalgam attack and subsequent Operation Sindoor , Congress MP Manish Tewari on Tuesday posted a cryptic message on social media, invoking lyrics from a patriotic Hindi film song.While sharing a news article on why Congress did not allow party MPs Shashi Tharoor and Tewari to speak in Lok Sabha, the Congress MP posted famous lyrics of the Hindi film. ""Hai preet jahaan ki reet sada, Main geet wahaan ke gaata hoon, Bharat ka rehne waala hoon, Bharat ki baat sunata hoon,"" Tewari said in a post on X, adding, ""Jai Hind.""The Congress party reportedly approached Shashi Tharoor over the weekend to speak in the ongoing parliamentary debate, but he declined the offer and had not expressed interest on his own until then. His absence allowed the BJP to target the Congress, with BJP MP Baijayant Panda suggesting that Congress leadership was not letting Tharoor speak. However, Panda added that he was glad no one could stop Tharoor from speaking in the national interest.Shashi Tharoor avoided media questions on Operation Sindoor on Monday, responding with just one word -- ""Maunvrat, Maunvrat"" -- as he entered Parliament.According to TOI sources, Tharoor has now shown interest in speaking on the Indian Ports Bill, particularly due to its relevance to the Vizhinjam port in his Thiruvananthapuram constituency.The port was recently inaugurated in a high-profile event attended by the Prime Minister Modi and leaders from multiple parties.Congress MP Manish Tewari is expected to speak on the upcoming sports-related bills in the Lok Sabha. Though he initially showed interest in the Pahalgam-Sindoor issue, he later opted for the sports legislation. Sources said that under the party’s internal system based on performance and participation, MPs are generally allotted one key topic each to ensure more members get an opportunity to speak.India carried out Operation Sindoor on early on May 7 in response to April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and carried out precision strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoJK. India repelled subsequent Pakistani aggression and pounded its airbases.","Congress MP Manish Tewari posted a cryptic message on social media, invoking lyrics from a patriotic Hindi film song.

SC slams MP minister for online apology in Colonel case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-slams-mp-minister-for-online-apology-in-colonel-case/articleshow/122966361.cms,"New Delhi : Supreme Court on Monday slammed Madhya Pradesh minister Kunwar Vijay Shah for tendering an ‘online apology’ instead of a public apology for his objectionable comments on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, who had briefed the media on ‘Operation Sindoor’, and warned him against “testing the court’s patience”.Shah, who is facing a probe by an SC-constituted SIT for his comments, was pulled up by Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi. “What is this online apology? You are testing our patience. On the first day of hearing, you had offered to make a public apology. Where is it?

Women lead India’s 1st outcome-based skilling drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/women-lead-indias-1st-outcome-based-skilling-drive/articleshow/122966043.cms,"New Delhi :

Puja Kumari from a village near Bokaro, Ishrat from a conservative Delhi household, Simran Pandey from the capital’s workingclass lanes, and Sakshi from Jharkhand’s tribal heartland are part of a quiet but distinct shift in India’s skilling landscape. This change is being driven by the Skill Impact Bond (SIB) — the country’s first outcome-based skilling initiative.Launched in 2021 by the ministry of skill development & entrepreneurship through the National Skill Development Corporation, SIB is backed by a consortium of philanthropic and private partners, including the British Asian Trust and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) — two key organisations that helped conceptualise and fund the initiative. Along with JSW Foundation, HSBC India and Dubai Cares, they are driving one of India’s most ambitious public-private partnerships focused on women-led growth.SIB aims to train 50,000 youth, with at least 30,150 retained in jobs for a minimum of three months. So far, over 23,700 youth—72% of them women—have been trained across 30 job roles in 13 sectors, working with more than 700 employers. Of these, 75% have secured jobs, and 60% have stayed employed for over three months — well above national averages.As India approaches its demographic peak and eyes a $30-trillion economy by 2047, models like SIB offer a roadmap — targeted training, outcome-focused frameworks and sustained post-placement support.“We are not just experimenting with outcome-based financing—we are institutionalising it to build a resilient, inclusive skilling ecosystem,” said Jayant Chaudhary, minister of state (independent charge) for skill development and entrepreneurship. He cited the Skill Impact Bond and Project AMBER as examples of how public, philanthropic and private investment can together deliver measurable social impact at scale. Outcomebased financing, he added, is becoming a powerful tool to ensure public investment leads to tangible results—particularly in skilling, employment, and women’s empowerment.Puja, 26, trained as a CNC operator through Pan IIT Gurukul and moved to Chennai to work with IM Gears, becoming the sole breadwinner for her family. Ishrat, 18, began working in Noida in a data-entry role while pursuing a BA through Delhi University’s School of Open Learning—without telling her father. Simran, 21, joined an IT training programme and now works as a customer care executive in Delhi, saving to become an air hostess. Sakshi, 23, a school dropout from the Malto tribal community, enrolled in Pan IIT’s apparel programme in Bengaluru and now earns Rs 15,000 a month, supporting her siblings’ education.Their journeys reflect a fragile but significant transformation. Many are first-generation formal workers navigating rigid social norms, migration, and financial strain to pursue aspirational livelihoods.Jharkhand leads enrolment figures with 26% of trainees, followed by UP and Delhi. But the broader skilling landscape remains challenging still: only 4% of India’s workforce is formally skilled, and nearly 30% of trained individuals are without paid work. Retention is especially challenging for women who have availed traditional schemes. While 84% of those enrolled under such schemes complete certification, fewer than 10% stay in jobs beyond three months.The SIB seeks to reverse this trend by tying funding not to enrolment or certification, but to job placement and retention. Training providers are incentivised to support outcomes through onboarding, counselling and alumni engagement.“Till we come out of our comfort zone, we can’t achieve anything,” says Ishrat. “At first, I wasn’t sure I could manage the machines,” says Puja, now a trainer. “Now I want girls in my village to see what’s possible.”Sakshi says her job gave her more than income, it gave her purpose. “I didn’t want my siblings to face what I did.” Simran says the job gave her confidence. “I feel I can take care of my dreams & my family’s needs too.” For them, skilling isn’t just about employment—it’s about identity, agency, and finding a place in the formal economy.","SIB aims to train 50,000 youth, with at least 30,150 retained in jobs for a minimum of three months.

NDA MPs slam SP silence over cleric’s remark against Dimple Yadav,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-mps-slam-sp-silence-over-clerics-remark-against-dimple-yadav/articleshow/122965953.cms,"Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav

NEW DELHI : It was an unusual sight. Holding placards and shouting slogans, NDA MPs Monday staged a protest over All India Imam Association president Maulana Sajid Rashidi’s objectionable remarks against opposition Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav , with party chief Akhilesh Yadav criticising the cleric.“ Jo Lok Sabha mein pahen ke ayenge wohi humari har jagah dress ho gi (whatever I will wear to attend Lok Sabha, will be my dress for everywhere else),” Akhilesh said while responding to a media query over the issue.MPs of governing NDA said the cleric’s purported remark protesting against the SP MP for not fully covering herself during a recent visit to a mosque was an insult to women as a whole, and questioned the “silence” of the opposition.Dimple, however, was not impressed and said it’s good that action is being taken now but it would have been better if similar protests and support had been visible when horrifying incidents like the one in Manipur came to light through footage on social media, she said.In Lucknow, an FIR has been lodged based on a complaint by local resident Pravesh Yadav, who accused Rashidi of making “extremely offensive, inflammatory, and anti-women remarks” that were “derogatory and misogynistic” and aimed at “inciting religious disharmony & communal tension”.Talking to reporters, LJP (R) MP Shambhavi Choudhary said that for NDA, the honour and prestige of women is of utmost priority.Maulana Rashid had purportedly made misogynistic comments against Dimple in a TV debate and had praised another SP MP, Iqra Hasan, who had covered her head inside the mosque. The comments led to condemnation on social media and from women MPs, including BJP’s Bansuri Swaraj and Congress’s Renuka Chowdhury.The NDA MPs, especially women members, held a protest near Makar Dwar in the Parliament House complex, raising slogans like ‘ Nari shakti ka apman, nahin sahega Hindustan ’.Swaraj called the remarks “deeply shameful” and “unacceptable”. “Does opposition agree with this indecent remark? It is deeply shameful that such an offensive and inappropriate comment has been made against asitting MP...,” she said.She accused the opposition of prioritising “appeasement politics” over women’s dignity and affirmed that the NDA would continue to raise its voice for every woman, including Dimple Yadav.","All India Imam Association president Maulana Sajid Rashidi’s objectionable remarks against opposition Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav.

‘Those who are impure can't visit mosque': Muslim body writes to Delhi CM Rekha Gupta after SP Parliament meet; seeks imam's Nadvi removal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/those-who-are-impure-cant-visit-mosque-muslim-body-writes-to-delhi-cm-rekha-gupta-after-sp-parliament-meet-seeks-imams-nadvi-removal/articleshow/122945509.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The president of the All India Muslim Jamaat, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, has written to Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta demanding the removal of Maulana Mohibbullah Nadvi from his position as imam of a mosque in the national capital.His demand comes days after a Samajwadi Party (SP) meeting was allegedly held inside the mosque, where Nadvi serves as imam and is also the SP Member of Parliament from Rampur, Uttar Pradesh.In his letter, Barelvi said: ""By holding a meeting of Samajwadi Party inside the mosque, the sanctity of the mosque has been violated, and the religious faith of the Muslims has been hurt.""""No other work can be done inside the mosque except offering prayers to the God,"" he added.According to Barelvi, the SP meeting was attended by party chief Akhilesh Yadav , his wife and MP Dimple Yadav, MPs Dharmendra Yadav, Ziaur Rahman Barq, and other leaders.""Impure people cannot come inside the mosque. Only those people can come to the mosque who are pure,"" he wrote.He also pointed out that two women participated in the meeting, despite entry being ""prohibited inside the mosque.""A religious place like a mosque was used for politics.Through this meeting a political message was given that the Samajwadi Party is sympathetic to Muslims,"" Barelvi added.""Therefore, I demand from you that the Imam of the mosque, Maulana Mohibbullah Nadvi, should be removed from the 'Imamat', and a person with Sufi ideology should be made the Imam who is not political,"" he concluded.Meanwhile, the BJP's minority morcha has also taken issue with Nadvi's dual role as imam and MP. Its president, Jamal Siddiqui, has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, seeking Nadvi’s disqualification from Parliament on the grounds that he allegedly holds an ""office of profit"" by drawing a salary from the Waqf Board.Under Article 102(1)(a) of the Constitution, Siddiqui claimed, Nadvi’s position could be considered an office of profit ""because it is financed by a statutory body under the Delhi government.""Siddiqui also wrote to Delhi CM Gupta demanding Nadvi’s immediate removal, accusing him of ""using the mosque as his personal property.""""On July 22, 2025, Mohibbullah Nadvi, along with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, his wife, Dharmendra Yadav and other MPs, party workers, held a party meeting at the mosque where Namaz is offered and also had tea and snacks, which is against the Islamic model code of conduct,"" Siddiqui stated.He further alleged: ""Nadvi also took SP MP Dimple Yadav to the mosque, even though the entry of women is prohibited there.""""There is a place on the first floor of (the mosque) for women to sit.

Massive Rescue Operation: Over 300 Trekkers Saved in Maharashtra's Malshej Ghat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/over-300-trekkers-rescued-in-maharashtras-malshej-ghat-kalu-river-surge-traps-group-locals-forest-teams-lead-7-hour-operation/articleshow/122935040.cms,"



PUNE: Over 300 trekkers, including 100 women, were rescued by the Thane and Junnar forest divisions with help from local villagers during a seven-hour operation on Saturday at Wagachiwadi village in the Malshej Ghat region. This area lies on the border between Pune and Thane districts, about 150 km from Pune, near the Kalyan-Ahmednagar highway.The trekkers came from Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai but became stranded in the forest after the Kalu River’s water level rose due to heavy rainfall in the afternoon, according to forest officials and locals. The forest officials were notified of their entrapment after receiving a call from the state disaster management cell and district administrations.The rescue operation was particularly hazardous, as locals had to swim through the rushing waters to secure ropes and harnesses to trees, using a zipline to transport individuals across the river. Bhaskar Mengal (24), a villager from Morushi village who played a crucial role in the rescue, told TOI, “The river water was gushing, and there was no other way to reach the other side. Since I am familiar with the local conditions, I swam across the river to tie ropes and a harness to the trees.The tourists were scared, and tensions were high. I had to calm them down.”“I prioritised rescuing women. Since we were using the zipline to cross the river, I had to explain the technique to them and assure them that they would not fall. We successfully sent them across one by one. Eventually, another villager, Kamlu Pokla, and forest guards joined me.” Pokla, who has successfully rescued several stranded tourists in the past, added, “During the night, the tourists began to panic and were hesitant to follow our instructions as everybody wanted to go to the other side. We had to calm them down before rescuing them from the deep forest.”Forest officials said that the tourists ventured into the restricted dense forest that Saturday morning without consulting locals. “They were unaware of the local conditions, which led to their entrapment when the river’s water level suddenly increased within a few hours. This area is extremely treacherous and risky for visitors,” Rajvardhan Bhosale, the Range Forest Officer of the Tokavade forest range in Thane district, told TOI.The rescue operation began at 3 PM and concluded by 10 PM, successfully bringing everyone to safety. Most tourists prefer to approach the Kalu River waterfall from the Murbad tehsil side because the trek to the waterfall is steep. However, this particular zone is located within a reserved forest area, home to a large population of wildlife, including leopards and venomous snakes, said the forest officials.Smita Rajhans, assistant forest officer of the Junnar forest division, said, “As many tourists share videos on social media, an increasing number of visitors from other states are coming to Junnar and the surrounding areas for trekking to enjoy the rains. They often disregard their safety, neglect to hire locals for guidance, and attempt adventurous activities in these dense forest zones, leading to their entrapment as they miss the trails. ”The Malshej Ghat, Naneghat, and several villages in the Murbad tehsil of Thane district are known for their alluring jungle treks and trails. This region receives over 200 mm of rainfall within 24 hours, causing local streams, waterfalls, and rivulets to flow at capacity. Consequently, there are numerous small and medium-sized waterfalls in the area.“The natural beauty of these water bodies attracts tourists from various parts of the country, and even international visitors have started flocking to these spots. Hence, it has become imperative for us to enhance basic safety infrastructure in these locations,” said a senior forest official.Kalu Waterfall: The famous Kalu Waterfall is situated in the Khireshwar village, Junnar tehsil, approximately 150 km from Pune. Due to unfamiliarity with the region's geography, a tourist ventured too deep into the valley near the waterfall and accidentally fell into the rushing water at its base. The Kalu Waterfall, located in the Malshej Ghat region, is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors, especially from Mumbai and Pune, particularly during the monsoon season. With a height of 1,200 feet, the Kalu River cascades, making it one of the largest waterfalls in the region and the district.However, locals have voiced concerns about safety at the site, noting that inadequate safety measures have resulted in numerous fatalities. The area is prone to slippery patches and unstable rocks, raising the risk of accidents.Visitors are often drawn to the site due to videos shared on social media, compelling them to capture their experiences.Past Incidents: On July 12, a group of local youths rescued a youth from Hyderabad at Kalu Waterfall. On June 6, a 23-year-old woman tragically lost her life after falling into a 150-foot-deep gorge while trekking at Rajgad Fort in the evening hours.On July 13, six trekkers lost their way while descending from Visapur Fort in Lonavala. The members of the local rescue team rescued them. They were in the forest for almost four hours. In 2022, a software engineer (33) from Hyderabad experienced a scare after losing his way during a solo trek on a 30 km treacherous route from Sonavelu village in Murbad tehsil of Thane to Konkan Kada in Junnar, passing through hilly and forest areas.","Over 300 trekkers, including 100 women, were rescued by the Thane and Junnar forest divisions with help from local villagers. The trekkers came from Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai but became stranded in the forest after the Kalu River’s water level rose due to heavy rainfall.

HYDERABAD: In a twist to the surrogacy case involving a fertility clinic in Secunderabad, police have found that the baby was allegedly bought from a poor family and given to the city couple who sought IVF treatment in 2024.Police said the clinic suggested that the couple opt for surrogacy instead and assured them that the child would be biologically theirs. They were charged Rs 35 lakh for the procedure.Read also: IVF or infant trade? Dr. Patchipala Namratha linked to 2020 child trafficking case On Sunday, Hyderabad police arrested eight people including prime accused Dr Athaluri Namratha (64) of Universal Srushti Fertility Centre, Dr Nargula Sadanandam (41) an anesthetist from the state-run Gandhi Hospital and agents and technicians.They were booked on charges of cheating clients in the name of a surrogacy procedure and running a baby-selling racket. Cops also found that Srushti's licence had been cancelled in 2021. Dr Namratha was running it illegally.She has been operating three more centres in Kondapur (Hyderabad), Vijayawada, and Visakhapatnam. All of them were raided on Sunday.""The latest case appears to be only the tip of the iceberg; there could be many such cases.We are probing other couples who sought surrogacy and IVF treatment at different branches of the fertility centre to ascertain this,"" said S Rashmi Perumal, DCP (north zone).Read also: Hyderabad surrogacy clinic lost registration in 2021, but doctor continued to run it illegally Previously, Dr Namratha came under scrutiny twice – in 2016 and 2020. In the first case her licence was suspended for five years by the Telangana Medical Council after an NRI couple from the US alleged that the newborn given to them, allegedly through surrogacy, was not biologically related to them. Then in 2020 Vizag police arrested Dr Namratha and five others for allegedly trafficking newborns.Police said that more than 10 cases were previously registered against the accused doctor and her clinic at three places – Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Guntur.The latest incident came to light on July 26 when a city-based couple approached the Gopalapuram police alleging that the baby handed to them by the clinic – also known as Srushti Test Tube Baby Centre – following commercial surrogacy, was not biologically related to the father. They had independently run a DNA test to establish this. The couple allegedly paid Rs 35 lakh for the procedure.""After interrogating the prime accused we have established that it is not a case of surrogacy. Dr Namratha and her employees were selling infants to childless couples bought from poor pregnant women who were lured with money,"" said the DCP.She added: ""The biological parents of the baby, who have also been arrested, belong to Assam and were living in Hyderabad. They were paid Rs 90,000 and the mother was sent to Visakhapatnam for delivery.""The baby boy was two days old when he was sold to the complainant couple under the impression that it is their biological son.Among the others arrested are Dr Namratha's son P Jayanth Krishna (25), a practising advocate who used to manage his mother's funds, two employees of the clinic C Kalyani Atchayyamma (40) and G Chenna Rao (37), and an agent Dhanasri Santoshi (38). The biological parents of the infant have been identified as Mohammed Ali Adik (38) and Nasreen Begum (25). While seven of the accused have been sent to 14-day judicial remand to Chanchalguda jail, C Kalyani, an employee at Visakhapatnam branch is being brought to Hyderabad.""Apart from the illegal trade, the accused are also guilty of indulging in commercial surrogacy which is illegal in India. Only altruistic surrogacy is allowed,"" the DCP said.Senior police officials said the complainants, originally from Rajasthan, approached the fertility centre in Aug 2024 for fertility and IVF consultation. During the visit, Dr Namratha conducted fertility tests and advised the couple to opt for surrogacy. They were asked to visit the clinic's Visakhapatnam branch for further procedures.""They were assured that a surrogate would be arranged by the clinic and that their embryo would be transplanted. Over a span of nine months, the couple made multiple payments for consultation, treatment, and surrogate care,"" said a police official, adding, ""Throughout this period, the clinic provided regular updates claiming that the pregnancy was progressing smoothly.""In June 2025, the couple was informed that the surrogate mother delivered a baby boy via C-section in Visakhapatnam. They were asked to pay an additional delivery charge – of Rs 2 lakh – before taking custody of the child. The clinic claimed that the child's biological father was demanding more money.""Upon reaching Vizag, the baby was handed over along with documents falsely indicating that the child was biologically theirs, including a fabricated birth certificate,"" said the cop.When the complainants asked Dr Namratha for the DNA report they found that it was not done before the registration of the baby on their name. However, the clinic representatives kept falsely assuring the couple that the child belonged to them.Suspicion arose when the couple opted for a DNA test of all three in a forensics lab in Vasant Kunj, Delhi, which revealed that neither of them shared any genetic link with the child.""When they tried to seek clarification from the clinic, Dr Namratha initially blocked their numbers before threatening them and denying access to further documentation,"" said the police official.She said that the couple, fed up with the clinic's behaviour, approached Gopalapuram police around a week ago and lodged a complaint.""With malicious intentions, the accused Dr Namratha did not let the complainant couple meet the biological mother, who they believed was the surrogate,"" said the DCPFollowing the complaint, the police, along with health dept officials, seized the fertility centre at Gopalapuram. Officials said they found equipment which substantiated the facts that the accused were offering IVF treatments, creating live embryos, and carrying out medical procedures without any proper license.""Previously, when health officials visited the clinic for inspection on a quarterly basis, it was closed and seemed to be a residential complex. But, it turns out, patients were coming discreetly,"" said Dr J Venkati, district medical health officer (DMHO), Hyderabad.The DMHO added: ""During the recent crackdown, equipment for sex determination and nitrous oxide were also found. Many other pregnancy-related procedures such as MTP, IVF, and others were also being performed by uncertified professionals at the centre.""The DCP alleged that clients who protested were intimidated and threatened by her advocate son, who ran an office from the same premises.", Hyderabad police arrest eight people including prime accused Dr Athaluri Namratha. They were booked on charges of cheating clients in the name of a surrogacy procedure and running a baby-selling racket. Cops also found that Srushti's licence had been cancelled in 2021.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122943711,imgsize-41378,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122943711.jpg"

PATIALA: A man allegedly killed his son after an argument over a pedestal fan at Mallewal village near here on July 23 night, orphaning one of his grandsons on his birthday.Jagpal Singh (35) died of head injuries after being attacked by his father, Malkeet Singh (65), with a sharp farming tool. According to police, the incident occurred shortly after the family had gathered to celebrate the birthday of Jagpal's son. The dispute reportedly started over the pedestal fan being without a protective mesh.Jagpal had asked his father to switch off the fan while stepping out, expressing concern that a child might accidentally put their hand in it. The disagreement escalated, and both retired to their rooms later that night. Police revealed that Jagpal had two sons, aged 5 and 2.Police said Malkeet, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, entered his son's room while he was asleep and struck him three times on the head with a sickle-like tool. Jagpal was first taken to the civil hospital in Nabha and later referred to PGIMER, Chandigarh, in a critical condition, where he died during treatment.The SHO of Bhadson police station, Gurpreet Singh, said they had registered a case against Malkeet based on statements from family members. ""The incident took place on July 23 night. A day before murder, arguments took place between the duo, but they were pacified by the neighbours and family members. Jagpal was the only son of Malkeet. He is survived by two sons and his wife. An investigation is underway,"" said the SHO.Jagpal's mother expressed deep anguish over the incident and said her husband destroyed their family with his own hands.

The company will provide affected staff with severance benefits, outplacement services, and extended insurance coverage.

TCS Layoffs : What’s Behind The Move?

TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year. This is nearly a 2% reduction in the workforce of the IT giant, an unprecedented number for the IT firm.In an official statement, TCS told ET, “TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.”In the April-June quarter, the leading six IT companies saw 72% reduction in workforce expansion, with only 3,847 new hires, compared to 13,935 recruitments during the January-March period.India's IT services sector, which generates combined revenues of over $283 billion, has software companies ranked amongst the biggest private employers. TCS leads as the largest employer in this segment.According to the report, ongoing economic uncertainties and disruptions caused by AI technologies are impacting business demands.The Tata group subsidiary, based in Mumbai, has a total employee count of 613,069 at the close of June 2025.According to a Reuters report, the layoffs will majorly affect people in the middle to senior management positions and around 12,200 people will be asked to leave.According to HFS Research's CEO Phil Fersht, artificial intelligence is diminishing the labour-intensive service delivery approach in the industry.""(That model) is forcing large service providers such as TCS to rebalance their workforces to maintain profit margins and stay price-competitive in a cut-throat market where clients are demanding 20-30% price reductions,"" Fersht was quoted by Reuters.He further noted that this action by TCS, known for providing stable employment, underscores this industry-wide development.The impacted employees who will be asked leave will be provided with notice period compensation and extra severance benefits. Additionally, TCS plans to provide insurance coverage extension and career transition assistance to those affected by this decision, the report said.TCS also said, “This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities.""This workforce reduction comes within days of many TCS staff employees initiating legal proceedings challenging the company's modified bench policy. The revised policy stipulates that employees can only remain unbilled for 35 days annually and must achieve a minimum of 225 billable days per year.Recently it was reported that TCS has delayed the onboarding of 600 lateral hires. TCS issued a notice regarding 'indefinite delay', without providing any new joining dates for the selected technology professionals.NITES (Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate) has escalated this matter to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya through a written communication, highlighting concerns about the financial difficulties and psychological stress faced by these professionals due to the uncertain situation.TCS announced its comprehensive strategic approach, which includes investments in emerging technologies, market expansion, large-scale AI implementation for clients and internal operations, strengthening partnerships, developing advanced infrastructure and restructuring their employment framework.To achieve these objectives, various programmes focused on skill enhancement and staff reallocation have been initiated and are currently in progress.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year.

He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders.

He said by uploading video of burning currency notes and communications between the then CJI and Delhi HC CJ (related to Justice Varma's explanations) on the SC website, the petitioner has been vilified, subjected to media trial & pronounced guilty without an inquiry.While arguing against 'public debate and media trial' over Justice Yashwant Varma, who has identified himself as 'XXX' in his petition before Supreme court, his counsel Kapil Sibal and other MPs have gone public on Allahabad HC's Justice Shekhar Yadav's controversial remark and have signed a notice of motion in Rajya Sabha seeking his removal.Senior advocate Sibal said politics has been introduced into a purely constitutional matter by sending inquiry report by the then CJI to the President and PM with a recommendation to initiate removal motion against the judge. Justice Datta-led bench asked, ""President is the appointing authority, and PM is the head of the executive on whose advice the President acts. Sending the report to them does not mean it amounted to influencing Parliament, where the process is independent of the in-house inquiry report. ""Sibal said, ""How could the in-house inquiry committee conclude that it was a misbehaviour on my part when the cash was found in the outhouse? The committee did not find that the cash belonged to the judge. The judge's staff who were there were not told that the cash was found. The entire procedure of in-house inquiry was flawed and hence the report should be quashed.""Justice Datta said, ""What is the worth of the in-house inquiry report. It is not going to be treated as evidence by the inquiry panel to be set up (by Lok Sabha Speaker) under the Judges Inquiry Act. What are you aggrieved by? If you are aggrieved by the procedure adopted by the in-house committee, why did you participate in its proceedings?""""You are a constitutional authority well versed with the in-house procedure. You could have moved the SC challenging the setting up of the committee or even sought removal of the videos and communications from the SC website. Why did you not do that,"" the bench said and asked as to why the judge in his petition has not attached the inquiry committee report.The bench adjourned hearing a writ petition by advocate Mathews J Nedumpara, who has sought a direction to the Delhi police to register an FIR against Justice Varma for the discovery of unaccounted cash in his official residence premises during a minor fire incident. ""We would like to read the report. You file it. We will take up the matter on Wednesday,"" said the bench.","Supreme Court tells Justice Yashwant Varma he should not have filed the petition challenging the procedure adopted by the in-house committee after participating in it. Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih said ""It is a matter of moment only for the benefit of lawyers who are involved in this petition""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122962536,imgsize-161204,width-400,resizemode-4/122962536.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The incident involving the assault of a female receptionist at a paediatric clinic in Kalyan East has taken a new turn with fresh CCTV footage showing that the receptionist had first slapped the attacker’s relative moments before she was violently assaulted.On Monday evening at Dr Aniket Palande's Shree Balchikitsalaya Clinic in Nandivali, Mumbai, a man, identified as Gokul Jha, kicked the receptionist, dragging her by the hair, and slamming her to the ground inside the clinic.However, a second video now reveals that an argument had broken out between the receptionist and Jha’s family, which included one of his relatives, another woman, a man, and a child. During the exchange, Jha moved threateningly toward the receptionist but was pulled back by his relative. Despite being asked to leave, he re-entered the area and was pushed away again by the woman accompanying him.As the argument continued, the receptionist left her desk, threw papers on the floor, and approached the sister-in-law who remained in the reception area. She slapped the woman while gesturing toward Jha and the others, continuing to shout. Following this, the other man in the group confronted the receptionist, and Jha returned, assaulting her with a kick and slamming her to the ground.He was then pulled away by those with him. Bystanders helped the injured receptionist into a chair.The victim, identified as Sonali Kalasar, is a resident of Pisavali village in Kalyan and works at Dr Aniket Palande's Shree Bal Chikitsalaya Clinic in Nandivali. She is currently undergoing treatment for her injuries.Gokul Jha, 25, was arrested by Manpada police in Dombivli on Tuesday after allegedly attempting to evade capture by changing his appearance. He was presented before the Kalyan District and Sessions Court on Wednesday, which sent him to police custody for two days.","Gokul Jha, 25, was arrested by Manpada police in Dombivli on Tuesday after allegedly attempting to evade capture by changing his appearance.

"NEP@5: More learners, more women, more languages - But can it deliver on its full promise?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nep5-more-learners-more-women-more-languages-but-can-it-deliver-on-its-full-promise/articleshow/122962219.cms,"NEW DELHI: Foundational reading and arithmetic skills among Class III students in govt schools have recorded their strongest gains in nearly two decades, with rural learners outperforming their urban peers - indicating grassroots-level progress. In higher education, enrolment has increased by over 30.5% since 2015, with female PhD enrolment more than doubling and significant gains among SC, ST, minority and Northeast students, as the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 begins reshaping India's education system.However, five years on, the policy continues to face political resistance from some opposition-ruled states, which have raised concerns over centralisation and language. While 35 universities have begun transitioning into multidisciplinary institutions with central support, the uptake of reforms such as multiple entry-exit options remains limited - underlining both early momentum and implementation hurdles.In schools, the biggest shift has been the integration of pre-school into the '5+3+3+4 structure'. As of 2024, more than 1.1 crore children are enrolled in 'Balvatikas', up from 50 lakh in 2018.Over 4.2 crore students across 8.9 lakh schools have participated in 'Vidya Pravesh', a 12-week play-based module for Grade 1 readiness. With 496 Kendriya Vidyalayas now offering 'Balvatikas' and 121 multilingual primers developed, early education has gained structured support.The Nipun Bharat Mission, launched in 2021 to improve foundational literacy and numeracy, is beginning to yield outcomes. ASER 2024 showed that 23.4% of Class III students in govt schools can now read a Grade II-level text - the highest since 2005 - up from 16.3% in 2022. Arithmetic scores have also improved - 27.6% of students can now perform basic subtraction, up from 20.2% in 2022. The Parakh national survey found rural students outperforming their urban counterparts in both reading and math.More than 14 lakh teachers have been trained under the Nishtha foundational programme. The 'Jaadui Pitara' - a multilingual play-based teaching kit - has been distributed in 22 Indian languages. However, just over half of govt and aided schools offer preschool, and aligning curriculum with infrastructure remains a challenge.In higher education, NEP's emphasis on flexibility is reflected in the rollout of the academic bank of credit (ABC), multiple entry-exit options and biannual admissions. As of July 2025, over 32 crore ABC IDs have been generated and 2,556 institutions onboarded. The new biannual admission cycle is expected to ease transitions and reduce dropouts.Between 2014-15 and 2022-23, higher education enrolment increased from 3.42 crore to 4.46 crore. Female enrolment increased 38.4%, from 1.57 crore to 2.18 crore. Female PhD enrolment jumped 135.6%, from 48,000 to 1.12 lakh. SC student enrolment rose by 50% and ST enrolment by 75%. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) among SCs increased from 18.9 lakh to 27.3 lakh, and among STs from 13.5 lakh to 23.5 lakh.Access also improved among minorities. Muslim student enrolment grew by 46.3%, from 15.3 lakh to 22.4 lakh, and other minorities by 61%, from 6.5 lakh to 10.5 lakh. The Northeast saw a 36% increase, with female students now slightly outnumbering males.Still, the transformation of single-discipline institutions has lagged. Though 35 universities have received Rs 100 crore each under PM-Usha, many engineering and teacher education colleges are yet to realign. Gaps in faculty development, curriculum design and infrastructure persist.While 153 universities offer multiple entry and 74 allow early exit, only about 31,000 undergraduates and 5,500 postgraduates have used these options so far - suggesting structural reforms are outpacing student uptake.","In higher education, enrolment has increased by over 30.5% since 2015, with female PhD enrolment more than doubling.

Government throws open IITs for students from gurukuls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-throws-open-iits-for-students-from-gurukuls/articleshow/122961118.cms,"NEW DELHI: Students who have studied in traditional gurukuls, even without formal academic degrees, will now have the opportunity to earn recognised qualifications and receive generous scholarships for research at premier IITs. The move marks a major shift in India's education policy, opening up elite research pathways for scholars from non-formal backgrounds rooted in classical learning.The initiative, titled 'Setubandha Vidwan Yojana', aims to bridge India's age-old gurukul tradition with modern scientific and academic inquiry. Backed by the ministry of education and implemented by the Indian Knowledge System (IKS) division of the Central Sanskrit University (CSU), the scheme offers fellowships of up to Rs 65,000 per month across 18 interdisciplinary fields - from ayurveda to cognitive science, and architecture to political theory, grammar to strategic studies, performing arts to mathematics, physics, and health sciences.""Setubandha is the first national-level programme to formally integrate traditional scholars into the research ecosystem of IITs, without insisting on conventional degrees. Instead, eligibility is based on a minimum of five years of rigorous study in a recognised gurukul and demonstrable excellence in Shastras or traditional knowledge,"" said a senior MoE official. The maximum age to apply is 32 years.Scholars selected under Category 1 (equivalent to postgraduate level) will receive a monthly fellowship of Rs 40,000 and an annual research grant of Rs 1 lakh.Those under Category 2 (equivalent to PhD level) will be awarded Rs 65,000 monthly and an annual grant of Rs 2 lakh. Some of the recognised research areas include Anvikshiki Vidya (philosophy and cognitive science), Ganit-Bhaut-Jyotish Vidya (mathematics, physics, astronomy), and Bhaishajya and Arogya Vidya (Ayurveda and health sciences).The scheme marks a significant institutional recognition of traditional knowledge systems, which for decades have operated outside formal academic structures. The NE explicitly calls for the integration of Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) into mainstream curricula and research, encouraging cross-disciplinary studies rooted in the country's intellectual heritage. With increasing global interest in ayurveda, yoga, Sanskrit linguistics, and indigenous governance systems, the govt sees this initiative as a way to empower traditional scholars and harness centuries-old wisdom for modern applications in science, technology, and social policy.In 2020, India more than just released a policy - it rekindled an ancient ideal. National Education Policy (NEP) placed learning at the heart of nation building, drawing from civilisational wisdom. Framed through one of the most participatory policy-making processes in history under late K Kasturirangan's guidance, NE was a visionary roadmap rooted in cultural values. It reimagined learning as a process free from confines of rote memorisation, rigid structures, and linguistic hierarchies. It set the stage for a holistic, inclusive and future-ready education system.Five years on, NEP's impact is visible in policy corridors and classrooms. In early childhood classrooms, play-based learning is displacing rote memorisation; children read fluently in their mother tongue; Class 6 students explore hands-on skills in vocational labs. Its imprint is visible in research hubs where India's knowledge systems engage in dialogue with cutting-edge science. NEP's vision is reflected in the rise of women in STEM fields and in the growing global presence of Indian institutions.Nipun Bharat Mission has improved learning outcomes, ensuring foundational literacy and numeracy by Class 2. Nipun Bharat's success, reflected in Aser 2024 and Parakh Rashtriya Sarvekshan 2024, has made classrooms spaces of curiosity and comprehension. Initiatives like Vidya Pravesh and institutionalisation of Balvatikas will help integrate early childhood care and education. Add to this new-age textbooks and introduction of Jaadui Pitara and e-Jaadui Pitara in 22 Indian languages. Over 14L teachers have completed Nishtha training, and platforms like Diksha have expanded access to teaching resources.NEP recognised language is not a hurdle but a powerful medium of empowerment. With 117 language primers developed and Indian Sign Language introduced as a subject, vision of multilingual, inclusive education is being realised at scale. Bhartiya Bhasha Pustak Yojana and National Digital Depository for Indian Knowledge Systems will democratise access to linguistic and civilisational learning.National Curriculum Framework for School Education and new textbooks for Classes 1 to 8 are in place. Prerna is a bridge programme to help curriculum transition and ensure students aren't overwhelmed but supported at each stage of their learning journey.Centrally sponsored schemes like Samagra Shiksha and PM Poshan have helped achieve near-universal enrolment. NEP's reach has extended to underserved populations. More than 7.12L girls from disadvantaged groups are enrolled in over 5,138 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas. Over 490 hostels have been sanctioned for PVTG learners and 692 hostels under Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan. Prashast, a programme that screens for disability, helps the schooling system become more resilient and inclusive.A key driver of the transformation under NE are 14,500 PM Shri schools. These modern, inclusive and green institutions are being developed as exemplary schools aligned with NEP's vision, redefining both infra and pedagogy. The Vidyanjali platform has connected over 8.2L schools with more than 5.3L volunteers and 2,000 CSR partners, directly benefitting 1.7cr students. In higher education, total enrolment has risen from 3.42cr to 4.46cr, a 30.5% increase. Women now comprise nearly 48% of all students, and female PhD enrolment has more than doubled from 0.48L to 1.12L. This expansion in enrolment, especially for SC, ST, OBC, and minority students, marks a historic achievement for inclusivity in higher education. Female GER has surpassed male GER for six consecutive years.Introducing Multiple Entry and Exit, Academic Bank of Credits with over 21.12cr APAAR IDs issued, and National Credit Framework have together provided flexibility and mobility. With 153 universities offering multiple entry and 74 multiple exit options, learning is not linear but modular and student-driven.NEP's emphasis on research and innovation has improved India's Global Innovation Index rank from 81st to 39th. Over 18,000 startups have been incubated across 400 HEIs. Anusandhan NRF, revamped PMRF 2.0, and the ₹6k cr One Nation One Subscription initiative show a commitment to decentralise access to research.Tech platforms like Swayam and Swayam Plus have recorded over 5.3cr enrolments. Support of Diksha and PM e-Vidya with over 200 DTH Channels ensures high-quality content is available countrywide. Digital learning ecosystem's success, including biannual admissions and dual degree regulations, has made higher education more inclusive, interdisciplinary, and industry-relevant. In QS World University Rankings 2026, 54 Indian institutions made the list, up from just 11 in 2014. Global universities Deakin, Wollongong, and Southampton have set up campuses in India.The journey of transformation is being celebrated through Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Samagam, but is being measured in the quiet confidence of learners, teachers, and parents. We must continue to green our campuses, expand critical research infra, and deepen learning outcomes. Under PM's leadership, education is not just policy but the greatest national investment. Where there is learning, there is progress. A billion minds unshackled and empowered aren't just a demographic dividend, but New India's supernova.","The initiative, titled 'Setubandha Vidwan Yojana', aims to bridge India's age- old gurukul tradition with modern scientific and academic inquiry.

But, Panda said, he was happy nobody could stop Tharoor from speaking in the country’s interest.Sources said Tharoor has expressed a wish to speak on Indian Ports Bill, with local interest being the Vizhinjam port in his constituency Thiruvananthapuram, recently inaugurated in a high-profile ceremony attended by the PM and netas across party lines.Tewari will speak on the twin legislations related to sports that are to come up soon for discussion in LS.Apparently, the Chandigarh MP had expressed desire to speak initially on the Pahalgam-Sindoor issue, but later plumped for the sports legislations.Sources said as per the inhouse system that includes “performance assessment”, an MP is named to speak on only one big issue to give chance to maximum members.The absence of Tharoor and Tewari has been noticed given they were eager participants in global outreach delegations. Tharoor’s repeated remarks in favour of govt’s claims about Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, and his contradiction of US President Trump’s “ceasefire” claims embarrassed Congress, and led to public arguments with the Congress managers.","Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari are not in the shortlist of speakers, while there is no clarity yet on Amar Singh.

CHENNAI/TRICHY :

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day visit to Tamil Nadu has come as a morale booster not just for BJP workers but also for AIADMK rank and file.His meeting with AIADMK netas, including Edappadi K Palaniswami , at the airport is being seen as a reaffirmation of the BJPAIADMK alliance amid recent public disagreements over power-sharing. Modi’s decision to not engage with O Panneerselvam has further reassured AIADMK cadres that BJP values its partnership ahead of the 2026 polls.For BJP workers, Modi’s participation in Aadi Thiruvathirai festival, highlighting Chola glory, served as a cultural counterpoint to DMK’s Keeladi narrative, which accuses BJP of trying to whitewash Tamil Nadu’s rich past.AIADMK is upbeat, especially since not only EPS but also second-rung netas like K P Munusamy, S P Velumani, and Thalavai Sundaram were permitted to receive Modi at the airport. “By rejecting OPS’s request, Modi has sent a signal — only those parties we are comfortable with will be part of alliance,” said senior AIADMK neta S Semmalai.BJP functionaries, too, say the visit has helped build agrassroots-level bond. Some AIADMK cadres who earlier felt EPS was being arm-twisted now see the partnership as voluntary and valued.“AIADMK mobilised cadres for PM’s Trichy roadshow, showing their commitment.We’ll reciprocate in all ways possible,” said Sriram Shankar, BJP’s Trichy district chief. Netas say they are more cautious about their remarks, aware that their actions impact alliance chemistry.Likewise, AIADMK workers in Trichy say their hesitations about working with BJP have eased after the visit. Many now want more such visits to smoothen ties. “We’ll join BJP roadshows in future too,” said one functionary.To cement this rapport further, BJP state chief Nainar Nagenthran will host a feast in Tirunelveli for EPS and AIADMK netas during EPS’s statewide tour. Initially scheduled for Aug 3, the feast was postponed due to Modi’s visit but will soon take place.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day visit to Tamil Nadu has come as a morale booster for BJP workers.

No pollution data from Haryana as all state AQI stations offline since April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-pollution-data-from-haryana-as-all-state-aqi-stations-offline-since-april/articleshow/122963786.cms,"No pollution data from Haryana as all state AQI stations offline since April

Gurgaon staring at no alerts, no enforcement in smog season

GURGAON: A large chunk of Delhi's neighbourhood has been pollution-blind since April and could remain so when toxic air over the region peaks in Oct-Nov, severely undermining mitigation strategies over India's most polluted airshed.All 29 air quality monitoring stations in Haryana operated by state pollution control board (HSPCB) have been offline since April 2 this year. The state's pollution data, meanwhile, has been coming from just two stations of the India Meteorological Department, one in Gurgaon and the other in Panchkula.HSPCB stations are offline because the board let the maintenance contract with the firm that had managed monitors for five years lapse without lining up a stopgap fix. Air monitoring stations began going offline after Oct 31 last year. By Dec 31, nearly 50% of the stations had stopped recording data, which is used by HSPCB and Central Pollution Control Board to issue daily pollution bulletins and by CAQM to formulate strategies for bad-air days.The stations progressively went on the blink till the whole network went down on April 2.On days when the IMD stations don’t record air quality because of glitches or other reasons, the state has no pollution data.This happened in Gurgaon for several days this month when the IMD station in Gwalpahari wasn’t working. A tender floated in May 2025 for an operator drew only one bidder. The bid was automatically disqualified under govt’s procurement rules that require at least two bidders for competitive selection. According to officials, the second round of tenders is still being prepared and is expected to be issued this week with a late-Aug deadline for submissions.Once bids are received, a lengthy evaluation follows. The process involves technical scrutiny, financial review, clearance by a high-powered committee and finally approval from the chief minister’s office. That, according to officials, could take 60 to 90 days. That means Haryana could enter peak smog season without real-time AQI data, without which there can be no alerts, no enforcement and no public warnings. These are all critical to Grap (graded response action plan), which usually comes into force from Oct 15.“There should have been a contingency plan. Even if you want to bring in a new vendor, you don’t shut off surveillance entirely. That’s like switching off CCTV in a high-crime zone because you are changing the camera vendor,” a senior HSPCB official admitted.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at Envirocatalysts, emphasised the importance of timely administrative decisions on bids for new contracts. “Decisions on opening bids for new contracts for govt services are usually planned well before the existing one ends, especially for maintaining such critical infrastructure as air quality monitoring in a state like Haryana, which lies in one of the most polluted areas. It’s unfortunate that this happened, but it should serve as a reminder to plan better for the future and for other states,” he said.Asked about it, HSPCB chairman Vineet Garg said the board has changed certain conditions in the tender and will be floating it by the end of July.While Grap’s implementation is based on Delhi’s AQI data, anti-pollution measures are enforced in all NCR cities after analysing indices recorded by local air monitors.“This blackout is likely to have serious consequences. Winter is the most polluted time of year in Haryana, with air quality often slipping into ‘very poor’ or ‘severe’ category due to stagnant weather, crop residue burning and fossil fuel emissions. Without functioning monitors, district authorities can’t track local AQI levels, identify pollution spikes, decide when to implement pollution curbs,” said Shubhansh Tiwari, research associate at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), adding that the state would essentially be forced to rely on Delhi data.The implication goes beyond Grap. Under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and its state-specific pollution control action plans, govt must track, report and demonstrate year-on-year improvements in air quality, all of which are data-dependent.Manoj Kumar, an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said with the entire network rendered non-functional, there is growing concern about the progress, or lack thereof, made over the past six months. “In the absence of real-time data, it is tough to assess if efforts are underway to restore the monitoring system ahead of the upcoming peak pollution season. This gap in information affects both public awareness and the ability to evaluate policy response,” Kumar added.The two monitors in Gurgaon and Panchkula cover just a fraction of the state’s urban and industrial landscape. “You can’t extrapolate Delhi’s air to Karnal or Hisar,” said a senior officer who is part of the clean air programme. “The pollution sources, local weather patterns, and emissions vary. A single reading from Gurgaon tells you nothing about what’s happening in Yamunanagar or Panipat,” he said. For that matter, a station in one part of a large city won't even capture the picture in another part of it.A study of the air quality data by CREA found that Jan 19, 2025, was Gurgaon’s “overshoot day”. By then, PM 2.5 concentration was already so high that even if levels were to drastically reduce to zero for the rest of the year, the city would still fail to meet the acceptable limit specified by World Health Organisation (WHO). The analysis ranked Gurgaon as the fifth most polluted Indian city in the first half of 2025.",All 29 air quality monitoring stations in Haryana operated by state pollution control board (HSPCB) have been offline since April 2 this year.

"Much confusion on who does what, even upkeep of drains: HC to Delhi government",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/much-confusion-on-who-does-what-even-upkeep-of-drains-hc-to-delhi-government/articleshow/122963747.cms,"'Multiplicity of agencies leads to passing of buck'

NEW DELHI: The time has come for Delhi government to take a comprehensive decision on how civic services should be managed, the high court said Monday, citing the ""enormous confusion"" among various agencies, even on the key issue of controlling waterlogging. This, it said, had led to ""passing the buck on most occasions"".It cited a ""glaring example"" of such confusion in the way stormwater drains fall under PWD, while sewage line maintenance is under MCD, lamenting that this has ""led to non-maintenance of either of the lines, leading to excessive flooding in Delhi"".""Neither of these drain pipes is being properly managed by the respective agency, which seems to be passing the responsibility to the other agency,"" a special bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Manmeet PS Arora noted.In most colonies, it added, stormwater drains were also blocked by residents or constructions, leaving them ""perpetually clogged"". Directing that its order be sent to the chief secretary, who in turn should place it before the highest functionaries of Delhi government, the court said the authorities must decide on centralising the administration and management of drains. If required, the matter would be placed before Delhi's lieutenant governor, the court added.The high court was hearing two suo motu petitions dealing with waterlogging and rainwater harvesting, besides easing traffic jams in the national capital during the monsoon and at other times of the year.In the pending petition, a fresh plea was filed by the Residents Welfare Association of Maharani Bagh, saying a new problem arose due to the action of the Delhi govt's public works department (PWD). The court has been examining various aspects related to the Taimur Nagar drain adjacent to Maharani Bagh colony and has been issuing directions from time to time.During the latest hearing, the bench was informed that certain well marks or holes were made in the walls on the ring road through which water flowed into the Maharani Bagh colony, flooding the area.The PWD argued that these were not new holes but well marks that already existed and were blocked by the residents and had now been opened. The court was also informed that the road was earlier with the PWD and is now with the MCD.The court noted that the residents' plea showed the apathy prevalent in Delhi due to multiple agencies functioning and pointed out that it has to summon agencies, including MCD, PWD, DJB, DDA, and the Irrigation and Flood Control Department, before it for a consensus to be arrived at, and for effective implementation of its directions.""Between these agencies, there is enormous confusion, which is caused due to improper delineation of responsibilities, leading to passing the buck on most occasions,"" the court said. On the Maharani Bagh issue, the bench directed the PWD and MCD to hold a meeting with the residents on Aug 2 after conducting a site inspection and file a joint status report on the efforts to solve the issue.The high court also sought the presence of an official from AIIMS to answer why there was a delay in clearances relating to the laying down of a new sewer pipeline in the area.","Delhi high court cites ""enormous confusion"" among various agencies.

"Government to overhaul accreditation system, operationalise AI centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-overhaul-accreditation-system-operationalise-ai-centre/articleshow/122962055.cms,"NEW DELHI: Marking five years of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre is set to announce a major reform in the accreditation system for higher education institutions by shifting to a binary model - 'accredited' or 'not accredited' - replacing the existing multi-tiered grading system. This means institutions will no longer be ranked against each other but assessed against uniform minimum standards.On the anvil is also the launch of a new 'Bharatiya Bhasha' digital tool for direct translations between Indian languages, bypassing English as a mediator. In addition, govt will operationalise a Centre of Excellence in AI in education, as announced in the 2025 Union Budget.These announcements are expected to be made on Tuesday at a national event commemorating the fifth anniversary of NEP-2020, in the presence of senior ministers, educationists and state representatives at the Bharat Mandapam here.The new accreditation model aims at simplifying the process and encourage wider participation among higher education institutions (HEIs). Unlike the earlier framework, which graded institutions (A++, A, B, etc.), the new binary system will require institutions to meet basic benchmarks to qualify as 'accredited'. A senior education ministry official said, ""The change was designed to address the reluctance of many HEIs to apply for accreditation due to the effort involved and uncertainty about securing a favourable grade.The shift comes in the wake of concerns over credibility and participation in the current accreditation regime, particularly following recent controversies around the functioning of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (Naac). Inconsistent grading patterns and allegations of opacity had drawn criticism from academics and policymakers, prompting a rethink of the process.Elaborating on the new approach, the official said, ""Under the new model, all institutions that meet benchmark standards will be treated equally in the first phase. Grading from 1 to 5 will follow in the second stage, expected to begin in the next five to six months. Institutions will climb the grading ladder sequentially - starting from Grade 1 - based on verified performance data.""The data validation will rely on a triangulation method, using multiple sources and tools to ensure accuracy, and will exclude Naac's direct involvement. Instead, only govt agencies and Institutions of National Importance will be engaged for verification, and there will be no physical inspections.The 'Bharatiya Bhasha' digital tool will allow seamless translations between Indian languages without routing through English - for instance, enabling direct translation from Assamese to Tamil. In higher education, the Centre of Excellence in AI in education is set to be formally launched to support research and integration of AI tools in teaching and learning.For school education, announcements are expected on targeted infrastructure improvement and expansion of access, including new buildings for Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas, with corresponding funding support.","New binary model - 'accredited' or 'not accredited' - to replace existing multi- tiered grading system.

"'Misplaced concerns': India slams UN Human Rights chief's remark on Kashmir, Manipur",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/misplaced-concerns-india-slams-un-human-rights-chiefs-remark-on-kashmir-manipur/articleshow/118695977.cms,"Arindam Bagchi (File photo/X)

NEW DELHI: India on Monday lashed out at the United Nations' human rights chief for making ""unfounded and baseless"" comments about Kashmir and Manipur.Slamming the UN's human rights body for having a ""misplaced concern,"" India took strong exception to generalised remarks that were ""cherry picking"" of the situation.Arindam Bagchi, Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations, said India ""continues to be a healthy, vibrant and pluralistic society"".""As India was mentioned by name, let me begin by emphasising that the world's largest democracy continues to be a healthy, vibrant and pluralistic society. Unfounded and baseless comments in the update contrast jarringly with ground realities,"" said Bagchi, who is also the International Organisations in Geneva Ambassador.India's strong retort came after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk, in his global update to the 58th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, mentioned India and referred to the situation in Manipur and Kashmir.According to news agency PTI, Bagchi said the people of India have ""repeatedly proven wrong such misplaced concerns about us"" and ""we would urge a better understanding of India and our civilizational ethos of diversity and openness, which continue to define our robust and often cacophonous civic space.""Bagchi said nothing illustrates this divergence more than the passing reference to Jammu and Kashmir, which Turk ""erroneously referred to as Kashmir"" in the global update.The Indian envoy further highlighted the irony of the UN human rights chief’s remarks, pointing out that this year had been particularly notable for the region's strides toward peace and inclusive progress. He cited key developments such as high voter participation in provincial elections, a thriving tourism industry, and a rapid pace of development.Pointing out the need for an authentic reassessment, Bagchi criticised the global update for its ""oversimplifications of complex issues, sweeping and generalised remarks, usage of loose terminologies and apparent cherry picking of situations.""He further remarked, ""The High Commissioner has sensed a pervasive unease, but we would submit that a key element to addressing this is a long and hard look in the mirror by the Office of the High Commissioner.""The UN human rights chief, in his global update, called for increased efforts to tackle violence and displacement in Manipur. ""I also call for stepped-up efforts to address violence and displacement in Manipur, based on dialogue, peacebuilding and human rights,"" he stated.Additionally, he expressed concerns about the use of restrictive laws against human rights defenders and independent journalists, which, he noted, has led to arbitrary detentions and a shrinking civic space, ""including in Kashmir.""Turk acknowledged India's democratic framework as a fundamental strength, stating, ""India's democracy and institutions have been its greatest strength, underpinning its diversity and development. Democracy requires constant nurturing of participation and inclusion at all levels of society.""His global update addressed conflicts and human rights issues in various regions, including Ukraine, Gaza, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and the United States. However, Pakistan was notably absent from the report.","India slams UN's human rights body for having a ""misplaced concern"" India took strong exception to generalised remarks that were ""cherry picking"" of the situation.

RAJKOT: A court in Dhoraji town, in Gujarat's Rajkot district, found a 22-year-old man guilty of raping a 14-year-old girl despite his DNA not matching her fetus; the conviction was based on other evidence and the survivor's statement.At the same time, the court, in its recent order, also ordered the Rajkot SP to conduct a departmental inquiry against the investigating officer (IO) for failure to probe two other suspected perpetrators named as her friends in the complaint lodged by the girl's aunt. Himkar Singh, SP, Rajkot, told TOI, ""According to the court's order, I have entrusted ASP Simran Bharadwaj with the departmental inquiry against the IO of the case.""

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose. And then, silence. Shahzadi was gone.""We did not hear from her afterward,"" Shamsher said Monday. They searched. They begged for news, combing through bureaucratic barriers, unanswered pleas. ""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said. ""She was a victim, not a criminal. She was innocent,"" Shamsher said. ""She only wanted to fix her scars.""

"Bogged down by internal issues, Mayawati appears uninterested in rebuilding BSP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bogged-down-by-internal-issues-mayawati-appears-uninterested-in-rebuilding-bsp/articleshow/118692498.cms,"BSP supremo Mayawati’s key decisions, like snapping the alliance with SP immediately after 2019 Lok Sabha results, triggered speculation that extraneous factors like govt pressure over her legal woes were dictating her moves

NEW DELHI: The expulsion of heir apparent Akash Anand from BSP, after having been appointed and sacked as the party face twice in less than a year, is emblematic of the fall in the Dalit outfit's fortunes.The party was reduced to a solitary seat out of 403 in UP assembly in 2022 elections and then failed to win any of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2024, even as its cadre and mid-rung leaders have streamed into rival SP in good numbers, boosting the strength of Akhilesh Yadav's ranks while also benefitting BJP in pockets.That encapsulates the misery of BSP over last five years - confusion at the top and erosion at the bottom. How did the party, once imperious in its appeal and strength and the byword for Dalit assertion, reach this miserable stage is difficult to fathom. But as it came after BJP's romp in UP in 2014 LS and 2017 assembly polls, Mayawati's key decisions like snapping the alliance with SP immediately after the 2019 Lok Sabha results in which it managed to win 10 seats, triggered speculation that extraneous factors like govt pressure over her legal woes were dictating her moves. Its choice of candidates in select constituencies in successive elections, which were seen as seeking to damage the BJP's rivals, only fanned the suspicion.As it stands today, BSP is without much of its votebase and without any legislative strength, while rivals BJP and SP both have benefitted from its fading from the scene. The 2024 LS polls have shown strong evidence that SP may emerge as a key destination for Dalit cadre, who are being wooed by BSP turncoats now leading the charge from Samajwadi benches.To many observers, signs of ""behenji"" bogged down in internal issues like succession, and suspicion of successors, instead of focusing on making a deft attempt at recouping the lost base suggests a distracted leader not keen on rebuilding. This is a confirmation of the party's obituaries that emerged in the wake of the 2022 UP election disaster. Few, including close followers, are willing to give the BSP another chance at re-emergence, despite the party retaining a wistful goodwill among its core vote base that is drifting to other options.As a labour of love of the tireless Kanshi Ram, BSP was a trailblazer, the first of the political platforms of Dalits which captured the imagination of the downtrodden and then showed enough realpolitik to become an indispensable political player. Anchored in the largest state of UP, it had appeal across states and became a sub-regional force in many of them. If it was not a player, it was a good enough spoiler. And if it was not a political choice of social groups, it asserted itself as a moral authority on emancipation. Now, BSP risks being nothing than a spent force all around.",The expulsion of heir apparent Akash Anand from BSP is emblematic of the fall in the Dalit outfit's fortunes.

The problem is worsened by autos encroaching on the left-most lanes. On the opposite side, govt buses are often forced to stop in the middle of the road to drop passengers, despite a designated bus bay.By shifting mofussil bus operations to Kilambakkam, police expect smoother movement of MTC buses and local vehicles through the area, where traffic delays of 10 to 15 minutes have become routine.","Starting Tuesday, all govt mofussil buses from southern districts will terminate at Kilambakkam instead of Tambaram.

NEW DELHI: A couple arrested by ED from Punjab on Friday, who had masterminded a multi-level marketing fraud by duping investors with promises of handsome rental value on purchase of cloud space & leasing it back, has been remanded in ED custody.On Saturday, a special PMLA court in Jalandhar remanded Sukhvinder Singh Kharour to 10 days and Dimple Kharour to five days in ED custody. They allegedly collected over Rs 3,500 crore in past 2-3 years and siphoned off the ""proceeds of crime"".Look out notices were issued after they went underground. At least 26 luxury cars worth Rs 80 crore (belonging to the couple) were seized by ED last month. ED also attached other assets in Punjab, totalling Rs 178 crore.""The cloud sale and lease back model was found non-existent to cheat the investors. The proceeds of crime of Rs 3,558 crore (ascertained so far) generated out of criminal activities were diverted by VMSL (Vuenow Marketing Services Ltd) and group companies in giving commission to channel partners, purchase of various luxurious vehicles, gold and diamonds, routing of hundreds of crores through shell entities and further investment in properties,"" ED said.The accused created multiple shell entities to siphon off proceeds of crime. Huge funds were also diverted into bank accounts of Dimple and to film production units controlled by her, such as Kharour Films LLP, Fruitchaat Entertainment Pvt and Avni ITInfra Ventures Ltd, in which she is a director. However, these companies do not have any relation with the cloud particle business VMSL that collected huge funds from investors, the agency said.ED was on the lookout for the influential couple who had evaded arrest in Punjab for a long time despite several complaints of cheating and fraud. The central agency finally registered an FIR in Noida and with the help of UP Police issued a look out notice. Officials coordinated with international enforcement agencies that helped in tracing the accused in Nepal from where they were sent to India.

Government did not support us,"" he said.Shabbir Khan had approached the Delhi high court, urging the MEA to intervene in his daughter's case and seek clarity on her legal status. However, with confirmation of her execution, the court disposed of his plea.Shahzadi, a 33-year-old woman from Banda district in Uttar Pradesh, had been working in Abu Dhabi since December 2021 as a caregiver for an Emirati family. The case stemmed from the death of an infant under her care in December 2022, allegedly following routine vaccinations. Initially, the child's parents waived further investigation, but in February 2023, a video surfaced allegedly showing Shahzadi confessing to the murder, a confession her family claimed was obtained through coercion.She was arrested on February 10, 2023, and sentenced to death on July 31, 2023. Her appeals were dismissed, and the death sentence was reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation on February 28, 2024.Shahzadi's family contested the conviction, alleging that she was forced into confessing and denied fair representation. Despite legal assistance provided by the Indian Embassy, her clemency plea faced significant hurdles. Her father, Shabbir Khan, submitted multiple petitions, including one to the Indian Embassy in May 2024, but received no favourable response.On February 14, 2025, Shahzadi reportedly made a distress call to her father, hinting at her imminent execution. Desperate, Shabbir filed an urgent plea with the MEA on February 20, seeking an update on her legal status. However, before any intervention could be secured, the execution was carried out.MEA officials assured that they are extending all necessary assistance to the family, and Shahzadi's last rites are set for March 5. The Indian Embassy has also provided a dedicated contact number for the family to coordinate further arrangements.","Shahzadi Khan, 33, was convicted of murdering an infant under her care. The highest court of the UAE, the Court of Cassation, upheld the sentence. Her father, Shabbir Khan, submitted multiple petitions, including one to the Indian Embassy in May 2024, but received no favourable response.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118688058,imgsize-858521,width-400,resizemode-4/118688058.jpg"
Israel presses India for a ban on Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-presses-india-for-a-ban-on-hamas/articleshow/118692235.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid its ongoing effort to clear out the Gaza Strip of Hamas, Israel continues to press India for the group's designation as a terrorist organisation. The immediate provocation on this occasion for seeking its listing as a terror group is the presence of several Hamas leaders in POK last month on "" Kashmir Solidarity Day "".This was possibly the first time that Hamas leaders, who were joined by members of UN proscribed terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), travelled to POK. Israel is learnt to have discussed this with the Indian authorities. Despite its unqualified support for Israel on terrorism, and strong condemnation of the October 7 2023 terror attacks on Israel, India has not banned Hamas, even as many countries, including the US and EU, have designated it as a terrorist organisation.In 2023, Israel had banned Pakistan-based LeT, which carried out the Mumbai attacks. Israel's then ambassador to India Naor Gilon had expressed hope India too would proscribe Hamas, saying information about the group's terrorist activities had been shared with Indian govt.Whether or not there's a proposal to ban Hamas is a question that has also been raised in Indian Parliament, but external affairs ministry has responded so by only saying that designation of an organisation as terrorist is covered under UAPA and is considered as per provisions of the Act by relevant govt departments.In a fine balancing act, India, while backing Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, has continued to maintain its ties with Palestinian people, reiterating support for a negotiated two-state solution, and establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognised borders, living side by side in peace with Israel. India also supports Palestine's membership of the UN.","Israel is learnt to have discussed this with the Indian authorities.

Mohamed defends her remarks

NEW DELHI: Just a day before India’s semifinal match against New Zealand , a political bouncer rattled Congress after party spokesperson Shama Mohamed took a swing at Indian men's cricket team captain Rohit Sharma , calling him ""fat"" and a ""mediocre captain."" Her remarks, made after Rohit got out during India's Champions Trophy clash against New Zealand, have sparked a fiery debate, with politicians from all sides weighing in, and Congress distancing itself from the remark.The Congress leader had taken to social media on Sunday, criticising Sharma's physical fitness and calling him a ""mediocre captain."" ""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" she wrote in a now-deleted post.She went on to compare him unfavourably to cricketing greats like MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Sachin Tendulkar.After facing heavy criticism, Mohamed defended her comments, insisting they were observations rather than body-shaming. ""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming,"" she told ANI, adding that she had every right to express her opinion in a democracy.Congress leader Pawan Khera said that Mohamed had been asked to delete her posts and exercise greater caution in the future. ""Her remarks do not reflect the party's position. She has been advised to be more careful,"" Khera wrote on X.Congress MP Rajani Patil condemned Mohamed's comments, saying, ""I personally and the party also will not approve of body-shaming anyone. Talking this way about a sportsperson who represents the country is not right. The party will seek a response from her on this.""BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla attacked the Congress, saying, ""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling Rohit Sharma unimpressive! I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain.""BJP leader Pradeep Bhandari accused Congress of opposing patriotic figures. ""The Congress party is trying to send a message that every patriot, who does good for the country, will be opposed by them,"" he said.Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya also weighed in on the controversy and suggested political parties to leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives.In a social media post on X, Mandaviya said, ""Congress and TMC should leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives. Remarks made by leaders from these parties, indulging in body shaming and questioning an athlete’s place in the team, are not only deeply shameful but also outright pathetic.""""Such comments undermine the hard work and sacrifices that our sportspersons make to represent the country on the global stage,"" he added.TMC MP Saugata Roy supported Mohamed’s critique, arguing, ""I heard that Rohit Sharma's performance has been quite poor. He scored one century, but otherwise gets out cheaply. He shouldn’t be in the team. India wins because of other players.""Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi took a different stand, saying, ""Not an avid cricket fan, but even with my limited interest in the game, I can say that Rohit Sharma, with extra pounds or without, has led India to great heights. It is his work and commitment that matter. Win the trophy, Champion!""Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam strongly opposed Mohamed’s remarks, calling them disrespectful. ""Rohit Sharma and other cricketers like him are heroes of our country. Only Congress people can feel good about criticising such people. The anti-India mentality appears to be expanding from top to bottom.""BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia condemned the remarks and said its ""unfortunate"" that such remarks were made before the semifinal match.""It's very unfortunate this kind of remarks come from such a person who is on a responsible post to our captain, on a meanwhile time when India is playing an ICC tournament and the team is all set to play Semi final,"" he told ANI.Despite the backlash, Mohamed doubled down on her stance, questioning Sharma’s leadership choices in key matches. She cited his decisions during India's Test series against Australia and the World Cup final loss in Ahmedabad, arguing that his strategic calls had cost the team. ""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1, which backfired? Because of that, Shubman Gill was out of the XI. Didn’t we lose the last World Cup in Ahmedabad?""Later while speaking to ANI, Shama said that her comments were not meant to body-shame the Indian captain but were a general observation on athlete fitness.“It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that,” she said. “I have been attacked for no reason. When I compared him with previous captains, I put in a statement. I have the right. What is wrong in saying? It is a democracy,” she added.","Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed took to social media to criticise captain Rohit Sharma.

PM Modi goes on Lion Safari at Gir National Park in Gujarat

Government's Project Lion

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , on the occasion of the World Wildlife Day , went on a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat's Junagadh district on Monday.PM Modi, who is on the Gujarat tour, visited the forest with some ministers and senior forest department officials accompanying him.Modi had a night halt at Sinh Sadan, a forest guest house managed by the state forest department, in Sasan after his arrival from Somnath where he offered prayers at the Lord Shiv temple, the first among 12 jyotirlingas, on Sunday evening.At Sasan Gir , the headquarters of the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, the prime minister will also chair the seventh meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL).After the meeting, Modi will also interact with some women forest staffers at Sasan.The NBWL has 47 members, including the Chief of Army Staff, members from different states, representatives from NGOs working in this field, chief wildlife wardens and secretaries from various states.""This morning, on World Wildlife Day, I went on a Safari in Gir, which, as we all know, is home to the majestic Asiatic Lion. Coming to Gir also brings back many memories of the work we collectively did when I was serving as Gujarat CM. In the last many years, collective efforts have ensured that the population of Asiatic Lions is rising steadily. Equally commendable is the role of tribal communities and women from surrounding areas in preserving the habitat of the Asiatic Lion ,"" PM Modi wrote on X.The Prime Minister also shared the photos he clicked during the safari. ""Lions and lionesses in Gir! Tried my hand at some photography this morning,"" PM Modi wrote on X.Project Lion is an initiative launched by the central government on August 15, 2020, aimed at conserving and expanding the population of Asiatic lions in Gujarat.With a 10-year plan and a budget of Rs 2,927.71 crore, the project focuses on various strategies, including habitat and population management, wildlife health, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, community participation, tourism development, scientific research, training, eco-development, and biodiversity conservation.As of 2020, the Asiatic lion population in Gujarat was estimated at 674 individuals, spread across 53 talukas in 9 districts, covering nearly 30,000 square kilometers. A significant aspect of Project Lion is the development of the Barda Wildlife Sanctuary as a 'second home' for lions. Due to natural spread and successful breeding, Barda now hosts 17 lions, including 6 adults and 11 cubs.Additionally, a National Referral Center for Wildlife Health has been approved, with 20.24 hectares of land allocated in New Pipaliya, Junagadh District. A high-tech monitoring center and a state-of-the-art veterinary hospital have also been established in Sasan to monitor wildlife in the Gir region.Project Lion represents a transformative effort in India's conservation journey, aiming to ensure the long-term survival and well-being of Asiatic lions through comprehensive strategies and community involvement.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi went on a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat's Junagadh district on Monday.

The allegations were made by the party’s Empowered Action Group of Leaders and Experts (EAGLE), which has called the issue a grave threat to India’s democratic fabric.""The cover is now blown. It is clear that the ruling BJP wins or attempts to win elections by manipulating voter lists in connivance with the Election Commission. Which is why the process of appointment of the Election Commissioners is so critical to the Narendra Modi government that it subverted a Supreme Court ruling to have a balanced committee to appoint Election Commissioners,"" the Congress said in a post on X.The Congress had set up an eight-member team EAGLE last month to keep a “bird’s eye view” of elections in the country and “monitor the conduct of free and fair elections by the Election Commission”. The panel includes Congress leaders Ajay Maken, Digvijaya Singh, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Praveen Chakravarty, Pawan Khera, Gurdeep Singh Sappal, Nitin Raut and Challa Vamshi Chand Reddy.According to the statement by the EAGLE, multiple voters were found registered under the same voter ID number within the same constituency and even across different states. The party called this an unprecedented violation of electoral integrity, comparing it to multiple vehicles being registered under the same license plate number.During the Maharashtra assembly elections held in 2024, the Congress claimed the EC registered an astonishing 40 lakh new voters within just five months—far exceeding the 32 lakh new voter registrations recorded over the entire previous five-year period (2019-2024).“These new voters, suspiciously, seem to have voted overwhelmingly for the BJP-led alliance in Maharashtra, significantly impacting the election results in their favor,” the Congress alleged.The Congress further claimed that when initially confronted with evidence of duplicate voter IDs, the EC dismissed concerns, stating that a voter ID number may be repeated across states but remains unique within a state. However, subsequent findings contradicted this claim, exposing instances of identical voter IDs being used within the same constituency. The party accused the EC of deliberate silence following these revelations.The Congress alleged that the ruling BJP has manipulated the electoral process in collaboration with the EC to secure victories. The party also criticised the Modi government for overriding a Supreme Court directive aimed at ensuring a balanced appointment process for Election Commissioners.“This is a grave danger to India’s democracy,” a statement from the Congress read. “Babasaheb Ambedkar envisioned an independent Election Commission to safeguard elections from executive interference. We will not let this issue fade away and will pursue legal, political, and legislative remedies,” it said.",The Congress has accused the Election Commission of being complicit in large- scale voter list manipulation.

RAIPUR: A hardcore Maoist - described by police as ""Bijapur's most violent Naxal commander"" - who was involved in multiple ambushes that claimed the lives of at least 100 security personnel has surrendered before Bijapur police.Cops identified him as Dinesh Modiyam , secretary of Gangaloor committee - a unit feared for brutal murders of villagers, off-duty police personnel, and even fellow cadres. He was in the rank of ""divisional committee member"" in the insurgent outfit, said an officer.Dinesh and his wife Kala Tati, a Maoist ""area committee member"", came with their child to surrender. Police said he gave up arms because he feared for his own life. Now that the Maoist organisation is battered and its cadres scattered with haphazard command and control, Dinesh's bloodthirsty past was coming back to haunt him, and he feared he would be killed by his own men, said an officer.Dinesh's surrender is being seen as a body blow to Maoists but it puts the Chhattisgarh administration in a quandary.","Dinesh Modiyam was secretary of Gangaloor committee - a unit feared for brutal murders of villagers, off-duty police personnel, and even fellow cadres.

'Have babies immediately': Stalin amid delimitation row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-babies-immediately-stalin-amid-delimitation-row/articleshow/118692438.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin

TRICHY: Tamil Nadu 's crusade against delimitation took ""baby steps"" towards a full-blown public showdown with the Centre on Monday, with CM M K Stalin calling on newlyweds to ""immediately"" have children for the state to have an upper hand when the exercise is rolled out in over a year.The CM was speaking at a wedding ceremony in Nagapattinam, suggesting that the state's successful population control has now turned out to be a disadvantage. ""With policies such as delimitation that Union govt is planning to implement, we cannot say that (population control is a success). So I would now urge newlyweds to immediately have babies and give them good Tamil names,"" Stalin said.This comes as the governing DMK and the CM have accused the BJP-led Centre of hatching a conspiracy to reduce constituencies in TN under the garb of delimitation. ""It is a danger aimed at reducing our representation and crushing our voice,"" Stalin said at a political event later.Stalin had previously described the proposed delimitation as a ""sword"" hanging over southern states. Congress-governed Karnataka and Telangana have extended support to Stalin on the issue.The CM urged parties, boycotting a March 5 all-party meeting, to set aside political differences and speak in a unified voice against delimitation as well as the Centre's three-language policy under the New Education Policy. The appeal came as BJP , NTK, and TMC opted out of the meeting. ""We (DMK) have invited all parties. Many have agreed to participate, but some are planning to skip. I urge them once again to reconsider and join,"" Stalin said.The CM accused the Centre of imposing the three-language policy and deliberately withholding funds. ""Even children in TN understand this conspiracy. Recently, a girl from Cuddalore donated Rs 10,000, saying, 'If the Union government won't provide funds, I will.' This reflects the prevailing sentiment in the state, which the BJP-NDA fails to grasp,"" Stalin said.","Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin calls on newlyweds to ""immediately"" have children for the state to have an upper hand when the exercise is rolled out in over a year.

Prevalence of excess weight among Indians up nearly five-fold in 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prevalence-of-excess-weight-among-indians-up-nearly-five-fold-in-30-years/articleshow/118692424.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Prevalence of excess weight among people in India has gone up nearly five times in the past 30 years - from approximately 53 million in 1990 to 236 million in 2021, claims a new study published in The Lancet.If action is not taken to curb this growing public health challenge, the study warns, the overweight and obesity prevalence in the country may go up to over 521 million (projected) - the second highest globally, by 2050. China, which was estimated to have approximately 464 million overweight or obese persons in 2021, is likely to have the highest number of persons with the lifestyle disorder at 696 million (projected) in the next 30 years, the study suggests.The study is based on an analysis of 1,350 unique data sources, including all major multi-country and national survey data. For individuals older than 18 years, overweight has been defined as having a BMI of 25 kg/m² to less than 30 kg/m² and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher. For individuals younger than 18 years, the definitions were based on the International Obesity Task Force criteria.Importantly, the authors note that more recent generations are gaining weight faster than previous ones and obesity is occurring earlier, increasing the risk of complications such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and multiple cancers occurring at younger ages.For example, in high-income countries, approximately 7% of men born in the 1960s were living with obesity at the age of 25, but this increased to around 16% for men born in the 1990s and is forecast to reach 25% for men born in 2015.The authors have called for a five-year action plan (2025-30) to curb the rise in obesity globally and help form new goals and targets for the post-2030 Sustainable Development Goal-era. ""Preventing obesity must be at the forefront of policies in low- and middle-income countries,"" said co-lead author Dr Jessica Kerr.""Policy action in these regions must balance the challenges of over-nutrition with under-nutrition and stunting, with interventions ranging from support for nutritional diets and regulating ultra-processed foods to promoting maternal and child health programmes that encourage pregnant women to follow a healthy diet and breastfeed. This is no time for business as usual. Many countries only have a short window of opportunity to stop much greater numbers shifting from overweight to obesity,"" she said.Kerr stressed on the need to transform diets within sustainable global food systems and to support comprehensive strategies that improve people's nutrition, physical activity and living environments, whether it is too much processed food or not enough parks.Recently, PM Narendra Modi raised the issue of growing incidence of obesity in the country and suggests ways, including reduction of intake of cooking oil in all households, to curb the problem.","China is likely to have the highest number of persons with the lifestyle disorder at 696 million in the next 30 years.

AHMEDABAD: A 19-year-old UP native living incognito in Faridabad and suspected of preparing for an attack on Ram temple in Ayodhya was arrested in a joint operation Sunday, soon after Gujarat police's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) got wind of the alleged ISI-engineered plot and teamed up with Haryana's Special Task Force (STF) to bust the alleged terror network.The arrest of Abdul Rehman Abu Bakar , who had been lying low in Faridabad under the assumed identity of Shankar, led investigators to a suspected accomplice and a hideout where they found two hand grenades provided by ISI handlers through a network linked to the Islamic State of Khorasan Province.A bomb disposal squad safely defused the explosives in Faridabad, ATS sources said.

NEW DELHI: An Indian woman on death row in Abu Dhabi for the alleged murder of a four-month-old infant was executed on February 15, the Centre informed Shahzadi Khan’s horrified family in Delhi high court on Monday.Indian embassy was informed about execution only on Feb 28. “It is over. She was executed on Feb 15. Her last rites will be held on March 5,” a senior law officer representing Centre told Justice Sachin Datta.HC was hearing the woman’s father’s plea seeking the MEA’s intervention to find out about her well-being. “It is very unfortunate,” the court said, even as additional SG Chetan Sharma assured the court that embassy officials & the petitioner were in touch and arrangements were being made so the family could attend daughter’s last rites in UAE.We did our best to save Shahzadi. We hired a law firm there to represent her in court. But the laws there treat the death of an infant severely, additional SG Chetan Sharma said.

The guidelines should not lead to censorship. But to say it is a free for all is also very dangerous,” a bench of Justice Surya Kant and N K Singh said.The Supreme Court had on Feb 18 given Allahbadia a dressing down before staying his arrest in FIRs lodged in Thane and Guwahati.The court allowed Allahbadia to hold his shows on the condition that he would not violate traditional Indian norms on decency and morality.“There should be some element of control so that free speech is not misused but the regulations cannot impinge on freedom of speech,” the bench said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the govt was all for it.“Government is also against any censorship of free speech. But in the name of comedy, one cannot broadcast something which is indecent, vulgar and perverse. Freedom of speech is precious, it must be protected. But perversity cannot be freedom of speech. The young generation must be protected from such shows,” Mehta said.Allahbadia’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud pleaded with the court to stay the arrest and relax its Feb 18 condition — not to hold any show till further orders — and said 280 people worked with Allahbadia and their livelihood would be jeopardised if the petitioner was prevented from running his show.Taking into account the apology and remorse expressed by Allahbadia, the SC agreed to relax the condition but warned that he should not be seen violating traditional Indian societal norms on decency and morality in any of his shows. On his request to allow him to visit foreign countries, the bench said it would be considered after he cooperated with the investigations being carried out by police in Maharashtra and Assam.“We know one of your associates who went to Canada and made all kinds of comments on the court order,” the bench said, inviting an immediate clarification from Chandrachud that his client had nothing to do with the show broadcast from Canada. He said the person concerned was a copanelist with Allahbadia in the controversial show and there was no other connection between the two. “Such was the vulgarity, obscenity and the rotten level of humour and language used by Allahbadia in the show that no family could have sat together and watched that kind of a show,” the SG said.On the warning of ‘adults only’ for the show, Mehta said a child could not be allowed access to such shows under the specious ruse that the producers had sounded the ‘adults only’ warning. “Our standards of morality and decency differ from the western world,” he added.“Government also is against censorship, but there should be some regulation on such use of profanity which militates against the morality and decency of society. There are comedians who are very critical of the govt yet make shows without crossing the limits. They employ good humour, which can be watched by one and all,” Mehta said.The bench told Mehta that the Union govt should discuss with all stakeholders to deliberate what safeguards and measures are needed to regulate free speech, but these must not amount to censorship.","Supreme Court ruled out censorship of freedom of speech and said it remained sacrosanct if it conformed to reasonable restrictions. However, it clarified that this was not a licence to broadcast on social media platforms filthy words and depraved thoughts that militate against decency and morality.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118692100,imgsize-814959,width-400,resizemode-4/118692100.jpg"
SC seeks government’s response on social media blocking rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-seeks-governments-response-on-social-media-blocking-rules/articleshow/118692085.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a PIL that challenged the constitutional validity of a provision of ‘ Blocking Rules, 2009 ’ on the ground that it violated the right of content creators to be heard by authorities, who preferred to direct social media platforms to block content.Appearing for PIL petitioner organisation ‘Software Freedom Law Centre’, senior advocate Indira Jaising told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran that under Rule 9 of Blocking Rules, authorities had the freedom to issue notice either to the content creator or the social media platform which hosted the content. Be it Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other social media platforms, authorities give blocking notices only to them to avoid giving reasons to the content creator for deciding to block certain posts, Jaising said.“The arbitrary use of Rule 9 as an emergency provision to block user content without any prior notification leaves the originator of the content no mechanism of relief due to the lack of a notice, a reasoned order, and an opportunity to be heard. These rights are intrinsic to freedom of speech and expression, and the right to receive information, which can be granted to the originator even as the blocking order is in effect,” she said. Though the bench said it would have been appropriate for any content creator who was aggrieved by non-issuance of notice to him/her prior to blocking of content to move court, it decided to issue notice to Centre and sought its response in six weeks.Jaising said the intermediary, which hosts the content, was under no obligation to seek aresponse or clarification from the content creator when authorities gave it notice for blocking certain content, thus leaving the content creator with no remedy to retrieve the content and repost it. “An intermediary is merely providing a platform for hosting information and has no means to understand or justify the originator’s defence against the blocking order, nor does the intermediary have a vested interest in defending the originator’s content. Such a process thus renders the blocking process inherently unfair and violative of the fundamental rights of the originator,” the petitioner said.","Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a PIL that challenged the constitutional validity of a provision of ‘ Blocking Rules, 2009 ’ The PIL claimed that authorities had the freedom to issue notice to the content creator or the social media platform which hosted the content.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118692086,imgsize-303064,width-400,resizemode-4/118692086.jpg"
"After 75 years of Constitution, cops must understand free speech: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-75-years-of-constitution-cops-must-understand-free-speech-sc/articleshow/118692065.cms,"Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday questioned Gujarat police for lodging an FIR against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi over a social media post with a poem, ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno (those who are bloodthirsty listen to us)’.The piece is about promoting non-violence and is not related to any religion or antinational activity, the court said, noting that there is nothing objectionable about it. “Some sensitivity has to be shown by police. They should have read the poem before taking action”, SC said while disapproving of the FIR. “In 75 years of the existence of the Constitution, freedom of speech and expression has to be at least now understood by police,” it said.At the outset of the hearing on the politician’s plea for quashing of the FIR, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan read out the English translation of the poem, which said, ‘Those who are blood thirsty listen to us. Even if the fight for justice is met with injustice, we will meet that injustice with love’.“This (poem) actually promotes non-violence. It has nothing to do with religion, this has nothing to do with any anti-national activity. Police have shown lack of sensitivity,” SC said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, said people took Pratapgarhi's social media posts in different ways which created the problem. The bench responded, “This is the problem. Now, nobody has any respect for creativity.” At this stage, senior senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Congress MP, intervened and said the apex court should also say something about Gujarat High Court which approved lodging of the FIR. However, this was strongly opposed by Mehta who said the court should not venture in that area.Though the court hinted in no uncertain terms that criminal proceedings against the MP were not required, it reserved its order. “Something needs to be said” in the case which would be reflected in the judgment, it said.The SC had earlier granted interim relief to Pratapgarhi by stopping all steps in pursuance of the FIR. The FIR was registered over an Instagram post featuring a video clip with the poem ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno’ running in the background.The FIR was registered by City A-Division police station, Jamnagar, against him for hurting religious sentiments and promoting enmity between different groups Pratapgarhi had first approached Gujarat HC for quashing of criminal proceedings but the HC on Jan 17 refused to quash the FIR, saying there was a need for further investigation. It had said the poem's tenor indicated something about the throne and that responses to the social media post also suggested a potential disturbance in social harmony.“Looking to the tenor of the poem, it certainly indicates something about the throne. The responses received to the said post by other persons also indicate that message was posted in a manner which certainly create disturbance in social harmony. It is expected from any citizen of India that he should behave in a manner where communal harmony or social harmony should not be disturbed and the petitioner, who is a Member of Parliament, is expected to behave in a more restricted manner as he is expected to know more about the repercussions of such a post,” the HC had said.Immediately after the Gujarat HC order, Pratapgarhi rushed to the apex court which on Jan 21 granted him protection. Noting that he had not been arrested in the case so far, SC had said “no further steps shall be taken in any manner on the basis of the FIR”.","The piece is about promoting non-violence and is not related to any religion or antinational activity, the court said. “Some sensitivity has to be shown by police. They should have read the poem before taking action”, SC said while disapproving of the FIR.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118692051,imgsize-605267,width-400,resizemode-4/118692051.jpg"

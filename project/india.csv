KANPUR: Nine bank managers, three crop insurance staffers, and 32 farmers - 14 of them landless - have been booked after Rs 68 lakh was fraudulently transferred to 35 ""landless"" farmers as compensation for crop losses in Uttar Pradesh's Farrukhabad district in violation of Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme (PMCIS) rules.Deputy director (agriculture) filed two FIRs. The case pertains to the 2024 rabi season, during which HDFC Ergo had insured crops of 8,849 farmers.

Road ministry to do away with arbitration for disputes in NH sector which are for over Rs 10cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/road-min-to-do-away-with-arbitration-for-disputes-in-nh-sector-which-are-over-10cr/articleshow/126241885.cms,"NEW DELHI: Seeking to end alleged malpractices in high-value arbitration cases, including concerns over undue influence to obtain favourable rulings, the road transport ministry will do away with the provision of arbitration for disputes in the highway sector which are over Rs 10 crore.As per the finalised changes in contract norms, disputes valuing more than Rs 10 crore will be dealt only through conciliation or mediation. In case of no resolution, parties can take the matter to civil courts. The new norm would be applicable for all types of contracts - Build-Operate-Toll-Transfer (BOT-Toll), Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) and Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC).The changes in the contract conditions are being made based on a study of arbitration practices in the past 10-15 years. People familiar with the issue said that between 2015 and 2025, there were nearly 2,600 arbitration awards in the highways sector where contractors had raised disputes of around Re 90,000 crore and the arbitration award was little over Rs 30,000 crore in these cases.

‘We Will Win In The End’: Kuldeep Sengar’s Daughter Speaks After SC order On Unnao Rape Sentence

'Public servant'

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a week-old Delhi high court order granting bail to former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, convicted of raping a minor in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao, during pendency of his appeal against conviction and ensured that he is not released from prison.Departing from the general practice of the apex court not interfering with HC orders granting bail, a bench of CJI Surya Kant, and Justices J K Maheshwari and A G Masih said the case against Sengar and the way the HC granted him bail raises several questions of law requiring deeper consideration.""Keeping in mind these peculiar circumstances, we deem it appropriate to stay the operation of the impugned order dated Dec 23 passed by HC. Consequently, the respondent (Sengar) shall not be released from custody..."" the bench said.One of the issues raised by CBI through solicitor general Tushar Mehta was that the HC failed to appreciate that Sengar, a public servant being an MLA, was in a dominant position and hence his offence of raping a minor girl must be construed as an aggravated form of sexual assault under IPC and Pocso Act Such an act under Pocso warrants stringent punishment, which under IPC shall not be less than 10 years imprisonment and could extend up to the entire natural life of the convict.When Sengar's counsels, senior advocates N Hariharan and Sidharth Dave, questioned the CBI contention about Sengar being a public servant, CJI Kant-led bench said, ""We are worried that if the proposition advanced by the convict is accepted then a patwari will be considered a public servant but not MPs and MLAs."" The bench sought Sengar's response to CBI's appeal and posted the matter for further consideration on Jan 20.Mehta said, ""A person may not be a 'public servant' for the purpose of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, but may still be a 'public servant' within the meaning of the Pocso Act if he is in such a dominant position as contemplated in other categories of Section 5.""""Considering the intent, object and purpose of the POCSO Act, an elected representative who wields enormous power and is in a position of dominance over children will have to be treated as a 'public servant' for the purposes of the Act, particularly when the Respondent Accused (Sengar) was an MLA of the same constituency where the victim/survivor resided,"" he said.""We are conscious of the fact that ordinarily when a convict/under-trial has been released on bail pursuant to an order passed by the trial court or the high court, such order shall not be stayed by this Court without hearing such person,"" the SC bench said. ""However, the instant matter revolves around certain unique facts and circumstances, wherein the respondent-convict is also separately convicted and sentenced in a case under Section 304 Part II of the IPC and is consequently still in custody. We are informed that in such proceedings also, the respondent-convict has applied for bail, and after hearing the arguments, the order is said to have been reserved by the concerned court.""The bench said the rape survivor had a statutory right to file a separate appeal against the HC order and required no SC permission. ""In case she needs any free legal aid, the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee is directed to provide such services to her. However, she may, if so advised, file her appeal through counsel of her own choice,"" it said.Hariharan pointed out innuendoes being hurled at the judges of HC bench which granted bail to Sengar and said some allegations going viral on social media were contemptuous. Mehta said the judges in HC division bench were among the finest in the country with unimpeachable integrity and condemned the personal attack unleashed against them.""There are always some elements who attempt to browbeat honest judges. Such devious forces must not be encouraged. The opinion of party (CBI) which lost before the bench of these two honest and brilliant judges must put an end to this controversy generated by some unscrupulous vested interests,"" he said.The bench agreed and said it is not uncommon that even the most brilliant and honest judges commit an error. ""These two HC judges are among the finest. But we (judges) are all prone to committing errors,"" CJI Kant said.","Former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted of raping a minor in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao.

Peace deal ‘90% agreed’

Trump’s deadline: Weeks, not days

Also read:

Optimism tempered by war on the ground





US President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, even as Russia intensified its attacks on Kyiv. Both leaders struck an optimistic tone, repeatedly suggesting that a peace deal was closer than at any previous point, yet they also acknowledged that several issues particularly territory, security guarantees and the future of occupied infrastructure remain unresolved.“I think we’re getting a lot closer, maybe very close,” Trump said after the meeting. Zelenskyy, thanking Trump for a “great meeting”, said Ukraine was “ready for peace” and that talks had yielded “significant results”, even if final decisions were still pending.The talks came just hours after the 47th POTUS held a lengthy phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin , and against the backdrop of fresh Russian missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities.Zelenskyy’s visit followed what Trump described as an “excellent” phone call with Putin earlier the same day. The Kremlin later said the call was “friendly, benevolent and businesslike”, adding that Trump and Putin agreed to speak again promptly after Trump’s talks with the Ukrainian leader.Trump insisted Putin still wants peace, despite Russia launching new attacks on Ukraine as Zelenskyy travelled to the US.“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, adding that Putin had been “very generous in his feelings toward Ukraine succeeding”.That framing has alarmed some of Ukraine’s supporters, who note a pattern in which Trump speaks to Putin before meeting Zelenskyy. However, unlike previous encounters, this sequence did not lead to an openly tense exchange between the US and Ukrainian presidents.At the centre of the talks was a revised 20-point peace framework that US and Ukrainian teams have been refining for weeks. Zelenskyy said the plan was “90% agreed”, while Trump said he did not like using percentages but suggested the deal was nearly complete.“We discussed all aspects of the peace framework,” Zelenskyy later wrote. “We agreed that security guarantees are a key milestone in achieving lasting peace.”The two sides also agreed that their teams would meet again as early as next week to finalise remaining details, and that Trump would host Ukrainian and European leaders in Washington in January.Both leaders acknowledged that the fate of the eastern Donbas region remains unresolved. Trump described it as “a very tough issue”, though he said it was getting closer to resolution. Zelenskyy was blunt about the divide. “Our attitude is very clear,” he said, adding that Ukraine and Russia hold fundamentally different positions.Trump suggested that making territorial concessions sooner rather than later could be pragmatic. “Some of that land has been taken,” he said. “And are you better off making a deal now?”Zelenskyy has shown new flexibility, saying any territorial settlement would require either a referendum or parliamentary approval, but only after a ceasefire, something Moscow has so far rejected.Security guarantees emerged as the clearest area of convergence. Zelenskyy said US-Ukraine security guarantees were “100% agreed”, calling them essential to preventing future Russian aggression. Trump was more cautious, saying the talks were about “95% done” and stressing that European countries would need to shoulder much of the responsibility with US backing.During recent negotiations, Washington has floated Nato-like guarantees for Ukraine, even as Zelenskyy signalled he could drop Kyiv’s bid to formally join the alliance if equivalent protections were provided. Russia, however, has repeatedly rejected any Nato role and warned it would view allied troops as legitimate targets.Another unresolved issue is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, which has been under Russian control since early in the war. Trump said the plant was discussed “at length” and suggested Putin was open to cooperation. “President Putin is actually working with Ukraine on getting it open,” he said.Under US proposals, the plant could be jointly run by the US, Russia and Ukraine, with shared profits. Zelenskyy is known to oppose any Russian commercial role, making this a potential flashpoint as talks continue.After their meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke jointly by phone with a broad group of European leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Finland.Von der Leyen later said progress was “good” but stressed that “ironclad security guarantees from day one” would be essential. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said leaders underlined the urgency of ending the war and commended Trump for driving talks forward.Trump repeatedly warned that negotiations could still collapse. “In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other,” he said. “It’s possible it doesn’t happen.”The US president, who once claimed he could end the war in a day, now openly acknowledges its complexity. “This is not a one-day process deal,” he said. “This is very complicated stuff.”Even as diplomacy intensifies, fighting continues. Russia launched major attacks on Kyiv and other regions ahead of the talks, knocking out power and heating for hundreds of thousands. Ukrainian officials described the strikes as evidence of Moscow’s true intentions.Still, both Trump and Zelenskyy emerged keen to project momentum. “I do think we’re getting a lot closer,” Trump said. Zelenskyy echoed that sentiment, thanking Trump and his team and reiterating: “Ukraine is ready for peace.”","US President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing controversy over Digvijaya Singh 's remarks praising the RSS’s organisational strength, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi 's role in Congress leadership, citing examples of elevation of Manmohan Singh and P V Narasimha Rao to the post of Prime Minister.In a social media post on X, Reddy, on the 140th foundation day of the Congress, said that the party “has shaped every defining chapter of modern India.”“Congress: a force for the people of India was born 140 years ago on this day. The story of the Indian National Congress is the story of Indian democracy in motion. When one reflects on the leadership of Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji, we find service, commitment, ethics and values,” Reddy said.“Under Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji’s leadership, it became possible for Shri P V Narasimha Rao garu, who started his public career from a remote village in Telangana, to rise to become Prime Minister of the country. Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji also made an economist like Dr Manmohan Singh Ji the Prime Minister. From leading India’s freedom struggle to framing the Constitution, from building democratic institutions to uniting a diverse nation, the Indian National Congress has shaped every defining chapter of modern India,” he added.This comes after Digvijaya Singh stirred a controversy by sharing a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader L K Advani in Gujarat.Singh commented on the ability of grassroots workers to ascend through the ranks to become chief minister and eventually Prime Minister, attributing it to the “power of organisation.”He tagged several senior Congress leaders, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jairam Ramesh, Prime Minister Modi, and the official Congress handles.Reportedly, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister rued “over-centralisation” in the Congress and pushed for decentralisation in the presence of top leadership at the CWC meeting held on Saturday.He also complained that district and state chiefs were appointed by the AICC and questioned why decisions taken at the Udaipur Chintan Shivir, including setting up an election management department, had not been implemented.Last week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him “full marks,” while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, “Rahul ji, you are absolutely ‘bang on’ in matters of socio-economic issues. Full marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like the Election Commission needs reforms, so does the Indian National Congress. You have started with ‘Sangathan Srijan’, but we need more pragmatic, decentralised functioning.”He added, “I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. The only problem is that it is not easy to ‘convince’ you!!”","Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi's role in Congress leadership.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir’s apple orchards — the backbone of the Valley’s rural economy — are under renewed scrutiny as lawmakers and medical experts raise concerns over a possible link between decades of pesticide use and rising cases of malignant brain tumours among orchard workers.The concerns were raised by the House Committee on Environment of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, chaired by CPM legislator MY Tarigami, which met officials, scientists and health experts to examine the health hazards faced by those working in apple orchards.“For years, farmers have sprayed orchards unaware of the toxicity of constant pesticide exposure, leading to a rise in malignant brain tumors among those who power the valley’s billion-rupee apple economy and contribute more than 70% of India’s total apples,” the committee said.The discussion revisited findings from a study conducted by the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), which examined more than 400 cancer patients between 2005 and 2008.The study reported high incidences of primary brain cancer in districts forming Kashmir’s core fruit belt, including Baramulla, Anantnag , Budgam, Shopian and Kupwara. It identified a “quite strong and possible” link between pesticide exposure and malignant brain tumours among orchard farmers.The findings were largely ignored when first published but have resurfaced amid growing medical evidence of pesticide-linked health disorders in the Valley.Tarigami told TOI, “We don’t want to create panic among farmers who spray their orchards every season. But neither can we sit idle when data indicates a serious health hazard. If pesticide spray is harming lives, it must be addressed.”Scientists told the committee that pesticide use in apple orchards often exceeds recommended limits.Shahid Rasool, principal scientist at CSIR–Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, said many orchardists spray chemicals every 10 to 12 days instead of the advised 18 to 21, believing it boosts yield.“Few can afford protective gear; chronic cough, rashes and irritation are common. Without gloves, goggles and masks, the risk multiplies,” he warned.Rasool said orchardists now use as many as 15 rounds of fungicide and insecticide each season, far beyond recommended schedules, and called for safer practices and protective equipment.Further concerns were raised by Dr Sobia Nisar, a physician-researcher at Government Medical College, Srinagar, who has studied the biochemical effects of pesticide exposure among residents of apple-growing districts such as Shopian and Pulwama.“The initial idea was to check pesticides residue levels in the fruit,” she said. “But what we found was far more disturbing. Traces of these compounds in human blood samples.”Her findings document pesticide residues in the bloodstream of orchard workers and nearby residents, along with higher rates of obesity, lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome and early kidney impairment.“When such patterns emerge consistently across populations exposed to pesticides, it demands urgent scientific scrutiny,” Dr Nisar said.A study published in the Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported that 90% of brain tumour patients from Kashmir’s orchard belts had been exposed to pesticides, with all cases involving high-grade, aggressive tumours.The research focused on orchard workers in districts such as Anantnag, Budgam and Baramulla — areas that account for over 90% of the Valley’s apple-growing land — with smaller districts like Shopian and Kulgam also showing significant concentrations of cases.The House Committee on Environment said it would recommend measures to the health and horticulture departments focusing on monitoring, research funding and worker safety, as concerns grow over the long-term health impact of pesticide use in Kashmir’s apple orchards.A detailed study titled “Pesticides and brain cancer linked in orchard farmers of Kashmir”, conducted by researchers at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), examined the relationship between pesticide exposure and primary malignant brain tumours among orchard workers in the Valley.The study analysed medical records of 432 patients diagnosed with primary malignant brain tumours and 457 control patients with non-tumour neurological conditions, all treated at SKIMS over a four-year period between 2005 and 2008.These patients had been exposed to multiple neurotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals, including chlorpyriphos, dimethoate, mancozeb and captan.Only 9.96% of patients had no recorded exposure to pesticides. Among the control group, 119 out of 457 patients had a history of pesticide exposure, while 338 had no such link.Of the pesticide-exposed cancer patients, 71.7% were male and 28.3% were female, including members of three families. Nearly a third — 31.9% — were younger than 40 years, having begun exposure at an early age.The study found that all orchard-related patients had high-grade, aggressive brain tumours, unlike those in the non-pesticide-exposed group. Mortality among pesticide-exposed tumour patients was recorded at 12%.Researchers measured serum cholinesterase levels — a marker used to assess exposure to organophosphate pesticides — and found higher-than-normal levels in 31.9% of exposed patients, while decreased levels were seen in 45.3%.Statistical analysis showed a significant case-control odds ratio of 0.28, with additional hospital and family control serum cholinesterase odds ratios of 1.1 and 1.5 respectively, pointing to what the study described as a strong suspicion of a link between pesticide exposure and brain cancer.The study noted that millions of tonnes of pesticides, insecticides and fungicides are sprayed annually across Kashmir’s orchards. Apple cultivation alone covers more than half of the Valley’s fruit-growing land, with around 40% of the population directly or indirectly exposed through farming, residence near orchards or recreational use of orchard spaces.Researchers highlighted that prolonged use of synthetic pesticides over the past three decades has coincided with a marked rise in admissions of high-grade malignant brain tumours from orchard districts to SKIMS.The study concluded that occupational and environmental exposure to pesticides in Kashmir’s fruit-growing regions poses a serious health risk, warranting closer monitoring and further investigation.","Kashmir’s apple orchards are under renewed scrutiny as lawmakers and medical experts raise concerns over a possible link between decades of pesticide use and rising cases of malignant brain tumours among orchard workers.

Cracks in MVA?

How the feud began

What the split led to

NEW DELHI: Are the senior and junior Pawars on the same side again? For the upcoming civic polls, the answer is yes. The Ajit Pawar-led NCP has announced that it will contest the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune local body elections together with the NCP ( Sharad Pawar faction).Announcing the tie-up, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the alliance is restricted to the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) elections, stressing that it is a local arrangement.“For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the ‘clock’ and the ‘tutari’ (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said while announcing the alliance.""We are the ones who work for development. We will edge out those who tried to put this municipal corporation in debt,"" he added.Claiming the upcoming polls to be the ""fight of the workers"", NCP(SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said that the decision was taken listening to the views of party workers.""After speaking with all the party workers, Supriya Sule herself also interacted with the workers from Pune. Subsequently, discussions were held with workers from Pimpri-Chinchwad.This is a fight of the workers and their election. Therefore, after listening to their views and understanding their concerns, it was decided that both NCP factions will contest the polls together in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. However, both parties will contest on their respective symbols. "" NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said.""This decision has been taken only for Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, and that too after listening to the local workers and with their consent. Pawar Saheb is not involved in this entire decision-making process. Such senior leaders have never directly participated in municipal corporation elections. He only said that the views of those who fought for us should be heard and understood, and that decisions should be taken in accordance with what the workers decide. Therefore, this alliance has been formed in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad,"" he added.Meanwhile, the announcement also brought ripples in the Mahaviakas Aghadi Dal alliance partners seeking answers from Sharad Pawar.""This issue is limited to Pimpri-Chinchwad. As far as I think, they will not be in an alliance in Pune. Sharad Pawar needs to answer this, as he has always opposed the BJP, but now they are going with them. Pawar Saheb and Amit Shah need to respond to this,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said during a media briefing.Earlier, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Shirsat also hinted that there is a possibility of NCP (SP) joining the BJP-led NDA government.“Both the NCPs are coming together by forming an alliance for the upcoming municipal corporation elections,” he said, adding that such local-level adjustments could be a precursor to a broader political understanding.This comes two years after Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. He had raised objection over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party, despite old age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under this new alliance. He favoured aligning with the ruling coalition, while Sharad Pawar's faction insisted on remaining with the opposition.The Election Commission later recognised Ajit's faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock' symbol. Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar's faction (NCP-SP) adopted the ‘tutari' (curved trumpet) symbol.Both factions contested elections separately. After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where his faction faced setbacks, Ajit Pawar acknowledged that turning his back on family had been a “mistake”.Ajit had justified his decision by saying that he joined hands with NDA to ""ensure stability and progress in Maharashtra.""""We are in alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, and many people ask me why I took the step of separating from the (undivided) NCP and why I accepted the strain on family and personal relationships. I want to tell you that I did this not for power or position, but to ensure stability and progress in Maharashtra.""""In other parties, leaders retire after an age. In the BJP, leaders retire at 75, when are you going to stop? You should also give new people a chance. If we make mistakes, tell us. Your age is 83, will you ever stop or not? You give us blessings,"" he added.In the Maharashtra assembly elections in 2024, Ajit Pawar’s NCP upped its score from a mere six Assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha results to a tally of 41 MLAs, in the process beating the senior Pawar’s nominees in 27 head-to-head clashes; the latter won seven of those contests.The 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections saw the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance win 235 seats, including 132 for the BJP, 57 for the Shiv Sena, and 41 for the NCP (Ajit Pawar faction). The Maha Vikas Aghadi was reduced to 20 seats for Shiv Sena (UBT), 16 for the Congress, and 10 for the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction).","The NCP has announced that it will contest the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune local body elections together with the NCP ( Sharad Pawar faction) This comes two years after Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with his uncle Sharad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126230609,imgsize-560805,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The 'public servant' interpretation



Why it matters



Survivor welcomes SC intervention



(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stepped in to stay the Delhi high court order that suspended the former BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s life sentence in the 2017 Unnao rape case. On the Central Investigation Bureau's plea challenging the HC order, Supreme Court bench flagged serious legal concerns over the interpretation of the law and the implications it could have for accountability of elected representatives.A three-judge vacation bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant, along with Justices JK Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, stayed the execution of the high court’s December 23 order that had suspended Sengar’s life sentence under the POCSO Act Supreme Court made it clear that Sengar would not be released from jail, noting that he continues to remain in custody in another case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.While acknowledging that sentence suspensions are not usually stayed without hearing the convict, the bench said the ""peculiar facts"" of the case warranted immediate intervention.""Issue notice. We have heard solicitor general Tushar Mehta for CBI and senior advocate for the convict... Counter will be filed in four weeks. We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court without hearing such persons.But in view of peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi high court order dated December 23, and thus the respondent shall not be released pursuant to the said order,"" the bench ordered.At the heart of the CBI plea is whether an MLA can be treated as a ""public servant"" for the purpose of aggravated offences under the POCSO Act.Appearing for the CBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that Sengar, who was a powerful MLA at the time of the crime, exercised dominance over the minor survivor and squarely fell within the scope of aggravated sexual assault under the law.Sengar’s counsel, senior advocates Siddharth Dave and N Hariharan, countered this by arguing that an MLA could not automatically be treated as a public servant under POCSO.The Supreme Court, however, expressed unease with the high court’s reasoning, warning that such an interpretation could lead to lawmakers being exempted from stricter punishment.""We are worried that a constable or patwari will be a public servant under the Act, but an MLA or MP will not be and get exempted,"" the bench observed.Section 5 of the POCSO Act treats sexual assault as ""aggravated"" if committed by a public servant or a person in a position of authority, attracting a minimum punishment of 20 years that can extend to life imprisonment.In 2019, a Delhi trial court had held that Sengar qualified as a public servant and sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life. The high court’s suspension of that sentence had triggered sharp criticism, with the CBI arguing that it diluted the intent of the law.The Supreme Court has now issued notice to Sengar and will examine whether the high court erred in excluding legislators from the definition of ""public servant"" under POCSO Act.Meanwhile, the Unnao rape survivor welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying she had full faith in the justice system and felt reassured by the apex court’s intervention.""I am very happy. I had faith in the Supreme Court. I will ensure that he is given a death sentence,"" she said speaking to the reporters.The survivor's mother has asked for security for her family and advocate saying, ""My family needs security. Our advocates need security. I request that the government keep us all safe.""","The Supreme Court on Monday stepped in to stay the Delhi high court order that suspended the former BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s life sentence in the 2017 Unnao rape case.

Unnao Rape Case: Activists Protest Outside Delhi High Court Over Sengar Bail

Aishwarya Sengar's big charge after SC order in Unnao case

NEW DELHI: Ishita Sengar, daughter of former BJP MLA and Unnao rape case convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar, penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith”.Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.In her letter, Ishita wrote: “I am writing this letter as a daughter who is exhausted, frightened, and slowly losing faith, but still holding on to hope because there is nowhere else left to go.”The Supreme Court stayed the operation of the December 23 Delhi high court order and directed that Kuldeep Singh Sengar shall not be released from prison in connection with the 2017 Unnao rape case.A three-judge vacation bench comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices JK Maheshwari and AG Masih passed the order while hearing a plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The bench observed that although courts usually do not stay bail orders once a convict is released, the present case involved “peculiar facts” as Sengar remains in jail in another criminal case.“We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court.But in view of the peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi High Court order,” the bench said.Also read: 'Will ensure Kuldeep Sengar is given death sentence- Unnao rape survivor hails SC decision; what she said Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an expelled BJP MLA from Unnao, was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2019 for the rape of a minor under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He is also serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.In her letter addressed to the “Hon’ble Authorities of the Republic of India,” Ishita Sengar said her family had waited silently for eight years, trusting the legal system.Explaining why the family chose not to protest publicly, she wrote: “We chose silence not because we were powerful, but because we believed in institutions. We waited because we believed that truth does not need spectacle.”She alleged that despite being labelled “powerful” because of her father’s political identity, her family remained unheard.“People call us ‘powerful.’ I ask you what kind of power leaves a family voiceless for eight years?” she said. Ishita added that her family had been “drained financially, emotionally, and physically” while seeking justice.Also read: SC stays Delhi HC order granting bail to Kuldeep Sengar; ex-BJP MLA to remain in jail Ishita also claimed she had received rape and death threats on social media over the years, which eventually silenced her.“Over these years, I have been told countless times that I should be raped, killed, or punished simply for existing,” she wrote, describing the abuse as “daily” and “relentless.”She further expressed concern that fear and public outrage were beginning to overshadow facts and due process.“If pressure and public frenzy begin to overshadow evidence and due process, what protection does an ordinary citizen truly have?” she asked.Clarifying her intent, Ishita said the letter was not written to seek sympathy or special treatment.“We are not asking for a favour. We are asking for justice because we are human,” she wrote, urging that the law be allowed to function “without fear” and evidence be examined “without pressure.”During the Supreme Court hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, described the case as a “very horrific” instance of child rape and argued that Sengar, being an MLA at the time, occupied a dominant position over the victim, attracting stricter punishment under the POCSO Act.The bench also expressed concern that excluding lawmakers from the definition of “public servant” under POCSO could create legal immunity for MPs and MLAs.Meanwhile, the rape survivor’s mother welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying it gave her hope that her daughter would finally get justice.The Supreme Court has issued notice to Sengar and sought his response within four weeks. The matter is scheduled to be heard again in the last week of January.Following the apex court’s decision, Kuldeep's daughter Aishwarya Sengar alleged that her family was not given an opportunity to present its arguments on the merits of the case and claimed that key facts were being overlooked.“We couldn’t even start arguing on the merits of the case today, that she has changed her statement several times, changed the timing thrice, starting from 2 pm, 6 pm and then finally 8 pm. There’s a finding of the AIIMS medical board that she was more than 18. I’ve been fighting for justice for the past eight years, but maybe the sorrows of me and my family mean nothing. We have been stripped of our dignity, our peace, and even our fundamental right to be heard. Still hope for justice. I request that the media not spread any misinformation,” Aishwarya said.","Ishita Sengar penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith” Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.

Indian Army Displays Turkish Yiiha Drone Used By Pakistan During Operation Sindoor

Cops seized Monday an unidentified drone abandoned in a field near the Pakistan border in J&K’s Poonch district, while seven rounds of magazines for an AK-series rifle were found strewn in Udhampur district, over 270 km away.Officials clarified that the drone was not a defence equipment but among many such devices often used for taking photos at weddings and other social gatherings. Still, the discovery sparked fears of espionage as the site is near the Mendhar sector of the border.“Special Operations Group (SOG) of J&K police received an input about the drone abandoned in a field belonging to one Mohd Shafiq in Gohled village. After the information, SOG rushed and seized the drone,” an official said.The magazines were found in an open field at Sudhmahadev village in Udhampur’s Chenani area during a search by security forces, officials said. A probe is on. No one has been arrested so far.In Jammu’s Pragwal area, forces seized an aircraft shaped-balloon bearing the mark “PIA” -- short for Pakistan International Airlines -- from the border village Gurah Manhasa, the officials said.At Barmini on Jammu city’s outskirts, a man travelling in a Scorpio was arrested during checks, allegedly with an illegal 12-bore gun and two cartridges. Cops identified him as Sahil Singh and said further investigations are on.","Unidentified drone found abandoned in a field near the Pakistan border in J&K’s Poonch district.

"On the roof of the world, feral dogs hunt down Ladakh’s rare species",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladkah-on-the-roof-of-the-world-feral-dogs-hunt-down-ladakhs-rare-species/articleshow/126218554.cms,"Lean, feral dogs move with predatory intensity across a snow-dusted desert, Ladakh's stark peaks looming behind.

SRINAGAR: It’s bloody murder on the roof of the world.A new predator has quietly grown to dangerous numbers. Feral dogs roam the cold desert of Ladakh, preying, often in packs, on endangered wildlife and attacking people. Conservationists warn that they outnumber native predators in the region.What began as a byproduct of increased tourism, military deployment, and unmanaged waste in the cold desert moonscape of Ladakh has grown into a full-blown crisis. And it’s manmade.Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000, far in excess of what the region’s ecology can sustain — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. They threaten snow leopards, wolves and foxes, and prey on rare species like Pallas’s cat, the Eurasian lynx, Tibetan gazelle, blue sheep, ibex, and Himalayan marmots, said Lobzang Visuddha, chairman of the Wildlife Conservation and Birds Club of Ladakh (WCBCL), a community-based voluntary initiative by young people.The killing of a Pallas’s cat, one of the rarest and least-studied species, by feral dogs in Anley last year has alarmed conservationists like Visuddha. “In fact, there are records of killing two Pallas’s cats and Eurasian lynxes by feral dogs,” he saidThe dogs also threaten ground-nesting birds, with packs frequently chasing black-necked cranes, the UT’s state bird, and attacking ruddy shelduck chicks when they move from rocky nesting sites to nearby water bodies, Visuddha said.Advocate Tashi Gyalson, who headed the local government in Leh as chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council from Nov 2020 to Nov 2025, said the issue hasn't been arisen all of a sudden. “We have to admit that this situation has actually been created by humans over a long period of time,” he said.Gyalson said these dogs have been part of the ecosystem and community but rapid urbanisation meant they lost their use as hunting dogs, shepherd dogs, watchdogs and companion animals. “This, multiplied by the abundant carrying capacity of the environment, caused their rapid multiplication, and eventually caused the current situation,” he said.Experts say the worst hit is eastern Ladakh, the region with the highest concentration of wildlife, where poor waste management are subsidising the dog population.“The main concern is the availability of excess kitchen waste in areas occupied by the Army and areas where there is tourism,” Gyalson said.The stretch from Kargyan Chibra to Tsokar, in eastern Ladakh, has become a hotspot for feral dog activity due to unsustainable waste “Feral dogs are by far the most serious threat as far as the wildlife of Ladakh is concerned. I have myself seen how stray dogs in Hanle and Tso Moriri actually raided the nests of the black-necked crane, and preyed upon the eggs and young ones,” said Intesar Suhail, who was wildlife warden of Ladakh in 2013-14.“I have even seen them chasing animals as big as the Tibetan wild ass. The active ground nests of waterbirds, particularly the black-necked crane and bar-headed goose, are more vulnerable as they are located in marshy areas, surrounded by shallow waters easily accessible to dogs,” he said.A strong sense of smell and pack behaviour give feral dogs a lethal advantage over wildlife that evolved without such human-introduced predators, Visuddha said.“Though these species face natural threats in the wild, feral dogs are not one of them, they are a problem introduced by humans,” said the WCBCL founder.Ladakh has also reported at least five fatal attacks on humans, mostly on women and children, by feral dogs, which was unheard of in the region until recently, he said.Phuntsog Wangail, president of the Chamba Animal Welfare Society, which runs Ladakh’s largest animal care facility, said Ladakh was facing growing fears of long-term ecological imbalance due to feral dogs.They survive largely on food waste from tourist camps, hotels, roadside dhabas and temporary settlements. When these facilities close or relocate, particularly during winter, the canines are left without reliable food sources and begin roaming over long distances.“This seasonal movement pushes dogs into wildlife habitats, increases territorial conflicts, and accelerates breeding, placing Ladakh’s fragile ecosystem under severe pressure,” Wangail said.Visuddha said the feral dog threat to wildlife of Ladakh was next only to human activity.The rapid infrastructure expansion, including road building, power lines and mobile towers, has already fragmented habitats, while the expansion of camps, resorts, guest houses and hotels has intensified pressure on wildlife, he said.In winter, when tourism grinds to a halt and food becomes scarce, the dogs roam extensively, leading to a rise in dog-bite cases, road accidents and formation of aggressive packs. “At the same time, winter offers the best window for sterilisation, as dogs tend to remain closer to human settlements.”Data from the Animal Husbandry Department in Leh shows that 32,887 dogs were sterilised between 2015 and 2024, yet officials and conservationists say the population remains dangerously high.Wangial said Ladakh should carry out mass sterilisation over the next two years, with a special focus on female dogs and puppies, while calling for strict enforcement of animal welfare laws, including heavy penalties for dog dislocation, abandonment and cruelty.He called for the replication of successful models from the Netherlands and Bhutan, where mass sterilisation, strict enforcement of animal welfare laws and strong community participation have led to significant reductions in stray populations.While Visuddha said govt appears unconcerned about the issue, Gyalson offered a contrasting view. He said that after Ladakh became a Union Territory in 2019, a mission-mode campaign was launched to control the dog population. “The impact of the programme is visible as there are far fewer street puppies, especially in Leh city,” he said.However, Gyalson said several challenges continue to hinder effective population control, including Ladakh’s vast and rugged terrain, extreme climate, dispersed dog population, difficulties in capturing animals, and the absence of an accurate census.","Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000 — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species.

Press release by the defence ministry

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday cleared a major tranche of defence procurements worth about Rs 79,000 crore, approving missiles, rockets, radar systems, drones and support platforms aimed at significantly strengthening the combat capabilities of the armed forces. The approvals were granted by the defence acquisition council chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh.As per a statement by the defence ministry, the DAC accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for a wide range of proposals across the Army, Navy and Air Force. The approvals cover the procurement of Loiter Munition Systems for artillery regiments, Low Level Light Weight Radars, Long Range Guided Rocket Ammunition for the Pinaka Multiple Launch Rocket System (MRLS), and the Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mk-II.Following the meeting, Rajnath Singh said the decisions reflected the government’s focus on defence preparedness. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting held today accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for various proposals of the three Services amounting to a total of about Rs 79,000 crore.”He added, “The MoD under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi is working tirelessly to strengthen India’s defence preparedness.The decisions taken today will help in enhancing operational capabilities of the Armed Forces.”The ministry said loiter munition will be used for precision strikes against tactical targets, reflecting the growing emphasis on stand-off and high-accuracy weaponry. The low level lightweight radars are designed to detect and track small-sized, low-flying unmanned aerial systems, a capability that has become increasingly critical in modern battlefields.For the Indian Navy, the DAC approved procurement of Bollard Pull (BP) tugs, High Frequency Software Defined Radios (HF SDR) Manpack, and the leasing of High Altitude Long Range (HALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The ministry said induction of BP tugs will assist naval ships and submarines in berthing, unberthing and manoeuvring in confined harbour waters.The Indian Air Force will receive approvals for the procurement of Automatic Take-off Landing Recording Systems, Astra Mk-II missiles, Full Mission Simulators and SPICE-1000 long-range guidance kits.“Induction of the automatic take-off landing recording system will fill the gaps in the aerospace safety environment by providing high definition all-weather automatic recording of landing and take-off,” the ministry said.It added that Astra Mk-II missiles, with enhanced range, will improve the ability of fighter aircraft to neutralise adversary platforms from large stand-off distances.","The Centre on Monday cleared a major tranche of defence procurements worth about Rs 79,000 crore.

NEW DELHI: Father of Anjel Chakma, the Tripura student who died in a fatal racial attack in Dehradun, made serious allegations against the authorities saying that they refused to file an FIR after the assault dismissing it as ""minor matter"".""They wanted to file an FIR, but they were refused, being told it was a minor matter...

""I saw my child in a critical condition; his left arm and leg were paralysed because he had been stabbed twice in the back. Blood was gushing from his head,"" he said.He said that the case was registered only when he reached Dehradun.""I went to the police to report the incident, and they reviewed the CCTV footage from the scene.

Supreme Court Halts Bail For Ex-BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar In Unnao Rape Case, Signals Tough Stand

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday noted that some individuals are attempting to gain ""political advantage"" after lawyers for expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar claimed that allegations had been made against the Delhi high court judges who had suspended his life sentence in the Unnao rape case.""We understand it. We are not sitting in ivory towers. We understand that people are trying to take political advantage and there are people who are trying to take advantage,"" said CJI Surya Kant, who was heading a three-judge vacation bench.Senior advocate N Hariharan, representing Sengar, highlighted that certain individuals were making allegations against the high court judges who handled the case.He urged such persons to refrain from making statements or accusations against the judges, noting that a circulating video containing these allegations was a matter of concern.""They are doing that on national television,"" Hariharan said, as cited by PTI.Another lawyer representing Sengar said that photographs of the high court judges were also being circulated. The bench noted that such actions overlook the fact that Sengar was convicted by the judiciary itself.“Very frankly, these judges are one of the finest we have,” said the bench, also comprising Justices J K Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, during the hearing.Later, when asked about the allegations against the judges, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, stated unequivocally that both the high court judges are ""brilliant judges with unimpeachable integrity,” adding that any attempt to malign them must be strongly condemned, as cited by PTI.The Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s life sentence and granted him bail in the 2017 Unnao rape case. The apex court also issued a notice to Sengar, directing him to respond within four weeks to the CBI’s plea challenging the high court order.The high court had suspended Sengar’s sentence pending the outcome of his appeal against the 2019 trial court verdict in the rape case. However, he will remain in jail, as he is also serving a 10-year sentence in the custodial death case of the victim’s father and has not been granted bail in that matter.The survivor on Monday vowed to pursue the death penalty for Sengar and welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to stay the Delhi High Court’s suspension of his life sentence.""I am very happy. I had faith in the Supreme Court. I will ensure that he is given a death sentence,"" she said while speaking to reporters.The Unnao rape survivor, who was a minor in 2017, was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted by Kuldeep Singh Sengar between June 11 and 20, and was later sold before being rescued from the Maakhi police station.","Supreme Court Halts Bail For Ex-BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar In Unnao Rape Case, Signals Tough Stand.

DRDO Completes User Trials Of Akash-NG Air Defence Missile System, Ready For Induction

Importance of Pinaka

NEW DELHI: Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) on Monday successfully conducted the maiden flight test of the Pinaka Long Range Guided Rocket (LRGR 120). It was conducted at the Integrated Test Range in Odisha's Chandipur.""The rocket was tested for its maximum range of 120 km, demonstrating all in-flight manoeuvres as planned. The LRGR impacted the target with textbook precision,"" reported news agency PTI.Earlier, the day the Centre also cleared a fresh set of defence procurements worth around Rs 79,000 crore, giving the armed forces a significant boost in combat capability. The approvals were taken at a meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh According to the defence ministry, the council granted Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for a range of equipment to be inducted by the Army, Navy and Air Force.The cleared proposals include loitering munitions for artillery units, low-level lightweight radars, long-range guided rocket ammunition for the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, and the Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mark-II, among other systems.The Pinaka Long Range Guided Rocket (LRGR 120) is an extended-range, precision-guided rocket developed for the Indian Army ’s Pinaka Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). The “120” denotes its maximum strike range of around 120 kilometres.Unlike earlier unguided Pinaka rockets, the LRGR is equipped with a guidance system that significantly improves accuracy, enabling it to engage targets such as enemy artillery positions, command nodes and logistics installations at long distances. The rocket is fired from the existing Pinaka launcher, allowing the Army to enhance capability without inducting a new launch platform.The LRGR 120 is part of India’s effort to increase indigenous, long-range precision firepower. Guidance is achieved through a combination of inertial navigation, with mid-course updates and terminal correction, reducing circular error probable (CEP) compared to earlier variants.The system provides the Army with a stand-off strike option, allowing targets to be hit from well behind forward areas, improving survivability of launch units. The rocket is intended for deployment across artillery regiments operating the Pinaka system, strengthening deep-strike and counter-force capabilities.","The rocket was tested for its maximum range of 120 km, demonstrating all in- flight manoeuvres as planned.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

Rail services hit

NEW DELHI: Dense fog blanketed Delhi and large parts of North India on Monday, triggering widespread disruption across air and rail networks, with hundreds of flights cancelled or delayed and trains running hours behind schedule, leaving passengers stranded and frustrated.At the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, at least 128 flights — 64 departures and 64 arrivals — were cancelled, while eight flights were diverted due to low visibility conditions. Nearly 200 flights were delayed, with an average departure delay of around 24 minutes, according to flight-tracking website Flightradar24.Visibility at the airport dropped to as low as 50 metres, forcing operations to continue under CAT III conditions, an advanced landing system used during dense fog. Delhi's AQI also crossed 400 on Monday, hitting 'severe' category of air pollution.Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) said runway visibility was gradually improving but warned that departures and arrivals could remain affected.IndiGo cancelled 80 flights across its network due to bad weather, with around half of those cancellations at Delhi airport. Other affected airports included Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Dehradun, Indore, Patna and Bhopal.While the airline did not explicitly disclose the number of cancellations in its advisory, it acknowledged that fog-related disruptions were likely to extend into the afternoon hours.“Fog continues to persist across Delhi and several airports in northern India. Visibility remains reduced and, as a result, flight movements are presently slower than normal,” IndiGo said in a post on X.The airline has been cancelling flights in significant numbers since the start of the fog season on December 10, following earlier large-scale disruptions caused by stricter pilot duty norms. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has designated December 10 to February 10 as the official fog window this winter, during which airlines must deploy CAT-IIIB-compliant aircraft and pilots trained for low-visibility operations.Airlines including IndiGo and Air India urged passengers to regularly check flight status and assured them that safety remained the top priority as operations continued to adjust to fluctuating weather conditions.Rail services were also hit hard. Several trains were delayed by hours at New Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin railway stations, prompting passenger complaints.Gagan, travelling to Kanpur, told ANI that his train was delayed by eight hours, while students expressed concern about missing meals, exams and connections due to prolonged delays.Taxi drivers at stations reported a sharp drop in business as late-arriving trains reduced passenger movement.The fog also raised safety concerns on roads, with commuters warning of increased accident risks due to poor visibility. Meanwhile, smog reduced visibility in parts of Mumbai, adding to travel woes.","Dense fog blanketed Delhi and large parts of North India on Monday, triggering widespread disruption across air and rail networks.

Live-fire war games: China launches drills around Taiwan; Taipei mobilises forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/live-fire-war-games-china-launches-drills-around-taiwan-taipei-mobilises-forces/articleshow/126227109.cms,"ON CAM: Chinese Warships, Fighter Jets & Troops Encircle Taiwan; PLA Moves In For Invasion?

China on Monday launched large-scale live-fire military drills around Taiwan, deploying warships, fighter jets, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles in what Beijing described as a stern warning to supporters of Taiwanese independence and foreign powers, as the island placed its forces on high alert and vowed to defend its democracy.Taiwan’s defence ministry said that as of 3 pm, it had detected 89 Chinese military aircraft and drones, with 67 entering Taiwan’s response area.China’s People’s Liberation Army said the exercises, code-named “Justice Mission 2025”, included live-fire training on maritime targets to the north and southwest of Taiwan. The PLA Eastern Theatre Command said the drills involved destroyers, frigates, aircraft and rocket forces and would continue into Tuesday, including simulated strikes and exercises aimed at blockading key ports.“This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces,” said Shi Yi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.Taiwan’s military said it had activated its response mechanisms and deployed forces in reaction to the drills. “A response centre has been established, and appropriate forces have been deployed,” the military said, adding that its armed forces had carried out a rapid response exercise.A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters that dozens of Chinese military aircraft and vessels were operating around the island, with some “deliberately closing in” on Taiwan’s contiguous zone, defined as 24 nautical miles from its coast.Taiwan’s defence ministry said Chinese aircraft and ships had been detected operating around the island over the past 24 hours and that the military remained on high alert. “All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom,” the ministry said.Taiwan’s government condemned the exercises, while the defence ministry posted a video on Facebook showcasing weapons including US-made HIMARS rocket systems, which could strike coastal targets in China’s Fujian province in the event of a conflict.The coast guard said it had dispatched large vessels to respond to Chinese coast guard activity near Taiwan’s waters and was coordinating with the military to minimise disruption to shipping lanes and fishing areas. Taiwan’s aviation authority said China had designated a temporary danger zone in Taipei’s airspace for live-fire drills scheduled for Tuesday and that alternative flight routes were being assessed.The drills mark China’s sixth major round of war games around Taiwan since 2022 and come 11 days after the United States announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to the island. Beijing had protested the package and warned it would “take forceful measures” in response.Analysts say China’s exercises are increasingly blurring the line between routine training and preparations that could be used to mask an actual attack, reducing warning time for Taiwan and its allies.China’s state media said the drills would focus on sealing off key ports including Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south. The PLA released posters depicting targets locked across the island, accompanied by slogans such as “Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions” and “Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial”.“Any foreign interference that touches the shield (of justice) shall perish!” one poster read. “Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!”The exercises follow rising tensions between Beijing and Tokyo after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could warrant a military response from Japan. Beijing summoned Japan’s ambassador and warned its citizens against travelling to the country.China claims Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory and has not ruled out using force to bring the self-governed island under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claims, insisting that only its people can decide the island’s future.“I think these drills are just meant to scare us,” said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher in Taipei. “Similar drills have happened before ... the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan's current government and how they choose to respond.”Taiwan’s stock markets were largely unaffected by the drills, rising 0.8% to a record high in morning trading.","China launches large-scale live-fire military drills around Taiwan.

'Power of the organisation'

BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday stopped short of agreeing with its senior leader Digvijay Singh after he gave example of Rashtriya Swayamseva Sangh ( RSS ) to call for organisational reforms within Congress.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera, reacting to former Madhya Pradesh chief minister's remarks said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Earlier on Saturday Digvijay praised the organisational strength of RSS and shared a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi seated back on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, acknowledging how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh BJP worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""However, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO. If it's an NGO, then where have your rules and regulations gone? But I admire their organisational capacity,"" he added.Earlier this week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him ""full marks"" while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'संघटन सृजन' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Digvijay's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the party.BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Rahul was bringing his party ""upside down"" because he had been sidelined in the party.""It's because our Narendra Modi is 'guddri ke lal' (diamond in the rough) and their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' (great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru). Since our Narendra Modi has risen to top from bottom, he is taking the party (BJP) also to the top from bottom,"" Trivedi told a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.In a swipe to Rahul, he said, ""Since their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' who is now 'side down from up', he is bringing his party upside down.""This comes after the Congress held the CWC meet in Delhi on Saturday under the chaimanship of party chief Mallikarjun Kharge -- first after the party suffered a huge loss in Bihar assembly elections.After the CWC meet, Kharge announced that the grand-old-party launch a nation-wide protest against the Centre for replacing rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law from January 5.""In the meeting, we took an oath. We decided to launch a massive movement across the country, making the MNREGA scheme the central point.

Red tape may be often associated with officialdom but for J&K’s paperless bureaucracy, green is the go-to colour this year-end as it has achieved the equivalent of “planting over 4.5 lakh trees or taking over 2,200 cars off the roads permanently”, according to a study.Released on Monday, the study by Shahid Iqbal Choudhary, secretary in J&K’s science and technology department, shows the govt’s move from paper files to digital systems has helped avoid more than 62,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Digitisation has removed the need for over 20 million paper pages each year, saving thousands of trees and cutting pollution, says Choudhary’s study, published by. The research provides a first-of-its-kind, scientifically grounded environmental impact evaluation of digital public administration in a fragile Himalayan ecosystem.The govt formally shifted from physical movement of files to e-office in 2021. Choudhary calls it a turning point in the region’s administrative history. “The environmental impact was massive -- 10,294 tonnes of CO2 eliminated every year. The scale of what changed is hard to grasp until you see the numbers. Since 2021, this transition has avoided printing 405.7 million pages. Think about that. Hundreds of millions of paper sheets that never got manufactured, never got transported, never ended up in landfills.Tens of thousands of trees still standing,” Choudhary said.The science and technology secretary explained the changes further. “As of mid-2025, over 26,000 users in the civil secretariat and more than 31,000 at HoD levels actively use the e-Office platform, processing millions of files and receipts annually. The transition has replaced physical file transport and in-person correspondence with a digital ecosystem supported by secure networks, VPNs, and over 1.8 lakh official email addresses,” says the study.The research was based on data from 2018 to 2025, administrative records, transport logs and energy consumption patterns, all analysed using international methodologies. “Now, 114,826 officials process everything digitally. They’ve handled 3.75 million files and 34 million receipts without paper. It’s faster, more transparent, and dramatically better for the environment,” Choudhary said.According to the secretary, the changes mark a paradigm shift in “our thinking on climate action”. “We focus so much on big industrial changes. But govt operations themselves have a significant carbon footprint. When you digitise an entire administrative system, especially in ecologically sensitive mountain regions, the environmental gains are substantial and immediate.”Choudhary held up the efforts as a model for administrative systems across India, especially in hilly states. “The combination of difficult terrain, fragile ecosystems, and administrative needs makes digital governance not just efficient but environmentally essential,” he said.","J&K's move from paper files to digital systems has helped avoid more than 62,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

Elderly deaths, distress reported amid SIR hearings across Bengal

KOLKATA: An 82-year-old jumped on the railway tracks hours before his scheduled appearance at a hearing for the special intensive revision of electoral rolls at Para in Bengal's Purulia Monday. A septuagenarian from Howrah and another from Kalyani died after receiving SIR hearing notices. Family members of both blamed SIR stress for the deaths.As SIR hearings entered the third day, reports poured in of anxiety gripping ""unmapped"" voters being asked to appear before EC officials.A 96-year-old man in Cooch Behar, a 90-year-old woman in Katwa and a pregnant homemaker from Taki were among thousands who waited in queues for hearings. EC clarified that, on request, BLOs would visit homes of voters aged 85 and above, and those with disabilities and ailments.TNNDurjan Majhi, 82, jumped onto the railway tracks and was run over by a train at 8.30am, around 5 hours before he was to appear in an SIR hearing at the Para BDO office. His only son Kanai, who works as a day labourer, said, ""My father had submitted the SIR enumeration form but his name was not on the draft voters' list.His name was on the 2002 voters' list, though. We don't understand why he was called to a hearing. He had been anxious since getting the hearing notice on Dec 25. ""Jamat Ali, 75, passed away at his home in Howrah's Amta Sunday night, hours after receiving a hearing notice. Howrah DM P Deepap Priya said, ""He was already unwell. His kin claimed he was anxious about the hearing. An inquiry is underway.""In Kalyani, Jaharlal Mahato (72) died of cardiac arrest on Monday, 48 hours after he attended an SIR hearing.

He could barely walk because of his age and physical ailments. ""I am the only one in my family to get the SIR notice. My name was not on the 2002 list. I gave them whatever documents I had,"" Sarkar said, visibly frustrated.At Katwa I BDO office, one of the people in the queue was a 90-year-old bedridden woman, Muktibala Paramanik, whose house is 4km from the hearing venue. Grandson Paritosh Paramanik said, ""This is just harassment. They asked her to sign some documents and let her go.""East Burdwan DM Ayesha Rani said, ""We did not get any written instruction that hearings for elderly people should be conducted at home. Even so, I instructed that elderly and infirm people should not be called.""A woman from Taki, who is eight months pregnant, fell ill while waiting in a long queue at Basirhat Block II BDO office. Supriya Mondal got a hearing notice as her name did not feature on the 2002 list. Her mother, Khukurani Das, said, ""After waiting for a long time in the crowd, my daughter suddenly felt dizzy and collapsed.

NEW DELHI: From French and Israeli-origin missiles to 'Make in India' kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems as well as range extension of existing missiles and artillery rockets, the defence ministry on Monday gave the preliminary nod to a slew of military modernisation projects worth Rs 79,000 crore.The biggest project to get acceptance of necessity, first step in long-winded procurement process, from the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council was Rs 30,000 crore purchase of a large number of missiles for Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile system, jointly developed with Israel, for IAF and Navy, sources told TOI.These missiles, with an interception range of over 70km, were used as part of the multi-layered air defence network that thwarted the multiple waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles fired by Pakistan during the cross-border hostilities in May.The DAC also approved the Rs 1,600-crore lease of two more MQ-9B 'Predator' high-altitude long endurance drones, which will add to the existing two being operated by the Navy for long-range surveillance missions, for three years. They will fill the gap till India gets the 31 armed MQ-9B remotely-piloted aircraft systems in 2029-30 under the $3.8 billion deal with the US in Oct last year. Another major project to get the nod was the long-pending over Rs 9,000-crore acquisition of six mid-air refuelling aircraft for IAF to extend operational reach of its fighter jets.""Under it, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) will modify six second-hand Boeing 767 commercial planes into tankers. A fresh approval was required because the competition resulted in a single vendor situation,"" a source said.Two crucial home-grown design and development projects to get the AoN were for range extensions of the Astra Mark-2 air-to-air missiles and Pinaka guided rocket ammunition. The Pinaka multiple launch artillery systems currently fire multi-calibre rockets with a variety of warheads up to ranges of 75 km. ""Pinaka's deep strike lethal capability is now being increased to 120 km. It was tested successfully on Sunday. In the future, it will be extended to 300 km,"" a source said.DRDO is already working on enhancing the range of Astra missiles from the existing 100-km to 200-km. ""IAF will initially order 600-700 Astra-2 missiles. There will also be a 350-km Astra-3 in the future. Indigenous long range air-to-air missiles are crucial,"" another source said. ""DAC also approved some additional French Meteor air-to-air missiles (120 to 150-km range) for Rafale fighters as well as Israeli guidance kits for Spice-1000 precision-guided bombs (125-km),"" he added.AoN was also accorded for 850 kamikaze drones or loitering munitions for precision strikes for the Army's new 'Shaktibaan' and 'Divyastra' artillery batteries for around Rs 2,000 crore. ""They will be made in India either by domestic companies or with foreign collaboration,"" the source said. The indigenous integrated drone detection & interdiction system Mark-2 (IDD&IS) systems, with 30-kilowatt lasers to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft and swarm drones at ranges up to 3.5-km, also got the green light.The overhauls of Mi-17 helicopters in Russia and T-90S main-battle tanks in India were also approved.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu police have detained four 17-year-old school dropouts for hacking a 20-year-old migrant worker from Odisha with sickles near abandoned railway quarters in Tiruttani, a temple town on Chennai's northwestern fringe, after filming the assault to post as a social media reel.The victim, K Suraj, recently arrived in Chennai following a family dispute and had been surviving on menial jobs, police said Monday.The attack unfolded Saturday evening aboard a Chennai-Tiruttani EMU local train. At Thiruvalangadu station, about 70km northwest of Chennai, the four juveniles boarded Suraj's compartment, allegedly drunk & carrying two sickles concealed in bags. Investigators said they planned to use the weapons while recording content for social media.A brief exchange in Hindi escalated into an argument that continued until the train reached Tiruttani station, around 90km from Chennai. After disembarking, the youths allegedly forced Suraj towards the railway quarters near the tracks. Three attacked him with sickles, with one flashing a ""victory sign"", while a fourth recorded the assault on a mobile phone, police said.Suraj suffered deep cut wounds. Bleeding heavily, he staggered to a nearby road, where passers-by alerted railway police. He was taken to Tiruttani govt hospital and later referred to Tiruvallur Govt Medical College Hospital, where doctors said his condition was stable. Police traced the suspects using the video uploaded to Instagram, locating them later that night near Gangai Amman temple along the Tiruttani-Arakkonam bypass, a highway stretch on the town's outskirts, where they were allegedly drinking.Produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, three were sent to a govt observation home. The fourth, described as differently abled, was released to his parents with a warning.","Four 17-year-old school dropouts detained for hacking migrant worker with sickles.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

NEW DELHI: Amidst outrage over the murder of Anjel Chakma, 24, from Tripura allegedly on racial grounds, a petition has been filed in Supreme Court seeking its intervention to protect people from north-eastern states from hate and racial abuse in other parts of the country.The petition, filed by advocate Anoop Prakash Awasthi, said that people from northeast are subjected to racial abuse across the country and they are targeted as if they are not citizens of the country. He said the repeated humiliation of north-eastern citizens by being called ""Chinese"" or ""chinky"" is not merely a matter of individual prejudice but it represents a fundamental misunderstanding of India itself and its civilisational and constitutional vision.Referring to TOI's report on the last words spoken by the deceased that he was also an Indian while appealing to the attackers not to target him, the petition said it's a failure of constitutional governance if a citizen has to assert nationality as a defence against violence.""What renders this incident constitutionally searing are the victim's reported last words, spoken in a moment of existential desperation: ""I am Indian...What certificate should we show?"" These words are not merely an expression of personal anguish; they constitute an indictment of the Republic's failure to make citizenship experientially real for all its people. When an Indian citizen, in the moments before death, feels compelled to assert nationality as a defence against violence, the promise of equality before law stands profoundly compromised,"" the petition said.It said the question raised by Chakma ""what certificate should we show"" exposes the informal but pervasive demand placed within our society upon racially distinct Indians to explain their citizenship which is unfortunate as Indianness flows from the Constitution, not from public perception or ethnic conformity.""The killing of Anjel Chakma must therefore be understood as the culmination of a social process rather than an aberration. It demonstrates how racial othering, when left unaddressed, travels a continuum, from verbal abuse to physical assault, and ultimately to homicide. The law's failure to interrupt this continuum at earlier stages amounts to a failure of constitutional governance. The vulnerability of citizens from the north-eastern States is not an unforeseen or emergent phenomenon. It stands formally acknowledged on the floor of Parliament itself. Centre, through replies given to questions raised in the Lok Sabha in March 2017, placed on record both the prevalence of racial attacks and the absence of any dedicated institutional mechanism to address them. These replies, read together, constitute clear executive admissions of knowledge coupled with inaction,"" the petition said.The petitioner said that a young student from Tripura being compelled to utter the words ""I am Indian...What certificate should we show?"" to avoid death was not merely a personal tragedy but a a civilisational indictment.""The incident was preceded by racial slurs questioning the victim's nationality and identity, reflecting a deeply entrenched social trope that citizens from the north-eastern states are ""outsiders"" within their own country, a trope which, when normalised by silence and institutional indifference, escalates from verbal abuse to lethal violence,"" the petition said, pleading the SC in intervene to frame guidelines as there was vacuum in policy.""The informal and pervasive demand placed upon north-eastern citizens to ""prove"" their nationality through appearance, language, or conduct is inherently unconstitutional, arbitrary, and discriminatory, and no such burden is imposed upon citizens whose physical features conform to socially constructed norms,"" the petition said.",Petition has been filed in Supreme Court seeking intervention to protect people from north-eastern states from hate and racial abuse in other parts of the country.

NEW DELHI: Expressing horror at the ""hate crime"" murder of Anjel Chakma in Dehradun, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday blamed the ""hate spewing"" leadership of BJP for normalising prejudice, which, he said, is being fed for years through toxic content and irresponsible narratives.Assam Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said Chakma was killed after being called a ""Chinese"" while the oldest tribe of Karbi are facing ""Chinese go back"" slogans in their own land of Karbi Anglong in Assam, as he accused the governing BJP of failing to celebrate the diversity of the country.Gogoi said there was a 12-day delay in filing the case in Chakma's murder and the main accused has gone absconding. He demanded an inquiry into lax action and immediate arrest of the accused.The Assam Congress chief said the people of the North-East are facing prejudice on a daily basis across states while ""our PM and the entire machinery supporting him is only focused on changing the mindset of India from one that celebrates its diversity to one that focuses only on one identity"".He said BJP govt is not able to understand the anger among the people of the North-East against the Centre. ""Neither could they understand it in Manipur, nor in Karbi Anglong.They are also unable to understand the doubts in the minds of the people of the region in the Anjel Chakma case. The PM only uses people as a prop, who are collected during his trips and then sent back after a photo-op,"" he said.Gogoi said he too was once asked at Agra where he hailed from and was asked to show his passport. ""Only the people of the North-East understand this pain. And, it takes a lot of courage to proudly carry our country's flag despite such experiences. This is evidence of our tolerance and our patriotism,"" he said.Rahul said, ""India is built on respect and unity, not fear and abuse. We are a country of love and diversity.

For six months, we had been tracking Mishra,"" said SP Palash Bansal.The surveillance and tip-offs revealed that Mishra had changed his identity to evade arrest. His wife Shyama had also changed her name to Pooja Tiwari, said Bansal.""The accused managed to stay off police radar by frequently changing locations and limiting contact with relatives.The accused worked in factories and made no contact with the family, and even avoided travelling to Banda in these years,"" said an official.The breakthrough came when cops intercepted a call made by his wife to her parents. It raised red flags during surveillance, prompting cops to verify the family details and movements. The cops checked that the names of the parents matched those of the in-laws of the elusive Mishra.After months of quiet tracking and ground verification, police zeroed in on the suspect's activity as he was to come to attend his son's wedding in Banda, said a source.","Sandeep Mishra had been on the run after escaping from police custody in 13 years ago.

Hyderabad: A year after Telangana HC declared that former BRS MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh was not an Indian citizen and imposed a Rs 30 lakh fine on him for concealing his German citizenship while contesting assembly elections, he continues to receive a pension of Rs 60,000 as a former MLA.Congress MLA Adi Srinivas has urged the assembly secretary not to pay the pension to Ramesh, arguing that he is not entitled to any govt benefits, and has demanded the recovery of benefits, emoluments, and salary already given to the German citizen.""As there has been no action on my previous request, I am again urging the assembly secretary and the Speaker to stop his pension immediately. I will approach the HC on this issue again, if required,"" said Srinivas, who had challenged Ramesh's citizenship.Sources said the assembly secretary had earlier informed Srinivas that the high court order did not mention recovering salary and other emoluments from Ramesh, and that there was no provision under existing rules to make such recoveries.Under the Telangana assembly rules, former MLAs are entitled to a pension, medical reimbursement, and other benefits. As Ramesh had served four terms as MLA from Vemulawada, he drew over Rs 50,000 as monthly pension from Dec 2023.Following court order, Ramesh paid Rs 30 lakh in damages.Former Telangana advocate general K Rama Krishna Reddy said, ""The legislative secretary cannot decide on pension issues as he does not have adjudicating powers. The assembly Speaker can decide whether Ramesh is entitled to the pension, as this is a decision to be taken post-disposal of the court case. Srinivas can also approach the competent court on the issue.""He added that Srinivas had approached Supreme Court by filing a special leave petition to declare him elected for the terms Ramesh served as MLA. However, in Aug this year, Supreme Court, declining to interfere, said it could not 'resurrect' the matter as the term of the election had already ended.""Even SC did not address the emoluments and pension when the present MLA approached top court,"" a source close to Ramesh told TOI.","Former BRS MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh continues to receive a pension of Rs 60,000 as a former MLA.

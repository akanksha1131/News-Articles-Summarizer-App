"Delhi at 66%, but only 22% deaths nationwide have certified cause",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-at-66-but-only-22-deaths-nationwide-have-certified-cause/articleshow/128289081.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Even as Delhi reports relatively strong medical certification of deaths, the national picture remains stark — only 22% of registered deaths in India were medically certified in 2023, exposing a serious gap in how the country tracks disease trends and plans health policy.The concern was flagged at a two-day National Symposium on Strengthening Mortality Information Systems held in the capital, which concluded on February 11. Experts warned that despite years of reform efforts, large sections of India’s death data remain incomplete.Latest Civil Registration data reveal sharp disparities across States and Union Territories. Delhi recorded 66% of registered deaths as medically certified, placing it among the better-performing regions. Goa (100%), Lakshadweep (99.2%) and Puducherry (91.4%) have near-universal certification, while Chandigarh (76.4%) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (67.2%) also report high coverage. In contrast, several large states lag significantly — Maharashtra (42.4%), Tamil Nadu (39.1%), Telangana (38.4%), Karnataka (26.7%), Odisha (23.4%) and Gujarat (23.3%) — pulling the national average down to 22%.Dr Harshal Ramesh Salve of AIIMS told TOI that barely 1 in 5 deaths nationally undergo proper medical certification of cause.A substantial proportion of deaths — particularly in rural areas — occur outside health facilities, where formal certification is often absent.Inaugurating the symposium, Dr V K Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, stressed that robust and interoperable mortality systems are essential for evidence-based governance. He said health planning must be driven by reliable, real-time data and underscored the need for coordinated action across sectors to ensure that every death is counted and its cause scientifically determined.Experts said counting every death and accurately recording its cause is critical for estimating disease burden, identifying risk factors and designing prevention strategies. Without reliable cause-of-death data, health planning risks relying on projections rather than evidence. Stronger data sharing between ORGI, the health ministry and academic institutions, they added, would help generate science-driven, decentralised policies and improve India’s self-reliance in disease estimation.Over the past decade, AIIMS and the Office of the Registrar General of India strengthened surveillance through verbal autopsy and digital systems. More than 10 lakh cases were reviewed, and over 4 lakh deaths were assigned a probable cause, with about 1,000 trained doctors engaged across 27 institutes. However, much of this supports sample-based surveillance rather than universal coverage. With nearly 1 crore deaths reported annually, comprehensive certification remains a work in progress.Verbal autopsy is used mainly when a person dies outside a hospital. It involves interviewing family members about symptoms and circumstances before death, after which trained doctors assign the most likely cause using standard medical classification systems. While it improves national estimates, experts say expanding routine medical certification of deaths in hospitals and communities remains essential.The symposium concluded with the launch of a National Consortium for Strengthening Mortality Data Systems to improve data quality, expand certification and accelerate digital integration nationwide.Public health experts said that while Delhi’s 66% certification rate reflects progress, the national gap underscores the urgency of ensuring that every death — and its cause — is systematically recorded.","Latest Civil Registration data reveal sharp disparities across States and Union Territories.

"FOGSI seeks rollback of NEET-PG percentile cuts, flags ‘pay-to-enter’ risk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fogsi-seeks-rollback-of-neet-pg-percentile-cuts-flags-pay-to-enter-risk/articleshow/128289362.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), representing clinicians and academicians committed to maintaining high standards in medical education and patient care, has sought an immediate review and withdrawal of repeated reductions in the NEET-PG qualifying percentile.In a statement issued on February 11, FOGSI expressed serious concern that lowering the qualifying threshold in a national merit-based examination dilutes meritocracy and compromises academic rigour, raising concerns about the quality of specialist training and patient safety.The body urged the National Medical Commission, particularly its Postgraduate Medical Education Board, to urgently revisit the policy.FOGSI pointed out that the NEET-PG Information Bulletin already lays down a structured and transparent algorithm for filling vacant seats, including category conversion and sequential counselling rounds. These mechanisms, it said, must be strictly followed and exhausted before any lowering of qualifying standards is considered.Addressing the issue of vacant seats, the federation said the root cause is not lack of merit but “highly irrational and unaffordable” fee structures in several private and deemed universities.With postgraduate fees running from tens of lakhs to several crores, specialist education risks turning into a “pay-to-enter” system where financial capacity outweighs competence.“Postgraduate medical education is not merely about seat occupancy; it is about training competent specialists who will serve the nation for decades,” the statement said, adding that dilution of entry standards alongside unchecked commercialisation threatens academic excellence, professional dignity and public trust.FOGSI called upon authorities to withdraw repeated percentile reductions, ensure strict adherence to counselling and seat-conversion rules, initiate urgent rationalisation and regulation of postgraduate fee structures, and engage specialty societies and academic stakeholders before implementing policy changes with long-term consequences.The federation reiterated its commitment to safeguarding merit, affordability and the integrity of medical education in the larger interest of patients and public health.","The Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) has sought an immediate review and withdrawal of repeated reductions in the NEET-PG qualifying percentile.

"SC to courts: Show courage, drop cases before trial if proof not strong",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-courts-show-courage-drop-cases-before-trial-if-proof-not-strong/articleshow/128285342.cms,"NEW DELHI: Criminal proceedings bring strain and social stigma, the SC said on Thursday, urging courts, particularly trial courts, to show “clarity and courage” to discharge an accused at the framing of charges itself when the material on record fails to make out a prima facie case.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said that judicial process itself should not become a punishment, and the courts must remain alive to the human consequences of their decisions and to the trust society places in them. The court passed the order while discharging a person under SC/ST Act after it found that ingredients of the offence under the special law was not met but it allowed trial court to proceed for offences under IPC.The top court said charges are to be framed only if the court forms an opinion that there is a ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence and said HCs should also apply their mind on discharge plea and not to reject it mechanically.“...at the stage of framing of charge or considering discharge, the court is not dealing with an abstract legal exercise. It is dealing with real people, real anxieties and the real weight of criminal prosecution.Judicial responsibility at this stage calls for care, balance, and an honest engagement with the facts on record. The power to frame a charge is not meant to be exercised by default or out of caution alone. When the material placed before the court, taken at face value, does not disclose the ingredients of an offence, the law expects the court to have the clarity and courage to say so and to keep such a case aside,” Justice Karol, who wrote the judgment for the bench, said. The bench said discharge is not a technical indulgence “but an essential safeguard”.“The court must consciously distinguish between a genuine case that warrants a trial and one that rests only on suspicion or assumption or for that matter without any basis. To allow a matter to proceed despite the absence of a prima facie case is to expose a person to the strain, stigma, and uncertainty of criminal proceedings without legal necessity. Fidelity to the rule of law requires the court to remember that the process itself can become the punishment if this responsibility is not exercised with care,” it said.The bench said the responsibility weighs the heaviest on trial courts.“For a litigant or an accused, the trial court is not just one level in a hierarchy. It represents the face of the judiciary itself. The sensitivity, fairness, and legal discipline shown at this stage shape how ordinary citizens understand justice. The impression a trial court creates, through its approach to facts and law, often becomes the impression people carry of the entire judicial system. That is why, at every stage and especially at the threshold, trial courts must remain alive to the human consequences of their decisions and to the trust that society places in them,” it said.",The top court said charges are to be framed only if the court forms an opinion that there is a ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence.

Rera only facilitating builders in default: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rera-only-facilitating-builders-in-default-sc/articleshow/128284797.cms,"Better Abolish It: Bench At Hearing On HP Office Shift

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said it is high time all states rethought the constitution of the real estate regulatory authority (Rera) as the institution is doing nothing except “facilitating” defaulting builders.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the people for whom Rera was created were “completely disappointed”. “Better abolish this institution, we don’t mind that,” the CJI said. The observations came as the bench permitted the Himachal govt to shift the Rera office to a place of its choice.“...High time that all the states should revisit and rethink of even constituting this authority,” the bench said.When the bench was informed that a retired IAS officer was appointed in Rera, the CJI said, “In every state, it has become a rehabilitation centre. These authorities are all occupied by these persons.”The advocate general of Himachal told the bench that, as per a policy decision, the state is developing Palampur, Dharamshala and other cities.The CJI asked, “What is the logic of having a retired bureaucrat? How he will be able to help in developing Palampur? You need to avail services of some architect who is environment friendly, knows Palampur, Dharamshala and these areas.Only those persons will help”.The bench issued notice on a plea filed by Himachal Pradesh govt and others challenging an order of the high court in a matter pertaining to the shifting of the state Rera office from Shimla to Dharamshala. The HC had earlier stayed a June 2025 notification concerning the shifting of the Rera office till further order. Later, in its order on Dec 30, 2025, the court directed the continuance of the interim order. The top court stayed the HC’s Dec 30 direction.In its plea filed in the top court through advocate Sugandha Anand, the state said the decision to shift the office was taken to “decongest” Shimla, and it was purely on administrative considerations. An advocate, appearing for the respondent, said 90% of the projects with which the authority deals are in Shimla, Solan, Parwanoo and Sirmaur, which are within a radius of a maximum of 40km. He said about 92% of complaints pending before Rera are from these districts; only 20 projects are in Dharamshala.“The people for whom this institution was created, they are completely depressed, disgusted and disappointed. None of them are getting any effective relief. For whom this institution actually is now serving, you will find out when you meet these people,” the bench said.The top court also observed that Shimla is “completely over exhausted”. Issuing notice on the plea, the bench said, “The state is permitted to shift the office of Rera to the place of its choice. However, it shall be subject to the final outcome of the writ petition pending before the high court”.The bench was also informed that Shimla district judge hears appeals against the orders passed by Rera. To ensure those affected by the orders of Rera do not face any inconvenience visiting Shimla for filing appeals, it is directed that appellate power may be shifted to principal district judge of Dharamshala, the bench said.","The bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the people for whom Rera was created were “completely disappointed” “Better abolish this institution, we don’t mind that,” the CJI said.

Why is stock market down today? Top 5 reasons

IT sector stocks crash

Weak global equity markets

Dollar strength, weak rupee

Weak technical set-up

Geopolitical tensions linger

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,600, BSE Sensex was down over 700 points. At 10:45 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,570.30, down 237 points or 0.92%. BSE Sensex was at 82,943.66, down 731 points or 0.87%.The stock market slide was led by continued selloff in IT shares which weighed heavily on market sentiment amid rising concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence.Large-cap technology stocks such as Infosys, TCS, HCLTech and Wipro led the losses. The crash wiped out approximately Rs 4.62 lakh crore in investor wealth, reducing the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies to around Rs 467 lakh crore.Selling pressure in IT stocks intensified for a second straight session after the American depositary receipts of Infosys and Wipro dropped nearly 10 percent overnight. During Friday’s trading, the Nifty IT index fell more than 4 percent, taking its two-day decline close to 10 percent. Major sector players including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, HCLTech and Mphasis declined between 4 and 6 percent, indicating widespread weakness across the segment.Negative sentiment strengthened after US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic introduced a new enterprise-oriented tool designed for corporate legal teams. The company, known for its Claude chatbot, said that the platform can automate several tasks such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement sorting, compliance processes, preparation of legal briefs and standardised responses. This development has raised concerns about the long-term demand outlook for traditional IT services.“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon,” warned V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. He added that Indian IT may continue to face pressure in the near term, while a rotation of capital toward stronger-performing sectors could support stocks outside the technology space.Global market sentiment remained fragile after sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday, driven largely by heavy selling in technology stocks. Investors turned cautious amid growing concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt earnings visibility and compress margins across the sector.The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, fell around 2 percent, while broader US indices also declined as market participants evaluated fresh labour market data and positioned themselves ahead of the closely monitored January inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 669.42 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 49,451.98. The S&P 500 slipped 108.71 points, or 1.57 percent, to 6,832.76, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 469.32 points, or 2.03 percent, ending at 22,597.15.Asian equities mirrored the weakness on Friday, pulling back from recent record levels as concerns over profitability pressures in the technology sector weighed on major stocks such as AppleA stronger US dollar, which extended gains for a third consecutive session to 96.93, along with a softer rupee, added to market pressure.The Nifty closed in negative territory on Thursday, slipping out of its recent consolidation range and forming a short-term pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The 26,000 level continues to act as a significant resistance zone, supported by strong call writing activity and multiple failed attempts to move higher.Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East has continued to weigh on investor sentiment after Donald Trump warned that the United States could consider action against Iran if negotiations over a nuclear agreement fail, even as diplomatic efforts remain underway. Adding to market unease, Trump indicated that deploying an additional aircraft carrier to the region is under consideration as Washington and Tehran prepare to restart discussions.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff.

"Centre rejects Sixth Schedule, statehood for Ladakh, offers council",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-rejects-sixth-schedule-statehood-for-ladakh-offers-council/articleshow/128273026.cms,"JAMMU: The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, two key demands of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution allows special administrative arrangements for tribal areas to safeguard autonomy, culture and land. Speaking publicly for the first time after the Feb 4 talks with a Union home ministry (MHA) high-powered committee, Ladakh leaders said the Centre had instead offered a “territorial council” model.Under this proposal, chief executive councillor of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) will be designated as CM and the deputy chief executive councillor as deputy CM.“We call it a farce. LAB and KDA rejected it (the offer), except for one KDA member, Kunzes Dolma,” KDA co-chairman Asgar Ali Karbali said at a gathering in Kargil on Wednesday.According to Karbali, Dolma had earlier supported KDA’s agenda and was nominated as a member for the talks. “She told the high-powered committee that a conspiracy was hatched to remove her and that she is satisfied with the Union Territory status for Ladakh.We will not tolerate anyone, whether Dolma or anyone else, who plays with Ladakhi identity,” Karbali said.As Karbali spoke, many in the Kargil gathering raised slogans against Dolma and chanted support for Sonam Wangchuk, LAB member and climate activist jailed over violence in Sept 2025 during statehood protests in Leh.After the talks negotiations with the MHA committee headed by junior Union home minister Home Nityanand Rai, Karbali and Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) president Tsering Dorje Lakrook had described the talks as inconclusive.“When we reiterated Sixth Schedule status and statehood, they (MHA officials) argued that the Sixth Schedule has become ‘defunct’ and largely powerless. We disagreed. Supreme Court has repeatedly held Sixth Schedule as a law in itself and a strong constitutional safeguard. If it is powerful in the Northeastern states, why is it suddenly being called weak for Ladakh?” Karbali said.On statehood, Karbali said the MHA’s main objection was that Ladakh lacks sufficient financial resources. “When we asked that our legal experts be allowed to explain this, we were told they could not be called into the meeting. There is no Indian state that has every resource within its own territory,” Karbali argued.He reiterated the LAB and the KDA remain united in pressing for Sixth Schedule status and statehood as their core demands.","The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.

NEW DELHI: The Congress–DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu faced renewed strain on Thursday after Congress MP Manickam Tagore publicly pushed back against chief minister MK Stalin after he dismissed the power-sharing demands as a ""conspiracy"".Tagore, one of the most vocal proponents of a share in governance for Congress, questioned Stalin’s remarks in one-line post on X: ""How is it that seeking, in a spirit of friendship, a role (a share) in work to serve the people could be termed as conspiracy?"" The pointed response, accompanied by a thinking-face emoji, suggested that at least a section of the party is unwilling to soften its stand even after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leadership drew a clear red line.DMK chief Stalin on Wednesday firmly ruled out sharing power with allies, while insisting that the alliance with the Congress was ""intact"" and free of confusion. ""We also know that it will not work in Tamil Nadu; they (Congress) know it too. It is a problem created by some people. They are deliberately conspiring to see if there will be a rift in the alliance. We are not worried about it. Rahul Gandhi is not worried either,"" Stalin said.Emphasising continuity, the chief minister added, ""The DMK-Congress alliance is in harmony. What others are expecting will not happen,"" Stalin said.The DMK leadership has since doubled down on that position. Senior party leader and Tamil Nadu forests minister RS Rajakannappan struck a blunt note saying the party did not run on the strength of alliances. ""If they come, let them come; if they go, let them go. It is the chief minister’s preference,"" he said.Rajakannappan also invoked history to justify the DMK's stance. ""When Kalaignar won more than 100 seats, did he allow a share in governance? When the DMK is poised to win 150 seats, how can we give a share?"" he had asked at a recent event, reiterating that there would only be a ""Dravida model"" government under Stalin.Within the Congress, the signals are more mixed. While Tagore has argued that the question of whether Tamil Nadu should have a single-party or coalition government should be left to the people, the party’s state leadership has opted for caution. TNCC president K Selvaperunthagai said the chief minister had expressed his view and added, ""Every party has its own opinion. Our leaders voice their views. Everyone, including the AICC high command and the CM, will sit and discuss and take a good decision. "" He insisted that there was ""no opportunity"" for a crack in the alliance.Stalin's carefully worded response till now on power-sharing had asserted DMK dominance in the alliance while avoiding a direct confrontation with the Congress leadership. His recent comment has, however, put Congress leadership in a very uncomfortable spot.Political commentator Suguna Diwakar told TOI earlier that a large number of Congress functionaries were not very particular about share in power, and that party would remain with the DMK. “There is no strong demand from the Congress leadership for a share in power. None of the party top brass was adamant about their demand. Only stray voices such as AICC functionary Praveen Chakravarty and Congress MP Manickam Tagore made these demands,” he said. “At least now they are strong with 18 MLAs and if they join an untested player like Vijay they will be reduced to a minor party in the state,” said Suguna Diwakar.However, there's one more option.Politcal analyst TSS Mani said majority of Congress cadres and functionaries wish to go with the TVK. He told TOI that AICC general secretary KC Venugopal feels that TVK president Vijay has a considerable number of fans in Kerala as well as other southern states. ""Congress leaders feel that this support base will help the party in 2029,"" Mani said.The recent out-in-the-open tension between the DMK and the Congress has however given an ammunition to the Bharatiya Janata Party. The saffron party has claimed both allies were searching for an exit ahead of the 2026 assembly elections. ""DMK feels Congress is a waste luggage to carry, and Congress feels the DMK may not return due to anti-incumbency,"" BJP spokesperson Narayanan Tirupathy claimed, calling the situation a standoff with each side waiting for the other to blink.For now, both allies maintain that the partnership endures. Yet the increasingly public exchange of sharp words over power-sharing raised questions about how long the truce can hold as negotiations over seats and strategy for 2026 draw closer.","Congress MP Manickam Tagore publicly pushed back against chief minister MK Stalin. Tagore questioned Stalin’s remarks in one-line post on X: ""How is it that seeking, in a spirit of friendship, a role (a share) in work to serve the people could be termed as conspiracy?"" Tagore is one of the most vocal proponents of a share in governance for Congress.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128254142,imgsize-1040000,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"
"Muslim groups, Left, TMC oppose govt’s move to mandate recitation of all 6 verses of Vande Mataram",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muslim-groups-left-tmc-oppose-govts-move-to-mandate-recitation-of-all-6-verses-of-vande-mataram/articleshow/128276596.cms,"NEW DELHI: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Thursday strongly objected to the central govt’s recent notification mandating the recitation of all six verses of ‘Vande Mataram’ at official functions and in schools before the National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana.The AIMPLB has termed the decision “unconstitutional and contrary to religious freedom” and demanded that the govt immediately withdraw the notification or else it will challenge it in the court. Both factions of prominent Muslim body Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind have also raised objections to the govt’s order.Meanwhile, Left parties like CPI(M) and CPI also came forward to oppose the MHA order. CPI(M) demanded that the govt “uphold the spirit of the Constitution and immediately withdraw this order”.The CPI(M) accused the BJP-led union govt of attempting to create an “unnecessary controversy concerning the national song and the national anthem with ulterior motives” and that the “BJP govt should not be allowed to play with such historic cultural symbols.”The Left party highlighted that “the Constitution of India clearly states in Article 51A(a) that it is the duty of every citizen to respect the national flag and the national anthem.After thorough deliberation, the constituent assembly adopted the statement made by President Rajendra Prasad concerning the national song, whose two stanzas only would be sung.”“Through its recent order, the govt seeks to include the remaining four stanzas, which the constituent assembly felt did not resonate the secular character of the Indian Republic,” the party added.CPI’s Rajya Sabha MP Sandosh Kumar P accused the govt of “cynically weaponising culture to polarise the people.” “Our position is clear: for us, the country comes first; for the BJP, elections come first,” he added.Referring to the ruling party at the Centre, he alleged that “it is deeply ironic that those who had no role in the freedom struggle and remained subservient to British colonialism now claim the authority to issue certificates of nationalism.”Trinamool Congress lashed out at the govt alleging that the BJP was “Bangla-Birodhi”. “And now, in an official notification, @HMOIndia has distorted the original lyrics of Vande Mataram penned by Rishi Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in Anandamath,” the party alleged in a post on X.Elaborating on the reasons for opposition, AIMPLB general secretary, Maulana Mohammed Fazlur Rahim Mujaddidi, alleged that the MHA order was “unconstitutional, against religious freedom and secular values, contrary to Supreme Court judgment, and directly conflicting with the religious beliefs of Muslims.”“Whatever the political considerations behind implementing this decision ahead of the West Bengal elections, Muslims cannot accept it, as it directly conflicts with their faith,” he added.Maulana Mujaddidi said that, following Rabindranath Tagore’s advice and deliberations in the Constituent Assembly, it had been agreed that only the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram would be used. He said that “a secular government cannot forcibly impose the beliefs or teachings of one religion upon followers of other religions”.He added that the song was written in the context of Bengal and contains references to the worship and veneration of Durga and other deities.“A Muslim worships only one God, Allah, without partners, and Islam does not permit any form of associating partners with God,” the AIMPLB general secretary emphasised.“Therefore, the Board demands that the Central Government immediately withdraw the notification; otherwise, the Board will challenge it in the court,” he asserted.Jamiat Ulama - i - Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani described the govt order as “biased” that he alleged was “a conspiracy to snatch the religious freedom” granted to all citizens by the Constitution of India.He further alleged that the Central govt’s order on Vande Mataram was a “unilateral and coercive decision” and that it reflects “a systematic attempt to curtail the constitutional rights of minorities”.“Muslims do not prevent anyone from singing or playing “Vande Mataram”; however, some verses of the song are based on beliefs that portray the homeland as a deity, which contradict the fundamental belief of monotheistic religions. Since a Muslim worships only one Allah, forcing him to sing this song is a clear violation of Article 25 of the Constitution and several judgments of the Supreme Court,” he added.In a statement from the Maulana Mahmood Madani-led faction of Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind faction, its general secretary Maulana Hakimuddin Qasmi said, “If the majority community wishes to recite it, they are fully entitled to do so. However, making it mandatory for all citizens would amount to imposing restrictions on religious freedom,” he added.He stated that the Constitution of India guarantees every citizen the inalienable right to profess, practice, and propagate his or her religion, and to live in accordance with one’s faith and conscience. “Therefore, compelling any individual to recite a specific poem or composition that conflicts with his or her religious beliefs is contrary to the spirit and provisions of the Constitution,” he said.He further stated that “India is a pluralistic and multi-religious nation where constitutional supremacy and the principle of “unity in diversity” form the foundation of national integration. Any step that weakens this foundation cannot be in the interest of the country.”“The Muslims of India hold a unanimous and unequivocal position that any decision undermining religious freedom will not be accepted. We strongly urge the Government of India to review the said circular in light of constitutional provisions, judicial precedents, and the diverse social fabric of the nation, so that religious liberty, constitutional dignity, and social harmony may be preserved,” he added.","The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has strongly objected to the central govt’s recent notification mandating the recitation of all six verses of ‘Vande Mataram’ at official functions and in schools before the National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday doubled down on his attack at the central government over the India-US trade deal, saying the pact with America ""betrays our food security and farmers"" and that PM Modi has opened the Indian agriculture market as US President Donald Trump ""has him by the throat.""Reacting to the ruling BJP 's privilege motion against him in the Lower House, the Rae Bareli MP said he spoke truth in Parliament and that he would be unfazed by the repercussions of it and reiterated his ""PM Modi has sold the nation"" remark.""Narendra Modi ji has sold the country, sold the farmers.

American farmers have large farms, thousands of acres of farms, fully mechanized and the government gives them subsidy. You know that our farmers have small farms, don't get proper MSP and mechanization is just in name,"" he said.His statement comes a day after his Lok Sabha speech in which he accused the Centre of ""compromising national interests"".In his address, the Congress leader said the government had acknowledged a global shift marked by the end of a single superpower era, rising geopolitical conflicts, and the weaponisation of energy and finance.Despite this, he alleged, the government had allowed the United States to weaponise energy and financial systems in ways that affect India.He further alleged the deal has compromised security in all three critical things needed to run a modern country — data, food supply, and energy.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi doubled down on his attack at the central government over the India-US trade deal.

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Thursday clarified that the investigation into the June 2025 crash of Air India Flight AI-171 in Ahmedabad is still ongoing, dismissing reports that the probe has concluded and pinned the blame for the incident on pilot.“The investigation is still in progress. No final conclusions have been reached,” the AAIB said, urging media organisations to exercise restraint and avoid premature speculation, which it said could cause public anxiety and undermine the integrity of the investigation.The AAIB noted that it conducts investigations strictly under the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2025, and India’s obligations under ICAO Annex 13.The preliminary report, released in July 2025, provided only factual information available at the time. The final investigation report, containing conclusions and safety recommendations, will be published upon completion.Earlier, Italian daily Corriere della Sera had reported, citing unnamed sources, that investigators had determined the crash was caused by an “intentional act” rather than a technical defect, and identified Captain Sumeet Sabharwal as the primary suspect.The report claimed US experts assisting in the probe described the findings as a “breakthrough.”The AAIB stressed that such reports are speculative. “Aircraft accident investigations are technical, evidence-based processes aimed at determining root causes and enhancing safety,” it said.The Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, operating Flight AI-171, crashed seconds after taking off from Ahmedabad airport, killing 260 people, including passengers and individuals in a medical students’ hostel where the aircraft fell.Only one passenger survived.

Congress missing from action

Is ‘solo’ the best way forward?

NEW DELHI: Is the Congress decision to go solo in West Bengal a bold political move with the party’s long-term gains in mind? Or is it a move fraught with political risks in a state where the grand-old party has been literally wiped out from the ground? The Congress, which faces an existential crisis in the state, has broken its alliance with the Left and announced to go solo in all 294 seats in the upcoming assembly elections.Now, consider these facts:In both these elections, the Congress had aligned with the Left to take on the common enemy - the ruling Trinamool Congress and its leader Mamata Banerjee . The Congress’s electoral strategy and political campaign centred around a very strong anti-Mamata theme, led by the then party chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is a known staunch and vocal critic of the Trinamool chief.Interestingly, while the Congress and the Left went all guns blazing against Mamata, the relentless BJP gained ground and captured the opposition space. The story of the 2021 assembly elections in West Bengal was the rise of the BJP as main opposition party and the simultaneous decimation of the Congress and the Left in state politics.So, while the Congress tally in assembly went down from 44 in 2016 to 0 in 2021, the BJP’s score increased from 3 in 2016 to 77 in 2021. In terms of vote share, the pattern was all the more worrying. Congress went down from 12.25% to 3.03% while the BJP jumped from 10.16% to 37.97%.The Congress’s decision to contest solo may signal the party’s resolve to take the long and difficult path of revival, but it perhaps ignores the grim ground reality of the party’s diminishing presence and influence in West Bengal.Does the party have enough time to make its presence felt among the electorate? More so, when its main rivals - the Trinamool Congress and the BJP have already taken giant strides on the ground to woo the voters.Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool have unleashed an all-out offensive against the Election Commission … from the streets of Kolkata to the Supreme Court in the national capital. Mamata has also announced many welfare-driven measures in her interim budget to set the electoral narrative ahead of the high-stakes polls.Some of the key announcements include:The BJP is also in an overdrive as it makes yet another attempt to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress. Top BJP leaders, both in Bengal and in Delhi, have been relentless in their attacks against Mamata Banerjee linking almost every incident in the state to the failure of the Trinamool government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have already addressed many political rallies in the poll-bound state. BJP chief Nitin Nabin has been holding meetings with all stakeholders to energise the party cadres.Here’s a look at some of the key moves which the BJP has already made:In the midst of all these political buzz, the Congress, unfortunately, has been missing from action till now. The Congress leadership seems to have done little on the ground after the past electoral drubbings except effecting a leadership change in the state. Shubhankar Sarkar replaced Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as the West Bengal Congress chief in September 2024.Since Adhir was a staunch critic of Mamata Banerjee and was the biggest hurdle in any possible alliance with the Trinamool, the change of guard was construed as a shift in the party’s approach vis-a-vis the Trinamool chief. However, once it was clear that Mamata was not interested in any tie-up, the Congress had no option but to go solo in the assembly polls. Continuing with the Left alliance was not an option given the fact that the Congress has high stakes in Kerala where the CPM-led LDF is its main rival.Shubhankar Sarkar after taking charge had stated that the 2026 assembly elections and strengthening the organisation were two of his immediate missions. However, just months away from the 2026 electoral battle, he seems to be still far away from achieving either of them.Over the years, the Congress has lost its political ground to regional parties across states. Many of the regional parties have grown in the states at the expense of the Congress. Any attempt by the grand-old party to regain its political space is resisted by these state parties leading to friction. This contradiction has been at the core of the alliance trouble which the Congress has had with the regional parties. It is in this context that the party’s decision to go solo in West Bengal should be analyzed. The Congress, which has been voiceless in the state assembly for the last 5 years, has nothing to lose. If the leadership can energise party cadres to make a new beginning on the ground, Bengal could serve as a template for the Congress in other states where it faces similar challenges. One wonders what prevented the Congress leadership from taking this course correction after the 2021 elections drubbing or even after the 2024 Lok Sabha fiasco. Well, better late than never!","In the 2021 assembly elections, the Congress could not win even one seat in the 294-member assembly. The Congress vote share in 2021 assembly election plummeted to 3.03% - the lowest ever in the state. The BJP is also in an overdrive as it makes another attempt to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128253448,imgsize-1661646,width-400,resizemode-4/images-31.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reprimanded Congress MP Jairam Ramesh for challenging an Office Memorandum issued by the Centre to implement the apex court’s judgment on retrospective environmental clearance.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said that since the Office Memorandum was meant to implement an SC judgment, the challenge was effectively against the judgment itself.“Be ready for exemplary costs. We know the design behind this,” a bench led by CJI Surya Kant said.“Can one challenge a judgment by a writ petition? It is just for media consumption,” the bench added.When the bench warned of exemplary costs, Ramesh withdrew his plea.Last year in May, the top court held that the right to live in a pollution-free atmosphere was part of the fundamental right as it struck down the Centre’s Office Memorandum allowing ex post facto or retrospective environmental clearances to projects in violation of norms.“The Union government, as much as individual citizens, has a constitutional obligation to protect the environment,” the court said. It added that it “must come down very heavily” on the Centre’s attempt to do “something which is completely prohibited under the law”.It further observed, “Cleverly, the words ex post facto have not been used, but without using those words, there is a provision to effectively grant ex post facto EC. The 2021 OM has been issued in violation of the decisions of this court….”The Centre, as a result, was restrained from issuing directions for grant of ex post facto clearances in any form or manner or for regularising acts done in contravention of the EIA notification.",Supreme Court reprimanded Congress MP Jairam Ramesh for challenging an Office Memorandum issued by the Centre to implement the apex court’s judgment on retrospective environmental clearance.

Just move your heels: A 3-min trick may reduce post-meal sugar spike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/just-move-your-heels-a-3-min-trick-may-reduce-post-meal-sugar-spike/articleshow/128284378.cms,"NEW DELHI: What if lowering your blood sugar did not require a treadmill, gym membership or even standing up?A new scientific review published in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews suggests that something as simple as lifting your heels while sitting could sharply reduce post-meal sugar spikes. At a time when India is facing a surge in type 2 diabetes — increasingly among younger and sedentary adults — researchers say targeted lower-limb muscle activity may offer a practical, low-cost tool for millions.The review highlights the role of the soleus muscle, located deep in the calf. Unlike larger leg muscles that fatigue quickly, the soleus is built for endurance and can remain active for extended periods.“We often think of the heart as the only vital pump in the body, but the soleus muscle in the calf acts as a ‘second heart.’ When activated regularly, it not only improves circulation but also works like a powerful metabolic sink — helping remove excess sugar from the bloodstream, even while we are sitting,” said a lead author Dr Raju Vaishya, Apollo Hospital, Delhi.In experiments reviewed in the study, seated soleus contractions during a three-hour glucose test reduced post-meal sugar by 39-52% and cut insulin response by up to 60% compared to prolonged sitting.Disrupting sitting every 30 minutes with three minutes of light leg activity reduced insulin spikes by 26% in overweight adults and improved post-meal and overnight glucose levels in those with type 2 diabetes.The science is straightforward. Skeletal muscle accounts for nearly 80% of glucose uptake after meals. Activating the soleus stimulates insulin-independent pathways that help transport glucose into muscle cells, making it particularly useful for people with insulin resistance.Corresponding author Anoop Misra from Fortis said lower limb muscle strength is closely linked to glucose control and blood circulation, not just mobility. He noted that simple seated exercises such as soleus push-ups, which activate the calf muscles, can significantly lower blood sugar without requiring strenuous activity, making them a practical option for India’s largely sedentary population.“We found simple seated movements like soleus push-ups can significantly reduce post-meal sugar spikes — offering a practical solution for people who can’t perform strenuous exercise. You don’t need a gym to improve metabolism. Small, sustained muscle activation — especially of the soleus — can deliver powerful benefits for diabetes prevention and heart health,” Dr Vaishya added.It also found a 40-minute stretching session lowered blood glucose by up to 28 mg/dL and improved circulation. While experts caution seated heel raises are not a substitute for regular exercise, for elderly or obese people, they may offer a practical way to improve metabolic health.",Simple seated movements like soleus push-ups can significantly reduce post-meal sugar spikes.

LOP: Spoke truth in House, won’t back down

NEW DELHI: Congress’ Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said he spoke the truth in Parliament and will not back down even if BJP moves a privilege motion or files a police case against him.In a video, Gandhi said Congress and the country fought for food security, but PM Narendra Modi has betrayed the farmers by “selling out cotton, soybean, apple and fruit growers”. Foreigners have been trying for a long time to capture India’s agriculture market and Modi has opened the doors for them because “Donald Trump controls his reins”.He said farmers in the US have large, mechanised farms and receive govt subsidies, while Indian farmers have small landholdings without mechanised farming and don’t get MSP either.“File a case against me, abuse me, move a privilege motion. It does not matter. I spoke the truth in Parliament. You may not like it, but the country understands the truth. Whatever the govt may do, I am with the farmers and won’t back down. Congress is with the farmers. We won’t allow injustice,” Gandhi said.Congress MP and general secretary KC Venugopal said, “We are not bothered about any motions and if you want to hang us, we are ready for that also. We will continue to tell the truth in Parliament.”He said BJP had taken away Gandhi’s LS membership in 2023, but he bounced back with more votes in the next election.Venugopal also lashed out at Modi govt over removal of parts of Gandhi’s speech from Lok Sabha records. “Whatever Gandhi said is completely expunged from the records. Whatever Nirmala Sitharaman said, the same remarks were included in the records. Govt has double standards... This Parliament is running for the govt, not for the opposition,” he said.Saying that he spoke the truth in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi asserted he will not back down even if BJP moves a privilege motion or files a police case against him. BJP had taken away Rahul’s LS membership in 2023, but he bounced back with more votes, Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said, slamming the govt for expunging parts of Gandhi’s speech.

What are you challenging?”“We know the design behind this. Through a writ petition, you want to seek review of the judgment. Be ready for exemplary cost. This is all for media publicity,” it remarked.The bench said, “The OM is implementing the Nov 18 judgment. So, in effect you are challenging the judgment. Can you challenge a judgment of the SC through a writ petition? ...If you have a grievance against the judgment, you have a remedy to file a review petition, but you can’t file a writ petition challenging a judgment.”Given the choice between exemplary cost and withdrawal of the petition, Khan chose the latter.",Congress MP and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh had to beat a retreat in Supreme Court on Thursday.

Parliament passes bill to bring legal clarity to labour issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-passes-bill-to-bring-legal-clarity-to-labour-issues/articleshow/128283847.cms,"NEW DELHI: Parliament on Thursday passed Industrial Relations Code (Amendment) Bill, 2026, seeking to bring legal clarity over labour issues. Both Houses passed the bill by voice vote, even as several opposition members described it as “anti-labour” and accused govt of favouring industrialists over workers while drafting the industrial relations code.BJP and its allies, on the other hand, strongly defended the bill terming it a “historic reform” for the welfare of labourers.Replying to a debate on the bill in Lok Sabha, labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the four labour codes implemented nearly three months ago give a guarantee of minimum wage. These codes also ensure compulsory issuance of appointment letters as well as uniform wages for the same work irrespective of gender, he said.Before the bill was passed by RS, leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said the four codes are a way to steal the rights of workers, and govt has joined hands with corporates to strangle labourers, by threatening job security and increasing working hours.Mandaviya dismissed all charges saying the bill was brought in for legal clarity and Modi govt is committed to protect labourers and workers, and save industries.He said trade unions and workers support it, but those who want to do politics only speak against it. These codes ensure equal wages and rights for men and women, he said.Congress’ Jairam Ramesh said Industrial Relations Code was passed in the din on Sept 23, 2020 by a voice vote. “Today we are amending, with retrospective effect, a law that was passed six years ago. This reflects a complete failure of govt, as this repealing of the old Act should have been done before the new law was passed,” he said.Ramesh said the most significant change being brought about by the amendments is going to enable “ease of firing” and there is “no ease of hiring”.Earlier piloting the bill in Rajya Sabha, Mandaviya said, “When Industrial Relations Code, 2020 was passed, three Acts were subsumed in that”. He informed the House that those laws were Trade Union Act, 1926; Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946; and Industrial Dispute Act, 1947.","Both Houses passed the bill by voice vote, even as several opposition members described it as ‘anti-labour’ Opposition accused govt of favouring industrialists over workers while drafting the industrial relations code.

It was submitted that the injury was so grave that the finger was “broken into two parts and required a screw and wire to be put together”.In 2025, Delhi Police filed a chargesheet naming Prasad under CrPC sections 325 and 341, but submitted there was “insufficient material” to proceed against Bina and Bhasin. Samir subsequently filed a protest petition seeking cognisance against them as well. He alleged that Prasad stopped him from entering the boardroom on Bina’s instructions and assaulted him when he insisted on attending.Bina and Bhasin later insisted on proceeding with the meeting despite his injury, Samir further alleged.Judicial magistrate Aneeza Bishnoi observed that although the evidence against Bina and Bhasin was circumstantial, there was sufficient material indicating their prima facie involvement. The court held that the investigating officer could not “exonerate” them “based on the sole statement” of Prasad.The medico-legal certificate and CCTV footage showed that an altercation took place, the court said, and summoned all three on May 7. A detailed evaluation of evidence isn’t required at this stage, the court noted, adding that the “material forms a prima facie chain suggesting a meeting of minds among the accused”.Commenting on Prasad’s conduct, Bishnoi said even if the complainant wasn’t invited to the meeting, “causing grievous injury would be unlawful”. The court also took note of Prasad’s changing statements regarding whether he stopped only Samir from attending the meeting. While it was claimed that others were also not allowed in, the court pointed out that the submitted footage showed only Samir being barred.","A Delhi court has issued summonses to industrialist Bina Modi and senior advocate Lalit Bhasin.

Sitharaman said India is witnessing a rare macro-economic phase of elevated growth and low inflation, enabled by sustained efforts, planning, timely interventions and reforms. She said Budget steps show the resolve to build a resilient and self-reliant India.On criticism over welfare funding, Sitharaman said, ""Earlier, success was measured by how much money was pushed out without ensuring spending. It created a huge float. We now have absolute transparency. We do not blindly release funds to book expenditure; we release them only when required at the ground level. There is no denial or stoppage of funds to any state or scheme.Every rupee of the taxpayer is accounted for. Centre's funds are not a free pool of cash. They are hard-earned contributions of every Indian.""Lashing out at Congress for shedding ""crocodile tears about rising debt"", she said the opposition wants govt to borrow more and release funds to states. ""The govt cannot borrow excessively. That principle guides us. Congress is obsessed with outlays, but we give money only for outcomes. We want results,"" she added.Sitharaman rejected charges of high inflation, saying inflation is at a historic low and there is no inflation crisis today. ""Inflation has been tamed due to stability and steps taken by the govt. Growth without jobs was a UPA-era story,"" she said.She attacked the TMC-led Bengal govt, alleging it does not implement welfare schemes financed by Centre, depriving people of benefits. She also countered DMK claims that no big-ticket announcement was made for poll-bound Tamil Nadu, listing Budget proposals for the state.Responding to former finance minister P Chidambaram's remark calling the Budget ""forgettable"", Sitharaman said, ""Budget is never forgetful of the past. Cherish a glorious past, but learn from a tarnished one and avoid repeating mistakes."" The remarks were made amid continued political sparring in Parliament.","Nirmala Sitharaman says every rupee of the taxpayer is accounted for.

"Cabinet may take up infra projects over 40k crore, including Rs 19k crore tunnel through Brahmaputra in poll-bound Assam",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-may-clear-infra-projects-over-40k-crore-including-rs-19k-crore-tunnel-through-brahmaputra-in-poll-bound-assam/articleshow/128274098.cms,"NEW DELHI: Cabinet is likely to take up over half a dozen infrastructure projects on Friday worth over Rs 40,000 crore, including nearly Rs 19,000 crore road-cum-rail tunnel through Brahmaputra river in poll-bound Assam. This will be one of the biggest govt funded projects in the highway sector.South Block will host the last Cabinet meeting on Friday afternoon where more items may be taken up by the highest decision making body for approval, officials said. The infrastructure projects would be largely from the road and railway sectors.It can be recalled that recently an inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary had given green signal for the construction of a 15.8 km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track. As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube.TOI on Oct 6 had first reported that road and railway ministries have identified three links for construction of road-cum-rail tunnels, including underwater tunnels through Brahmaputra and a 22-km tunnel passing through Chicken Neck corridor in the northeast.The Northeast Frontier Railway had shared details of a new line of the Dumdangi-Rangapani-Bagdogra section and the proposed alignment, which includes construction of a 22-km tunnel, with the road transport ministry.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has finalised the alignment for the Gorakhpur-Siliguri Expressway project.Once the Brahmaputra tunnel project is complete, the travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from the current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240 km to 34 km, officials said. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and other northeastern states.",South Block will host the last Cabinet meeting on Friday afternoon where more items may be taken up by the highest decision making body for approval.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has approved the ""Chief Minister Skill Development Scheme"" aimed at providing structured training, financial support and digital market access to artisans engaged in khadi, handloom, cottage industries and the unorganised sector.The decision was cleared at a Cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Rekha Gupta. The scheme seeks to equip traditional workers with upgraded skills and connect them directly to online marketplaces, including the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), according to a statement.Announcing the initiative, Gupta said artisans have long contributed to preserving Delhi's cultural heritage but require modern training and improved access to markets to remain competitive.The scheme, she said, is designed to link skills with sustainable livelihoods and expand opportunities for workers in the evolving economy.The programme will be implemented through the Delhi Khadi and Village Industries Board (DKVIB). During 2025-26, 3,728 beneficiaries will be covered under the first phase, for which Rs 8.95 crore has been approved. A proposed outlay of Rs 57.50 crore for 2026-27 is expected to significantly scale up the initiative, it stated.Under the scheme, beneficiaries will undergo 12 days (96 hours) of structured training, including a two-day Entrepreneurship Development Programme.

'Batenge Toh Katenge': Uddhav & Raj Thackeray Unite For Mumbai Civic Polls | Shiv Sena (UBT) | MNS

NEW DELHI: Senior Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Sandeep Deshpande alleged on Thursday that Shiv Sena (UBT) corporators were each paid Rs 1 crore to back the BJP in the mayoral election, paving the way for the saffron party’s candidate to be elected mayor of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.Shiv Sena (UBT) contested last month’s civic body elections in Mumbai in alliance with the MNS, a development that brought together Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and MNS president Raj Thackeray — cousins who had been estranged for years. At the state level, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party continues to be part of the opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), alongside the Congress and the NCP (Sharad Pawar).Tensions have since surfaced between the Congress and Sena (UBT) after the BJP, with the support of Sena (UBT) corporators, succeeded in getting its mayor candidate elected in the Chandrapur Municipal Corporation, despite the Congress emerging as the single largest party in the civic polls. The grand old party lost by just one vote.""Every Shiv Sena (UBT) corporator received Rs 1 crore in Chandrapur, apart from other offers.An independent corporator was given Rs 50 lakh,"" Deshpande, the MNS' Mumbai unit chief, claimed.Both Sena (UBT) and the BJP rubbished the allegation.Deshpande further slammed the Uddhav Thackeray-led outfit for crying foul when the MNS supported the BJP but deeming it ""correct behaviour"" when Sena (UBT) itself did the same.He was referring to the local MNS leadership in Kalyan-Dombivli extending support to the rival Shiv Sena led by Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde following the civic elections, a move criticised by senior Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut.Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Chandrapur district president Sandeep Girhe hit back at Deshpande, saying he would resign if the MNS leader produced proof that corporators had received money. Girhe also accused local Congress leaders of insulting Sena (UBT) functionaries in the district.Deshpande, meanwhile, targeted Sanjay Raut, questioning whether the senior Sena (UBT) leader had been kept in the dark or had chosen to “wear a blindfold” during the developments in Chandrapur.Raut met MNS president Raj Thackeray in Mumbai on Thursday. Speaking to reporters later, he blamed the Congress for the setback in Chandrapur, saying it should have held more serious discussions with local Sena (UBT) corporators.According to Raut, local Congress factions led by MP Pratibha Dhanorkar and Vijay Wadettiwar failed to arrive at a “consensus”. He added that he had spoken to senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and KC Venugopal on the issue.“Uddhav Thackeray is personally looking into it. Corporators from Chandrapur will be summoned to Mumbai in a day or two. Uddhav Thackeray's stand was that under no circumstances the party should do anything that will help the BJP, and that stand continues even today,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.BJP’s Sangeeta Khandekar won the Chandrapur mayoral election by a single vote, defeating Congress candidate Vaishali Mahadule. Sena (UBT) corporator Prashant Danav was elected deputy mayor.The development has raised serious questions about Opposition unity and the viability of the MVA. Chandrapur is among the few municipal corporations where the Congress emerged as the single largest party and had been expected to secure the mayor’s post.In the elections to the 66-member civic body, the Congress won 27 seats, followed by the BJP with 23.",Shiv Sena (UBT) contested last month’s civic body elections in Mumbai in alliance with the MNS. Tensions have since surfaced between the Congress and Sena after the BJP succeeded in getting its mayor candidate elected in the Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.

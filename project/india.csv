'Match-fixing will come to Bihar next': Rahul Gandhi attacks BJP over Maharashtra polls; alleges 'rigging',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/match-fixing-will-come-to-bihar-next-rahul-gandhi-attacks-bjp-over-maharashtra-polls-alleges-rigging/articleshow/121688049.cms,"Step 1: Rig the panel for appointing the Election Commission

Step 2: Add fake voters to the roll

Step 3: Inflate voter turnout

Step 4: Target the bogus voting exactly where BJP needs to win

Step 5: Hide the evidence

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Saturday again accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of engaging in ""poll rigging"". Citing last year's Maharashtra polls, he cautioned against similar ""match-fixing"" activities by the saffron party in the upcoming Bihar polls.""How to steal an election? Maharashtra assembly elections in 2024 were a blueprint for rigging democracy,"" he said as he went on to list out the alleged sequence. He noted that the alleged tampering begins by ""rigging the panel for appointing the Election Commission"".""It’s not hard to see why the BJP was so desperate in Maharashtra. But rigging is like match-fixing - the side that cheats might win the game, but damages institutions and destroy public faith in the result. All concerned Indians must see the evidence. Judge for themselves. Demand answers. Because the match-fixing of Maharashtra will come to Bihar next, and then anywhere the BJP is losing. Match-fixed elections are a poison for any democracy,"" he added.The opposition parties have consistently raised the allegations of poll rigging in Maharashtra polls, with leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge even calling for a going back to ballot paper system terming electronic voting machines (EVMs) as ""fraud"" and something that put the opposition at ""disadvantage"".The Election Commission, has however, rejected Rahul's charge of unexpected voter's spike in the Maharashtra polls calling it ""nothing unusual"".""During the assembly elections in Maharashtra 6,40,87,588 electors, who reached the polling station from 7 am to 6 pm, voted. About 58 lakh votes were polled per hour, on an average. Going by these average trends, nearly 116 lakh voters could have voted in the last two hours. Therefore, casting of 65 lakh votes by electors in two hours is much below the average hourly voting trends,"" a senior EC functionary had said earlier this year.They also pointed out that Congress's own polling agents were present at every booth during the elections and did not raise any credible complaints about irregular voting — neither during the scrutiny by returning officers nor before election observers the following day.","Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi again accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of engaging in ""poll rigging"" Citing last year's Maharashtra polls, he cautioned against similar ""match-fixing"" activities by the saffron party in the upcoming Bihar polls.

Where do they play SPB’s songs?

A few nights ago, sleep eluded me. I tossed, turned, and finally surrendered to wakefulness. I reached for my phone, seeking solace in music. As always, my playlist led me back to the 1990s, and SPB.As the first notes played, I sat up in sudden realization. The date had just turned to June 4. SPB’s birthday.S P Balasubrahmanyam. A voice that painted decades of Indian cinema with its warmth. A legend who gifted us more than 40,000 songs—, and my eternal favorite,. Though he has passed, his voice lingers—breathing through our memories.I cannot speak for what men feel when he sings, but I know what women hear—the tenderness we long for, the gentleness of love, the strength of restraint, the shimmer of longing. It has weight, and wings. It lifts us when we’re low and stills us when we tremble.But that night, I realized it was not just the magic of his voice that bound us to him. It was something deeper—his humility .I recalled a stage performance. SPB was singing live, captivating the audience. During the second background interlude, a short but vital flute solo was to emerge. It didn’t. Arunmozhi, the flutist, missed his moment.SPB, the professional, continued unflinchingly and ended the song to thunderous applause. But he didn’t exit. He turned to the audience and spoke—gently, generously—about the skill of the flutist and the difficulty of his art. He asked the audience permission to replay the interlude. This time, Arunmozhi played it perfectly, and the applause was louder.SPB saw the crestfallen face of a fellow musician and chose compassion. And then there was another moment—captured in a video that went viral after his passing. On his way to Sabarimala, unable to make the climb, SPB sat on a—a palanquin carried by porters. Before sitting, he touched the feet of the men who would carry him. It was not a ritual—it was reverence. A silent apology. A humble bow to those who bore his weight. A quiet assertion:In that instant, a couplet fromstirred within me:Traditionally, this couplet has been interpreted through the lens of karma: that one’s position in life—rider or bearer—is a consequence of past virtue or vice. But a few commentators differed and viewed through a different lens.What if Thiruvalluvar wasn’t affirming karma, but questioning our habit of justifying inequality through it? What if he was asking us not to preach to the rider, drunk on privilege—or to the bearer, bowed by burden? Perhaps he was reminding us that the journey matters more than the height. That the destination awaits us all—riders and bearers alike.SPB seemed to have lived that message. Never pompous, always gracious. He knew that fame is not a summit, but a platform held up by others. He respected every hand that steadied him—no matter how invisible.He was not just the voice of a generation. He was its conscience.If someone were to offer me a choice between heaven and hell, I would ask just one question:","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121687893,imgsize-42930,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/121687893.jpg"
WACE of Australia is 1st foreign government-backed board in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wace-of-australia-is-1st-foreign-government-backed-board-in-india/articleshow/121684705.cms,"NEW DELHI: After becoming the first country to establish foreign university campuses in India with the entry of University of Wollongong and Deakin University, Australia is now extending its footprint into school education, as Western Australia's WACE has become the first foreign govt-backed school board to begin operations in India, receiving equivalence from the Association of Indian Universities for its Class X and Class XII qualifications. This is the first such approval for a foreign board in India in 25 years.WACE, or Western Australian Certificate of Education, is the school-leaving qualification for students in Western Australia, administered by state's School Curriculum and Standards Authority (SCSA). WAIS, or the Western Australian International School System, is the framework through which this curriculum is delivered in international partner schools.Ange Smith, principal consultant for international education at SCSA, said the board has been running its international education programme since 1987 and began expanding its global presence more actively in 2019. ""Since then, we've worked with govt bodies in several countries to secure foreign board equivalence. India has been one of the most rigorous but rewarding. After AIU approval, we focused on identifying partner schools in India,"" she said.The board is currently operational in 16 countries.She said the National Education Policy 2020 played a significant role in shaping their entry strategy. ""We undertook curriculum mapping and found alignment with NEP priorities, especially around holistic development, skill integration and nurturing students beyond academics.""Explaining the curriculum structure, Smith said WAIS students take five subjects each in classes XI and XII, with an option to take six. English is compulsory, but only the top four ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) courses count towards the final university entrance score. ""ATAR is based 50% on final exams and 50% on school-assessed coursework. This reduces pressure and supports consistent performance over two years,"" she said.In response to a request from Indian partner schools, Smith confirmed that work is underway to introduce a 10th board exam for WAIS students in India. ""Some Indian states may require a 10th board certificate for transitions, so we are developing one specifically for this context,"" she said.Syed Sultan Ahmed, chairperson of the Association of International Schools of India, said WAIS offers a balance between accessibility and international standards. ""It sits between CBSE and Cambridge. A CBSE school charging Rs 1 - 1.2 lakh annually can adopt WAIS with a 15-20% fee increase. It opens up global pathways without requiring Rs 45 lakh fees like IB,"" he said. The first WAIS partner schools in India have been established in Bengaluru and Bidar, both in Karnataka.Ahmed said the ATAR rank helps WAIS students apply to universities globally without separate entrance exams such as the SAT or JEE. ""The ATAR consolidates certification and university eligibility. It's one system for both. Students also become eligible for a Premier's Bursary of AUD 20,000 if they choose to study in Western Australia,"" he added.The curriculum incorporates seven general capabilities: literacy, numeracy, ICT, ethical understanding, civic and social responsibility, critical & creative thinking, and intercultural understanding.",Western Australia's WACE has become the first foreign govt-backed school board to begin operations in India.

Musk vs Trump: Did Vivek Ramaswamy 'Doge' a bullet by getting out in time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-vs-trump-did-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-a-bullet-by-getting-out-in-time/articleshow/121664165.cms,"Trump WIPES OUT Elon Musk's $15 BILLION In Just 6 Minutes; Tesla Shares Tank, MAYHEM At Wall Street

Elon Musk EXPOSES Donald Trump-Epstein Link From 1992 Video: Mar-a-Lago Tapes Go Viral





In Washington’s latest episode of Tech Titans vs MAGA Caesar, D onald Trump has turned on Elon Musk —his former bromantic partner-in-disruption, SpaceX messiah, and self-appointed guardian of Western civilisation. The trigger? Musk labelled Trump’s much-hyped One Big Beautiful Bill “a disgusting abomination” and warned that America was hurtling toward “debt slavery. ”Trump, never one to take offence lightly—or privately—responded with a MAGA-flavoured blitzkrieg. Contracts for Musk’s companies? At risk. His reputation in conservative circles? Torched. “Just another whiny billionaire,” Trump sneered, “who forgot who made him matter.”As the Trump-Musk bromance dissolves faster than a Tesla on Autopilot in Washington traffic, one man watches the fireworks from a safe, well-lit distance—sipping Perrier, adjusting his campaign blazer, and thanking his stars he got out early, having clearly absorbed Sun Tzu’s timeless wisdom: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”—Vivek Ramaswamy.Also read: 'Disgusting abomination' to 'bombshell': Trump & Musk feud spirals; timeline of the public meltdown Once the philosophical darling of the new right, Ramaswamy was handed a shiny new toy in Trump’s second term—DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.A meme-ified federal Frankenstein, DOGE was Trump’s idea of bureaucratic reform through Silicon Valley swagger. Musk was the co-head. Vivek was the “sane one.” Together, they were meant to revolutionise Washington. Or at least yell at it until it agreed to be disrupted.But like any startup built on vibes and vague mission statements, DOGE began to implode before it launched. Musk wanted to fire half of Washington via app. Trump wanted press conferences with golden eagles and fog machines. And Vivek? Vivek quietly disappeared.Officially, he left to run for Ohio governor. Unofficially, insiders suggest he saw the writing on the Twitter wall —that DOGE was less a reform movement and more a digital kamikaze mission, powered by ego, caffeine, and libertarian hallucinations.And now, in hindsight, his exit looks less like a career pivot and more like a Sun Tzu manoeuvre. Because while Musk is now battling Trump, Congress, and his own booster-fuelled paranoia, Ramaswamy is free to reinvent himself as a centrist tech-whisperer in the Rust Belt. MAGA enough to get the base. Moderate enough to avoid the madness.Except MAGA, like any self-devouring revolution, doesn’t forget. Or forgive.Since stepping away from DOGE and softening his Trumpian rhetoric, Ramaswamy has found himself in the crosshairs of the same base that once anointed him their biotech Brahmin. Hardcore influencers have branded him a traitor. Conservative meme accounts now photoshop him next to Liz Cheney. And in the subterranean rage economy of right-wing internet culture, he's been rebranded from “America First entrepreneur” to “globalist plant with a Harvard tongue. ”Also read: Feud intensifies: Musk shares 1992 video; Trump seen with Jeffrey Epstein in clip The irony? The same mob now grilling Ramaswamy for “disloyalty” is turning on Musk for “disrespect.” In MAGAland, loyalty is a zero-sum blood sport, and the only acceptable exit is the one through public execution.DOGE, predictably, has become a political punchline. It was doomed from conception—run like a Reddit thread, branded like a crypto coin, and staffed by men who confuse spreadsheets with scripture. The only surprising thing is how quickly it crashed. Musk thought he could out-Trump Trump. But in MAGA-land, there can only be one sun god—and he’s orange, not emerald-mined.Ramaswamy, to his credit, didn’t wait around to become collateral damage. He understood what Musk didn’t: that proximity to Trump is radioactive. Stay too long and you mutate. Get out early and you might just survive.The result? Musk is in political freefall. Trump is in attack mode. And Ramaswamy? He’s in Ohio, sipping Perrier and talking about “innovation in public policy”—while ducking MAGA Twitter grenades and hoping they forget he ever existed.Call it foresight. Call it cowardice. Or just call it good political hygiene.Because as Sun Tzu said—he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.And in the dystopian sitcom that is American politics, that makes Vivek Ramaswamy the guy who ghosted the group chat before the firestorm—and lived to run another episode.","Vivek Ramaswamy was the co-head of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.

This also applies to “waqf by user” properties that existed prior to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025 coming into force on April 8.Sharing that there were over 9 lakh waqf properties in India, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju asserted that states should follow the timelines strictly and the boards must ensure that details of all waqf properties registered with them are uploaded on the portal within the stipulated 6 months.“All old properties that are in keeping with the law — titled and legitimate — will get included. Those that are illegal and without any documents will not get included. New waqf properties that get created going forward will be included in the database,” Rijiju said.According to officials, waqf properties that are not registered will need to approach their waqf boards to complete the process of registration. In the case of properties whose details are uploaded but which fail to get validated on the portal, there will be the option to approach the waqf tribunal for redressal.On what happens to properties which have supposedly been used as waqf but lack documents to prove so, Rijiju said: “Such waqf properties that do not have adequate documents but which are recognised socially and by govt and are working, we are not declaring them illegal. The issues are only with those kinds of properties which have been acquired forcefully, fraudulently, or do not have proper supportive documents or provisions. Moreover, the law does not prevent anyone from performing any religious rituals....”He, however, emphasised that going forward all waqf properties will need to fix whatever is missing in their documentation in order to come on board.On the portal, the entry of property details by the Mutawalli (caretaker) will be followed by validation by waqf boards and approval by designated govt authorities, after verification of records, to enable its entry into the ‘UMEED’ (Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act 1995) portal.For the wide-ranging details related to any property, the portal also requires the Muttawali to give a declaration before uploading them. This includes questions like “have you failed to maintain regular accounts for two consecutive years or submit for two consecutive years the yearly statement of accounts as per law; have you been convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment of less than two years; and are you part of any unlawful organisation under UAPA”.Key features of the portal include creation of a digital inventory with geo-tagging of all waqf properties, online grievance redressal system, transparent leasing and usage tracking, integration with GIS mapping and public access to verified records and reports.Pointing out that there was no stay on the law by the judiciary, Rijiju stressed that the portal in no way violates the law or the Constitution. The minister was responding to All India Muslim Personal Law Board's statement that it will challenge the legal validity of the portal in the Supreme Court where the law is under scrutiny.",Only properties registered as waqf with the state boards will be able to upload their details for verification and get a 17-number unique ID.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic turn of events, Canadian PM Mark Carney called PM Modi and invited him for the G7 summit that begins eight days from now at Kananaskis in Alberta. Modi accepted the invitation and said he was looking forward to meeting him at the summit.The announcement by Modi on X followed almost a week of suspense over his participation because of a lack of invitation, drawing barbs from the opposition about his possible exclusion from the summit. India is not a member of G7 but Modi has been invited for all summits since 2019. Modi congratulated Carney on his poll win and thanked him for the invitation.As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests,"" Modi posted on X.Without elaborating, a Canadian readout said that ""importantly, there was agreement to continued law enforcement dialogue and discussions addressing security concerns"".Modi and Carney, who was sworn in as PM in March and won federal elections the next month to cement his position, have pledged to rebuild the relationship that was left tottering by former PM Justin Trudeau's allegation of India's complicity in the murder of pro-Khalistan separatist and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar.New Delhi has rejected the allegation saying Ottawa hasn't provided any evidence to back its claim.The Indian govt will hope that Canada will ensure enough security to not allow Sikh separatist groups, who had been applying pressure on Carney to not invite Modi, to disrupt the visit. India's official position remains that the main issue with Canada is the leeway provided to Khalistan backers to carry out anti-India activities. For India to engage in any serious effort to rebuild the relationship, foolproof security for the country's diplomats, along with a crackdown on extremists and secessionists who seek to hurt Indian interests, is of paramount importance.Modi had last visited Canada in 2015. While the two countries are also said to be considering reappointing high commissioners, both Canadian and Indian authorities maintain they are looking at repairing ties one step at a time. Asked about the Nijjar investigations, Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand said last week that while the rule of law will never be compromised, Canada is looking forward to continuing to build this partnership.""The two leaders discussed the longstanding relationship between Canada and India, including deep people-to-people ties and significant commercial links,'' said the Canadian readout.

NEW DELHI: A city court on Friday remanded four individuals, including Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Head of Marketing and Revenue Nikhil Sosale, to 14-day judicial custody in connection with the tragic stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium that claimed 11 lives.The additional chief metropolitan magistrate ordered Sosale, along with DNA Entertainment Private Limited executives Sunil Mathew, Sumanth, and Kiran Kumar, to be held in custody following their arrest earlier in the day in a joint operation by the Bengaluru police and the city’s crime branch.Sosale, arrested at Bengaluru Airport as he was about to board a flight to Dubai, has approached the Karnataka High Court challenging the legality of his detention.According to news agency, Justice S R Krishna Kumar heard the plea but declined to grant interim relief, adjourning the matter to June 9.As reported by news agency, Sosale has claimed in his petition that the arrest was ""arbitrary, illegal, and without any material basis,"" alleging that it occurred even before any preliminary investigation had been conducted.The police had registered an FIR against RCB, event organiser DNA Entertainment, and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) on Thursday, invoking serious charges including culpable homicide and illegal assembly after chaos broke out during RCB’s IPL victory celebration.The free-entry event drew nearly 3 lakh people, leading to a deadly crush at the gates.In response to the FIR, senior KSCA officials, including president Raghuram Bhat and secretary A Shankar, moved the High Court seeking quashing of charges. The court granted interim protection from arrest to KSCA office bearers, directing them to fully cooperate with the investigation until the next hearing on June 16.Meanwhile, the state government suspended multiple senior police officials, including Bengaluru Police commissioner B Dayananda, following the incident. Others suspended include additional commissioner Vikash Kumar Vikash and DCP (Central) Shekhar HT.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah defended the government's action amid BJP criticism, stating, “We have taken action against those who were visibly responsible and negligent in their duty,” and accused the opposition of politicising the tragedy.Deputy CM DK Shivakumar added, “The government has done its best to give justice... The case has been handed over to CID, and a judicial inquiry is underway”.On the political front, BJP state president BY Vijayendra claimed, “The government acted only under pressure,” referencing the sudden suspensions and arrests made post the public outcry.The Karnataka High Court has also taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and asked the state to file a status report by June 10.A one-man inquiry panel led by retired judge Justice John Michael D’Cunha has been appointed to probe the incident.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Head of Marketing and Revenue Nikhil Sosale remanded to 14-day judicial custody in connection with the tragic stampede that claimed 11 lives.

How is India using AI as a soft power or diplomatic tool globally?



The Election Commission's 2024 AI content labelling advisories set a global benchmark for ethical AI in elections, noted by international media.

PM Modi's safe AI advocacy in G20 and bilateral talks (e.g., with US leaders) enhances India's image as a responsible tech power.

Bhashini's multilingual AI is being adapted for diaspora engagement, translating cultural content for Indian communities in the US and Gulf.

AI startups like Krutrim and Polymath Solutions, plus plans for India-specific AI models, position India as an innovation hub for the Global South.

As tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the horrific Pahalgam attack on April 22, the nation witnessed a parallel war that erupted online — one that included not drones or missiles but manipulating pixels and synthetic voices.From AI-generated clipping of a newspaper falsely praising Pakistan's air force to deepfaked video of S Jaishankar offering fake apologies, public fell prey to misinformation created with help of Artificial Intelligence.The weaponisation of AI, particularly in times of elections or war, is not just a nuisance or prank; it's a calculated effort to sway voters or influence public sentiment. Even to distort facts.India, with tech-savvy population, is suffering the threat where mass-producing propaganda takes seconds, and it is no longer hypothetical but real, present, and dangerous.The threat isn't just reserved for wartime, it is increasingly creeping into India's democratic bloodstream.A prominent politician appears on your WhatsApp feed, making inflammatory remarks about a sensitive religious issue. The video spreads like wildfire across social media, triggering outrage and potentially swaying thousands of voters. There's just one catch – the politician never actually said those words.Welcome to the age of deepfakes, where seeing is no longer believing.While Artificial Intelligence offers powerful new tools for political campaigning and even diplomatic engagement, its rapid advancement also casts a long shadow – the rise of deepfakes and the potential for widespread digital deception. The very technology that amplifies a campaign's reach can also be weaponised to manipulate the truth, posing significant ethical challenges to the integrity of information and trust within India's democratic processes.In a conversation with TOI, Devesh Singh, a political communication strategist, said deepfakes are a serious threat, undermining electoral integrity through misinformation. In 2024:""Low digital literacy (76.32% adult literacy) exacerbates vulnerability, especially in rural areas. The Election Commission’s May 2024 advisory, mandating deepfake labelling and removal within three hours, lacks robust enforcement, and India has no specific AI laws. With deepfakes created in 2-3 minutes, their viral potential threatens hyper-local constituencies, risking trust erosion and potential unrest if unchecked,"" he added.Talking about deepfakes and morphed videos, a digital communication consultant, Keshav Mishra, said, ""these have been used to defame political opponents during elections. While digitally literate audiences can often identify AI-generated content, rural populations remain vulnerable to misinformation.""While explaining harm caused by fake AI-generated content, Singh said harmful AI content spreads rapidly, often outpacing takedown efforts. ""Misinformation spreads five times faster than corrections. A deepfake can reach tens of thousands in a day, underscoring the need for real-time monitoring and stricter platform accountability,"" he added.As domestic politics is adapting to AI, India's foreign policy is also evolving under its influence. Recently, the world went mad over Ghibli Art, and even politicians went gaga over it.For example, in the wake of Ghibli art, AI united two nations — India and Israel, through AI-generated images. The Israeli Embassy in India shared an image showcasing the friendship between PM Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu in a beautiful Ghibli-style art piece. The Indian Embassy in Israel also shared images of PM Modi driving a vehicle on the shores with Netanyahu enjoying his company.The artistic portrayal is an example of how the two countries are strengthening ties at a crucial time (the Israel-Gaza conflict).Apart from this, India is leveraging AI as a soft power tool on the global stage, from cyber diplomacy to multilateral tech partnerships.D uring AI Action Summit in Paris on February 11, 2025, PM Modi emphasised how ""AI is already re-shaping polity, economy, security and even society.""""AI is developing at an unprecedented scale and speed. And being adopted and deployed even faster. There is also a deep inter-dependence across borders. Therefore, there is a need for collective global efforts to establish governance and standards, that uphold our shared values, address risks, and build trust,"" he added.Highlighting India's tech-savvy youth at a global platform, he underlined the fact that India is building AI applications for public good. ""India is building its own Large Language Model considering our diversity. We also have a unique public-private partnership model for pooling resources like compute power. It is made available to our start-ups and researchers at an affordable cost. And, India is ready to share its experience and expertise to ensure that the AI future is for Good, and for All,"" he added.Cutting short, diplomacy is not just about defence, infrastructure, nuclear deals and trade tariffs anymore — it's also about tech stacks and AI models.Singh said India is leveraging AI to bolster its soft power, positioning itself as a tech governance leader:However, the lack of comprehensive AI legislation limits India's influence compared to the EU or the US. Still, its election AI experiments offer a model for democratic nations, strengthening its diplomatic narrative.Amid fears of AI working at the forefront and replacing jobs, a question arises: will it also replace politicians? Well, time will generate the code to decode the question. But now, we can say that AI might change how they win.With scale, diversity and digital ambition, India is positioned well to become a leader in ethical AI adoption. But, it is noteworthy that leadership won't come from tools alone.","Fake videos of Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh endorsing Congress sparked police complaints, reaching millions via WhatsApp's 535.8 million users. A deepfake of Rahul Gandhi ""resigning"" spread false narratives, particularly in Hindi-speaking belts. DMK's Karunanidhi deepfake, while strategic, blurred the lines between authentic and manipulated content.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121678649,imgsize-1318746,width-400,resizemode-4/121678649.jpg"

We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025,"" said the forum whose members include China, Pakistan's staunchest ally.The formulation, adopted by the forum after its three-day meeting in Brasilia where the Indian delegation was led by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, is seen a repudiation of the ""root cause"" alibi used by Pakistan to justify anti-India terror.""We reaffirm our commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including the cross-border movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens,"" the resolution further said.In his speech, Birla stressed the need for joint efforts to curb financial support to terrorist organisations, enhance intelligence sharing, prevent the misuse of emerging technologies, & promote cooperation in investigation and judicial processes.He also highlighted India's strong and clear position on various key subjects, especially global cooperation against terrorism, a just and balanced international order, participation in technological innovation, and democratic exchange.On terrorism, the parliamentary forum asked for zero tolerance response to terrorism, rejected double standards in countering it, while also underlining ""terrorism should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilisation or ethnic group, and that all those involved in terrorist activities and their support must be held accountable and brought to justice in accordance with relevant national and international law.

Fugitive liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya has told a podcast, in a rare interview, that he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.At the time there was supposed to be a CBI lookout circular (LOC) issued against him.Mallya told “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani” he was not aware of any LOC against him, nor that it had been downgraded by the CBI from detaining him to informing immigration of authorities of his travel plans.He told Shamani that certain TV anchors and the Indian govt want to see him in “jail clothes, eating jail food” in Tihar and spending the rest of his life behind bars. “If that is what is inevitable, what options do I have? It might be inevitable, I’m not an astrologer. I will fight my way in court.”He said: “I told FM Arun Jaitley before leaving for the airport and then I flew from Delhi to London on the way to Geneva for a meeting which was fixed months ago. I told the then finance minister because I went from Parliament to Delhi airport. When this news hit the media, once again, it created a storm.People went running to Mr Jaitley. He denied meeting me. A Congress MP saw us and then said to the media ‘No, I saw them together’. Mr Jaitley had to retract his statement and say ‘Yes, yes I met him but only while walking — it was a fleeting meeting’.”“I never said I went to Mr Jaitley’s office, sat in front of him, had tea with him. All I said is I told the finance minister while leaving, I’m going to London and going to Geneva for a meeting, please tell the banks to sit across the table and settle with me. How long does this once sentencetake? You see the way he denied it, and then when a Congress MP pointed out his mistake that he saw us, he quickly changed.”He also said he had always planned to go back to India but his Indian passport was revoked.In the four-hour podcast Mallya also said he would be prepared to return to India. “If I have the assurance of a fair trial and assurance of dignified existence in India, I will think about returning to India seriously. “ He then reminded Shamani of the judgment in the Sanjay Bhandari case which found “Indian detention conditions a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights)”, which may mean he could not be extradited now.When asked why he had not gone already as he had lost his extradition battle in the courts, the 69-year-old said: “My stay in England is fully legitimate. There is more than the particular case you are referring to. There are ongoing proceedings in this country. It’s one of the legal battles I am fighting,” he said. This suggests he may have applied for asylum.","Vijay Mallya says he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.

The men were held on charges of cheating and forgery, after police recovered 21 debit cards, 30 cheque books, and six PAN cards issued under different names. Their arrest followed a routine vehicle check in Surat’s Udhna area, where an associate was caught carrying fake PAN cards and firm stamps.“We found the trio had opened 165 bank accounts using documents of people who had applied for personal loans. They gave access to the criminals for cyber crimes including digital arrest, hawala transfer, task fraud, betting, stock market fraud, online cheating and OTP fraud,” Desai said.According to Desai, the accused got in touch with cyber gangs based in Cuba, Thailand, and Malaysia through the messaging app Telegram. In exchange for access to the accounts, they were offered handsome commissions.“We have so far received details of 89 of these 165 accounts from the bank.All identified accounts have since been frozen after victims lodged complaints,” Desai said.The police believe the fraudsters used a clever trick to get the bank accounts opened, approaching people applying for personal loans and taking their documents, claiming they could help secure the funds.After opening an account using those documents, they would return the papers to the applicant, saying the loan was rejected.“Since they used to give their own mobile number to get an OTP, the applicant never realised that a bank account had been opened in their name,” Desai explained.""Initially, the gang would lease out each account for a one-time fee of Rs 7 lakh to Rs 17 lakh.

Corporators should ensure special attention is given to cleanliness in their respective neighbourhoods. When climate change occurs, it does not affect just one individual, but the entire society. Therefore, everyone must plant at least one tree. Rivers are disappearing, and to avoid a severe water crisis, we must work on rejuvenating the rivers. Trees should be planted along both banks of rivers. Planting a tree is part of our duty toward Mother Nature,"" CM Yogi said.He further stated that a nursery with 50 crore plants was prepared for the campaign on climate change, further stating that solid preparations had been made by the Municipal Corporation for solid waste management, which would benefit everyone.""A nursery with 500 million (50 crore) plants has been prepared for this entire campaign.

Everyone will benefit from it,"" he added.Yogi also said that Gorakhpur now had four-lane roads, further stating that preparations were underway for the establishment of an AYUSH university, which would be inaugurated soon.""All roads in Gorakhpur have become four-lane roads.

New tools offer breakthrough in tackling 'hidden hunger' in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-tools-offer-breakthrough-in-tackling-hidden-hunger-in-india/articleshow/121680577.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: A new toolkit developed by The George Institute for Global Health (GIGH), India, in collaboration with Rutgers University, US and other international partners, promises to reshape India’s response to malnutrition by helping map and understand its complex food environments.The study, published in Current Developments in Nutrition, addresses how availability, affordability, and access to food influence nutritional outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India.The GIGH is an independent medical research organisation with a focus on improving the health of millions worldwide, particularly those living in disadvantaged settings. Established in 1999 and headquartered in Sydney, it operates major research centres in India, China, and the UK.Led by Shauna Downs of Rutgers and featuring Suparna Ghosh-Jerath from The George Institute, the research introduces a “Food Environment Toolbox” that includes seven practical tools such as participatory mapping and market assessments. These tools were piloted across rural, urban, and peri-urban areas in India and Cambodia.India’s food landscape is shifting rapidly, with growing market dependence not matched by better nutrition.“We developed the toolbox through an iterative process, ensuring it reflects the realities of LMICs,” said Dr. Ghosh-Jerath. The country continues to battle a double burden—widespread nutrient deficiencies alongside rising diet-related diseases. National surveys reveal severe anaemia among women and children, underscoring the need for diet quality over mere calorie sufficiency.The new toolkit could enhance key nutrition schemes like POSHAN Abhiyaan, ICDS, and the Mid-Day Meal Scheme by aligning them more closely with regional food realities. “The tools were adaptable across diverse contexts,” noted Dr. Downs, calling them a “timely step toward more effective, evidence-based nutrition policy.”","A new toolkit developed by The George Institute for Global Health (GIGH), India, promises to reshape India’s response to malnutrition.

Government to map NEETs by age in labour survey for targeted skilling push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-map-neets-by-age-in-labour-survey-for-targeted-skilling-push/articleshow/121680551.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: The Government is planning to track NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) youth by age in the labour survey for smarter skilling policies. The ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE) has successfully pushed for the inclusion of age-disaggregated NEET data in India’s flagship labour survey — the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS).Starting July 2025, the revamped survey will include new questions to better identify and support India’s disengaged youth and adult populations. Responding to the recommendations of Jayant Chaudhary, minister of state (independent charge) for skill development and entrepreneurship, ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) confirmed that new PLFS rounds will include two questions: one to track whether individuals are undergoing any training, and another to record education or training attendance for the entire 0–59 age group.“We need to know who the NEETs are—not just in absolute numbers, but in terms of age brackets, vulnerability, and skill needs,” Chaudhary wrote in a letter dated February 5 to MoSPI.While the term ""NEET"" has long been used to describe those slipping through the cracks of the education and employment systems, it has rarely been dissected beyond a general statistic. This is seen as crucial for how India plans, executes, and evaluates its skilling strategies.Responding to his Chaudhary's request, Rao Inderjit Singh, minister of state (independent charge), MoSPI confirmed on May 19 that new PLFS rounds will include two questions: one to track whether individuals are undergoing any training, and another to record education or training attendance for the entire 0–59 age group. The design was cleared after consultation with expert committees and MSDE to ensure methodological consistency.According to a senior MSDE official, the reform aligns with SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth and is critical for initiatives like Skill India Digital Hub and Apprenticeship Embedded Degree Programmes.Even a 1% shift in NEET status impacts over 2.6 million youth, and now, India is set to know exactly who and where they are.","The Government is planning to track NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) youth by age in the labour survey for smarter skilling policies.

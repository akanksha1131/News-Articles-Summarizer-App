NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak hailed the central government's Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), which he said helped to improve the water supply mechanism significantly in the country.Speaking at TOI's Water Summit 2025, the deputy CM said Uttar Pradesh made a major stride in the implementation of the scheme.Pathak highlighted how the increase in population led to water shortage and shed light on the ways Uttar Pradesh has been adopting to meet water demand.""When humans made progress, we tried moulding the environment as per our wishes. Humans would not have had to build reservoirs as natural reservoirs like rivers, waterfalls or rainwater fulfilled our daily needs. Then the population was less. But an increase in the population led to a rise in water consumption, melting of glaciers and reduction of rainwater in monsoons,"" Pathak said.The deputy CM thanked PM Modi for the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), saying the Prime Minister has made efforts to ensure on-ground implementation of JMM for the completion of a bigger goal.He said UP has ""done wonders in the implementation"" of JJM, adding ""we have witnessed the implementation of the scheme and he congratulated ""all officials linked to JJM and irrigation"".""Earlier houses had small water tanks for water storage, but PM Modi ensured the availability of fresh drinking water in every house. Uttar Pradesh has been number one in the effort. We are moving forward with a purpose,"" Pathak said.Claiming that the UP government, under CM Yogi Aadityanath, made unprecedented progress in JMM implementation, Pathak said: ""As of now, water supply is being ensured in 24,050 villages. Our connection has reached 2.36 crore houses, 37, 462 pump houses have been made. We have done a deep boring of 38,456 tubewells.""He said that the UP government has also given importance to an alternative source of energy.""Our team was aware of how would water be accessible in the absence of electricity. Therefore, the entire system is based on solar. We produce electricity, run our pump houses, supply water, and send extra electricity to the grid. This is a great effort under JJM,"" the minister said.",UP deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak hailed the central government's Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) Pathak highlighted how the increase in population led to water shortage and shed light on the ways Uttar Pradesh has been adopting to meet water demand.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119311281,imgsize-465603,width-400,resizemode-4/119311281.jpg"
TOI Water Summit 2025: Experts call for grassroots action on water crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toi-water-summit-2025-experts-call-for-grassroots-action-on-water-crisis/articleshow/119313786.cms,"NEW DELHI: Key experts and policymakers came together at The Times of India Water Summit 2025 to discuss grassroots awareness and the role of behavioural change in ensuring access to safe drinking water . The discussions centred on the Jal Jeevan Mission , highlighting community-driven solutions for sustainable water management.Smriti Singh, State Programme Director of WaterAid UP, spoke about the critical role of community involvement in the success of the Jal Jeevan Mission. "" Water conservation is a concept that is deeply linked to behavioural change. It has to start at the household level,"" she said. Highlighting the challenges of implementation, she added, ""Ensuring access to safe drinking water requires women’s participation at the community level. Historically, women have had to travel long distances to fetch water, increasing their workload and affecting their livelihood opportunities. Community engagement is essential to overcoming these challenges.""She also cited successful grassroots initiatives, such as the development of village action plans and water security mapping. ""By involving men, women, and children in the planning process, we were able to identify water sources, assess their sustainability, and introduce measures like rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge,"" she explained.Environmentalist Ramveer Tanwar, popularly known as the 'Pond Man' of India, emphasised the role of youth in water conservation. ""If we don't act now, future generations will only inherit polluted water bodies. The youth must step up and take responsibility,"" he said. He recounted his initiative, ‘Selfie with Pond,’ which encouraged young professionals working in cities to reconnect with their village water bodies. ""We challenged youth to visit their ancestral villages, take a selfie with a pond, and share it on social media. Thousands participated, realising the dire condition of these water bodies,"" he added.Brijraj Singh Yadav, IAS, Executive Director of S.W.S.M. (UP), highlighted the increasing stress on water resources due to rising consumption. ""Water is vital not just for drinking but also for irrigation and industry. As our population grows, so does our demand, making conservation even more urgent,"" he noted. Addressing the declining condition of traditional water bodies, he said, ""Many ponds have deteriorated over the last decade, turning into garbage dumps. We must take urgent measures to restore them before the damage becomes irreversible.""Venkatesh Dutta, Head of the Department of Environmental Science at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, underscored the necessity of a mindset shift in both rural and urban areas. ""We need to rethink how we manage water. Villages traditionally relied on ponds and wells, but urbanisation has altered these dynamics. We must implement structured recharge systems and geo-tagging to ensure sustainability. In cities, water is either drained into sewer systems or wasted. We need to adopt a circular approach—reuse, conserve, and return water to nature in its purest form. Pricing water appropriately could also drive conservation, as clean water is costlier than petrol,"" he explained.Radha Krishna Tripathi, Senior Media Advisor at S.W.S.M. (UP), discussed the role of the media in spreading awareness about water conservation. ""Every city has rivers and water bodies that are often neglected or misidentified as drains. Recognising their value is the first step toward conservation,"" he said. He stressed the importance of educating rural and urban populations about water quality and management. ""For decades, many villages lacked access to clean water. Now, as we introduce chlorinated water, it takes time for people to understand its benefits. Behavioural changes don’t happen overnight. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, we are working at the grassroots level to promote awareness and community participation,"" he added.","Key experts and policymakers came together at The Times of India Water Summit 2025 to discuss grassroots awareness.

He noted that these technologies have helped improve water quality and ensure effective wastewater treatment, particularly during large-scale events like the Maha Kumbh.Discussing the Jal Jeevan Mission , which aims to provide tap water to every rural household, he said, “When the mission was launched, UP had only 1.96% tap water coverage in rural homes. Today, we have made significant progress, and the state is even in contention for a national award.”He also addressed major challenges, including arsenic and fluoride contamination in Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur, which previously caused high fatalities. Improved planning and solar-powered water supply schemes, he said, have significantly improved the situation. “By integrating solar energy, we are not only reducing electricity costs but also cutting down carbon emissions,” he noted.Srivastava further pointed out that improved water access has enhanced public health, boosted school enrolment rates, and raised the overall quality of life, especially for women. A streamlined online payment system for contractors, he added, has also ensured faster project execution.Looking ahead, he stressed the need for continuous innovation and active community participation to prevent water misuse and sustain conservation efforts.","Anurag Shrivastava, Additional Chief Secretary, Namami Gange and Rural Water Resources Department, emphasised that strengthening water governance in Uttar Pradesh requires policy innovation and technology.

TOI Water Summit 2025: Experts weigh in on need for multi-pronged approach to ensuring safe water access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toi-water-summit-2025-experts-weigh-in-on-need-for-multi-pronged-approach-to-ensuring-safe-water-access/articleshow/119313279.cms,"Speaking at the TOI’s 2025 Water Summit, Experts and policymakers underscored the need for a multi-pronged approach to ensuring safe water access at the “Water Sanitation & Public Health – Safe Water for All” panel discussion. The session, moderated by Daksh Sethi, Founder of Guby Rogers & The Wolf Media Co., brought together key voices from government, research, and civil society to discuss challenges and solutions.The panel featured Heera Lal, IAS, State Nodal Officer, Prime Minister Agriculture Irrigation Scheme; Divyendu Kumar Singh, Unit Coordinator (Technical), S.W.S.M. (UP); Prashansha Gupta, CEO, Institute for Water & Climate Initiatives; and Mr Hari Prakash Haihyvanshi, Deputy Programme Manager, Water & Wastewater, CSE India.Prashansha Gupta highlighted gaps in water supply infrastructure, particularly in high-altitude regions where pipeline maintenance remains a challenge. She advocated for community ownership and education to ensure efficient water use and reduce wastage. “A well-built system is only as good as its users,” she noted, emphasising the importance of solar-powered water pumping stations as a sustainable alternative.Divyendu Kumar Singh provided insights into Jal Jeevan Mission , launched in 2019 to provide tap water connections in rural India. He detailed Uttar Pradesh’s progress, citing the laying of 51,000 km of pipelines, connecting 48,000 villages to the network, and certifying 24,000 villages as ‘Har Ghar Jal’ (Every Home with Water). He also highlighted the adoption of solar energy for water supply schemes, stating that 900 MW of solar panels have been installed across 33,000 schemes, reducing operational costs and ensuring sustainability.While infrastructure is crucial, experts agreed that sustainability depends on community participation. Ms Gupta stressed that awareness campaigns, especially targeting children and social media, could drive a shift in water conservation practices. “The mindset needs to change. If people don't value water, no system will work efficiently in the long run,” she added.Heera Lal called for rethinking large-scale water storage and instead prioritising localised conservation efforts. Citing research from IIT Kanpur, he said, “Big dams are no longer the solution. Small-scale groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting must be prioritised.”The discussion concluded with a consensus that a combination of infrastructure, policy innovation, and public awareness is critical to addressing India’s water challenges. Sustained government investment, solar-powered solutions, and community-led conservation efforts will be key to securing safe and accessible water for all.","Experts and policymakers underscored the need for a multi-pronged approach to ensuring safe water access at the ‘Water Sanitation & Public Health – Safe Water for All’ panel discussion.

Sahil's room

'Made Muskan an addict'

'Directed her to stab Saurabh's heart thrice'

NEW DELHI: As hesitant Muskan sat on the chest of her unconscious husband, her lover Sahil handed her a knife and showed her how to wield it. ""You have to stab him in the heart three times,"" he instructed her with a promise of a new life after all this.Sahil, along with his lover Muskan Rastogi, stands accused of the murder of Muskan's husband, former Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput.Sahil's room offered a glimpse into his dark and disturbing psyche. A dimly lit space with broken walls, filled with satanic symbols, cigarette boxes, and artwork depicting drug consumption. The victim's family believe that Sahil’s obsession with the occult played a role in the murder, with Saurabh Rajput’s mother, Renu Devi, claiming that her son was killed as part of a tantric ritual.In Sahil's room a bed sheet covered the window, and a sofa stood against the wall. Among the graffiti was a message: ""You can't trip with us."" The room had liquor cans scattered.On March 4, Rajput was allegedly drugged, stabbed, dismembered, and his remains sealed inside a cement-filled drum. Muskan and Sahil then embarked on a vacation to Himachal Pradesh, using Saurabh’s phone to mislead his family. The crime was discovered two weeks later when Muskan finally confessed to her parents, who then informed the police.Police sources told news agency PTI suggest that Sahil exercised psychological control over Muskan, isolating her from her six-year-old daughter and turning her into an addict. Muskan's parents accused him of trapping her in his web of superstitions. Neighbours also recalled his eerie behaviour—wearing kurtas with 'Mahakal' inscriptions, feeding stray cats, and keeping his room shrouded in darkness. Sketches of ominous figures adorned his walls, reinforcing his unsettling presence.""Sahil's occult practices dominated Muskaan's mind in such a way that she started keeping her six-year-old daughter away. Sahil had made Muskaan an addict and completely superstitious,"" the victim's mother said.Muskan, in her statement to police, admitted that Sahil coerced her into committing the murder. He allegedly told her, ""You have to kill Saurabh if we are to start a new life."" On the night of the crime, he directed Muskan to sit on Saurabh’s chest before handing her a knife. When she hesitated, he guided her hand to stab her unconscious husband three times in the heart.""Sahil got Muskan to kill her husband. First, he made her sit on Saurabh's chest. Then he brought a knife from the kitchen, showed her how to wield it and directed her to insert the knife in Saurabh's heart thrice,"" the source told PTI.Investigations also revealed that Muskan manipulated Sahil by creating a fake Snapchat ID impersonating his deceased mother. Through this, she convinced him that his mother wanted Saurabh dead.Investigators uncovered that Muskan and Sahil had reconnected in 2019 through a school WhatsApp group, reigniting an old relationship. By November 2023, Muskan had allegedly begun plotting Saurabh’s murder, PTI reported. Before his return from London in February, she purchased sedatives and knives under the guise of needing them to cut chicken. She also attempted to find a location to dispose of the body.SP City Ayush Vikram Singh revealed that Saurabh had been estranged from his family since marrying Muskan, which she believed would help cover up his disappearance. Ultimately, her plan failed, and both she and Sahil now face trial for a crime that investigators say was as gruesome as it was methodically planned.","Sahil, along with his lover Muskan Rastogi, stands accused of the murder of Muskan's husband, former Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput.

Twice in the space of 15 days, Nitish Kumar has mocked Rabri Devi reminding her of the circumstances under which the RJD leader was made the chief minister of the state in 1997.On Thursday, when Rabri Devi, along with other opposition members in the legislative council, targeted Nitish Kumar over the law and order situation in the state, the Bihar chief minister's counter was sharp and personal.""Her husband (Lalu Prasad) made her the chief minister when he was placed under suspension,"" Nitish said referring to Lalu Prasad's move to make Rabri Devi the chief minister after he was forced to resign from the post following an arrest warrant in a fodder scam case.Rabri Devi, a homemaker-turned-politician who is now the leader of the opposition in the Council, rose to register her protest, asserting that she could speak of achievements of her eight-year-long tenure as the chief minister.Nitish Kumar then ticked her off with the Magahi phrase ""(you stay out of this. You know nothing about these matters)"".This was the second time that Nitish Kumar had singled out Rabri Devi on the issue and made a mention of how and why Rabri Devi was made the chief minister.Earlier on March 7, during a heated debate over plight of women under the NDA government, Nitish had unleashed a broadside against the RJD in general and Rabri Devi in particular.The Bihar chief minister surprised many with his choice of words to refer to former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi.""Jab iske husband doob gaye to apni wife ko bana diya (When her husband began to sink, he installed his wife (in the CM's post))"", Nitish had said.So, why is Nitish Kumar harping on what happened 28 years ago? Is he trying to drive home some political message as the state gears up for assembly elections later this year?Political analysts believe Nitish Kumar's barbs at Rabri Devi are an attempt to consolidate the support of women who have played a key role in his past electoral victories.""Nitish Kumar is trying to send across a political message with his attacks on Rabri Devi. He wants to establish the narrative that while the RJD under Lalu Prasad had empowered women in his family, he has worked for the common women of the state announcing several schemes for them in the last two decades,"" says Kumar Vijay, a political analyst.""Law and order and development schemes for women have been the strongest forte of Nitish Kumar and when the opposition starts attacking him on these fronts, the reaction is bound to be strong,"" he says.Nitish Kumar faces one of the toughest assembly elections later this year. In the 2020 elections he was reduced to being the junior partner of the BJP in NDA alliance for the first time. This time around he needs to better his party's score to stay relevant.In the last several elections, Nitish has got huge backing of women in Bihar riding on his women-centric schemes and especially after his prohibition move. The JD(U) chief knows that he needs their backing more than ever before. After all, women voers could play a key role in shaping his political fortunes.",Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has mocked opposition leader Rabri Devi twice in the space of 15 days. He has reminded her of the circumstances under which the RJD leader was made the chief minister of the state in 1997. Political analysts believe he is trying to consolidate the support of women who have played a key role in his electoral victories.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119310489,imgsize-1151165,width-400,resizemode-4/119310489.jpg"

The Sisyphus Clause



The Myth of Sisyphus

I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. Albert Camus

So maybe Pakistan is happier.

Not because it is richer, freer, safer, or better—

But because, like Sisyphus, it has made peace with the mountain.

And it no longer asks why.

Long before he became a meme for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars for a joke that seemed like a punchline for Big Pharma to sell some follicular solutions, Will Smith acted in some remarkable movies. One of the most moving was, a fine film on paternal-filial relationships. In a rather dark moment, he wonders if Thomas Jefferson gaslit America by stating in the Declaration of Independence that every American would be endowed with certain rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He says in the movie: “And I remember thinking: how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what.”It’s a sentiment that theappears to agree with—at least for Indians , who have been rankeddespite the fact that it’s a rising global power—one of the few, to borrow a line from the proverbial egg-faced Shashi Tharoor , whose leader can hug both the premiers of Ukraine and Russia.But that’s hardly surprising, because it completely fits into the WENA (Western Europe and Norhtern American) idea of India. If one were to learn about India solely from Anglosphere coverage, one would assume that India was a genocidal hellhole where the living conditions were worse than sub-Saharan Africa.The fact is that if irony could be measured, the World Happiness Report 2025 would be a more shoddily written Don Quixote. India is ranked 118th—below Saudi Arabia (32), Libya (79), Venezuela (82), Uzbekistan (53), Rwanda (116), China (68), Iran (99), Lebanon (104), Palestine (108), Pakistan (109), Ukraine (111), Iraq (101), Cameroon (104), a list that includes war zones, authoritarian regimes, debt-ridden states, and nations facing civil unrest. Even if one were to accept that there are enough citizens of the world who prefer being a fed sparrow to a hungry songbird, even Pakistanis would be shocked to learn that they are ranked above India and would wonder if the only person surveyed for this poll was Osama Bin Laden So, before we get into the problem with the methodology, let’s do a simple headcount between India and Pakistan. Currently, India’s GDP is $3.7 trillion—the fifth largest in the world and the only one after the US to outstrip its former colonial rulers. Pakistan, meanwhile, is a $375 billion economy—not even 10% of India’s size. India’s digital economy is booming, startups are thriving, and infrastructure is expanding at a record pace. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s economy is lurching from one IMF bailout to another like a tippler looking for his next drink.Pakistan is essentially running on loans. The country has over $125 billion in external debt, with crippling inflation and foreign reserves barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports. It defaulted on several payments before being saved by yet another IMF bailout. India, by contrast, is not only managing its debt prudently but has become a net lender to the IMF.As for the contrasting militaries, there’s a delightful anecdote from 1957 recalled by Anvar Alikhan in apiece titled, where he draws parallels between the militaries of the two countries.He writes: “A true story: In 1957, the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , visiting the office of General Thimayya, the Chief of the Army Staff, saw a steel cabinet behind his desk and asked the general what it contained. The general replied that the top drawer contained the nation’s defence plans. And the second drawer contained the confidential files of the nation’s top generals. And what about the third drawer, enquired Nehru. Ah, said the general with a straight face, the third drawer contains my secret plans for a military coup against you. Nehru laughed, but there was apparently a tinge of nervousness to his laughter.”While the idea of a military coup in India remained a joke locked in a cabinet, in Pakistan, the military was so good at dealing with law and order and other issues that whenever martial law was declared, people would rejoice: “” playing on the termWhile India became a nuclear-armed democracy—warts and all—Pakistan devolved into a de facto military state whose generals always had more power than elected officials. Coups happened with the alacrity of Friday prayers. In fact, Imran Khan was propped up by the military to counter mainstream politicians, but the former World Cup winner soon became more powerful than his puppeteers intended. Yet, a country where the army decides your prime minister, your policies, and sometimes even your breakfast menu is apparently living its best life.Yes, India’s secularism is under scrutiny and faces legitimate criticism. But it still remains a constitutionally enshrined, functioning democracy with an independent judiciary, regular elections, and a diverse press. Pakistan, in contrast, is a state founded on religious identity and has institutionalised discrimination against minorities. Ahmadiyyas can’t even call themselves Muslim, and Hindus are regularly persecuted. Minorities live under a blasphemy law that’s been used more as a weapon than a shield.So, how exactly does a theocracy with enforced religious conformity and institutional bigotry outscore a pluralist democracy—even if imperfect?India is seen as a rising power on the global stage. It’s hosting G20 summits, mediating in global conflicts, and pushing for a multipolar world. Pakistan, meanwhile, is often the subject of IMF reports, FATF warnings, and UN human rights resolutions. India’s passport opens doors; Pakistan’s passport raises eyebrows.In fact, the contrast between India and Pakistan can even be seen in both nations’ favourite pastimes: cricket. In recent years, much to the chagrin of English and Australian columnists, India has become the de facto Trump of world cricket —big enough to call the shots—so much so that when Pakistan finally got the chance to host a Champions Trophy, India refused to set foot. While the Pakistani team went out dismally in the group stage, India romped home to pick up the trophy without as much as breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury, India’s dominance meant that Pakistan (the hosts) had to travel to Dubai to play its match, and India reaching the final robbed Pakistan of the spectacle.India’s changed standing on the global stage can be summarised by the contrasting online reaction to a tweet from an American commentator with a Ukraine flag (a marker of online inanity), which wondered why there was no outrage when Prime Minister Modi (like Zelenskyy) wasn’t dressed in a suit. Most commentators pointed out that Modi was dressed in traditional garb (a kurta pyjama and a jacket) as opposed to Zelenskyy’s cosplay sweatshirt and khakis. However, the real kicker was even white Americans—who often spend time mocking JD Vance’s wife —defended the Indian Prime Minister because he wasn’t in America asking for more funds and weapons.The implication that India—a growing economy, a space-faring democracy, and a hub of innovation—is less “happy” than war-torn or economically collapsed nations raises serious questions about the methodology behind these rankings. The report relied heavily on subjective self-assessments, primarily via Gallup’s “Cantril Ladder,” where respondents rated their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. These were then modelled against six variables: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. However, many of these variables were based more on perceptions than hard data. In societies where expectations are low, or media is tightly controlled, people often report higher satisfaction. In contrast, in dynamic democracies like India, rising aspirations, political noise, and media scrutiny tend to yield harsher self-assessments—even in the midst of tangible progress.All of this brought renewed attention to the flaws of international perception-based indices—something Sanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora had flagged in a 2022 working paper . They had offered a pointed critique of three influential global indices: Freedom in the World (by Freedom House), Democracy Index (by the Economist Intelligence Unit), and the V-Dem Indices (by the University of Gothenburg)—all of which had routinely rated India poorly.Sanyal-Arora had argued that these indices were largely opinion-driven, relying on small, opaque pools of anonymous “experts” whose identities, qualifications, and nationalities were often undisclosed. Freedom House, for instance, used 25 subjective questions assessed by internal analysts and external advisers, but published no transparency on scoring mechanisms. The EIU claimed to use public opinion, yet India’s last World Values Survey input dated back to 2012—meaning more recent assessments were based almost entirely on expert opinion. V-Dem, meanwhile, used 473 variables, many of them highly subjective, including notions like “self-censorship” or “deliberative quality of governance.”They also noted that many of the questions used were ill-suited for cross-country comparisons, such as “how pervasive is corruption?” or “to what extent is direct popular vote utilised?”—metrics that penalised democracies like India and the US for not holding national referendums, while awarding higher scores to one-party states like Cuba.India and Pakistan are on two different trajectories, and even the honest Pakistani knows that. If Albert Camus was right, then perhaps the secret to happiness lies not in prosperity, democracy, or purpose—but in the acceptance of futility, the repetition of struggle, and the knowledge that there is no divine reward at the summit.In, Camus describes a man condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time. It is an absurd fate, but in contemplating it—knowing it is his, accepting it as unchangeable—Sisyphus becomes, paradoxically, free. Camus writes: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”Perhaps this, then, explains Pakistan’s higher ranking in the World Happiness Report 2025. Perhaps Pakistan is the Sisyphus of South Asia. A nation locked in a cycle of economic collapse, military coups, IMF bailouts, energy shortages, and cricketing heartbreak, and yet—it smiles on the way back down the hill.Where India fights, debates, builds, reforms, and aspires—Pakistan accepts. It no longer expects the summit. Its happiness is not driven by achievement but by survival, not by growth but by repetition. Where India agonises over its democracy, Pakistan no longer pretends to have one. Where India chases global leadership, Pakistan is content negotiating its next loan. There is peace in low expectations, freedom in detachment. If happiness is the absence of disillusionment, then what better strategy than to stop being illusioned in the first place?And so, while Indians grumble through traffic jams in growing cities, rage against corruption, or demand better governance, Pakistanis return to their rock each morning, lift it with muscle memory, and smile—because nothing else was promised. As Camus wrote: “Each atom of that stone... forms a world.”Every bailout is a new beginning. Every coup, a cosmic reset. Every World Cup loss, a philosophical cleansing. They roll the rock. It rolls back. The absurd cycle is complete. Meanwhile, India is caught in its own existential spiral—still believing happiness is to be earned, still chasing Jefferson’s promise of “the pursuit”, still demanding meaning from its journey. But as Camus warns, meaning is a human construct. The world owes us none.","India is ranked 118th among 147 countries in the World Happiness Report 2025.

NEW DELHI: A fire that broke out in the residential bungalow of a Delhi high court judge resulted in recovery of a huge pile of cash, sending shock waves in judicial corridors and forcing the Supreme Court collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna to decide to transfer him to another HC.When the fire broke out, Justice Yashwant Varma was not in town and his family members called the fire brigade and police. After the fire was doused, first responders found a huge amount of cash inside a room, leading to official entries being made about the recovery of what appeared to be unaccounted money.The local cops informed their seniors who briefed the brass about the accidental discovery. Soon, the news reached the higher-ups in the govt, who, in turn, informed the CJI about the hoard. CJI Khanna took a very serious view and immediately called for a collegium meeting.Also read : Who is Justice Yashwant Varma, the Delhi HC Judge transferred after cash recovery The collegium was unanimous that Justice Varma needed to be transferred immediately. He has been transferred to his parent HC, Allahabad HC. He had moved from there to Delhi HC in Oct 2021.However, some members of the five-judge collegium felt such a serious incident, if let off with a transfer, would not only tarnish the judiciary's image but also erode trust in the institution. They said Justice Varma should be asked to resign and if he declined, an in-house inquiry should be initiated by the CJI, as the first step towards his removal by Parliament.As per the in-house procedure devised by SC in 1999 to deal with allegations of corruption, wrongdoing or impropriety against constitutional court judges, CJI on receipt of a complaint, seeks response of the judge.He can set up the in-house probe panel comprising an SC judge and chief justices of two HCs in case he is not satisfied with the response or concludes that the matter requires deeper probe.","A fire that broke out in the residential bungalow of a Delhi high court judge resulted in recovery of a huge pile of cash. When the fire broke out, Justice Yashwant Varma was not in town and his family members called the fire brigade and police.

"'Hope to rebuild ties': India after Trudeau's exit, says ties with Canada hit due to 'license given to extremists'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hope-to-rebuild-ties-india-after-trudeaus-exit-says-ties-with-canada-hit-due-to-license-given-to-extremists/articleshow/119299487.cms,"Justin Trudeau (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The central government on Friday said it is ready to rebuild ties with Canada, which has taken a hit over Ottawa harbouring anti-India elements.The ministry of external affairs said the downturn in relations between both nations was caused by the Trudeau-led Canadian government giving license to the extremist and secessionist elements.""The downturn in India-Canada relations was caused by the license that was given to the extremist and secessionist elements in the country. Our hope is that we can rebuild our ties based on mutual trust and sensitivity ,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a press briefing.Over the past several months, relations between New Delhi and Ottawa have experienced significant strain, primarily due to the presence of Khalistanis, who actively work against India's national security.In October 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian government agents of involvement in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Canadian citizen and prominent Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia.This allegation led to a diplomatic crisis , with both nations expelling senior diplomats. Canada's federal police claimed to have credible evidence of Indian agents engaging in illegal activities on Canadian soil, including intelligence gathering and interference in democratic processes.The situation further deteriorated when demonstrations near a Hindu temple in Brampton, Ontario, were dispersed by police after weapons were reportedly spotted among participants. This event followed a violent protest involving Khalistani terrorists opposing a visit from Indian consular officials.In response to these developments, India invoked the provision of parity in Canada's diplomatic presence, citing concerns over interference in its affairs by Canadian personnel.External affairs minister S Jaishankar stated that the relationship between the two countries was going through a difficult phase and indicated that India might resume issuing visas to Canadians if there was progress in ensuring the safety of Indian diplomats in Canada.However, Justin Trudeau on January 6 announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party, citing internal conflicts that hindered his ability to effectively lead into the next election.The chances of improvement in ties appeared after Mark Carney was named the new Canadian Prime Minister. Carney has, in the past, expressed a positive outlook on India, particularly regarding its economic growth and commitment to clean energy.","The ministry of external affairs said the downturn in relations between both nations was caused by the Trudeau-led Canadian government giving license to the extremist and secessionist elements.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday took a sharp jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi while speaking in the Rajya Sabha on counter-terrorism operations and development in Jammu and Kashmir under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.With a 'Kala Chashma' (black glasses) remark, Amit Shah accused Rahul Gandhi of refusing to acknowledge the development work done by the Modi government . The home minister said, ""If someone is sitting with black glasses on, how is it possible to show them the development?""During his speech, Shah said, ""They ask us — 'What happened after the abrogation of Article 370 ?' Saheb, development can only be seen by those with open hearts and clear vision. Those who sit with black glasses on and their eyes closed cannot see the progress in Jammu and Kashmir.""The home minister, referencing Rahul Gandhi's 2023 statement about his Bharat Jodo Yatra in Kashmir, said, ""He went to Kashmir, played Holi of snow, and then claimed he saw terrorists there."""" (If a terrorist is in your mind, he will appear in your dreams as well as in Kashmir), he added.""Whenever we see a terrorist, we shoot him between the eyes,"" Shah said, emphasizing the Modi government’s zero-tolerance policy on terrorism.Shah was referring to Rahul Gandhi's 2023 remarks at Cambridge University, where Gandhi recalled facing terrorists during the Bharat Jodo Yatra.Rahul had said that security forces in Kashmir advised him not to walk in the region due to fears of terror attacks.During the walk, an unknown man allegedly approached him, pointed toward some nearby individuals, and revealed that they were terrorists.""I thought I was in trouble because, in that situation, terrorists would kill me. But they did nothing because this is the power of listening,"" Rahul Gandhi had said.Shah, while responding to a debate in the Rajya Sabha on the functioning of the Home Ministry, asserted that the Narendra Modi government had fulfilled the vision of the Constitution’s architects by abrogating Article 370.""Article 370 was the foundation of separatism in Kashmir. However, I thank the architects of our Constitution for making it a temporary provision and incorporating a pathway for its abrogation within the Article itself,"" Shah said.He blamed vote bank politics and political rigidity for the prolonged existence of Article 370. ""On August 5, 2019, we finally abrogated Article 370, realizing the vision of our Constitution’s framers, who believed there should be no two heads of state, two constitutions, or two flags in one country,"" he stated.","Amit Shah took a sharp jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi while speaking in the Rajya Sabha on counter-terrorism operations and development in Jammu and Kashmir.

What is Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act?

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk-owned X filed a case against the central government on Thursday for allegedly using the IT Act to block content on the micro-blogging site. The case has been filed in the Karnataka high court.In the plea, the X has challenged what it called unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship.It raised concerns over the Centre's interpretation of the Information Technology (IT) Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which X argues violates Supreme Court rulings and undermines free expression online, according to the news agency PTI.The lawsuit alleged the government is using the said section to create a parallel content-blocking mechanism, bypassing the structured legal process outlined in Section 69A.Section 69A of the IT Act allows the government to order content removal for national security, public order, or sovereignty concerns, giving companies a clear legal basis to act. In contrast, Section 79(3)(b), companies argue, is vague, forcing platforms to decide what content is illegal, exposing them to lawsuits or backlash.Companies often use Section 69A as a defense, arguing they should only be liable if the government explicitly orders content removal, rather than guessing what is illegal. This shifts responsibility to the government, protecting platforms from legal risks and accusations of bias while ensuring compliance with official directives.X further claimed the government's current approach contradicts the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in the Shreya Singhal case, which established that content can only be blocked through a proper judicial process or the legally defined route under Section 69A.Social media companies complain about Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act because it creates legal uncertainty, forcing them to remove content even when it's unclear if it's illegal. The social media platforms allege that the vague definition of ""knowledge"" of illegal content makes them fear lawsuits, leading to over-censorship and suppression of free speech. The law also places a huge burden on platforms to police billions of posts daily, which is technically challenging.Social media platforms have also legally challenged the government's Sahyog portal, a system developed by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs to manage takedown requests under Section 79(3)(b) and enable direct coordination between social media companies and law enforcement agencies.X has refused to assign an employee to the platform, arguing that it serves as a ""censorship tool"" that pressures companies to take down content without proper legal scrutiny. The lawsuit claims this is yet another government attempt to regulate online discourse without judicial oversight.",Elon Musk-owned X filed a case against the central government on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Waqf (Amendment) Bill is expected to be introduced in Lok Sabha next week, inviting another round of confrontation between govt and opposition as both are firm on their stands as majority of opposition parties have opposed the legislation.Cabinet has approved the proposed amendments to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill incorporating the changes recently recommended by the parliamentary panel , paving the way for it to be tabled for discussion and passage.The bill was referred to JPC in Aug 2024 after it was introduced in Lok Sabha by minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju . The parliamentary panel adopted the report with majority vote while all 11 MPs from opposition parties in the panel had objected to the report. They had also moved dissent notes. The 655-page report was submitted to both Houses of Parliament earlier this month. The panel, while doing away with the “Waqf by User” provision, going forward, has allowed only existing “Registered Waqf by User” to be recognised as waqf. This will exclude the cases where the properties are under dispute or owned by govt. As per the report, the panel had supported inclusion of non-Muslims in waqf boards, which can go upto four and recommended transfer of dispute investigation authority from district collectors to senior state govt appointees.The state waqf boards will now include one member from the Muslim OBC community, ensuring broader representation. NDA, led by BJP is safely placed in Lok Sabha as a simple majority requires 272 votes to pass any legislation. NDA has 293 of 543 seats. In Jan, JPC approved 14 amendments proposed by NDA members, with TDP and JDU backing the revised version, signaling their alignment with BJP’s agenda. The proposed amendments introduce a series of changes designed to modernise the Waqf system.

Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

I have always admired author Arthur Hailey. The meticulous research that has gone into each of his works never ceased to amaze me, be it Airport , Hotel , Money Changers , or Evening News . But Final Diagnosis remains my favourite.

Dr Pearson, an old doctor, who once helmed a research centre and Hospital, imparts wisdom to his young successor, Coleman, on the fleeting nature of time:

“You’ll sit on that chair and the phone will ring, and it’ll be the administrator—talking about budgets. Next minute, one of the lab staff will want to quit.” The old man smiled. That’s the way a day can go, and the next. Until you find a year has slipped by, and another. You will not read books, you will delegate research work to junior doctors.

And one day, you’ll realize that everything you once knew is outdated. If you want to avoid that, lock yourself in a room. Stay ahead.

I don’t remember whether Dr Coleman took Dr Pearson’s advice in the novel, but those words of Hailey stayed with me.

That’s how time passes us—like water cupped in our palms.

Our daily routines must go on, endless chores will demand our attention. Women, especially, bear this weight tenfold: ""My nails need trimming, I can't recall my last salon visit, my hospital check-up is overdue. It’s been a year since I had an uninterrupted conversation with my sister.”

Life is a constant battle between the vital few and the trivial many. The external world demands attention, but our internal calling whispers persistently. We work tirelessly, filling our days with ceaseless activity. But if we pause and ask whether we have moved closer to our dreams, the answer is often silent regret.

This paradox haunts employees during performance evaluations. ""I’ve been working non-stop,"" they say, only to hear, ""But the goals set at the beginning of the year remain unfulfilled."" Ironically, their managers, and their managers’ managers, all wonder the same—where did the time go?

Time management experts constantly remind us to carve out ‘sacred time’. Step away from the routine, and focus on what truly matters – at least 25% of our time has to be allotted for that. If we continue to say, “One day, when things settle, I will pursue my dream,” that day may never arrive. The time to act is now.

In the Mahabharata , the Pandavas lived an incognito year, shedding their royal identities in Virata Parva . Yudhishthira became a dice companion to the king, Draupadi a royal maid, Bhima a palace cook, Arjuna a transgender dance teacher, Nakula a horse trainer, and Sahadeva an astrologer. That year of reinvention deepened their wisdom, strengthening them for what lay ahead. When they left behind their identities and routine, they were able to connect with their inner selves more deeply.

Many renowned artists, thinkers, and scientists took time away from the everyday grind to devote themselves to their passion. Beethoven withdrew from social life to compose some of his greatest symphonies. Writers like Thoreau retreated into solitude to pen works that would later inspire generations.

Thiruvalluvar’s wisdom echoes through time:

Eydarkku Ariyadhu iyaindakkaal Annilaye

Seydarkku Ariya Seyal.

Hesitate not to prioritise the time which is rare,

And achieve tasks otherwise hard.

Are our days spent merely ticking off tasks on an endless list or in shaping something when looked back upon, brings fulfilment rather than regret?

Later, when the national anthem was played, he stood smiling and waving at bystanders.Kumar came under heavy opposition fire in both Houses of the state legislature for disrespecting the national anthem. His latest act led to much mirth and has given fodder to opposition parties, RJD and Congress, to exploit in the upcoming state polls, arguing he can't be given another term in view of his health condition.BJP, sources said, is confident of winning another term alongside JDU and LJP, but the party's worry is that Kumar's unexpected behaviour in the public glare has often given openings to opponents.The party, however, believes Kumar continues to be a valuable partner, and the memories of RJD's ""jungle raj"" will blunt any possibility of ""anti-incumbency"". Moreover, Kumar is credited with good governance and raising the bar in terms of performance which, BJP insiders feel, will help the alliance win another term.Of late, Kumar's behaviour has not followed a consistent pattern; there have been days when no mishaps took place and he appeared to be in control, like during his 'Pragati Yatra', even though he was in the public glare for several days.

Woman who accused Maharashtra minister Jaykumar Gore of harassment held for extortion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/woman-who-accused-maharashtra-minister-jaykumar-gore-of-harassment-held-for-extortion/articleshow/119322238.cms,"KOLHAPUR: A Satara-based woman who had accused Maharashtra minister Jaykumar Gore of harassment was arrested while accepting Rs 1 crore as the first tranche of the Rs 3 crore she had allegedly demanded to settle the matter, police said on Friday.Gore, who is state rural development and panchayati raj minister, had claimed that the woman had demanded the extortion money through a Wai resident, Viraj Ratansinha Shinde, to not sit in protest at Raj Bhavan, a police officer said.The woman had allegedly told Shinde that if the money was not paid, she would also accuse the minister of raping her and lead a campaign seeking his resignation, the officer said.""Shinde approached us with the complaint that the woman was blackmailing the minister. With the help of two witnesses, the complainant arranged Rs 1 crore (arranged in 10 wads of Rs 10 lakh each). She told the complainant to come to her lawyer's officer, where we arrested her while she was accepting the money. A case has been registered with Satara city police station under BNS Sections 61 (2) [criminal conspiracy], 308 (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) [related to extortion], 351(3) [criminal conspiracy], and 3(5) [common intention]. She will be produced before a court in Satara on Saturday. We have ample evidence to seek police custody,"" said inspector Arun Devkar of the local crime branch in Satara.Though TOI tried to contact Gore for comment, his phone was switched off till late evening and text messages remained unanswered.In 2016, the woman had accused Gore of sexual harassment, assault, stalking, and transmitting material containing sexually explicit acts. Recently, in an interview on an online video-sharing platform, she alleged that Gore was maligning her image and that she was coming on record in public about the 2016 case. Gore denied the charges, stating that he had fought a legal battle and the court had acquitted him. On March 10 this year, Satara police arrested journalist Tushar Kharat after Gore alleged that he had sought Rs 5 crore to stop the smear campaign. After his police custody ended, Kharat was remanded in judicial custody till March 26 by a Vaduj court.The woman's allegations triggered an uproar in the ongoing assembly session, with the opposition demanding his resignation. The minister, however, brought a breach of privilege motion against NCP(SP) MLA Rohit Pawar and Kharat.Following the woman's arrest, opposition questioned the circumstances leading to the payment of Rs 1 crore and the source of the cash.Rohit Pawar said: ""What did the woman possess that Gore agreed to pay her Rs 1 crore? There was an agreement between the woman and Gore that if the latter stopped harassing her, she would let him free. What was the reason for agreement?""NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule said: ""After demonetisation, how can a person have Rs 1 crore in cash? It was a double-engine govt that brought in demonetisation. The question arises whether the woman had sought the money or it was deliberately handed to her. Central agencies, such as ED and CBI, should investigate the source of Rs 1 crore cash.""Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said, ""The journalist and the woman were arrested in the same way. It is sheer misuse of power."" BJP MLA Parinay Phuke, however, said it was an opposition conspiracy to defame the minister and force him to resign.","Satara-based woman had accused Maharashtra minister Jaykumar Gore of harassment.

It set aside a 2023 tribunal order directing one senior citizen to hand over the premises to another, observing that the elder sister was not legally required to maintain the younger sister, both being senior citizens.The dispossessed younger sister had petitioned HC against the tribunal's order. Residing in a ground-floor slum tenement, she sought the eviction of her elder sister and another family member from the first-floor premises, alleging encroachment. However, Justice Sandeep Marne held that her application was a case of possession recovery, which could not be filed under the special law meant for senior citizens' maintenance.In its March 10 order, HC allowed Vimal Kate and other petitioners to retain the premises but clarified that the younger sister could pursue recovery through a civil court. It noted that the tribunal, meant for summary inquiries, could not adjudicate complex possession disputes. ""Such adjudication can be undertaken only before a civil court,"" it stated, calling the case a ""gross abuse of jurisdiction"" to secure possession through improper means.While HC entertained the case due to its unique circumstances, it emphasised that this ruling should not be seen as a precedent for bypassing the appeal process under the Act. It also directed the elder sister to pay pending power and water charges and not to harass the younger sister until legal proceedings were initiated."," Bombay HC sets aside a 2023 tribunal order directing one senior citizen to hand over the premises to another.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar , during his visit to Berlin on Friday, strongly condemned the recent Pahalgam terror attack and said that India has tolerance for terrorism and New Delhi will ""never give in to nuclear blackmail"" referring to crossborder terrorism backed by Pakistan.He also added that all issues with Pakistan will be handled bilaterally, without any third-party involvement.Jaishankar is in Berlin on the final leg of his three-nation tour to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. He held meetings with key German leaders, including foreign minister Johann Wadephul and Chancellor Friedrich Merz, focusing on strengthening the India-Germany partnership.At a joint press conference with Wadephul, Jaishankar said: ""I came to Berlin in the immediate aftermath of India responding to the Pahalgam terror attack. Let me share with you what I conveyed to Mr Wadephul in that context. India has zero-tolerance for terrorism. India will never give in to nuclear blackmail.""He added: ""India will deal with Pakistan purely bilaterally. There should be no confusion in any quarter in that regard.""He also reflected on brutality of terror attack in J&K's Pahalgam and India's strong response afterwards, at German Council, saying, ""This was a terrorist attack, which is part of a pattern which has targeted not only J&K but other parts of India as well...thiswas meant to create a fear psychosis and destroy the tourism economy of the Kashmir...and sow religious discord...what we were responding to were terrorism. ..and when we responded there were a lot of international understanding...we targeted terrorist headquarters and terror sites. Our campaign is against terrorism, and in this case, terrorists happen to be located in the country next door because that country, for many years, has used terrorism as a tool.""Following their talks, the German foreign minister condemned the terrorist attack and expressed support for India’s right to defend itself. He also supported resolving India-Pakistan issues directly, without external involvement.After the meeting, Jaishankar posted on X: ""Excellent meeting today with FM Johann Wadephul in Berlin. Deeply appreciate Germany's understanding of India's right to defend itself against terrorism.""He also said that both sides discussed deepening the Strategic Partnership and exploring new areas of cooperation, including regional and global issues.His remarks came after India launched Operation Sindoor in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people. On May 7, India carried out precision strikes and destroyed nine terror camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Pakistan attempted to retaliate between May 8 and 10 by targeting Indian military bases, but met India's strong air defence system response.The confrontations ended with a ceasefire on May 10.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared a ""new normal."" saying that any future act of crossborder terrorism will be treated as an ""act of war.""Jaishankar and German officials also celebrated 25 years of the India-Germany Strategic Partnership. He noted that Germany is India’s largest economic partner in the European Union, and both countries have expanded cooperation across various sectors in recent years.He also praised Germany’s role in supporting a free trade agreement between India and the European Union. Both sides are working to finalise the deal by the end of this year, which could significantly boost business ties.In addition to his meetings with political leaders, Jaishankar met Germany’s minister of economy and energy, Katherina Reiche, to discuss enhancing industry cooperation, skilled talent exchange, and supply chain resilience.He also had talks with Gunter Sautter, foreign and security policy advisor to Chancellor Merz, and interacted with members of the German Parliament, thanking them for their support in growing India-Germany relations.","Jaishankar is in Berlin on the final leg of his three-nation tour to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany.

'No credentials to speak about protecting civilians': India slams Pakistan’s 'grossly hypocritical' remarks at UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-credentials-to-speak-about-protecting-civilians-india-slams-pakistans-grossly-hypocritical-remarks-at-un/articleshow/121372782.cms,"India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish

NEW DELHI: India delivered a sharp rebuke to Pakistan at the UN Security Council, condemning its ""grossly hypocritical"" stance on protecting civilians.While addressing UN Security Council, India's permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish challenged Pakistan's credibility in discussing civilian protection, highlighting recent provocative actions by Pakistani forces.""We just recently saw senior government, police and military officials pay respects at the funeral of noted terrorists targeted by Operation Sindoor . A nation that makes no distinction between terrorists and civilians has no credentials to speak about protecting civilians,"" Harish said.He detailed recent attacks by the Pakistani army that resulted in over 20 civilian deaths and 80 injuries, with deliberate targeting of religious institutions including gurudwaras, temples, convents, and medical facilities.""To preach at this body after such behaviour is grossly hypocritical,"" Harish stated.India's representative recalled Pakistan's involvement in numerous terrorist attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the recent killing of tourists in Pahalgam in April 2025. ""The victims of Pakistani terrorism have been predominantly civilians, since its objective has been to attack our prosperity, progress and morale,"" he noted.India on May 7 launched Operation Sindoor, which targeted nine terror-related sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir. This was in response to Pahalgam terror attack that claimed lives of 26 civilians. Pakistan retaliated with crossborder shelling and attempted drone attacks, prompting India to target key Pakistani military infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase. The hostilities ceased on May 10 after both countries reached an understanding.Residents of border areas in Jammu and Kashmir faced severe destruction due to Pakistani shelling during the recent cross-border tensions. These border communities were the immediate victims when hostilities broke out between India and Pakistan, though the situation has now stabilised following a mutual ceasefire agreement. The Pakistani artillery fire inflicted substantial damage in the frontier villages, leaving numerous houses either completely destroyed or severely damaged, rendering them uninhabitable.Harish addressed broader concerns about civilian protection in armed conflicts, highlighting the emerging threats from terrorist entities using new technologies. He stressed that the international community must focus on developing national capabilities to protect civilians while maintaining zero tolerance for terrorism.""Respect for principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States, should remain the basis for all actions taken by the Council for the protection of civilians,"" Harish stated, emphasising that politically motivated interventions in armed conflicts could have devastating consequences for civilian populations.Harish called for concrete actions to implement existing Security Council resolutions on civilian protection, emphasising that humanitarian operations must be guided by the core principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.Residents of border areas in Jammu and Kashmir faced severe destruction due to Pakistani shelling during the recent cross-border tensions.

When Indian TV news made social media look sane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-indian-tv-news-made-social-media-look-sane/articleshow/121372135.cms,"In times of war and other crises, people want news by the minute, but during Op Sindoor some Indian TV channels went overboard, at times running reports of deep strikes by Indian forces without verification, especially on May 8.Late evening, news anchors claimed Indian Navy had destroyed Karachi port, Indian Air Force had downed Pakistani jets, and their pilots had been captured, Pakistan’s PM had sought refuge in a bunker, and its army chief Asim Munir had been ousted in a coup. All of these claims eventually turned out to be false, and were picked up by major Western news organisations as a sign of decay in Indian TV journalism.The Economist has described the disinformation on TV as a “culmination of decades of descent into inanity,” adding that “Indian television achieved the astonishing feat of making social media appear sane.” The New York Times says, “anchors and commentators became cheerleaders for war between two nuclear-armed states. Some well-known TV networks aired unverified information or even fabricated stories amid the burst of nationalistic fervor. ”India had made it clear that Op Sindoor was a nonescalatory strike intended to take out terrorist infrastructure without harming Pakistan’s civilian and military installations.However, the belligerence of news channels suggested something else. “Indians watching television thought their country was only moments away from annihilating Pakistan,” NYT says.The Economist also took note of the commentary by panelists, “If news segments were merely outrageous, commentary was unhinged.” “One anchor demanded: ‘Set fire to Karachi, blow up the entire city.’ On another channel a former army officer called Iran’s foreign minister a ‘son of a pig’, triggering a minor diplomatic incident.” NYT points out that by pushing falsehoods, prominent news channels harm their audience and themselves: “When previously trusted sources become disinformation outlets, it’s a really large problem. ” In The Economist’s view, “Disinformation about drone swarms and mass suicide attacks was amplified rather than squashed. Border communities — which bore the brunt of blackouts and drone attacks — were left groping for facts. The rest of the country was less vulnerable to bombs, but not to lies.”But where TV news failed, newspapers remained true to their ethos of credibility. The Economist notes, “newspapers proved reliable” even though readers got their hands on them many hours after the “skirmishes” in the morning. That’s because the print media sticks to the old rule book of journalism and is also answerable for what it publishes. Every report is carefully fact-checked to safeguard credibility and reputation, built over decades and decades. Op Sindoor isn’t the first time newspapers have proven their credibility. Because processes of newsgathering and factchecking are sacrosanct. Seeing is believing, only if it’s in print.","During Op Sindoor some Indian TV channels went overboard, at times running reports of deep strikes by Indian forces without verification.

The Trump administration's decision to revoke Harvard's eligibility to enrol foreign students raised concerns over the legal status of thousands of students, including nearly 800 from India, currently enrolled at the elite school.At present, Harvard hosts about 10,158 students and scholars from around the world across its schools. According to data, there are 788 students and scholars from India for 2024-25 academic year.Ajay Bhutoria, a former advisor to Joe Biden, said Indian students contribute over $9 billion annually to the US economy and strengthen ties.

Koombalum Illadhu Arivu.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.Among the many couplets of Thirukkural on human connections, one stands out - friendships not swayed by emotions but steadied by clarity and enduring grace.The wise remain firm in friendships that neither blossom nor wither with time—unlike a flower that opens and closes its petals.Most of us know what it means to lose a friend; not with a dramatic rupture, but in the quiet drift of time. Bonds that once felt like lifelines slowly unravel. At times, life simply steers us in different directions. Sharp disagreements leave bruises. Or a shadow of a doubt — was something said behind one’s back— leads to a faltering of trust.I’ve had friends who were once the heartbeat of my days, now reduced to strangers. When we cross paths, it’s like walking through a museum of memories; echoes everywhere, but no one speaks. Some recollections are warm, others cut deep. The sting of betrayal resurfaces, uninvited. In those moments, I tell myself: You have to let people go. At some point, you see who truly mattered, who never did, and whose chapter in your story is simply over. They no longer belong to yours now.And yet, some friendships defy time, disagreement, and distance. Not because they are effortless, but because they are chosen, again and again, despite the friction.A shining example is that of Thiru V Kalyanasundaram (Thiru V Ka), the Tamil scholar and trade union pioneer. His friend and contemporary, M C Raja, was one of the earliest leaders of the Justice party. Both were reformers and thinkers, classmates and colleagues at Wesley College, and residents of Royapettah in Chennai.In 1921, the Binny Mill strike rattled the city. Thiru V Ka and Raja found themselves on opposing sides, not as enemies, but as leaders representing different groups of workers with diverging ideological paths.As tensions rose, whispers emerged that Thiru V Ka might be targeted, by police or angry factions. One day, a car halted at his door. Raja stepped out. “Trouble is on its way. Just get in,” he said.Thiru V Ka declined. But he never forgot the tears he saw in his friend’s eyes.Later, as the storm passed, Raja said something that stayed with him: Our friendship was strong enough to find harmony in the heart of conflict.Eventually, Raja moved to Alandur, and the rhythm of their friendship faltered.Another story, equally poignant, unfolded in 1933, again in Chennai. The newly formed Music Academy announced a dance performance by Rajalakshmi and Jeevarathnam—women from the devadasi community. The event was organised by E Krishna Iyer, then secretary of the Academy and a passionate cultural activist.At the time, Muthulakshmi Reddy was leading a fierce campaign to abolish the devadasi system, determined to restore dignity and civil rights to the women trapped within it. Krishna Iyer, while agreeing on the need for reform, argued that sadir—the classical dance form—should be preserved. To him, it was art, unjustly condemned by its social associations.The two began an intense public debate, exchanging letters through newspapers. Madras society split down the middle: some backed Reddy, others Krishna Iyer. Yet despite their differences, the two remained family friends, sharing stages, events, and mutual respect.In time, both found success. Reddy’s legislation helped abolish the devadasi system. Krishna Iyer, aided by Rukmini Devi Arundale, revived the art under a new name—Bharatanatyam—transforming it into a respected cultural treasure.Thiru V Ka and Raja. Krishna Iyer and Muthulakshmi Reddy. Four people divided by ideology, united by something deeper. Their friendships endured—not in the absence of disagreement, but because they held space for it. They lived what Thiruvalluvar wrote: relationships that neither bloom in prosperity nor wither in dissent.Not all of us are fortunate to have such enduring bonds. But perhaps the true test of friendship isn’t how brightly it blooms—but whether it survives when the petals fall.","Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text.

"'Tough life': SC directs IAF not to release woman officer who served in Operations Sindoor, Balakot till further orders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tough-life-sc-directs-iaf-not-to-release-woman-officer-who-served-in-operations-sindoor-balakot-till-further-orders/articleshow/121362528.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court directed the government and the Indian Air Force (IAF) not to release Wing Commander Nikita Pandey from service, after she alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission despite her critical role in Operation Balakot and Operation Sindoor. Noting a ""tough life"" for Short Service Commission (SSC) officers, the bench in ""layman's suggestion"" said its ""uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces.""A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to the Centre and the IAF on Thursday, seeking their response on Pandey’s plea, news agency PTI reported. She claimed that although she ranked second in the country among expert fighter controllers and had served over 13.5 years, she was being discharged due to a 2019 policy change that denied her a permanent commission.“Our Air Force is one of the best organisations in the world. Officers are very commendable. The quality of coordination they have exhibited - I think it's unparalleled. Therefore, we always salute them. They are a big asset for the nation. They are the nation, in a way. Because of them, we are able to sleep at night,” Justice Kant said.The bench expressed concern over the uncertainty faced by SSC officers, stating that a long tenure without permanent commission needed to be addressed.“That sense of uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces. It's a layman's suggestion, because we are not experts. On minimum benchmarks, there can't be a compromise,” Justice Kant added.Representing Pandey, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy argued that her client was an expert fighter controller, who had played a key role in the Integrated Air Command and Control Systems (IACCS) deployed during Operations Sindoor and Balakot.Pandey’s case, Guruswamy said, was affected by policy shifts that gave her just a month’s notice to end her career despite her stellar service record.Appearing for the government and the IAF, additional solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said that the officer had been found unfit by the selection board and had approached the apex court directly without first filing a representation. She also confirmed that a second selection board would now review Pandey’s case.Bhati, herself from a military background, acknowledged the difficult position of SSC officers but explained, “There are a limited number of posts. It's a very steep pyramid structure.”She noted that typically, 90–95 per cent of officers considered for permanent commission are found fit, but only a few miss out due to comparative merit.Justice Kant responded, urging a more accommodating approach, “You can have a policy of taking that many SCC officers who can be accommodated in the Permanent Commission, if they are found suitable. If you have 100 SCC officers, you should have the capacity to take 100 of them to the permanent commission.”He also emphasised that women officers have performed exceedingly well and highlighted the need for systemic capacity to retain them.The court directed that Wing Commander Pandey must not be released from service until further orders and posted the matter for hearing on August 6.However, the bench clarified that no equity would be created in the officer’s favour at this stage and that all contentions remain open.","Wing Commander Nikita Pandey alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission despite her critical role in Operation Balakot and Operation Sindoor.

Indigo, Air India Cancel Flights Amid Drone Scare Even After Ceasefire | Is Flying Still Safe?

NEW DELHI: The pilot of IndiGo's Delhi-Srinagar flight on Wednesday requested permission from Lahore ATC to briefly enter Pakistan airspace to escape turbulence after being caught in a sudden hailstorm. Sources said Lahore ATC denied the request, prompting the Airbus A321 pilot to declare an emergency with Srinagar ATC.The flight, carrying over 220 passengers, including Trinamool MPs, landed safely in Srinagar, but not without damage - the aircraft's radome, or nose cone, was left badly battered by the storm.A senior official from Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said, ""We've asked IndiGo for a detailed report and a probe is underway. The aircraft (VT-IMD) remains grounded in Srinagar. The pilots are being praised for their presence of mind and professionalism in ensuring everyone's safety.""IndiGo, in an official statement, said: ""Flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar on May 21 encountered a sudden hailstorm and landed safely at Srinagar International Airport. All passengers were well attended to upon landing and no injuries were reported.The aircraft is undergoing inspection and maintenance, and will resume service once it receives the necessary clearances.""Although Pakistan airspace is shut for Indian carriers, aviation experts argue that emergency requests like the one made by the IndiGo pilot should not be refused in the interest of passenger safety.Aviation regulator DGCA has directed commercial airlines and charter and private jet operators to ensure aircraft window shades, barring those for emergency exit-row seats, are closed during take-off and landing at defence airports, “particularly those near the western border”.The rule is meant to “enhance operational safety and prevent unintentional sharing of security-related information by general public/crew”. Failure to comply will invite legal action, DGCA said.Pakistani drone and missile attacks in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor led to 32 airports in north, central and western India — including defence airbases with civil enclaves in Srinagar, Jammu, Leh, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Gwalior and Hindon — being shut for a few days. While operations at these airports have resumed, security concerns remain.“These instructions shall apply post opening of Indian airspace for commercial operations to all scheduled, scheduled commuter, and non-scheduled aircraft operating from defence airfields. All passenger window shades, where applicable, shall remain closed until the aircraft is airborne and has crossed an altitude of 10,000 feet during departure, or during arrival, after it descends below 10,000 feet and reaches the parking bay at the civil terminal,” the order states.In normal circumstances, safety protocol mandates all window shades remain open during take-off and landing. This is to ensure passengers and crew can assess external conditions, such as fires or debris, and identify exits in case of an emergency evacuation. DGCA order for civilian operations at defence airfields also bars photography.","IndiGo flight 6E2142 from Delhi to Srinagar hit severe mid-air turbulence due to a hailstorm.

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh on Friday advised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to exercise caution in his remarks questioning the Centre and the armed forces over Operation Sindoor.Harivansh cited the example of Atal Bihari Vajpayee , who did not protest against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the 1971 war with Pakistan.""There cannot be a more shocking, sad, and uninformative statement than this. This is the time when we all should stand together,"" Rajya Sabha deputy chairman said.""When the 1971 war took place, it was widely publicised that Atal Ji called Indira Ji 'Durga'. The reality was that Atal Ji did not say that, but he also did not protest at that time. Today, the situation is such that the whole country has to stand united... Pakistan's DGMO called our DGMO for a ceasefire. Pakistan's DGMO surrendered, and we are not ready to listen to our army. Former NSA Shivshankar Menon’s book mentions that after the Mumbai attack in 2008, where 166 people were killed, there was silence—whose government was in power then?"" he added.Harivansh also reminded Rahul that the UPA government allegedly hid the news of terrorists beheading a soldier near the Pakistan border, while then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was scheduled to meet US President Barack Obama.""Brahma Chellaney wrote in 2013 that terrorists beheaded our soldiers in the Keran sector near the Pakistan border. At that time, the Prime Minister was in America and was to meet then US President Obama. This news was hidden from the country,"" Harivansh said.""Do not go into the past, otherwise I will mention 2,500 incidents from 2004 to 2014. There were thousands of such occasions when you should have taken action, but did not,"" he added.This comes after Rahul Gandhi, in a social media post, claimed that India's foreign policy has collapsed under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to explain why India has been hyphenated with Pakistan, and who asked U.S. President Donald Trump to ""mediate"" between the two South Asian neighbours.This follows Rahul’s claim that the Centre informed Pakistan ""at the start"" of Operation Sindoor and stated that this was not a ""lapse"" but a ""crime.""On May 17, Rahul shared an undated video of Jaishankar in which the minister is heard saying that ""India had warned Pakistan before launching strikes"" on terror infrastructure.The MEA clarified that the government had warned Pakistan during the ""early phase after Operation Sindoor’s commencement,"" not before it began. It noted that Jaishankar had said, ""We had warned Pakistan at the start, which is clearly the early phase after Op Sindoor’s commencement.""""This is being falsely represented as a warning issued before the commencement. This utter misrepresentation of facts is being called out,"" the ministry added.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7, targeting terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the deadly Pahalgam terror attack on April 22.","Harivansh cited the example of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who did not protest against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the 1971 war with Pakistan.

The contract had coincided with Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi's four-day visit to Bangladesh to further consolidate defence ties and explore new avenues for maritime cooperation.The ouster of the then PM Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh in Aug last year, however, has hit bilateral ties.

JAIPUR: Sixteen days after Supreme Court dismissed Rajasthan BJP MLA Kanwarlal Meena's appeal and two days after his surrender, assembly Speaker Vasudev Devnani finally disqualified the governing party's legislator on Friday.The move came hours after Congress filed a contempt petition against Devnani in Rajasthan high court for allegedly delaying action against Kanwarlal Meena , sentenced to three years for intimidating a govt officer at gunpoint during a panchayat bypoll in 2005.Devnani defended the timing of his decision, stating his office acted upon receiving a formal legal opinion from the advocate-general on Friday. ""I do not act under any pressure. Every decision is rooted in legal and constitutional principles. Even in past cases, Speakers took time for due diligence,"" Devnani said.Opposition Congress, however, cited examples of Rahul Gandhi being disqualified from Lok Sabha within 24 hours of his conviction in 2023 and Rajasthan BSP MLA BL Kushwaha being disqualified within two days of his conviction in 2016.

Meena had then approached the apex court for relief but it dismissed his plea on May 7 citing the legislator's extensive criminal record.The disqualification has reduced BJP's strength in the 200-member assembly from 119 to 118 and necessitates a bypoll in Anta, Meena's assembly seat in Baran district, within six months.

Delhi HC reserves order on Celebi's security clearance withdrawal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-reserves-order-on-celebis-security-clearance-withdrawal/articleshow/121370711.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi high court reserved judgment Friday on a petition by Celebi Airport Services Private Ltd against a decision by the Centre's Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BACS) to withdraw the Turkiye company's security authorisation for ground handling operations at airports over national security concerns.A single-judge bench of Justice Sachin Datta reserved the judgment after listening to senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Celebi, and solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the central govt. The court requested all parties to submit written statements by Monday. The cancellation of Celebi's security clearance came in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor and Pakistan's retaliation that included use of Turkish weapons.Rohatgi argued that principles of natural justice were breached, as Celebi received neither prior notice nor information about govt's intended actions. The decision violated Rule 12 of the Aircrafts Security Rules, 2023, rendering it invalid. The rule stipulates that govt must provide an entity an opportunity to present its case before suspending security clearance. Any suspension requires documented justification and cannot exceed one year.Cancellation is permitted only on reasonable grounds of national security, civil aviation security, or over non-compliance with security conditions.Rohatgi contended that Centre was not endowed with plenary powers, as it claimed to, and it was not open for govt to say it could be in breach of its own rules of granting an opportunity of hearing while revoking security clearance.Celebi urged the HC not to examine materials provided to it in a sealed cover until the firm was given a gist of the allegations it faced. Emphasising the firm ought to have been put on notice before govt's action, Rohatgi said: ""Notice has to say the proposed punishment based on the gravamen of the facts...

Preliminary questioning suggests that he spent months preparing for the attack and may have even practised using the weapon in isolated forested areas.According to police, the attacker used a handmade wooden bow and a sharpened metal arrow, reportedly crafted specifically for the assault. He waited behind a tree near the CBI gate, timing the attack for maximum impact as Singh stood momentarily alone. Singh was rushed to Lucknow's civil hospital with a 5cm wound to the left side of his chest.Chief medical superintendent Dr Rajesh Srivastava confirmed that Singh was in a stable condition and under continuous observation. ""If the arrow struck just slightly to the right, it could have pierced a major artery or even the heart,"" he said.CBI officers are also reviewing whether Singh received any threats in recent months, or if there were signs of surveillance prior to the attack.","A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer in Lucknow's Hazratganj had to pay a hefty price for uncovering a railway scam in 1993.

The agency initiated investigation under PMLA against JIL and JAL based on multiple FIRs registered by the economic offences wing of Delhi Police and UP Police on complaints filed by hundreds of homebuyers of Jaypee Wish Town and other projects of JIL.A senior officer said ED is looking into an alleged ""fraud with homebuyers and investors of around Rs 12,000 crore and siphoning off and diversion of funds"". The former promoters of JIL and JAL are under the scanner while JIL's present owner Suraksha Realty could provide documents available with the company as it is under its control now.A spokesperson for Suraksha told TOI that ""it is a mistaken identity as we have not done any sale or purchase, except construction of the projects"".He denied that Suraksha was in any way involved in bank borrowings related to the project.

NEW DELHI: India will make a strong case to put Pakistan back on the Financial Action Task Force 'grey list' at its next meeting in June and highlight Islamabad's failure to comply with anti-money laundering and terror financing rules, a govt source told TOI on Friday. India will also oppose a World Bank funding plan for Pakistan, which is also scheduled for discussion in June, the source said, adding Islamabad had used funds from multilateral agencies to buy arms.The source said India will present a dossier to the watchdog detailing how Pakistan had failed to comply with the rules.Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between India and Pakistan post Pahalgam massacre, New Delhi has mounted a global offensive against Pakistan, which it has accused of backing terrorists.After Pakistan was placed in FATF 'grey list' in 2018, it had promised to submit an action plan to curb money laundering and terror financing. It had also talked about enacting a law, which it has failed to do so far. In Oct 2022, FATF had announced that Pakistan had been removed from its 'grey list' as it had largely completed its action plans.Removal from the 'grey list' enables a country to have greater access to foreign loans and aid.When FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring and this is referred to as the 'grey list'.World Bank is expected to review a $20 billion funding for Pakistan under the 10-year country partnership framework that was announced in Jan this year.Earlier this month, India had strongly objected to IMF, which approved a $2.3 billion loan to Pakistan under the extended fund facility lending programme ($1 billion) and a fresh resilience and sustainability facility lending plan of $1.3 billion.India abstained from voting as IMF rules do not permit a formal 'no' vote. India had conveyed its strong dissent within the constraints of the IMF's voting system and used the opportunity to formally record its objections. Source said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had spoken to IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva and several European finance ministers expressing India's strong objection.""India is not averse to any country receiving money for development. But IMF funding was not the right thing to do at a time when there were border tensions between India and Pakistan and a situation of war. Also, Pakistan has a history of spending not for people, but for buying arms,"" the source said.After India's sustained objection, IMF has imposed 11 strict conditions on Pakistan on several parameters linked to fiscal, governance, social, monetary and financial parameters along with metrics to be met in energy sector and trade, investment policy and deregulation.Sources citing public data said Pakistan spends on average around 18% of its general budget on ""defence affairs and services"", while even conflict-affected countries spend on average far less (10-14% of their general budget expenditure). Sources pointed out that Pakistan's arms imports increased from 1980 to 2023 by over 20% on average in the years when it received IMF disbursements compared to years when it did not receive such funds.","India will make a strong case to put Pakistan back on the Financial Action Task Force 'grey list' at its next meeting in June.

It helped the police, who initially did not have any concrete leads, secure the conviction of a notorious serial killer, cannibal and skull collector, Ram Niranjan Kol alias Raja Kolander , and his accomplice Bachhraj Kol, in the case.A Lucknow court on Friday awarded life sentence to Raja Kolander and Bachhraj. Special judge Rohit Singh found them guilty under multiple sections of IPC, including 364 (kidnapping) and 394 (dacoity with murder. The two men were also fined Rs 2.5 lakh each, 80% of which will be paid as compensation to the victims' families.According to govt counsel M K Singh, special judge Rohit Singh ruled that both the convicts were guilty of acting in concert with the co-accused in a ""professionally executed and organised criminal conspiracy"" with the intention to loot and eliminate the victims.The prosecution sought the death penalty, citing the gruesome nature of the murders and convicts' criminal history, but the court did not consider it to be a ""rarest of rare"" case.The court rejected pleas for leniency, asserting the nature and planning of the crime left no room for sympathy. The case dates back to Jan 24, 2000, when Manoj left Lucknow for Rewa in MP along with his driver Ravi. They picked up six passengers, including a woman, from Lucknow's Charbagh railway station area. The last known location of his vehicle was in Harchandpur (Rae Bareli), where they had stopped for tea.Manoj's father lodged a missing report three days later. A search was initiated, and the mutilated bodies of Manoj and Ravi were found dumped in the Shankargarh forest area of Prayagraj. Police filed the chargesheet on March 21, 2001, and the trial began only in May 2013. While one co-accused died during the trial in 2017, the cases of three others were separated.Police initially lacked concrete leads, but the turning point came after they recovered the brown coat from the house of Raja Kolandar in Ram Sagar village in Prayagraj, M K Singh said. Manoj's family confirmed I was his coat, and he was wearing it when he had left home on the fateful day.Kolander and Bachhraj were earlier convicted of the cold-blooded murder of a journalist, Dhirendra Singh, in Nov 2012. The victim was lured, shot dead, mutilated and buried. A Prayagraj court had sentenced the duo to life imprisonment after 14 human skulls were recovered from Kolander's farmhouse.","The coat belonged to 22-year-old Manoj Kumar Singh, who was abducted and murdered along with his driver Ravi Srivastava 25 years ago.

The aircraft (VT-IMD) is now grounded in Srinagar. The pilots are being widely applauded for handling the situation well and ensuring everyone’s safety.In a statement, the airline said: “IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar on May 21, 2025, navigated a sudden hailstorm and landed safely at Srinagar International Airport.

Govt on Waqf Act in SC: Proof of being Muslim in sync with Sharia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-on-waqf-act-in-sc-proof-of-being-muslim-in-sync-with-sharia/articleshow/121348573.cms,"No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 Act: Raj govt to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order after arguments over three days between the Centre and petitioners for and against the validity of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Responding to the petitioners' objection to the provision that only a practising Muslim for five years could dedicate properties for waqf, SG Tushar Mehta said it was in sync with the requirement of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.Given the widespread misuse of waqf properties and their usurpation for personal purposes noted from 1870s, registration of waqf properties, including 'waqf by user', needed to be mandatorily registered under the 1923 and 1995 Waqf Acts, he said. Mehta said a person could be governed by the 1937 Act only if he satisfied the prescribed authority that he was a Muslim and filled a form before that authority declaring that he desired to follow Sharia law and be governed by its provisions - ranging from marriage to waqfs. ""So, what is the problem in the new law asking a person to be mandatorily a Muslim for the purpose of making a waqf?"" he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported by A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Huzefa Ahmadi, said the way the new waqf law was drafted, it would allow govt to take over 'waqf by user' properties, which were not registered for decades because of fault of state govts, an eventuality which would result in punishing the community for no fault of its.Sibal said waqf was part of zakat, one of the 5 cardinal principles intrinsic to Islam. ""Waqf was purely religious, and no authority could interfere in this as the Constitution guarantees that every religious denomination has the absolute right to manage its religious institutions, which in this case is waqf,"" he added.Appearing for Rajasthan, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said 'waqf by user' was a term evolved by Privy Council and did not find mention in the 1923 Waqf Act. There was no dedication to Allah in case of 'waqf by user', he said. For ST Muslim organisation, Odisha, and a waqf board, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Maninder Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan supported Centre's stand.An advocate brought to the court's notice that in Tamil Nadu's Tiruchendurai, its 1,500-year-old Chola-era temple and the surrounding area had been declared waqf property by TN waqf board. She said the board's claim was met with resistance from villagers, who were unable to sell their land without the board's approval. She said the new law would curb such practices.","Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order.

Shattering all the age-old adages that equate long hours with high scores, Rudra said: “I studied for just two hours a day.”At first glance, Rudra’s story seems like one of prodigious intellect. But a deeper conversation reveals something more universal and profoundly human—a story of clarity, self-discipline, and purpose-driven learning, all while shouldering responsibilities that transcends far beyond textbooks.From training with NASA and ISRO under their Young Scientist and Citizen Science programmes to interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during government-led youth initiatives, Rudra’s resume reads like a page out of an adult professional’s LinkedIn profile.“I’ve worked with the Ministry of Youth Affairs for programmes like Viksit Bharat and Leaders Dialogue,” he said. He also holds certifications in astrophysics from IIT Kanpur and IIT Bhubaneswar, and serves as a Brand Ambassador for KIIT University, Russia.At such a young age, Singh has earmarked his name as the world record-holding author, certified by the World Record Committee (USA) as the youngest writer of juvenile fiction. He perceives this as part of a larger mission. “I’m advocating for youth welfare, teen upliftment, and mental health activism,” he says with the composure of someone twice his age.So what is the secret behind a teenager with international commitments and so many other feathers in his cap finding time to top the board exams?It isn’t something very typical, nor something entirely different, Rudra says—“just prioritisation and consistency.”He didn't believe in marathon study sessions. “Quality over quantity—I never went beyond two hours a day. But I made sure those two hours were fully focused. I broke large tasks into smaller ones and checked them off daily.”Rudra admits to feeling demotivated several times during the journey. “Sometimes I wondered if two hours were enough,” he said. “But then my inner voice reminded me—you’ve made a promise to yourself and to the people who believe in you. That belief became my fuel.”Rudra’s love for learning isn’t confined to math or science. “I’ve always loved social sciences,” he said. His interests in geopolitics and climate science saw him working with Oxford Academy and participating in the UN Climate Science Olympiad. He’s also been a member of the United Nations World Parliament.He allocated separate time for each subject. “I gave 45 minutes each to English, Hindi, and Social Science, and a bit more to Mathematics because solving problems requires practice,” Rudra says. He made sure he was gaining conceptual clarity in every subject.Like every success story, Rudra’s too has its cornerstone. “My family, my teachers, and the environment around me,” he says without a pause. “There were times when my parents believed in me more than I believed in myself.”He credits his online mentors at PhysicsWallah for helping him build strong conceptual clarity and appreciates the flexibility that digital learning offers. “When we study online, we must show our face to the teacher—not just out of respect, but to stay accountable to ourselves.”For someone his age, Rudra is remarkably self-aware. “Motivation is temporary, but when discipline becomes your motivation, it stays.”Rudra’s message to juniors is both enriching and grounded in experience. “People told me, ‘To top CBSE, you have to study more.’ I wanted to prove them wrong—that even with just two hours of focused study a day, it’s possible. And I did.”But here’s the catch: “It only works if you’re consistent, humble, and willing to learn from others. Don’t be overconfident. Learn from your mistakes—and better still, from others’.”He also doesn’t shy away from acknowledging the pressure that comes with expectations. “In some internal exams, I missed two or three questions. It shook me. But I adapted—reduced my time on social media, focused on weak spots, and reminded myself why I began.”Currently in Class 11, Rudra is focused on the PCM stream, but his ambitions are far broader than just cracking an entrance exam. Whether it’s working with ISRO again, continuing his writing, or influencing youth policies, Rudra sees learning as a lifelong journey, not a series of marksheets.And as he moves forward, the lesson he leaves behind is a compelling one—you don’t need long hours, you need deep intent.In an age where academic excellence is too often equated with burnout, Thakur Rudra Pratap Singh stands as proof that with purpose, even two hours a day is enough to chase the stars—and catch them.","Rudra Pratap Singh secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams.

Poll Will RCB make it to the top two after their recent defeat? Yes, they still have a chance No, it's unlikely

Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'

CAN RCB STILL MAKE THE TOP TWO?

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru squandered a golden opportunity to seal a top-two finish in the IPL 2025 standings, falling to a 42-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday. Chasing a daunting 232-run target—powered by Ishan Kishan’s scintillating unbeaten 94 off 48 balls—RCB needed a precise and aggressive approach with the bat.They found initial momentum through Phil Salt (62 off 32), Virat Kohli (43 off 25), and Jitesh Sharma (24 off 15), but the chase eventually fizzled out as the visitors were bowled out for 189. The loss marked RCB's first away defeat this season.RCB’s reply began brightly with Kohli and Salt racing to 80 in the first seven overs. Kohli, recently retired from Test cricket, led the early charge—hammering two fours off Harshal Patel and launching a swatted six off Eshan Malinga.However, his familiar weakness against left-arm spin resurfaced, as he was dismissed by 22-year-old Harsh Dubey—Ranji Trophy 2024-25’s leading wicket-taker for champions Vidarbha. This marked the 22nd time Kohli has fallen to left-arm spin in T20s.Salt, meanwhile, overcame a slow start—scoring 14 off his first 12 balls—to blast 48 runs in the next 20.A tennis-style forehand six off Nitish Kumar Reddy stood out for its flair. He reached his half-century in 27 balls but was soon hampered by cramps and dismissed by Pat Cummins.Despite consistent boundaries on a true pitch, RCB's innings unraveled in the latter half. Skipper Rajat Patidar (18) and Jitesh stitched a brisk 44-run stand for the fourth wicket, taking the side to 173/3 in the 16th over. But a calamitous mix-up resulted in Patidar being run out by a long margin. In the same over, Malinga dismissed Romario Shepherd for a golden duck, triggering a collapse.Jitesh, along with Tim David—who appeared to suffer a hamstring injury—departed within nine deliveries, and the fight drained out of RCB. They lost their final seven wickets for just 60 runs as Cummins (3/28) and Malinga (2/37) spearheaded SRH's bowling effort.The defeat sees RCB drop to third place with 17 points, behind Gujarat Titans (18) and Punjab Kings (17), with their net run rate taking a hit.The loss significantly complicates their top-two ambitions. Even a win in their final league game might not be enough—they now depend on other results to fall in their favour to secure a top-two finish.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru squandered a golden opportunity to seal a top-two finish in the IPL 2025 standings.

Poll Will RCB secure a top-two finish in IPL 2025? Yes No

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: Already assured of a playoff spot, Royal Challengers Bengaluru will look to secure a top-two finish in the league stage for the first time since 2016 when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in their IPL 2025 clash on Friday. The last time RCB finished in the top two was during the 2016 season, which saw them end up as runners-up.Currently second on the points table with 17 points from 12 matches, RCB can potentially seal a top-two berth with wins in their remaining two fixtures.Friday’s encounter, which was initially slated as a home game for RCB, had to be shifted due to the arrival of the monsoon season.Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra weighed in on the conditions expected at the new venue — the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow — and predicted a low-scoring contest.“Don’t expect a high-scoring game – Ekana won’t allow it. It’s a big ground, not Chinnaswamy. But it’ll still be a good contest. Don’t count out SRH. That said, the dice is loaded in favor of the team Virat Kohli plays for,” Chopra said on the JioHotstar Network.He further shared his thoughts on the playoff race. “A change is coming. RCB vs PBKS – I think one of them drops a game. MI vs PBKS is also crucial. Don’t rule out SRH – they beat LSG and have game-changers.One big innings, like Marsh’s today, can shake things up. I won’t be surprised if the top four look completely different,” he said.RCB’s form has been bolstered by the outstanding run of Virat Kohli, who has struck seven half-centuries in 11 innings, providing consistent starts at the top.The team was riding a four-match winning streak before the league was disrupted due to the India-Pakistan military conflict. However, their return match after a 20-day hiatus was washed out, halting their momentum. It remains to be seen if they can recapture the rhythm and intensity that marked their pre-break performances.Chasing a long-awaited IPL title, RCB are enjoying one of their most consistent seasons in recent years.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru will look to secure a top-two finish in the league stage for the first time since 2016.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Would Do It

Why the Warriors Would Consider It

Theandare under pressure to make big moves this offseason. After disappointing playoff exits, both teams face tough decisions—and a surprising trade involvingcould be on the table.According to Colin Keane of Sporting News , the Warriors, led by Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler, fell short in the Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Their lack of depth and youth was exposed, signaling a need for fresh talent.Built on LeBron James and Luka Doncic, the Lakers also had defensive issues and lost to the Timberwolves in the first round. The front staff has been compelled to explore significant retooling due to their roster imbalance.Here’s the potential deal that could shake up both franchises: Draymond Green (4-time All-Star, defensive anchor)- Dalton Knecht (young sharpshooting wing)- Rui Hachimura (expiring contract)- 2031 first-round draft pick LeBron James , now 40, is still elite, but the Los Angeles Lakers must maximize their championship window.Draymond Green’s defensive versatility and playmaking would immediately elevate their roster.- Defensive Upgrade: Green’s ability to guard multiple positions fixes a major Lakers weakness.- Leadership: His vocal presence and playoff experience would bolster the locker room.- Win-Now Move: Knecht’s potential doesn’t align with the Lakers’ urgency to contend.As writer Colin Keane noted: ""Green would be heartbroken to trade in his Warriors uniform and go somewhere else, but his positive relationship with LeBron has been well-documented.""According to Colin, trading Draymond Green would be emotional, but the Golden State Warriors must plan for life after Curry.- Future Assets: Knecht and the 2031 pick offer long-term upside.- Financial Flexibility: Hachimura’s expiring deal clears future cap space.- Youth Movement: Green’s departure accelerates a rebuild around younger talent.While this specific trade might not be enough, the Warriors should keep an open mind if better offers emerge.Both teams are at a crossroads. The Los Angeles Lakers get a proven winner in Draymond Green, while the Golden State Warriors secure assets for the future. Whether this deal happens or not, one thing is clear: major changes are coming for these franchises.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit This trade scenario remains speculative, but it highlights the tough choices ahead for both teams.

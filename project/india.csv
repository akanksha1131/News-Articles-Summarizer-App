ALMHULT: After putting in over Rs 10,500 crore since 2018 in India, Swedish furniture retailer IKEA is planning a ""second wave"" of growth in India, focused on accelerated expansion backed by stronger local sourcing and logistics and a deeper omni-channel strategy, said Patrik Antoni, CEO, IKEA India.Discussing the challenges due to the US's tariff moves, Jesper Brodin, CEO of INGKA Group, the biggest franchisee of Inter IKEA, said the company will adapt to the new scenario. ""There's still significant uncertainty, and while IKEA has limited ability to influence outcomes, the focus is on preparing to adapt, given that its supply chain is far more regional and local than many assume,"" he said.Ikea plans to add four-to-six new customer touch-points in India every year, a significant step-up from its current pace of rolling out one store every year or two.The upcoming formats will be a mix of large-format flagship stores, such as those in Hyderabad, Navi Mumbai, and Bengaluru; new outlets in Noida and Gurugram; and smaller city-centre stores, planning studios, and online platforms.""The IKEA experience is no longer limited to a single visit to a large store - it's a combination of many touchpoints, more convenient and more accessible,"" Antoni added. Localisation will be central to IKEA's India strategy.The company plans to increase local sourcing from 30% today to 50% by 2030. With partnerships already in place with 45 suppliers, many of whom export globally, IKEA is also investing in a design centre to create products tailored for Indian homes, with an emphasis on sustainable and recycled materials, including Indian wood varieties.Antoni said India's growing role as a sourcing hub strengthens IKEA's ability to balance supply chain risks. ""Localisation and diversification are important for us. As global trade dynamics evolve, India's position becomes even more critical in ensuring affordability and resilience in our offering,"" he noted.Beyond retail, IKEA's India presence spans sourcing, a global capability centre, a digital hub supporting global teams, and Ingka Centres' two large shopping centres under construction in Noida and Gurugram.(The writer is in Almhult, Sweden, at the invitation of IKEA Group)",Ikea plans to add four-to-six new customer touch-points in India every year.

Poll Who do you think had the upper hand in the rivalry between Irfan Pathan and Shahid Afridi? Irfan Pathan Shahid Afridi It was evenly matched Not sure

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing Irfan Pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with Shahid Afridi , calling out the former Pakistan captain for resorting to personal attacks.Pathan, who enjoyed considerable success against Pakistan — with 67 wickets and 807 runs in Indo-Pak clashes — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking to Lallantop, the former India all-rounder recalled how the rivalry turned bitter after Afridi mocked his identity in an interview.“Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere walid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe,” Pathan revealed. “So whenever I had the ball in hand, I made sure I dismissed him. I have shown him 11 times who the real Pathan is — in big moments, in series deciders, and in the World Cup final.”Kaneria, Afridi’s former teammate, echoed Pathan’s claims in a scathing social media post. “Irfan @IrfanPathan bhai, you’re absolutely right.He always resorts to personal attacks — be it on someone’s family or their religion. Class and decency clearly aren’t his strengths,” Kaneria wrote while sharing the interview clip.Pathan also recalled off-field flashpoints, including a fiery mid-air spat during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’… Later, I told him, ‘He has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, he couldn’t reply.”For Pathan, Afridi’s taunts only served as fuel. “On the field, my performances were the perfect answer. I showed him who the real Pathan is.”Kaneria’s intervention has reignited an already fiery debate, bringing back to spotlight one of cricket’s most infamous rivalries.","Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has backed Irfan Pathan's claims about his rivalry with Shahid Afridi.

Poll Do you think India should focus more on high-tech solutions for national security today? Yes, technology is key for modern defense No, traditional strategies still matter

Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Lieutenant General Vinod G Khandare (retired), who was the principal advisor to the Ministry of Defence during Operation Sindoor , on Sunday said further escalating the recent Indo-Pak conflict by occupying the PoK would have given birth to a ""new monster' for India.""The ceasefire was announced by India after a request from Pakistan DGMO. The war is not a cheap solution, as it comes with heavy expenditure and creates a financial burden. We have to decide where we have to take our country, especially when we are dreaming of becoming a developed nation by 2047,"" he said, adding that we must consider what we are handing over to the next generation.While addressing a public event organised by NGO Gyanyajnah Foundation at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Khandare termed Pakistan a ""nonsensical"" country, to whom he said a befitting lesson was taught as per the principles of war. Khandare, who is the recipient of the Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Ati Vishisht Seva Medal among other honours, termed Pakistan a police state that often witnesses military rules and political anarchy.Calling Operation Sindoor a convergence between political desire and military action, Khandare lauded affordable, modern innovation in the country's warfare during the May Indo-Pak conflict.""We can adopt high-tech solutions where common sense is added.India fought a high-tech war during Operation Sindoor. Many people are unhappy with us and imposing tariffs,"" he said, in an indirect reference to US President Donald Trump's tariff on India.Referring to doubts cast by Pakistan over India's success during Operation Sindoor, Khandare said, ""We are not worried by their accusations, but feel pain when ‘champions' from our country raise suspicions.""Speaking on the occasion, former DRDO scientist Pralhada Ramarao said India must advance in modern warfare tactics, and steps to achieve it are being taken.""The development of modern warfare will also be beneficial for our industrial and economic growth. Unless our borders are safe and secure, nothing can be achieved,"" he said.","Lieutenant General Vinod G Khandare (retired) was the principal advisor to the Ministry of Defence during Operation Sindoor.

Stricter laws and enforcement Awareness and community support

NEW DELHI: A 13-year-old girl from north-west Delhi's Bharat Nagar, who left home following a dispute with her father, was rescued nearly a month later after being trafficked and forcibly married off in Uttar Pradesh.She boarded a train that took her to Meerut, where two men lured her with false promises and took her to Shamli.There, she was illegally married to a 40-year-old man. A fake Aadhaar card was used to show her age as 19 years.The girl's missed call to her grandmother eventually led to her rescue. Police have arrested three men in connection with the case.Police sources said the force got a complaint about a missing girl on July 22. Despite continuous effort by the family and the police, she could not be traced at first. A case was registered under Section 137 (kidnapping) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).""While we were searching for the girl, her family informed us that they had received a missed call from an unknown number. When they called back, a woman answered and said her daughter-in-law might have made the call, then abruptly disconnected it.The number provided by the family had one incorrect digit, and when a police team followed that lead to Mathura, it turned out to be false, a police source said. Later, after obtaining the correct phone number, the team traced the location to Shamli and rescued the girl from a home.Police later learned that the girl had left her home and taken a bus to a railway station and randomly boarded a train that led her to Meerut.While she was wandering in the station, she encountered a 20-year-old man, who promised to help her settle down. However, it was a trap. The man from Hapur, along with a 55-year-old associate from Meerut, took the girl to Shamli, where they forced her to marry a 40-year-old man on July 24 in exchange for Rs 15,000-20,000. They made a fake Aadhaar card to falsify her age as 19 years.Four days after the forced marriage, the girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by the 40-year-old man at his residence. Police are now investigating whether other minor girls — often from impoverished backgrounds — were similarly trafficked and forcibly married to older men.The duo, and the man who married the girl, have been booked under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including charges of human trafficking , exploitation of a trafficked person, and forgery of official documents.Additionally, provisions under Sections 6 and 21 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act as well as Sections 9 and 10 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, have been invoked against the trio.The arrests were carried out by a team from the Bharat Nagar police station.

NEW DELHI: ED has arrested Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.The arrest followed a police case registered in Mohali, with the probe agency conducting raids on Tuesday and Wednesday at multiple locations in Delhi and Mumbai, ED said in a press release.The agency said it found that Virk, who acted in movies and claims to be a cosmetologist, was in regular touch with Angarai Natarajan Sethuraman, a former director of Reliance Capital, which was part of the Anil Ambani group.The ED statement alleged Virk had been communicating with Sethuraman regarding illegal liaising work. It added that this was also confirmed during searches at the residence of Sethuraman, who was a prominent member of the business group's corporate affairs team in Delhi.When contacted, Sethuraman said, ""These allegations are entirely baseless"" and that he had no connection or involvement with Virk or any transactions related to her.In a release, ED said, ""Besides, diversion of funds for personal benefit has been unearthed during course of search. In 2018, public money of Rs 18 crore approx belonging to Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd was disbursed to Sethuraman by flouting prudent lending norms.The funds were lent under terms that allowed deferment of principal as well as interest, with multiple waivers granted & no due diligence conducted. Besides, home loan of Rs 22 crore was provided by Reliance Capital Limited by violating the prudential norms. Large part of these loans are seen to have been eventually siphoned off and remained unpaid.""Sethuraman said that the home loan he received from Reliance Capital was granted following due process and was secured by the property offered as collateral.Following her arrest, Virk was produced before a special court here on Wednesday, which remanded her to ED custody till Aug 14. Virk's arrest came after searches conducted by the agency in Delhi and Mumbai on her premises and those of her close associates,She is accused of impersonating officers of law enforcement agencies, duping individuals, and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud against complainant Jasneet Kaur, under the pretext of investment in a film project. The main accused in the fraud, Amit Gupta alias Nageshwar Gupta, was declared a proclaimed offender in Oct 2024.The agency claimed during its searches, it seized ""incriminating documents"" and records, and statements of key persons and associates, including Farrukh Ali, were recorded. ED said its current searches were part of an ongoing investigation into charges against Virk and her associates, who are alleged to have ""exerted undue influence through misrepresentation and defrauded individuals by soliciting money under false promises"".""Virk has acquired immovable property in her name by making false promises and cheating. She claims to be owner of hyboocare.com, a website purportedly selling FDA-approved beauty products. However, the products listed on the site have been found to be non-existent,"" the agency said. It added that its probe revealed that the website floated by Virk lacked basics, such as user registration options. Scrutiny of the website uncovered minimal social media engagement, an inactive WhatsApp contact number, and absence of transparent organisational details, all of which reinforce suspicion of non-genuine commercial activity, ED said.","Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands.

'I'm In Space, Can't Reach Me': Minister Quips As Oppn Interrupts Speech On Space Achievement

Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025

Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025

Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025

NEW DELHI: The government will on Wednesday introduce three bills in Parliament to provide a legal framework for the removal of prime minister, a Union minister, chief minister, or a minister in a state/Union territory if they are arrested or detained on serious criminal charges.According to PTI, the proposed legislations are: Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025; Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025; and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025.Union home minister Amit Shah will also move a motion in the Lok Sabha to refer these bills to a joint committee of Parliament.The Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, currently has no provision for the removal of a chief minister or minister if arrested or detained for serious criminal charges. The proposed bill would amend Section 45 of the Act to address this gap.The Constitution lacks provisions for the removal of prime minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, or state/Delhi government ministers if arrested and detained on such charges. The bill seeks to amend Articles 75, 164, and 239AA to create this framework.The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, does not provide for the removal of the UT's chief minister or minister detained on serious criminal charges. The proposed bill would therefore amend Section 54 of the Act seeks to address this.","The government will introduce three bills in Parliament on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday called for a mass campaign to highlight that Jawaharlal Nehru , India's first PM, had compromised the interests of the country and its farmers to make big concessions to Pakistan over Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), without taking either his Cabinet or Parliament into confidence, only to ""burnish his image"".At the NDA parliamentary party meeting for the felicitation of the alliance's VP candidate, CP Radhakrishnan, the PM told MPs to awaken the masses about the ""betrayal"" of India's interests by Nehru and how his govt had kept the treaty in abeyance.Modi, according to sources, said that India's first PM had allowed over 80% of the river's waters to be used by Pakistan, betraying the interests of Indian farmers, and it was only later that he admitted his mistake in agreeing to terms that brought no benefit to India.""Nehru partitioned the country once, and then again. Under Indus Waters Treaty, 80% of the water was given to Pakistan. Later, through his secretary, Nehru admitted his mistake, saying that it brought no benefit,"" sources quoted PM as saying at the NDA meeting.This was in contrast to Nehru's earlier defence of IWT, when he had responded to the criticism of the treaty in a parliamentary debate by, among others, BJP veteran Atal Behari Vajpayee, by saying that so much hue and cry was being raised over a few ""buckets"" of water"", Modi said, recalling that it was on a par with how the first PM laughed off the annexation of Aksai Chin by China with his remark that ""not a blade of grass grows there"".Nehru later admitted to his colleague that he had believed Indus Waters Treaty would help resolve other issues with Pakistan, but that did not happen, Modi is said to have noted at the meeting.On Aug 14, India rejected the recent award issued by the Hague-based Court of Arbitration under IWT, citing the court's lack of jurisdiction, legitimacy, and competence.Following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, in which 26 people were killed, India had, in an exercise of its rights as a sovereign nation under international law, placed IWT in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.IWT was signed in 1960, following nine years of negotiations between India and Pakistan, with assistance of World Bank, which was also a signatory. The treaty allocated the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan and the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) to India.","PM Narendra Modi called for a mass campaign to highlight that Jawaharlal Nehru had compromised the interests of the country and its farmers to make big concessions to Pakistan over Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) Modi said Nehru allowed over 80% of the river's waters to be used by Pakistan, betraying Indian farmers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123397177,imgsize-875773,width-400,resizemode-4/123397177.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The recent Sino-Indian detente seemed set for a significant step forward with PM Narendra Modi saying Tuesday that bilateral ties have made ""positive and steady"" progress guided by respect for each other's interests and sensitivities, and accepting President Xi Jinping's official invitation to visit China for the SCO summit.The invitation along with a message from Xi was delivered to Modi by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who called on the PM after his meeting with NSA Ajit Doval for the Special Representatives' talks on the boundary question. Recalling his meeting with Xi in Kazan in Oct, which opened the doors for normalisation of the relationship after an intense military standoff, Modi said he was looking forward to meeting the Chinese president on the margins of Eurasian bl-oc summit in Tianjin on Sept 1.""Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,"" said Modi in a post on X after the meeting with Wang.According to an Indian readout, Modi also emphasised the importance of maintaining peace on the border, and reiterated India's commitment to a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question.This was underlined by Doval in his meeting with Wang in which they discussed issues related to de-escalation, delimitation and boundary affairs.

Reddy as judge protected Constitution: Oppn

NEW DELHI: Dubbing the vice-presidential poll as an ""ideological battle"" to counter the assault on constitutional values, the joint opposition announced Tuesday former Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy as its candidate to take on NDA's C P Radhakrishnan, underlining that Reddy is a ""consistent and courageous champion of social, economic and political justice"".The opposition, after a meeting at the residence of Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , announced Reddy's candidature to end the suspense. ""Reddy... fully reflects the values that shaped our country's freedom movement so profoundly and the values on which our country's Constitution and democracy have been anchored.""All the values on which our Constitution has been anchored are under assault and, therefore, our collective and determined resolve to fight this election, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge read out from a joint statement, adding, ""B Sudershan Reddy is a pro-poor man, and in many of his judgments... he also protected the Constitution and fundamental rights."" Reddy was welcomed at Delhi airport by an opposition delegation in the evening. Opposition MPs will meet in Parliament's Central Hall Wednesday, while Reddy will file his nomination on Thursday.Source said at the meeting attended by K C Venugopal, Sharad Pawar (NCP-SP), M A Baby (CPM), Derek O'Brien (TMC), Kanimozhi (DMK), Sandosh Kumar (CPI), Dharmendra Yadav (SP), N K Premachandran (RSP), Sanjay Raut (Sena UBT), Rajaram Singh (CPI-ML) among others, Kharge merely announced the candidate's name, which was finalised during the discussions with allies through interlocutors Kharge, Venugopal and Jairam Ramesh late on Monday.The meeting on Monday remained inconclusive after DMK's nominee Mylswami Annadurai was objected to by TMC, which argued that the VP polls could not become a local Tamil Nadu affair, alluding to BJP's choice of C P Radhakrishnan. DMK did not press for it, sources said, in the interest of unity.But since the Trinamool brass was insistent on a non-political person, Congress is said to have recommended Reddy citing his judicial past and his strong social justice credentials. Sources said, none of the parties took a hard line on any issue to ensure that the rare unity in the anti-BJP axis was not broken. Kharge said, ""Whenever democracy and the Constitution are under attack, opposition parties unite to fight against it. ""CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said Reddy's nomination is an assertion that ""defence of the Constitution and democratic values is non-negotiable"", underlining Reddy is ""an eminent jurist whose record in upholding human rights and civil liberties is impeccable"".AICC data analytics department chairman Praveen Chakravarty posted photographs of working with Reddy, who was chairman of the expert group on Telangana caste survey that concluded recently.The opposition choice is also a political trap for Andhra-Telangana parties aligned with BJP, as opposition will try to embarrass YSRCP and TDP who are supporting Radhakrishnan. At the same time, BJP's Telangana MPs will have to manage a tightrope as ""Reddy is a known name in the state"". It is the same issue of optics that BJP through Radhakrishnan is seeking to foist on DMK, which is in the opposition camp.","Former Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy to take on NDA's C P Radhakrishnan.

Twenty proposers and as many supporters are expected to join him when he does so. Sources said the documentation work for his nomination was completed on Tuesday.After felicitating Radhakrishnan with a shawl, Modi praised his simple lifestyle and dedication to public service, noting cryptically, ""He might have a lot of interest in sports, but he does not play games in politics"".Like Modi, Radhakrishnan, a two-time former Lok Sabha MP from Coimbatore and former Tamil Nadu BJP president, was an RSS functionary before joining Jana Sangh and later BJP.Modi's remarks on Radhakrishnan's interest in sports and political integrity reminded political circles of Jagdeep Dhankhar, who resigned as vice president on July 21 amid indications of strained ties with the governing party.Modi lauded Radhakrishnan's 40 years of public service and appealed for his unanimous election.However, opposition later announced the name of former Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy as its candidate, ensuring a vice-presidential election on Sept 9.Modi's speech covered various issues, including S&P Global Ratings' recent upgrade of India's long-term sovereign credit rating, which, he said, highlights the robust condition of the country's economy and will attract more investment.He said after his Independence Day speech, in which he announced next-generation reforms and GST rate simplification, he was told the stock market will respond positively. Indeed, Sensex has rallied for two consecutive days following the three-day holiday for I-Day and the weekend.Modi, confident of India's economic outlook despite a 50% tariff imposed by US, highlighted that Delhi international airport is among the world's busiest and India's forex reserves remain high.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told the media that the governing alliance warmly welcomed Radhakrishnan's introduction by PM Modi at the meeting.

3 statute amendment bills today

Ministers facing

criminal charges

hinder good governance, says Shah

NEW DELHI: In a significant move, home minister Amit Shah will on Wednesday move a set of three bills providing for mandatory resignation or removal of the Prime Minister, chief ministers and ministers at the Centre and in states/UTs, if they have spent 30 consecutive days under arrest or detention, on an allegation of committing offences punishable with imprisonment extending to five years or more.However, nothing will prevent such PM, CMs or ministers from being subsequently appointed to the same office by President or governor, upon their release from custody.The timing of the amendments, two days before the end of Parliament's Monsoon session, and their implications caught political circles by surprise. The Representation of the People's Act, 1951 provides for the disqualification of members of state legislatures and Parliament if they are convicted with a sentence of two years or more. Convictions for serious offences such as corruption and drug trafficking result in disqualification irrespective of the duration of the sentence.There was so far no bar on ministers holding on to their offices after their arrests: something that was justified on the ground that no one deserves to be punished until proven guilty. Until a few years ago, ministers and CMs facing arrests, resigned. But the convention was of late followed more in breach with several ministers continuing in their posts after their arrests.The SC recently sought to reinstate the practice by forcing Tamil Nadu minister Senthil Balaji to step down.Shah, in the statement of objects and reasons of the bills, says the elected representatives, who represent hopes and aspirations of the people, are expected to act only in public interest and have character and conduct that is beyond any ray of suspicion.A minister, who is facing allegations of serious criminal offences, arrested and detained in custody, may thwart or hinder the canons of constitutional morality and principles of good governance and eventually diminish the constitutional trust reposed by people in him, Union minister Amit Shah said. The bills may be sent to a parliamentary panel for detailed scrutiny of provisions.The Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill states the PM, if under arrest or detention for 30 days on allegation of committing an offence punishable with jail term that may extend to five years or more, shall tender his resignation by the 31st day. ""If he does not tender his resignation, he shall cease to be PM with effect from the day falling thereafter,"" it adds.The same provisions will apply in case of a state or UT CM - the latter covered by two separate bills, Govt of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Act, 2025 - arrested for a straight 30 days for an offence carrying a prison sentence of five years or more.Even the ministers in the Council of States at Centre and in states/UTs will be bound by the same provisions. While a Union minister shall be removed from office by the President on advice of the PM, state or UT ministers shall be removed by the governor on advice of the CM.In recent past, then Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had refused to resign after he was arrested in a liquor 'scam' case and spent several months in jail. It was only after he was let out on bail that he stepped down and named Atishi as CM.","Home minister Amit Shah will on Wednesday move a set of three bills providing for mandatory resignation or removal of the Prime Minister, chief ministers and ministers at the Centre and in states/UTs.

project

KOCHI: The year M A Abdullah Maulavi was born marked the dawn of the Roaring Twenties, a decade of rapid tech transformation. Little did the now 105-year-old Kerala native know that it would take him another century and more to find his tech mojo as a ""fully digi-literate"" person able to use a smartphone.""I used to have keypad phones. With training from the panchayat, I can now access internet on a smartphone, keep myself abreast of news,"" Abdullah told TOI.The centenarian is among 22 lakh Keralites to have undergone training under state's Digi Keralam project, meant to achieve 100% digital literacy - the second such landmark since communist-governed Kerala became India's first fully literate state in 1991.For Abdullah, a resident of Odakkali in Ernakulam district's Perumbavoor, the pandemic was the catalyst for change. His son Faisal Ali recalls seeing his father get increasingly restless during the lockdown as the newspapers stopped coming. ""He would watch news channels on our phones, but didn't relish having to depend on others,"" Faisal said. ""Last year, when Digi Keralam volunteers asked if he was interested in becoming digitally literate, my father grabbed the opportunity. He didn't want to be left behind.""It helped that Abdullah, a religious scholar, has been a learner all his life. He is fluent in Arabic, Urdu, English and Hindi, besides Malayalam.

Cabinet okays bill that seeks to ban ‘online money game',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-okays-bill-that-seeks-to-ban-online-money-game/articleshow/123396077.cms,"2 years' jail, ₹50L fine likely for those advertising online games

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Tuesday approved a bill that seeks to ban ""online money game"", where users pay a fee or deposit money, proposing a maximum three years in jail or fine of up to Rs 1 crore for those involved in offering, encouraging or inducing players to participate, which also extends to banks facilitating these transactions.At the same time, Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, which will be introduced in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, seeks to promote e-sports and online social games where no money is involved.A regulator body is planned to oversee the functioning of the sector, sources told TOI. The proposed legislation defines ""online money game"" as an online game played by a user by paying fees, depositing money or other stakes in expectation of winning.Online social games have been defined as those that don't involve exchange of money, although users may be allowed to pay a subscription or one-time access fee.Govt has proposed the new law considering unregulated online money gaming platforms pose threats to national and economic security as they use digital wallets and cryptocurrencies for money laundering and illicit money transfer, cross-border data flows without compliance of data protection law, sources said.Moreover, offshore entities are seen to be circumventing tax and legal obligations.The proposed legislation also assumes significance as online money gaming poses serious concerns, including addiction among children and youth, mental health issues, financial losses leading to suicides and lack of uniform regulation across states. Law enforcing agencies face problems in tracking and regulating these platforms, particularly those hosted or operated from outside India.Sources said the govt proposes penalties of up to two years in jail or with a maximum fine of Rs 50 lakh or both for any entity advertising such games in media. For those offering online money games and banks engaged in transactions face violations of the proposed law will be ""cognisable and non-bailable"" offences. Every subsequent violation after conviction would attract penalties of at least three years' jail and fine of Rs 10-20 lakh. In the case of advertisers, such penalties would be 2-3 years in jail and fine of Rs 5-10 lakh.The bill proposes to hold senior executives of the companies liable, if it's established that the offences have been committed with the consent or connivance or due to their neglect.It also proposes blocking of platforms and money gaming services, if the entities or individuals fail to comply with the law.According to the proposal, the bill seeks to encourage Indian startups to build culturally relevant content, reduce dependence on foreign platforms and promote self-reliance in the digital gaming ecosystem.","Cabinet approves bill that seeks to ban ""online money game"", where users pay a fee or deposit money.

Opinion given by a

Constitution bench

of SC is binding on all, Mehta tells court

NEW DELHI: Keeping aside objections of Kerala and Tamil Nadu govts on the maintainability of the Presidential reference, Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would give its opinion on the President's 14 queries if it finds these raising important questions of law on SC's power to fix timelines for her and governors in granting, withholding or refusing assent to bills passed by assemblies.After hearing senior advocates K K Venugopal for Kerala and A M Singhvi for TN, a five-judge bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar asked, ""Are you really serious in raising preliminary objections?""CJI said, ""We are not deciding the validity of the (April 8) Tamil Nadu judgment (regarding its governor's role on bills). We are only deciding Presidential reference and will be giving an advisory opinion."" Kant said, ""We will first decide whether a question of law of public importance has been raised in the reference.""Singhvi said SC cannot overturn the two-judge bench's April 8 judgment in the Tamil Nadu case through an advisory opinion and that if the opinion expresses a view contrary to that expressed in the Tamil Nadu case, then there would be two sets of constitutional laws - one for TN on the governor's role on bills and the opinion applicable to all other states.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta cited a few judgments to argue that the opinion given by a Constitution bench of SC is binding on all and can even overturn views expressed by a bench on similar issues.Both AG R Venkataramani and Mehta, supported by senior advocates Harish N Salve, N K Kaul and Maninder Singh, argued in support of the Presidential reference and said in the light of the two-judge bench's judgment, but without referring to the facts of that case, the President felt an authoritative pronouncement from SC was needed given that there had been a series of disjointed pronouncements on the core issue.Venkatramani's arguments outlined the Centre's unease over SC, through its April 8 judgment, foraying into the legislative domain and amending constitutional provisions on the roles of governors (Article 200) and the President (Article 201) in relation to their power to give or deny assent to bills passed by legislatures, and said the two-judge bench should have referred the constitutional issues to a five-judge bench as mandated by Article 145(3) of the Constitution and not ventured to decide them.By prescribing timelines, ""SC looked upon the President as an ordinary statutory authority and asked her to give assent to a bill within a specified time without examining whether the bill is unconstitutional, against the national policy framed by the Union govt or against the national interest,"" the AG said.Venkataramani also faulted SC using its exclusive powers under Article 142 to mandate the President to seek advisory opinion of the court under Article 143 whenever she had doubts about constitutionality of a bill. ""SC robbed the highest constitutional authority of the power to think, and decide the legality or constitutionality of a bill,"" he said, adding that another unthinkable part of the SC judgment was the use of Article 142 powers to grant 'deemed assent' to bills.Without referring to facts of the case where the TN governor had long delayed granting assent to bills, the bench asked the AG, ""If the facts of a case on egregious delay (on the governor's part) comes for adjudication before a constitution bench of SC, can you suggest what should be the court's approach?"" The AG said even if a constitution bench can examine the issues, under no circumstance could the court either amend the Constitution or assume the role constitutionally assigned to the governor to grant ""deemed assent"" to bills. ""If this is permissible, then for every small mistake or delay, the states would approach SC for grant of deemed assent.""Mehta supplemented the AG's arguments and said the CJI-led five-judge bench could keep the TN facts aside and give an ideal interpretation of Articles 200 and 201.""Some mistakes committed by a governor or a minister or anyone in a given case should not be the guiding factor for interpreting constitutional provisions,"" he said.The SG will continue his arguments on Wednesday.",Supreme Court will give its opinion on the President's 14 queries if it finds these raising important questions of law. Kerala and Tamil Nadu govts raised objections on the maintainability of the Presidential reference. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta cited a few judgments to argue that the opinion given by a Constitution bench of SC is binding on all.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123396026,imgsize-10502,width-400,resizemode-4/123396026.jpg"

INDIA bloc represents 60% of the country's population and talks of ideals of the Constitution. As a lawyer, govt advocate, as a judge of HC and then CJ of an HC and SC judge, I had been doing the same.""""No doubt, NDA has a majority. But in this election, no political party can issue a whip to its MPs.

""What NDA group would do while seeking support for their candidate is not in my hands.

IMPHAL: Beoncy Laishram, who broke the glass ceiling by becoming the Northeast's first transgender doctor, won another landmark battle Tuesday when Manipur high court acknowledged her right to have all academic certificates reissued to reflect her ""female"" name and gender. The court directed the authorities to issue the certificates Beoncy had applied for within a month of the order.Beoncy, born male and known as Boboi Laishram before undergoing gender reassignment surgery in Oct 2019, got her Aadhaar, voter ID and PAN updated by producing a transgender certificate issued by the district magistrate of Imphal West.She approached the high court in Feb 2024 after the Board of Secondary Education Manipur, Council of Higher Secondary Education Manipur, Manipur University and Manipur Medical Council refused to change her name and gender in their records. Beoncy's counsel Jayna Kothari cited sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, while arguing for her right to have the requisite modifications made in her academic certificates. The law applies to all official documents, including one's birth certificate.The court ruled that the relevant provisions outlined in sections 6 and 7 of the Act must be incorporated into all laws, rules and regulations governing establishments within Manipur, as defined under Section 2(b) of the legislation.For Beoncy, the judgment comes as ""a relief"" that she can now build on her career without having to worry about identity confusion. ""I have been thinking of specialising in surgery or gynaecology someday. I was scared I would be made to stay in a boys' hostel just because my academic records say I am a male,"" she said.","Beoncy Laishram is the Northeast's first transgender doctor.

More than 1.07 crore people sterilised during Emergency: Govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/more-than-1-07-crore-people-sterilised-during-emergency-govt/articleshow/123395691.cms,"Indira Gandhi and son Sanjay in a file photo from 1977

NEW DELHI: Over 1.07 crore people were sterilised during the National Emergency from 1975 to 1977, exceeding the ""targets"" set by the then Indira Gandhi govt by 60%, as per the findings of the Justice J C Shah Commission shared by the Union home ministry with Lok Sabha on Tuesday.The Justice Shah commission had inquired into the excesses, malpractices and misdeeds during the Emergency, including the use of force in implementation of the family planning programme. Its report was tabled in Parliament on Aug 31, 1978. Junior home minister Nityanand Rai, in a reply to a question, shared the Shah panel reported 548 complaints of sterilisation of unmarried people and 1,774 deaths linked to sterilisation.As per the Shah commission, the govt of India had set annual targets for the states and Union Territories for the sterilisation programme for 1975-76 and 1976-77. While the states exceeded the 1975-76 target of 24.8 lakh sterilisations by 5.6% (having sterilised 26.2 lakh people), the number of actual sterilisations in 1976-77 (81.3 lakh) exceeded the target(42.5 lakh) by a whopping 91%.Maharashtra saw the most sterilisations during the Emergency period (14.4 lakh), followed by Madhya Pradesh (11.1 lakh), Bengal (10.8 lakh) and UP (9.65 lakh).As per Shah commission report seen by TOI, the voluntary nature of family planning programme appeared to have undergone a sudden change during the Emergency period. A note sent by then Union health minister Karan Singh to Indira Gandhi on Oct 10, 1975, on the 'crash programme to intensify family planning', spoke of ""introduction of some element of compulsion in the larger national interest"".""This can be done by enforcing a judicious and carefully selected mixture of incentives and disincentives. The present Emergency...(has) provided an appropriate atmosphere for tackling the problem,"" Singh added.On Jan 22, 1976, PM Indira Gandhi spoke of ""bringing down birth rate speedily"" with ""steps that may be described as drastic"".As per the Shah panel, the health ministry's approach to family planning during the Emergency became focused on a single method: sterilisation. While the achievement of sterilisation targets was ""107%"" and 190% in 1975-76 and 1976-77, the performance with regard to other methods fell far short of the targets.Strangely, some states went out of their way to raise the 1976-77 targets beyond those set by the govt of India. For instance, UP revised the target to 15 lakh from 4 lakh, though it could achieve only 8.4 lakh sterilisations. Similarly, Maharashtra revised the target from 5.6 lakh to 12 lakh but ended up doing 8.3 lakh sterilisations. West Bengal revised the 3.9-lakh target set by Centre to 11 lakh, only to achieve 8.8 lakh sterilisations in 1976-77.","Over 1.07 crore people were sterilised during the National Emergency from 1975 to 1977.

BENGALURU: After decades of deliberations, agitations and commissions, Congress govt in Karnataka on Tuesday decided to rework the internal reservation structure for Scheduled Castes (SCs).An official announcement on this will be made during the ongoing assembly session on Wednesday.According to some cabinet ministers, the Justice Nagamohan Das Commission, which had studied internal reservation among the 101 castes within the SC community, originally suggested five categories to ensure a well-balanced representation. However, govt chose to simplify the matrix and restrict it to three categories only.According to the new framework, Madigas will receive 6% allocation, while Holeyas and Alemari castes will be eligible for 6% reservation jointly. The third category comprising Bhovi, Lambhani and others will be eligible for 5% reservation.Backward classes welfare minister Shivaraj Tangadagi described the cabinet decision as one that carries consensus and acceptance across communities. Law and parliamentary affairs minister H K Patil, who briefed the media after the cabinet meeting, called it a landmark moment in social justice policymaking.""The cabinet meeting came out with a fruitful decision, which makes all ministers such as K H Muniyappa, H C Mahadevappa, and G Parameshwara happy,"" he said.Former minister H Anjaneya, a long-time advocate for greater representation of the Madiga community, hailed the decision as historic. ""I welcome the state gov's decision to grant a 6% reservation to the Madiga community,"" he said, adding: ""Community members had anticipated a 7% reservation. However, they managed to secure 6%. This is a victory for the community's demand that persisted for the last 30 years.""The Madiga community, which has been at the forefront demanding equitable distribution within the SC quota, has historically argued that benefits of reservation were cornered disproportionately by a handful of castes.","Congress govt in Karnataka rework internal reservation structure for Scheduled Castes.

NEW DELHI: The central government has said that it intends to control street dog population only through its established animal birth control (ABC) programme that mandates civic bodies to catch strays and release them back to their original locations post-sterilisation.The ABC rules, framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, align with global standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health and promote the ""Capture-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release method"" for humane and effective stray dog population management, Union minister of state for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, SP Singh Baghel, informed Parliament on Tuesday.The government's stand validates the viewpoint of protesting animal rights activists who have described the Supreme Court's Aug 11 order to remove all Delhi-NCR stray dogs to shelters in far-off places as ""inhumane, unscientific"" and ""one that violates the established ABC rules"".Though the issue of stray dogs falls under the purview of state governments, the minister, in a written reply to Lok Sabha, said, ""To ensure humane and effective dog population management, the central government has framed the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023.""""Under the Rules, local bodies are responsible for implementing sterilisation and vaccination programmes in collaboration with animal welfare organisations,"" he said.In fact, only last month, the minister said, ""...the Secretaries of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, and Ministry of Panchayati Raj jointly issued an advisory reiterating that sterilisation of stray dogs is central to dog population management.""""The advisory urged urban local bodies to establish Animal Birth Control units and undertake large-scale sterilisation programmes, covering at least 70% of stray dogs,"" he said in his written reply to Lok Sabha.Moreover, to bolster its ABC efforts, the government has revised the existing Scheme for Birth Control and Immunisation of stray dogs and stray cats, which is being implemented through the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) from the current financial year.Under this scheme, for sterilisation, the government has earmarked financial assistance of up to ₹800 per dog and ₹600 per cat for Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCAs) and local bodies to conduct ABC programmes.""A one-time grant of ₹2 crore is provisioned for state-run veterinary hospitals to develop facilities such as surgical theatres, kennels, and recovery units,"" the minister told Lok Sabha. Also, financial support of up to ₹15L and ₹27L for small and large animal shelters will be made available to urban local bodies and recognised animal welfare organisations.In addition, states will be given financial support for the procurement of anti-rabies vaccines, the minister told Parliament.","The government's stand validates the viewpoint of protesting animal rights activists.

NEW DELHI: Observing that it was not a crime to love and teenagers falling in love should not be treated as criminals and sent behind bars, Supreme Court on Tuesday stressed the need to protect mutual romantic relations between adolescents instead of criminalising them under Pocso Act At a time when the Centre is strongly objecting to the idea of reducing the age of consent from 18 to 16 years, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said genuine romantic relations should be on a different footing.""We are facing situations of minors falling in love and they even run away... It is a harsh reality. Same law (Pocso) should not be applied in such cases. Do not treat the minors as normal criminals in case of genuine romantic relations. Social reality should be kept in mind,"" the bench said while hearing a batch of petitions filed by NCPCR and NCW challenging various HC orders providing protection to minors who had eloped.The court was also hearing a plea by Bachpan Bachao Andolan challenging Tamil Nadu govt's circular to police to not make ""hasty"" arrests under the Pocso Act in cases involving ""love affairs and marriages"" and stating that arrests under Pocso should be made only after permission from an SP-level officer.Senior advocate H S Phulka said the circular was prone to misuse in case of adults getting into physical relations with minors. The bench, however, said it was for the police to apply its mind on a case-to-case basis.""Nowadays, boys and girls go to the same educational institutions and develop feelings for each other. It is a reality. Can you say that it's a crime to love and the minors should face rape charges... There are romantic cases where teenagers on the verge of majority run away... don't read such as criminal cases. It is more traumatic for girls who get separated from boys and see them going to jail...,"" the bench said. The court added that parents of girls would often use Pocso to cover up an elopement.The bench said it was strange that bodies meant to protect the interests of children and women were assailing the protection given to minors by HCs. The court said they had no locus standi to file appeals and asked them to take up cases with better causes. SC pointed out that if the court did not protect such a couple, they may be killed for ""honour"" by their families. ""If two minor children are protected by HC, how can NCPCR challenge such an order? It is strange that NCPCR, which is for protecting children, has challenged such an order,"" it said.","Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said genuine romantic relations should be on a different footing.

"Acquisition of another 97 Tejas, 6 AEW&C aircraft gets CCS nod",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/acquisition-of-another-97-tejas-6-aewc-aircraft-gets-ccs-nod/articleshow/123395422.cms,"New DELHI: India on Tuesday gave the final nod for the acquisition of another 97 indigenous Tejas fighter jets and six advanced airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft or “eyes in the sky”, collectively worth around Rs 85,500 crore, which will be crucial to tackle the collusive and `fused’ challenge from China-Pakistan in the years ahead.The PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved the around Rs 66,500 crore deal for the 97 “improved” Tejas Mark-1A fighters to be produced by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), which will add to the 83 such single-engine light combat aircraft already ordered from the defence PSU under a Rs 46,898 crore deal inked in Feb 2021, top sources told TOI.“The first two jets of the 83 ordered earlier are fully ready. The final weapons firing trials (including Astra air-to-air missiles) are slated for Sept. With the order for another 97 jets, HAL will be able to expand and stabilize its supply chains,” a source said.Faced with flak from IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh for the huge delays in deliveries, HAL has promised to progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains.The project for the six AEW&C aircraft, which will entail mounting active electronically scanned array antenna-based radars, electronic and signal intelligence systems on second-hand Airbus-321 planes bought earlier from Air India, in turn, will cost Rs 19,000 crore. “All six AEW&C aircraft will be delivered by 2033-34,” the source said.The timely induction of the 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters is needed to stem the rapid depletion in the number of IAF fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets), which will go down to its lowest-ever figure of 29 squadrons next month after retirement of the 36 old MiG-21s still in service.The IAF, incidentally, is authorized 42.5 combat squadrons. Pakistan now has 25 fighter squadrons, and is slated to get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets from China in the near future.China, of course, has more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India. In the AEW&C arena, which are required to boost surveillance capabilities along the borders as well as help direct friendly fighters during air combat with enemy jets, India lags far behind even Pakistan.The IAF currently has just three Netra AEW&C Mark-1 planes, with indigenous sensors mounted on Brazilian Embraer-145 jets for 240-degree radar coverage, and three Israeli `Phalcon’ radars mounted on Russian IL-76 aircraft.The new AEW&C project will involve the A-321 narrow-body aircraft first being “hardened and modified” in Spain and then being equipped with an antenna in the nose in addition to the main dorsal antenna to give 300-degree radar coverage. “The project, which was finalized earlier, has seen a cost escalation of around Rs 7,000 crore since a lot of modifications are required on the A-321s,” the source said.To make up numbers, the defence ministry in March also accorded the initial “acceptance of necessity” to a separate project for six Netra Mark-1A on Emb-145 jets, with more advanced technologies than the first three Mark-1 aircraft.On the Tejas front, IAF till now has got only 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010.The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, as well as weapons and radar integration issues are the main reasons for the delay in the Tejas Mark-1A fighters.","India on Tuesday gave the final nod for the acquisition of another 97 indigenous Tejas fighter jets and six advanced airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft.

NFL underdog Tyson Bagent shocks Chicago as the Bears suddenly boast the league's best quarterback duo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-underdog-tyson-bagent-shocks-chicago-as-the-bears-suddenly-boast-the-leagues-best-quarterback-duo/articleshow/123365228.cms,"Tyson Bagent turns preseason into statement night (Image credits: IG/X)

From small-school shepherd roots to stealing the show in Chicago

How Tyson Bagent made Ben Johnson’s new offense look effortless

From internet cult hero to Chicago’s most unexpected quarterback threat

What Tyson Bagent’s rise really means for the Bears’ future and the NFL

The Chicago Bears’ 38–0 preseason demolition of the Buffalo Bills was expected to be Caleb Williams’ coronation at Soldier Field. Instead, Tyson Bagent—the undrafted quarterback from Shepherd University—delivered 205 yards and a touchdown, turning a routine exhibition into a reminder that Chicago may have the NFL’s most intriguing quarterback depth.Two years ago, Bagent was an unknown rookie fighting for a roster spot. On Saturday, he ran Chicago’s offense with precision, extending drives and punishing Buffalo’s defense. His performance wasn’t just impressive—it was proof that small-school pedigree doesn’t limit NFL potential. In a sport obsessed with draft status, Bagent continues to rewrite the script.What separated Bagent was how comfortably he worked inside Ben Johnson’s new system. Quick reads, crisp timing, and fearless throws downfield kept the offense flowing. “He’s confident, he’s decisive, and he makes the offense click,” Johnson said. The trust from a first-year head coach signals that Bagent is more than an understudy—he’s a reliable driver of this scheme.Bagent’s value extends beyond preseason box scores. In a league where losing a starter can sink an entire season, the Bears have security others envy.“With Tyson, we know we’re in good hands if his number gets called,” receiver Olamide Zaccheaus said. That kind of assurance makes him one of the most valuable No. 2 quarterbacks in football.Last season, “Bagent Mania” felt like a quirky fan movement celebrating an underdog. Against Buffalo, it transformed into something more serious. His composure and accuracy suggest staying power, and that could spark debates about how central he might become to Chicago’s long-term plans. He is no longer just a novelty act; he is a problem defenses must prepare for.Preseason often gets dismissed as a tune-up, but for Bagent it feels like a turning point. His poise and production have made him one of the most intriguing storylines of August. For the Bears, it’s a luxury dilemma: Williams may be the franchise face, but Bagent has shown the spotlight in Chicago can’t belong to just one quarterback, reminding fans that competition breeds confidence and depth, and that even in exhibition football, moments like these can redefine careers and reshape a team's long-term vision.Suddenly, Chicago isn't watching a backup complete-they're watching a story of grit and belief unfold under the bright preseason lights.Also read: Joe Milton’s inaccuracy is silently wrecking Dallas Cowboys receivers’ roster chances","Tyson Bagent was an unknown rookie fighting for a roster spot two years ago.

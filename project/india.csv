Under the leadership of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami , prompt action is being ensured in cases of misconduct by government personnel. In line with this, the chairman of Uttarakhand peyjal nigam, Shailesh Bagauli, has suspended Sujeet Kumar Vikas, in-charge chief engineer (Kumaon), whose substantive post is superintending engineer, Uttarakhand peyjal nigam, Haldwani, with immediate effect for violation of the employee conduct code.As per the official order issued by the chairman of Uttarakhand peyjal nigam, a complaint was received from Sanjay Kumar, son of Chandrapal Singh, stating that he works on water supply projects on a contractual basis.

India tests nuclear-capable Agni-1 & Prithvi-2 ballistic missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-nuclear-capable-agni-1-prithvi-2-ballistic-missiles/articleshow/122720740.cms,"India test-fires Prithvi-II & Agni-1 ballistic missiles (ANI)

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday conducted successive tests of short-range nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, the Prithvi-2 and Agni-1, in what constitutes some strategic deterrence messaging to Pakistan soon after the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10.The Prithvi-2 (350-km strike range) and Agni-1 (700-km) missiles were launched from the integrated test range at Chandipur, off the Odisha coast, by the tri-service strategic forces command (SFC). “The launches validated all operational and technical parameters,” the defence ministry said in a brief statement on Thursday night.An official described the tests as “periodic routine trials” of already inducted missiles conducted by the SFC, which was established in 2003 to handle the country’s nuclear arsenal. But it’s possibly the first time that two such nuclear-capable missiles have been tested together on the same day.Both these missiles are Pakistan-specific, while the others like Agni-2 (2,000-km), Agni-3 (3,000-km) and the near ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) Agni-5 (over 5,000-km) are largely geared towards China.DRDO and the SFC have also been conducting “pre-induction night trials” of the new-generation Agni-Prime ballistic missile, which has a strike range from 1,000 to 2,000-km, which will gradually replace the Agni-1 and Agni-2 missiles in the country’s nuclear arsenal.The solid-fuelled Agni-Prime is the smallest and lightest among the entire Agni series of ballistic missiles and incorporates new propulsion systems and composite rocket motor casings as well as advanced navigation and guidance systems.The Agni-Prime, significantly, is also a canister-launch system like the Agni-V, which brings even the northernmost parts of China under its strike envelope, and the two together will add more teeth to India’s nuclear deterrence posture. Both these missiles are in the process of being inducted into the SFC, with new regiments being raised for them, as reported by TOI earlier.Canister-launch missiles - with the warheads already mated with the missiles - give the SFC the requisite operational flexibility to store them for long periods, swiftly transport them through rail or road when required, and fire them from wherever they want.The Agni-5 was also tested with multiple warheads (MIRVs or multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles) for the first time on March 11 last year. Once inducted in a few years more, this MIRVed missile will be capable of delivering three to four warheads at different targets separated by hundreds of kilometres.China, of course, is leagues ahead. It is adding around 100 nuclear warheads every year to its existing stockpile of 600 warheads, while deploying ICBMs like the DongFeng-5 and DF-41 with ranges over 12,000-km. India, in turn, has 180 warheads and Pakistan 170, as per the latest assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI).","The Prithvi-2 (350-km strike range) and Agni-1 (700-km) missiles were launched from the integrated test range at Chandipur, off the Odisha coast.

What is The Resistance Front (TRF)?



The United States on Thursday designated The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).The TRF -- the group responsible for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people.The US department of state, led by secretary Marco Rubio , said in a statement that TRF is a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy and front, and that it had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack.The statement said the group has also carried out multiple assaults on Indian security forces, including as recently as 2024.""Today, the Department of State is adding The Resistance Front (TRF) as a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).

Elusive warbler spotted in Ladakh after 46-year gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elusive-warbler-spotted-in-ladakh-after-46-year-gap/articleshow/122708065.cms,"Elusive warbler

TOI

At an elevation of 3,200 metres, Ladakh’s rugged mountain sweep in the backdrop, a group of five sat huddled and listened intently to the ‘click-clickclick’ captured in a recording. The insect-like call was proof that one of the most elusive bird species they had come looking for was there.Visual proof came soon enough, making July 15 the day when a conﬁrmed sighting of the long-billed bush warbler would be recorded after 46 years, in a thicket in Kargil’s Suru Valley.The last time the bird (Locustella Major) was seen was also in Ladakh in 1979, when a group of birders from Southampton University were on a tour (1977-80) to chronicle avian fauna. Between 1979 and now, one more sighting of the longbilled bush warbler was documented when ornithologist James Eaton spotted it in Naltar Valley of GilgitBaltistan in 2023.The current expedition by ﬁve birders – Harish Thangaraj, Lt Gen Bhupesh Goyal, Manjula Desai, Rigzin Nubu and Irfan Jeelani — was planned speciﬁcally to spot this warbler.Team leader Thangaraj toldthe group “has years and years of experience sighting birds” and “what we are now looking for are ‘lost birds’ – that were spotted decades ago but were never seen since”.This Feb, the group had made another expedition in search of the bird but failed to spot it. “We searched in Gurez and Tulail valleys at altitudes between 2,400m and 2,800m. But it yielded no results, possibly because of altitude mismatch,” Thangaraj said, referring to the Gilgit-Baltistan sighting, which was at a higher reach.After the unsuccessful attempt, the group stepped up research and got in touch with Eaton. It was the Malaysia-based American ornithologist who steered them on the right path – in this case, near terraced ﬁelds surrounded by rumex and gooseberry shrubs at Sankoo in Suru. “The bird was found in a willow amidst terraced ﬁelds. It’s the ﬁrst time it has been seen on a willow, which will now be added to its known habitats,” Thangaraj told TOI .At 3,200 metres, this is also the highest recorded altitude at which the bird has been seen. Classiﬁed as ‘near threatened’ by International Union for Conservation of Nature, long-billed bush warblers were commonly seen in Ladakh and GilgitBaltistan till the 1930s. In the decades since, birding expeditions were sparse. In 2015, Eaton wrote, birder Shashank Dalvi sighted two warblers in Suru, but it was too brief for him to take a picture. “Expansion of settlements combined with climate change, could be pushing the birds to go higher,” Thangaraj said.Pankaj Gupta, a Delhi Bird Society member who was not part of the expedition, said the “rediscovery” of the bird is “nothing short of extraordinary”. “It reminds us how much remains hidden in our fragmented landscapes, and how urgent it is to protect these last remaining pockets of wilderness,” Gupta said.","The long-billed bush warbler was last seen in Ladakh in 1979.

My rate vs your rate: Govt vs central banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-rate-vs-your-rate-govt-vs-central-banks/articleshow/122707532.cms,"Trump on powell

Trump dissing Fed chief Powell is new only to the extent that the former is rude. Plenty of govt bosses, in the West or in India, have had a go at chiefs of central banks. Govts like cheap money, it’s feel-good.

Central banks hate inflation. There lies the tension

‘CRAZY’, ‘LOCO’

INTERESTED PARTIES

NIXON WAS WORSE

INDEPENDENCE DAYS

Ex-US President Nixon

TUSSLE CONTINUES

Ex-RBI governors

Jerome Powell may still be a marked man. Trump now says he won’t sack him. But you never know with Trump. He called Powell “Too Late” for dithering in the face of the 2022 inflation surge. Also, “low IQ”, “very stupid”, “average mentally person”, and declared, “I think he’s doing a terrible job.” Yet, Trump is at a loss: “I do it every way in the book. I’m nasty. I’m nice. Nothing works.”Now, Trump’s aides are trying a pincer over the alleged $700mn cost overrun in the Fed building’s renovation that might let them pin Powell to the mat in his last year as Fed chair. Or not. Powell, after all, has been here before.When Trump picked Powell over Janet Yellen late in 2017, he was, in the President’s words: “strong, committed, smart”, someone who would provide the Fed “the leadership it needs in the years to come”.But six months into his first term, he was already out of favour.A non-economist — Powell’s a lawyer by training — he was expected to toe Trump’s line on interest rates. Basically, keep interest rates low to spur growth, boost stock prices, and ensure Trump’s re-election in 2020. Powell turned out to have a spine, and by Aug 2018 Trump was calling the Fed “crazy”, “loco”, “gone wild”. He told The Wall Street Journal: “(Powell) was supposed to be a low-interestrate guy. It’s turned out that he’s not. ”The crux of the Trump-Powell feud is the cost of money, or interest rates. Govts universally want money to be cheap, so that businesses don’t hesitate to borrow for expansion. Expanding businesses add jobs, GDP grows, stock markets zoom, and everybody lives happily ever after.However, cheap money can also drive up prices, or inflation, and when things cost more, people buy less, so businesses put off expansion. And if demand falls too much, jobs are lost, and everybody is miserable.So, central banks universally aim to keep price rise in check with interest rates. But because interest rates, unlike Schrodinger’s cat, can’t be in two states — high and low, in this case — at the same time, govts and central bankers with a spine must agree to disagree.History repeats itself. In 1969, Nixon picked Arthur Burns to head the Fed. Like Trump, he believed Burns would prove pliant, and just to be sure he told him: “I know there’s the myth of the autonomous Fed…” To ensure everyone else also got this, he declared at Burns’s swearing-in: “I respect his independence. However, I hope that, independently, he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.”Nixon wanted low rates with an eye on the 1972 election, and we know from the “Nixon tapes” that he told Burns in Oct 1971: “Liquidity problem (too much money in the system)... is just bullshit”. Burns obliged. His rate cut stimulated the economy in the short term and handed Nixon a landslide victory, but then caused an inflation problem that lasted a decade, and became the strongest argument for central bank independence (CBI).Central banks like RBI and the US Fed are a relatively recent development. Before WW-2, they were merely the lenders of last resort. After the war, setting interest rates became their job, but with plenty of govt interference. In India, RBI governor Benegal Rama Rau quit in 1957 after a face-off with finance minister T T Krishnamachari. During the Vietnam war, President Johnson summoned the Fed chair to his ranch and criticised the prevailing monetary policy.Even Milton Friedman, who coined the term ‘central bank independence’ in 1962, wasn’t in favour of all-powerful central banks. He wanted govt to set central bank objectives, and banks to attain them using policy instruments like interest rates — without further interference. CBI was important for central banks to function without fear of criticism from a man like Trump, especially since there’s a lag between policy implementation and results.Over a century from 1923, CBI has risen around the world. Trinity College professor Davide Romelli’s analysis shows 370 banking reforms across 155 countries — 279 of these increased CBI and 91 reduced it. Globally, the CBI index rose from 0.35 in the 1970s to 0.6 by 2020.That’s why Trump, when he brought “independent” govt agencies under his thumb with an executive order, made it clear that “This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.”Still, the old tussle for control over monetary policy continues. The Chidambaram-Subbarao standoff over interest rates in 2012, RBI governor Urjit Patel’s resignation in 2018, resignations of two Argentine central bank chiefs — Martin Redrado in 2010 and Juan Carlos Fabrega in 2014 (Luis Caputo’s 2018 resignation was under IMF pressure) — and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s choice of a “like-minded” central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, in 2013, are all examples of govt’s upper hand.But govt assertiveness over central banks takes a toll on stocks and bonds. For example, the S&P 500 dipped 2.4% when Trump called Powell a “major loser” in April. That’s why he can’t use a hammer to dislodge the Fed chief. What he can do is try to pry Powell off with a screwdriver, and that’s what he’s doing.","Jerome Powell may still be a marked man. Trump now says he won’t sack him. But you never know with Trump.

I can’t accept payment by UPI anymore,” Shankar, a shopkeeper in Horamavu told ET.According to vendors, lawyers and accountants, thousands of unregistered small businesses, including street food stalls, push carts and corner shops, have received GST notices. Some face demands running into lakhs of rupees.Advocate Vinay K Sreenivasa, joint secretary of the Federation of Bengaluru Street Vendors Associations, said many vendors fear harassment by GST officers and possible eviction by civic authorities, prompting them to switch to cash.Under the current GST framework, businesses supplying goods must register and pay GST if their annual turnover exceeds Rs 40 lakh. For service providers, the threshold is Rs 20 lakh.The commercial taxes department stated that notices were issued only in cases where UPI transaction data since 2021-22 indicated turnover levels that require GST registration. It said such businesses must register, disclose their taxable turnover, and pay the applicable tax.However, HD Arun Kumar, former additional commissioner of commercial taxes in Karnataka, said GST authorities cannot simply quote random figures as turnover. “Under the GST laws, the burden of proof is on officers. They must establish it before arriving at a tax demand, unlike in money laundering cases,” he said.Opposition BJP MLA S Suresh Kumar said he plans to write to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking his intervention.A former GST field official pointed out that not all UPI credits reflect business income. “Some of it would be informal loans or transfers from family and friends,” he said.“Bengaluru may emerge as a test case. If the GST authorities can net a good chunk of revenue by tapping unregistered vendors, other states too will take the cue as every state is desperate for funds,” said chartered accountant Sreenivasan Ramakrishnan of Sreeni & Associates.“Officials have zeroed in on chat vendors with high business in Mumbai. It's only a matter of time considering the huge potential tax base,” he told ET.Karnataka’s tax officials are under pressure to meet a collection target of Rs 1.20 lakh crore for 2025-26. CM Siddaramaiah is grappling with the twin demands of funding Rs 52,000 crore worth of welfare guarantees and responding to pressure from Congress MLAs seeking funds for infrastructure.","Bengaluru, once hailed as a tech capital, switching QR codes with physical currency.

"'Akbar brutal but tolerant, Babur ruthless': NCERT revises Mughal-era description; adds a no-blame footnote",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/ncert-social-science-textbook-highlights-mughal-brutality-but-adds-a-no-blame-footnote/articleshow/122574835.cms,"How Babur ’s arrival is now framed

Redefining Akbar ’s reign

Shifting the lens on Aurangzeb



Studying the past, not living in it

In a significant pedagogical shift, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has released a new Class 8 Social Science textbook titled Exploring Society: India and Beyond, offering a more layered and candid portrayal of India’s medieval past. The new volume, part of the new curriculum under the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF SE) 2023, shifts the study of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, and colonial encounters from Class 7 to Class 8, aligning with the Council's restructured thematic and chronological focus.The textbook’s chapter titled Reshaping India's Political Map presents major political shifts between the 13th and 17th centuries. It covers the rise and decline of the Delhi Sultanate, the Vijayanagara Empire, the Mughal dynasty, and the emergence of Sikh resistance. What distinguishes this update is not just its content, but its tone. It invites students to examine the past critically without assigning modern-day blame.The chapter’s preface lays out the framework clearly: “History may often appear dominated by wars and destruction—but should we simply leave them out? The better path is to confront and examine these events, to understand the forces that made them possible and, ideally, to prevent them from happening again.It’s essential to study these darker chapters with objectivity, without placing blame on people living today. ”The revised chapter begins its examination of the Mughal era with Babur, founder of the dynasty, whose arrival from Central Asia changed the subcontinent’s political map. The textbook outlines his key victories, particularly the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, and his use of advanced military techniques such as field artillery.While the textbook acknowledges Babur’s strategic acumen and his observations in the Baburnama, it also notes his destruction of temples and the religious motivations behind some of his campaigns. These details aim to provide students with an unvarnished understanding of the conquest and its cultural impact, without assigning simplistic labels.Among the central figures re-evaluated is Emperor Akbar, who took the throne at the age of 13 following Humayun’s death. The textbook acknowledges both his military conquests and his attempts at religious accommodation, describing his rule as a “blend of brutality and tolerance, shaped by ambition and strategy.”One example is the 1568 siege of Chittorgarh, where thousands were massacred and women and children enslaved. Citing Akbar’s own dispatches, the book offers insight into his motivations for religious conquest. Yet, it also highlights how Akbar abolished the jizya (a tax on non-Muslims), included Rajput leaders in his court, and promoted sulh-i-kul or “peace with all.” His translation project at Fatehpur Sikri, which rendered Hindu epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana into Persian, is presented as part of a broader cultural vision.A quote from his biographer, Abul Fazl, underscores Akbar’s personal evolution: “Formerly I persecuted men into conformity with my faith. As I grew in knowledge, I was overwhelmed with shame. Not being a Muslim myself, it was unmeet to force others to become such.”In contrast, Aurangzeb is introduced as a ruler whose territorial expansion was matched by increasing religious conservatism. The textbook documents how he reinstated the jizya, banned music and dance at court, and imposed pilgrimage taxes on Hindus. The destruction of temples in cities such as Banaras and Mathura is discussed alongside the persecution of Sikhs, Sufis, Jains, and Parsis.The succession struggle that brought Aurangzeb to power is also detailed. Students learn how he defeated Dara Shikoh, executed rivals, and imprisoned his father, Shah Jahan, the emperor behind the Taj Mahal.While the inclusion of violent episodes might spark debate, NCERT has clarified its intent. In a statement quoted by ANI, the council said:“While those happenings cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone today responsible for them. Understanding the historical origin of cruel violence, abusive misrule, or misplaced ambitions of power is the best way to heal the past and build a future where, hopefully, they will have no place.”The textbook encourages students to engage with history not as a catalogue of heroes and villains, but as a record of choices, consequences, and contradictions. By combining accounts of conflict with stories of reform and cultural exchange, it offers a more rounded view of the past.As India continues to revisit its historical narratives through updated academic frameworks, Exploring Society: India and Beyond signals a shift toward critical thinking in the classroom. It invites learners to interpret and contextualise, rather than simply memorise or judge.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

NEW DELHI: The US Department of State on Friday designated The Resistance Front (TRF), which claimed responsibility for the April 22 Pahalgam massacre, a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).Highlighting the TRF's involvement in multiple attacks against India, including the deadly Pahalgam attack, the state department said the decision reflected the Trump administration’s ""commitment to protecting US national security, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice following the Pahalgam attack"".""TRF and other associated aliases have been added to LeT’s designation as a FTO and SDGT pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and Executive Order 13224, respectively. The Department of State has also reviewed and maintained the FTO designation of LeT. Amendments to FTO designations go into effect upon publication in the Federal Register,"" the statement read.The April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam's Baisaran meadow, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, was a closely guarded conspiracy hatched by Pakistan spy agency ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) on the directions of the country’s political and military brass, and executed exclusively by Pakistani terrorists.In what sources have described an LeT-ISI joint project akin to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) gave specific directions to Pakistan-based Lashkar commander Sajid Jutt to deploy only foreign terrorists for the gruesome targeted killings in Pahalgam’s Baisaran valley.To ensure complete secrecy, no Kashmiri terrorists were taken on board, and instead, LeT foreign terrorists operating in J&K for sometime were told to execute the killings while ensuring minimal local involvement on a “need-to-know” basis.The Pahalgam attack squad was led by Sulaiman, a suspected former Pakistani special forces commando, who had trained at the LeT Muridke hub in Pakistan’s Punjab province before crossing the LoC in 2022 with his M-4 weapon to enter the Jammu region. Two other Pakistani terrorists were members of the squad.Satellite phone analysis has revealed that Sulaiman’s location on April 15 was in Tral forest, indicating he was in the vicinity of the attack site at Baisaran for almost a week before the incident. Sulaiman was also involved in the April 2023 attack on an Army truck in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed. However, he laid low for the next two years, before carrying out the ISI-LeT mission.Sources did not reveal the identities of the two other Pakistani terrorists who selectively gunned down the 26 civilians — all men and 25 of them being Hindus.There are currently about 68 foreign terrorists and three local terrorists active in the Valley. Only one local terror recruitment has been reported so far this year.","The US Department of State on Friday designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) The state department said the decision reflected the Trump administration’s ""commitment to protecting US national security, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump's call for justice following the Pahalgam attack""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122683606,imgsize-449979,width-400,resizemode-4/122683606.jpg"

'Time For Revival...': Russia's Big Unity Call To Rivals India & China | 'RIC Troika Will...'

(With inputs from agencies)

BEIJING/NEW DELHI: China on Thursday expressed its support for Russia’s initiative to revive the dormant Russia-India-China (RIC) troika.Russian news portal Izvestia on Thursday quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying that Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format and is negotiating on this issue with Beijing and New Delhi.“This topic appears in our negotiations with both of them. We are interested in making this format work, because these three countries are important partners, besides being the founders of BRICS,” Rudenko said.“Therefore, the absence of this format, in my opinion, looks inappropriate. In this regard, we expect that the countries will agree to resume work within the framework of the RIC — of course, when relations between these states reach a level that allows them to work in a trilateral format,” he said.In India, the ministry of external affairs said RIC is a consultative format where the three countries discuss global issues and regional issues of interest to them. “As to when this particular RIC format meeting is going to be held, it is something that will be worked out among the three countries in a mutually convenient manner,” said the spokesperson.Asked for his reaction to Rudenko’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Thursday said, “China-Russia-India cooperation not only serves the respective interests of the three countries but also helps uphold peace, security, stability and progress in the region and the world.”China stands ready to maintain communication with Russia and India on advancing the trilateral cooperation, he said.The Russian and Chinese interests in the revival of RIC followed the recent visit of foreign minister S Jaishankar to China to take part in the SCO foreign ministers meeting, during which he held talks with his Chinese and Russian counterpaerts Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov.Joint work in the RIC format was stalled, first because of the Covid pandemic and then by the India-China military standoff at eastern Ladakh in 2020.","Russia's deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko says Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format.

‘Safe harbour’ not an absolute right, but a privilege contingent upon strict adherence to statutory duties: Govt

NEW DELHI: The Centre told Karnataka high court Thursday that allowing the proliferation of unlawful content on social media in the name of free speech endangered democracy, and accused Elon Musk-owned X of attempting to escape accountability by taking shelter under the IT Act’s ‘safe harbour’ protection.Questioning the US-based company’s locus standi to move an Indian HC for protection of fundamental rights, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the constitutional protection to freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) must not be misunderstood as absolute protection for unlawful content.“Constitutional jurisprudence clearly differentiates between protected speech that contributes meaningfully to democratic discourse and unlawful speech that undermines societal stability and individual rights,” it said.It said the ‘safe harbour’ provision, which protects social media platforms from liability for content posed by their users, was a privilege available only to those internet intermediaries which were responsible.X had moved HC seeking to restrain govt departments from taking coercive action against it and its officials for the content on the microblogging site and said, “Unlawful and unjustified orders harm the X platform and its ability to operate.The issuance of information blocking orders without following due process of law, and in violation of IT Act and the Constitution, violates X’s right to equality under Article 14 and detrimentally impacts its business. ”In written submissions before HC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Proliferation of what can be termed as unlawful content on social media platforms poses an unprecedented threat to public discourse, democracy and societal stability.”“Social media intermediaries possess an unparalleled ability to amplify information instantaneously, without traditional barriers like language or geographical limitations, and thus carry significant responsibilities,” the law officer said.Advent of the internet, social media and digital intermediaries had fundamentally altered the character and scale of human communication, demanding a re-examination and suitable tailoring of constitutional standards, Mehta said, adding India’s internet subscriber base had grown from 25 crore in 2013-14 to 97 crore in Sept 2024.The govt’s stand that ‘safe harbour’ does not mean blanket immunity can have implications for all social media platforms. This also rhymes with the growing call for repeal of Section 230 of US's Communications Decency Act from which social media giants derive the immunity.The Centre said ‘safe harbour’ protection for internet intermediaries was not an unconditional entitlement but a privilege contingent upon strict adherence to statutory duties. While committing to full protection of the right to free speech, the govt said, “The question raised by X cannot be examined merely from the prism of the person using this medium.“The concept of ‘safe harbour’ inherently includes rigorous responsibilities, requiring intermediaries to promptly and effectively remove or disable unlawful content upon receiving notice. These safeguards are deliberately designed to balance innovation with accountability, ensuring intermediaries do not become platforms for unlawful activities.”The govt said X’s attempt was to present ‘safe harbour’ as an absolute right, devoid of any corresponding duties. “Such a stand fundamentally misconstrues the very basis of this legal protection. ‘Safe harbour’ is not a constitutional guarantee but a statutory privilege, specifically designed to foster responsible conduct,” it said.It told HC that X had confused itself with the play of Sections 69A and 79 of the IT Act. It said Section 69A pertains explicitly to govt orders for blocking content with serious penal consequences for non-compliance whereas Section 79 deals with due diligence obligations to maintain ‘safe harbour’ protection.The Centre said X purposefully blurred the clear distinction to escape accountability for its statutory duties. It said social media platforms use ‘amplification’ mechanisms to push visibility of a particular type of view.“The algorithms used by intermediaries actively curate and boost content, shaping public opinion and significantly influencing social harmony or disorder. This active role demands heightened accountability, necessitating robust regulation specifically tailored for social media, distinct from traditional media,” the Centre further said.",The Centre told Karnataka high court Thursday that allowing the proliferation of unlawful content on social media in the name of free speech endangered democracy.

BENGALURU: In a faux pas, Meta’s auto-translation tool “digitally” killed off Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah while translating a condolence message posted by CMO on social media Tuesday. Understandably furious at being referred to as “late” CM, Siddaramaiah told Meta to suspend its Kannada auto-translation feature until it learns not to distort facts.The condolence message was posted in Kannada on Facebook and Instagram, mourning the death of veteran actress B Sarojadevi. Meta’s English auto-translation, however, read: “Chief Minister Siddaramaiah passed away yesterday multilingual star, senior actress B. Took darshan of Sarojadevi’s earthly body and paid his last respects.”Reacting sharply to the goof-up, Siddaramaiah posted on X: “Faulty auto-translation of Kannada content on Meta platforms is distorting facts and misleading users. This is dangerous when it comes to official communication. My media adviser has formally written to Meta urging immediate correction. Social media platforms must act responsibly.I caution citizens to be aware that translations shown are often inaccurate. Such negligence by tech giants can harm public understanding and trust.”The CMO said it sent a mail to Meta, seeking urgent intervention. The CMO also urged Meta to hit pause button on Kannada auto-translation until it improved the feature further. It also asked the tech company to collaborate with Kannada language experts and professionals “to enhance contextual accuracy” of translations from Kannada to English”.“We have noted with concern that the auto-translation from Kannada to English is frequently inaccurate and, in some cases, grossly misleading,” wrote K V Prabhakar, the CM’s media adviser. Prabhakar cautioned that such bloopers could cause confusion, especially when they involve public communication, official statements or important messages from the CM or govt. “Many may not realise that what they are reading is an automated translation rather than the original message,” he said.","The condolence message was posted in Kannada on Facebook and Instagram, mourning the death of veteran actress B Sarojadevi.

Poll Should preliminary accident reports be made public before investigations are complete? Yes, for transparency No, it can lead to misinformation

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) on Wednesday raised serious concerns over the preliminary findings and public commentary surrounding the crash of Air India Flight AI171, which went down in Ahmedabad shortly after takeoff en route to London.In an official statement, the FIP said, ""We register our dissatisfaction with the exclusion of pilot representatives from the investigation process. We also firmly object to how the preliminary report has been interpreted and presented publicly.""The federation criticised the report for lacking comprehensive data and relying heavily on ""selectively paraphrased cockpit voice recordings"" that appear to imply pilot error and question the competence of the flight crew. ""This approach is neither objective nor complete,"" the FIP said, urging members and the public not to draw conclusions prematurely.""Assigning blame before a thorough, transparent, and data-driven investigation is both premature and irresponsible. Such speculative commentary undermines the professionalism of highly trained crew members and causes undue distress to their families and colleagues,"" the statement added.The 15-page preliminary report, released a month after the crash, outlines initial findings from the accident that claimed 240 lives out of the 241 people on board. The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed into a medical hostel complex shortly after takeoff.According to the report, the incident involved mid-air engine shutdowns, cockpit confusion, and failed recovery attempts just seconds into the flight.However, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) stressed that key parts of the investigation -- including wreckage analysis, post-mortem reports, and component inspections, are still under way.At this stage, the AAIB has not issued any safety recommendations for Boeing 787-8 aircraft or its GE GEnx-1B engines.Air India stated it is cooperating fully with investigators. Boeing also said it will defer to the AAIB for updates, in line with international aviation protocols under ICAO’s Annex 13.","The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has raised serious concerns over the crash of Air India Flight AI171.

NEW DELHI: India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday in what is seen as the first official reaction to the US and EU threat of secondary sanctions for buying those barrels.“India has diversified the sources (of oil). I am not worried at all. If something happens, we will deal with it. There is sufficient supply available,” Puri said at an industry event.Separately, the foreign ministry said govt’s overriding priority was to secure the energy needs of its people, while also cautioning against any double standards on the issue.The comments, in response to media queries, followed NATO chief Mark Rutte’s threat, echoing the US, that countries like India, China and Brazil would take a battering for buying Russian exports.“Let me reiterate, and I have said this in the past as well. Securing energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“In this endeavour, we are guided by what is there on offer in the markets, as also by the prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter,” he added. India has in the past too accused the West of having double standards on the issue, saying that European countries have themselves benefited from importing Russian energy for prolonged periods.Puri said India has built up “navigational resilience” by expanding the sourcing of oil from 40 countries against 27 countries earlier. “India has been clear that it will buy oil from wherever it has to. The prime minister’s commitment, in the final analysis, is to the Indian consumer,” he said.In addition, Puri said, more oil was coming into the global market from countries such as Brazil, Guyana and Canada that are not members of the OPEC+ grouping. “If a major source goes off the market, you diversify. The current debate in the oil market is whether prices will be in the range of $65-70 or $60-65 (per barrel),” he said.","India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said.

NEW DELHI: Only 45.8 lakh voters, or 5.8% of Bihar’s 7.9 crore electorate, are yet to submit their enumeration forms as part of the ongoing SIR of electoral rolls in state, with eight days to go before the July 25 deadline. EC Thursday said close to 7.1 crore or 89.7% forms have been submitted, while 4.5% electors were not found at their addresses, possibly on account of being deceased, permanently shifted or enrolled at multiple places.The details of electors not found at their recorded addresses, even after three mandatory visits by BLOs, will be shared with district presidents and booth level agents of political parties from Friday onwards to confirm the exact status of such electors before the July 25 deadline for submitting enumeration forms.All electors whose enumeration forms are received before July 25 will figure in the draft electoral roll to be published on Aug 1.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About

Poll Should the woman face legal consequences for her actions in this case? Yes, she should be held accountable. No, she is a victim of circumstances.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday turned the tables on a married woman, who sought cancellation of anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping her on promise of marriage, by warning her she might be liable for prosecution for having a physical relationship with a man other than her husband during subsistence of her marriage.When the woman's counsel argued that the man had continued to engage in a sexual relationship with his client on the false promise of marriage, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh said, ""You are a married woman with two children. You are a mature person, and you understand the relationship you were getting into outside the marriage.""When the advocate said that she was called many times to hotels and rest houses by the man for sex on the pretext of marriage, the bench asked, ""Why did you go to the hotels repeatedly at his beckoning? You very well understand that you also have committed an offence by having a sexual relationship outside the marriage.""The bench said Patna high court was right in granting anticipatory bail to Ankit Barnwal and dismissed the plea of the woman. The trial court had refused anticipatory bail to Barnwal, who had sought relief after the woman registered a rape complaint against him.Also Read: Man arrested for raping minor sister in law The married woman and Barnwal had been in a relationship after knowing each other through social media in 2016.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Home Minister Ashish Sood on Thursday alleged that AAP leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia purchased several top‑of‑the‑line mobile phones on government funds.Citing a 2013 government circular that allows the chief minister and ministers to buy phones worth up to Rs 50,000 and Rs 45,000 respectively, Sood showed documents that suggested Kejriwal bought an iPhone 6s Plus for Rs 81,000 in 2015, an iPhone 7 Plus for Rs 69,000 in 2017, an iPhone 12 Pro Max worth Rs 1.39 lakh during the Covid period in 2020, and an iPhone 13 Pro Max for Rs 1.63 lakh in July 2022.He further said Manish Sisodia had purchased five expensive handsets between 2017 and 2022, including Samsung Galaxy S8 models costing nearly Rs 60,000 and iPhones priced between Rs 1.12 lakh and Rs 1.66 lakh. Former minister Atishi too allegedly bought a phone for Rs 1.27 lakh in 2023, though the entitled reimbursement was only Rs 45,000.Delhi CM Rekha Gupta also weighed in with a poetic jibe on social media. She wrote, “AAP’s cap was hiding a whole market — every move filled with scams! They bought costly phones for themselves, now the truth is out so smile!

Calcutta HC acquits three on death row for 2014 murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-hc-acquits-three-on-death-row-for-2014-murder/articleshow/122702397.cms,"Calcutta high court

No proof that any of 3 accused was near crime spot: HC

KOLKATA: Three persons awarded death sentence for a murder and incarcerated for the past 11 years were acquitted on Thursday by Calcutta high court, which ruled that the prosecution had failed to conclusively establish their hand in the killing of a 28-year-old woman, whose mutilated body was found at Sealdah railway station in 2014.A division bench of justices Debangsu Basak and Md Shabbar Rashidi held that there was no evidence whatsoever to associate the three accused — the woman’s husband and two others — with the murder.Their presence at the scene of crime at the relevant time has not been proved convincingly, Calcutta HC held. On the morning of May 20, 2014, chopped body parts of Jayanti Deb were found in the parking area of Sealdah station, some wrapped in a quilt and some stuffed into a trolley bag. Investigating the case, Govt Railway Police arrested her estranged husband Surojit Deb, his girlfriend Lipika Poddar and one Sanjoy Biswas. Surojit and Lipika were accused of committing the murder and hiring Sanjoy to dispose of the body.Charges were framed against the three on April 21, 2015. In 2019, a Sealdah court found them guilty of murder, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy, and sentenced them to death.The high court bench overturned the verdict. The HC observed that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Surojit had moved out of his marital home with his daughter much before the crime, and was living elsewhere with Lipika. There was absolutely no evidence that any of the three accused was in the vicinity of the crime spot around the date of the incident, the court said, acquitting all three. “The prosecution had hopelessly failed to bring home the charges levelled against the appellants at the trial, beyond all reasonable doubts sufficient enough to secure their conviction,” the bench stated.The trial court order was based on Sanjoy’s ‘confession’, which he later retracted.","Jayanti Deb's mutilated body was found at Sealdah railway station in 2014.

CHENNAI: Take legal action against those preventing a person from entering a temple because of his or her caste, Madras high court has directed authorities, stressing that caste-based discrimination cannot be permitted in a country governed by the rule of law.Petitioner Venkatesan moved the court after idols installed by people belonging to scheduled caste (SC) at Ayyanar temple in Pudukudi village in Ariyalur’s Udayarpalayam taluk were vandalised by dominant caste members. He alleged that members of SC were being forced to have a darshan of the deity from behind a large iron gate.“If a temple is permitted to be visited by the public, it assumes the character of a public temple.

ED’s action part of political witch hunt: Vadra’s office

NEW DELHI: A day after attaching his properties worth Rs 37 crore, the ED on Thursday filed a chargesheet against Robert Vadra, son-in-law of former Congress president Sonia Gandhi , in a Rouse Avenue court here accusing him of laundering “proceeds of crime” in a Gurgaon land deal worth over Rs 58 crore.Besides Vadra, ED has accused 11 others in its chargesheet against the businessman, husband of MP Priyanka Gandhi. The other accused include Onkareshwar Properties and promoters/directors Satyanand Yajee & K S Virk, sources said.The Rouse Avenue court in Delhi is yet to take cognisance of the ED chargesheet against Robert Vadra. This is the second chargesheet filed against the Gandhi family in less than three months. The ED had filed a chargesheet against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on April 17 in the National Herald money laundering case.Reacting to the ED chargesheet, Vadra’s office said the “present proceedings are nothing more than an extension of the political witch hunt by the present govt”, adding that he would defend and clear his name in court. “As a law-abiding citizen, Vadra has always and will continue to extend his fullest cooperation to the authorities and he is confident that at the end of it all, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,” the statement said.Vadra is facing multiple money laundering cases for several land deals he negotiated under the then Congress govts in Haryana and Rajasthan, and for alleged favours he had received from the then Congress govt in Haryana led by then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda . The Hooda-led Congress govt had allowed changes in land use from agricultural to commercial/residential for properties acquired by Vadra, leading to alleged windfall gains for him. Vadra is also facing a money laundering investigation in a case filed against fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. He has been accused of allegedly acquiring properties through Bhandari in London and Dubai from the proceeds of crime from multiple defence deals.In the present case in which chargesheet has been filed, Vadra has been accused of purchasing 3.5 acres in Shikohpur village in Gurgaon’s Sector 83 through his Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd from Onkareshwar Properties Pvt Ltd on Feb 12, 2008, for Rs 7.5 crore. The then Congress govt in Haryana immediately gave him a commercial licence to develop the property over 2.7 acres. Four months later, the same land was sold to DLF for Rs 58 crore, making a profit of Rs 50 crore within months of purchasing it.ED’s money laundering probe is based on an FIR registered by Gurgaon police in 2018, alleging fraudulent transactions in the land deal. The ED on Wednesday attached 43 properties worth over Rs 37 crore associated with Vadra and his entities, including Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd.","ED files chargesheet against Robert Vadra, son-in-law of former Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 16-year legal battle over toddy strength has ended with Kerala revising the permissible alcohol content in the popular coconut palm beverage to 8.98% v/v, replacing the 2007 cap of 8.1% that triggered prolonged litigation.The decision comes after a SC directive on May 1 last year in a special leave petition filed by Komalan, a former toddy shop licensee.The 2007 limit, imposed citing public health concerns, sparked a legal fight beginning with a Kerala HC writ petition and culminating in the apex court. SC asked the state to conduct a scientific study and revisit its policy. Komalan cited a Kerala University study recommending a 9.59% limit. The state initially rejected that, warning higher levels could indicate adulteration with spirit or arrack. The chief chemical examiner and Bureau of Indian Standards backed the 8.1% cap, while research by Coconut Research Institute’s former director R Child showed toddy could naturally reach 8.1% after 33 hours of fermentation.An expert panel later reviewed samples statewide and global literature. It recommended the 8.98% limit, now adopted. A gazette notification is expected soon. The decision is seen as a boost to the traditional toddy sector.","Kerala revises the permissible alcohol content in the popular coconut palm beverage to 8.98% v/v, replacing the 2007 cap of 8.1% that triggered prolonged litigation.

'Blunder at gates'

Poor security arrangement due to cops-organisers nexus

Standard protocols bypassed: Karnataka govt

BENGALURU: The one-man judicial commission constituted by Karnataka’s govt to probe the June 4 stampede outside Bengaluru’s Chinnaswamy stadium that claimed 11 lives has held Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL), which owns and runs RCB, event organisers DNA Entertainment, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) officials and senior police officers responsible for the tragedy.The Justice D’Cunha Commission found that the organisers failed to obtain mandatory prior permissions — seven days before the event, as required under the Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bengaluru City) Order, 2009.Meanwhile in the high court, the state govt argued that police officers handling the situation on the day of the stampede had acted like “servants of RCB management”.The Justice John Michael D’Cunha commission, which submitted its report recently, has recommended legal action against three from KSCA: Raghuram Bhat (president), A Shankar (former secretary), and ES Jairam (former treasurer); RCSPL vice-president Rajesh Menon; two from DNA: T Venkata Vardhan (MD) and Sunil Kumar (VP); three IPS officers: B Dayananda, Vikash Kumar Vikash, Shekhar T Tekkannavar; and two more from police department: C Balakrishna and AK Girish.The commission found that the organisers failed to obtain mandatory prior permissions — seven days before the event, as required under Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bengaluru City) Order, 2009.Pointing out that police security arrangement was grossly inadequate and ineffective, the panel said senior cops were working on ‘bandobast’ under direct command of additional DGP and commissioner of police, “in nexus” with organisers, even before any formal security activation took place.“Out of 515 personnel deputed, only 79 were posted outside the gates to control the crowd. Even these officers were not visible at the venue during the crisis,” it noted.Control room staff failed to alert on-ground security teams stationed at the entry gates. Despite clear signs of overcrowding, the exit gates were not opened in time, which the commission termed “a serious act of negligence and a breakdown of emergency protocols”.The report also flagged improper and unscientific installation of barricades, combined with narrow and constricted entry gates, as a major contributing factor. Under-deployment of police at high-risk gates made the situation worse.It concluded that the organisers themselves triggered the stampede by failing to regulate entry and by making reckless announcements about stadium access.The situation, the commission said, was the result of “hasty decisions and lack of preparation, amounting to recklessness bordering on gross negligence”.The “who is responsible for the stadium stampede” debate took an interesting turn in Karnataka HC on Thursday with the state govt alleging that police officers handling the situation on the day of the tragedy had “acted like servants of RCB management”. However, a suspended IPS officer countered it saying that govt made him a scapegoat.Vikash Kumar Vikash had challenged govt’s decision to suspend him in Central Administrative Tribunal (Bengaluru branch), which recently quashed his suspension and ordered his reinstatement. Referring to CAT’s move, govt told HC that CAT had exceeded its authority by conducting an unnecessary fact-finding mission whilst handling his petition.Special advocate PS Rajagopal, representing govt, noted that police officers acted without proper requisition from RCB management as if they were servants of the entity. Regarding the tribunal’s decision to exonerate Vikash and advise the govt to extend the relief to four other officers, he said it had overstepped its jurisdictional boundaries.He highlighted the unprecedented events of June 3 and June 4, where RCB hastily invited people without proper procedures. He pointed out that police arrangements were made despite lacking necessary permissions, bypassing standard protocols for venue inspection and safety assessments.","The one-man judicial commission has held Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL), which owns and runs RCB, event organisers DNA Entertainment, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) officials and senior police officers responsible for the tragedy.

No arrests yet, but some men detained for Patna shooting: SP

PATNA: Five men, each carrying a pistol, strolled into a room in a top private hospital here Thursday morning and shot dead a murder convict undergoing treatment on parole and fled without encountering any resistance, the impunity of the execution triggering fresh alarm in a city reeling from a string of killings this July. The last gunman didn’t bother to run; he swaggered off, CCTV footage showed.Chandan Mishra, 36, of was serving a life sentence at Beur central jail for the 2011 murder of a businessman. He was recovering from liver surgery at Paras HMRI Hospital on Bailey Road. His parole was to end July 18.Around 7.15am, CCTV footage captured five men with pistols approaching Room 209 on the hospital’s second floor and firing at close range.Their faces were clearly visible in the footage, now circulating widely on social media. Mishra died of multiple gunshot wounds.A case has been registered. Forensic and canine units were sent to the scene. The body has been sent for autopsy. “Some people have been detained for questioning, but no arrests have been made yet,” Patna SP (central) Diksha said.Mishra had over two dozen cases against him. His 2011 conviction was tied to the murder of businessman Rajendra Kesari.Police said he often declared his intentions openly and had told Kesari, “I will kill you tomorrow,” after he refused to pay extortion money. Kesari was gunned down the next day.Patna SSP Kartikeya K Sharma said preliminary evidence pointed to gang rivalry. “There was a gang called Chandan-Sheru. The manner of shooting suggests a targeted hit by a rival group, possibly over personal enmity or gang war,” he said.Mishra had teamed up with Omkarnath, alias Sheru Singh, to form the Chandan-Sheru gang, which dominated organised crime in western Bihar. Their rise prompted police crackdowns and Rs 50,000 bounties on both men. Power struggles over money and leadership eventually split the gang, with Sheru forming his own faction. Both had clashed when they were inmates at Bhagalpur jail.","Chandan Mishra, 36, of was serving a life sentence at Beur central jail for the 2011 murder of a businessman.

The move follows promises of 200 units of free electricity by rival and former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav of RJD, which leads opposition INDIA bloc in the state.Nitish made the announcement through his official social media handle. “All domestic consumers will get 100% subsidy on 125 units of power from Aug 1... It will benefit 1.67 crore families,” he said.Bihar has around 1.82 crore power consumers, deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP revealed at a press conference later. “Among these households, an estimated 1.67 crore (91%) are known to consume less than 125 units. They will enjoy a golden time as a result of the CM’s announcement,” he said.As per the deputy CM, the benefits will cost the state an additional Rs 3,000 crore. “So far, govt has been bearing an annual expenditure of about Rs 16,000 crore for power subsidy. The new scheme will raise the amount to more than Rs 19,000 crore,” said Choudhary, who is also the state’s finance minister.To mitigate the financial impact of free power, Nitish announced that govt will promote solar energy through two schemes where a 50% central subsidy was provided for rooftop solar panels and associated equipment. Choudhary said the state intended to achieve a target of 10,000MW solar power in next three years, tapping PM’s Surya Ghar Yojana. Reminded about NDA’s earlier stand of ‘no freebies’, Choudhary said “we are not using the word free (muft). It is a 100% subsidy.”","The move follows promises of 200 units of free electricity by rival Tejashwi Yadav of RJD.

NEW DELHI: The SIR exercise in Bihar and the issue of official documents like voter ID and Aadhaar card being obtained by alleged infiltrators figured in Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting Thursday, with several BJP MPs expressing concern over benefits of welfare schemes being availed by ineligible people.The PAC, headed by Congress MP K C Venugopal, also deliberated on “functioning of UIDAI”, with a few members suggesting a simpler procedure to effect changes in erroneous Aadhaar details, which deny people access to what’s their due, including govt benefits.“Documents like voter ID and Aadhaar are given to citizens and not residents... The matter was raised and a suggestion made that ineligible cardholders should be identified,” a senior member said, citing the process until 2023 under which a certificate from panchayat head was enough to procure Aadhaar or voter ID.A few members said Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar was an exercise being conducted in earnest, as it is in interest of the country if the ineligible are identified. BJP MPs Ravi Shankar Prasad, Nishikant Dubey, Anurag Thakur, Tejaswi Surya, L Laxman, and Congress’ Jai Prakash and Shaktisinh Gohil were among those who attended the meeting. The BJP MPs said a large number of ineligible people, especially suspected infiltrators, had obtained the unique identity before the application rules were made stringent and sought a review of their bona fides, sources said.An MP claimed Aadhaar serves as “backdoor” entry for people with suspect citizenship to get a raft of official documents, including voter ID and passport, while others spoke of the presence of alleged infiltrators in Karnataka, Bihar and Jharkhand.Sources said some MPs were of the view that since Aadhaar is considered a residency proof and does not certify Indian citizenship, authorities need to reconsider if it alone should be the basis for identifying people eligible for welfare schemes. Without getting into details of the committee’s deliberations, Venugopal said Aadhaar is a “common man issue” and many questions had been raised and suggestions made.At the meeting, attended by officials of ministry of electronics and information technology and UIDAI, a few members highlighted difficulties faced by Aadhaar cardholders in redress of their gri-evances, as at times biometric details do not match for a variety of reasons, or other details are erroneous.","BJP MPs expressed concern over benefits of welfare schemes being availed by ineligible people.

Brutality not sole criterion for extreme penalty: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brutality-not-sole-criterion-for-extreme-penalty-supreme-court/articleshow/122685631.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Brutality of offence cannot be the sole criterion to award death punishment and mitigating circumstances, including socio-economic background and psychological state of the convict, must also be considered, Supreme Court has said while commuting the death sentence of two convicts in two different cases. It condemned them to spend the rest of their lives in jail without the possibility of remission.Though trial courts and high courts in both cases had awarded death, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta commuted the sentences and granted them life sentences with the condition that they have to die in jail.In one case, the convict from Ballari district in Karnataka had killed his wife, three children and sister-in-law in 2017 due to suspicion that he was not the biological father of the children and they were born out of infidelity. In the other case, a daily wage earner had raped and strangulated a 10-year-old girl in 2018 in Dehradun.The court held that in both cases, trial court and HC decided the punishment on the basis of barbaric and ruthless manner of committing the crime and mitigating circumstances were not considered. “Courts below have only commented on the brutality of crime in question, to hand down the death penalty to the appellant. No other circumstance came to be discussed by the courts in reaching the conclusion that the case forms part of the ‘rarest of rare’ category. Such an approach in our view cannot be sustained,” it said.","Brutality of offence cannot be sole criterion to award death punishment, Supreme Court says.

NEW DELHI: Delhi HC Thursday sought Centre’s explanation for excluding same-sex couples from the right to make medical decisions for each other during treatment.Justice Sachin Datta observed there appeared to be no reason why this right should “not be available” to same-sex or unmarried couples under Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. It directed Centre and National Medical Commission to respond within four weeks.The 2002 regulations state that consent for medical procedures must be obtained from “husband or wife, parent or guardian in the case of a minor, or the patient himself.”HC was hearing a plea by Arshiya Takkar seeking legal recognition for queer couples to make medical decisions for partners during emergencies. The plea argued that lack of guidelines leaves queer partners powerless in critical situations and amounts to bias.Justice Datta also questioned how the rules applied to orphans or people living alone and asked Centre to clarify.",HC was hearing a plea by Arshiya Takkar seeking legal recognition for queer couples to make medical decisions for partners during emergencies.

Supreme Court comes to rescue of man facing rape charges for 13 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-comes-to-rescue-of-man-facing-rape-charges-for-13-years/articleshow/122680444.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court rescued a young man, who impulsively eloped with a college girl and stayed together at Hyderabad for two months but for the next 13 years the man faced the rigour of police investigation and later, was concurrently convicted of kidnapping and rape by the trial court and the Telangana HC.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the man of all charges on finding that the couple were in a consensual relationship and had eloped on their own volition. The trial court had convicted and sentenced him to seven years rigorous imprisonment, which was reduced to two years by the HC.The man had eloped with his friend’s sister on Aug 4, 2012, and the couple stayed at Shadnagar, Hyderabad. The girl’s mother had on Aug 8 lodged a missing complaint with police. On Oct 12, the man met with an accident while riding his motorcycle and was admitted to hospital. On that day the girl returned to her parental home. On her statement, the police lodged an FIR for kidnapping and rape against the man.Analysing the evidence produced before the trial court, the bench said, “The girl’s deposition does not demonstrate that the man forcibly removed or enticed her from the guardianship of her parents with deceit or inducement.She admits having voluntarily accompanied the man on a motorbike on Aug 4, 2012. SC wondered as to why the girl’s mother waited for four days to lodge a missing complaint and said the girl living willingly and without protest with the man for two months generates doubts over the kidnapping theory of the police.The bench said when the man was hospitalised after the accident, she remained with him for two days. On rape charge, it said, “This charge has no legs to stand on, for she only makes a positive statement about the occurrence of sexual intercourse and does not even in the slightest imply the same to be against her will.”Acquitting him of all charges, Justices Karol and Mehta said, “We do not find any evidence which may suggest that the appellant kidnapped the victim from lawful guardianship or confined her, for approximately two months, against her volition in a house at Hyderabad or had sexual intercourse with the victim against her will or without her consent.”","A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the man of all charges on finding that the couple were in a consensual relationship.

Man can’t demand access to wife’s call detail records: Chhattisgarh HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-cant-demand-access-to-wifes-call-detail-records-chhattisgarh-hc/articleshow/122680470.cms,"Representative photo

RAIPUR: A husband cannot demand access to his spouse’s personal information or communication as that would amount to infringement of privacy, Chhattisgarh high court has ruled, dismissing a man’s plea seeking the call detail records (CDR) of his wife.Asserting that privacy is a constitutionally protected right under Article 21 that marriage cannot override, the court said forcing the wife to share her phone call or bank account details could even attract domestic violence charges.“Marriage does not grant the husband automatic access to the wife’s private information, communications and personal belongings. The husband cannot compel his wife to share her passwords for the cellphone or bank account, and such an act would amount to a violation of privacy and potentially domestic violence. There should be a balance between marital privacy and the need for transparency and, at the same time, trust in the relationship,” Justice Rakesh Mohan Pandey said, upholding a Durg family court’s order.The first additional principal judge of family court had in June last year rejected his application for his wife’s CDR.He argued his wife frequently spoke to her brother-in-law for long periods, suggesting a possible illicit relationship.","Chhattisgarh high court dismisses a man's plea seeking the call detail records (CDR) of his wife.

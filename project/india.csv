'Sought and received permission': Dismissed CRPF jawan on marrying Pakistani woman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sought-and-received-permission-dismissed-crpf-jawan-on-marrying-pakistani-woman/articleshow/120865016.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan, Munir Ahmed , plans to legally contest his sacking over allegations of concealing his marriage to a Pakistani national. Ahmed claimed that he had received official permission for the marriage from CRPF headquarters in April 2024.""I initially came to know about my dismissal through media reports. I shortly received a letter from the CRPF informing me about the dismissal, which came as a shock to me and my family, as I had sought and received permission for my marriage to a Pakistani woman from the headquarters,"" Ahmed told news agency PTI.""I made the first correspondence on December 31, 2022, informing them of my wish to marry the Pakistani national, and I was asked to complete formalities like enclosing copies of the passport, marriage card, and affidavits.

He asserted that he had already completed the necessary formalities by informing the government about his marriage to a foreign national in accordance with the rules.""We got married online on May 24 last year through a video call. Subsequently, I submitted marriage pictures, 'nikkah' papers, and the marriage certificate to my 72 Battalion, where I was posted,"" Ahmed said.""When she came for the first time on February 28 on a 15-day visa, we applied for a Long-Term Visa in March itself and completed the necessary formalities, including an interview,"" he added.Ahmed further said that he returned to his duties at the end of his leave period and was asked to report to the battalion headquarters at Sunderbani on March 25. But on March 27, ""I was handed over a transfer order and posted with the 41st Battalion at Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) without being given the mandatory 15-day joining period.""I was given the order copy and relieved immediately, leaving me with no option but to join my duties at Bhopal, where I reported on March 29. I faced an interview with the commanding officer and his deputy on reaching there and also completed the documentation process, clearly mentioning my marriage to a Pakistani woman. I am hopeful of getting justice from the court of law,"" he added.",Munir Ahmed claims he had received official permission for the marriage from CRPF headquarters in April 2024.

Global agreement reached to eliminate hazardous pesticide chlorpyrifos with exemptions for India and other countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-agreement-reached-to-eliminate-hazardous-pesticide-chlorpyrifos-with-exemptions-for-india-and-other-countries/articleshow/120863171.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a significant decision, countries across the globe on Saturday struck a major deal to eliminate the use of one of the most hazardous pesticides , Chlorpyrifos, with certain exemptions, under the Stockholm Convention at the ongoing meet in Geneva.India, which opposed its complete elimination at this stage, will continue to use it for another five years as per its registered uses for 12 crops, including rice, wheat, gram, sugarcane, beans, cotton, mustard, brinjal, onion, apple, barley, and groundnut, to deal with certain pests and termites.Over 40 countries, including all 27 European Union (EU) nations, the UK, and the US, have already banned the use of Chlorpyrifos on food crops. India, during the negotiation, pitched for exemptions, arguing the need for its use in certain crops in the absence of alternatives. The country, along with other nations, including Russia, Kenya, Zambia, and Costa Rica, also favoured exemptions for ensuring food security .Though India and many countries will continue to use it for select exempted purposes in the cultivation of certain crops while dealing with pests, the decision will ultimately push the users to look for alternatives in the final goal of complete elimination of the use of Chlorpyrifos, a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide with harmful effects on health and the environment.The decision was taken at the ongoing Conference of the Parties (COPs) to the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm (BRS) Convention in Geneva, being held to galvanise global efforts to manage hazardous chemicals and waste in an environmentally sound manner.Experts who have been tracking the development at the Convention welcome the listing of Chlorpyrifos in Annex A (meant for elimination) of the Convention but expressed their concerns at the long list of exemptions.“The world can no longer turn a blind eye to the overwhelming scientific evidence on Chlorpyrifos. Its global elimination is a critical step toward safeguarding public health, environmental integrity, and the rights of future generations,” said Dileep Kumar of the Pesticide Action Network (PAN) India.""We support a broad spectrum evaluation and speeding up the separation of highly hazardous chemicals for elimination. The survival of life, including biodiversity, is at stake. Also, national govts have to take up their own independent physico-chemical and ecotoxicological evaluation to propose such chemicals for elimination,” said Narasimha Reddy Donthi, a public policy expert.The specific exemptions allowed under the decision include 18 crop-pest complexes (rice, maize, wheat, sugarcane, onion, peanut, barley, cabbage, chickpea, cotton, pineapple, and rapeseed, among others); control of leaf-cutting ants for agricultural use; control of locusts; control of ticks in cattle; and wood preservation against borers and termites in building foundations.","India, which opposed its complete elimination at this stage, will continue to use it for another five years as per its registered uses for 12 crops.

"Courtrooms have winners & losers, but mediation's healing: CJI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courtrooms-have-winners-losers-but-mediations-healing-cji/articleshow/120861373.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Saturday said courtroom adjudication is grim and shallow, as it results in a winner and a loser - a process that fails to heal strained relationships between parties. He contrasted this with mediation, which, he said, seeks to provide a holistic solution that restores relationships.Speaking at the first National Mediation Conference inaugurated by President Droupadi Murmu, CJI Khanna said ' community mediation ' provision in the Mediation Act, 2023 is salutary as this can be an effective tool to resolve disputes that are likely to affect peace, harmony and tranquility among residents or families in a specific area or locality. ""This is an important step forward,"" he said.Justice Khanna said unfortunately mediation, which is ingrained in our civilisational history, is not mainstreamed and not first choice of parties to a dispute even though modern mediation tools can provide solution to litigants, which is unavailable in courtrooms.""In courtroom adjudication, one party is right, the other is wrong. In this way, courtroom litigation and adjudication are grim and shallow. At times, the root cause remains unaddressed, and the ailment and pain remain. The relationships are strained, if not broken. There is a winner, there is a loser,"" he said.In contrast, mediation seeks to identify and remedy the root cause with a process that delves deeper into the issue, the cause of the misunderstanding between the parties and attempts a holistic solution without getting mired in legal procedures to restore the relationship between parties, he added.""Because process is voluntary and participatory, solution reached is less traumatic, more humane and acceptable,"" Justice Khanna said, adding that between 2016 and early 2025, a staggering 7,57,173 cases were settled using mediation.Comparing the courtroom justice delivery mechanism and the mediation crafted resolution, CJI Khanna said while a judge attempts to find whois at fault among the litigants who advance their case through argumentative lawyers, a mediator goes beyond the binaries and attempts to resolve misunderstandings, which is often the mother of most litigations.He said, ""Mediation offers space by undoing complexity. It does not involve legal and procedural complexities. It is flexible and personalised, not bound by rigid procedure. And above all, it is empathetic - aiming not to win over the other side, but to bring together.""Mediator's neutrality is crucial to achieve resolution of a dispute, said Justrice Khanna, adding that ""a skilled mediator senses not only what is being said, but what lies beneath the words.""","CJI Sanjiv Khanna said courtroom adjudication is grim and shallow.

This was mentioned in a Russian readout of a conversation that foreign minister Sergey Lavrov had with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar about the Pahalgam terrorist attack on Saturday.Jaishankar reiterated in his talks with Lavrov that perpetrators, planners and backers of the Pahalgam must be brought to justice. India sees Pakistan as having done little to respect the principles enshrined in the Simla Agreement but acknowledges its importance in underlining the significance of bilateralism in addressing disputes. The agreement has also been important for upholding the sanctity of the LoC, which resulted from the ceasefire of December 1971, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and use of peaceful means for resolving disputes. Pakistan has so far not issued a notification for putting the agreement in abeyance.According to Russian authorities, Lavrov and Jaishankar discussed issues related to Russia-India cooperation and the “aggravation of India-Pakistan relations following the terrorist attack in Pahalgam”. The conversation followed President Vladimir Putin’s message to PM Narendra Modi last week that Russia expects the organisers and perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to face “deserved punishment”.“Sergey Lavrov called for settling disagreements between New Delhi and Islamabad on a bilateral basis by political and diplomatic means per the provisions of the Simla Agreement of 1972 and the Lahore Declaration of 1999. The ministers also discussed the schedule of upcoming contacts at the highest levels,’’ said the readout.Both sides also discussed Putin’s likely visit to India later this year for the annual India-Russia summit. Modi had visited Moscow for the summit last year and now it’s Putin’s turn to participate in the same meeting here. Modi may also have another meeting with Putin in China this year if he decides to participate in the upcoming SCO summit.The Russian side is currently working on a proposed meeting between Putin and US President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia for the Ukraine peace talks.

Pahalgam attack aftermath: Long leaves cancelled at ordnance factories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-attack-aftermath-long-leaves-cancelled-at-ordnance-factories/articleshow/120858421.cms,"AI generated image

Poll Do you support the cancellation of long leaves for employees in defense manufacturing during times of national security tensions? No, it affects employee well-being. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

‘Cancellation of leaves aimed at accelerating defence production’



NAGPUR/JABALPUR/KOLKATA: Amid surging tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack , Munitions India Limited (MIL), agglomerate of the 12 ordnance factories across the country, has cancelled long leaves of its employees at most plants, sources told TOI on Friday. No leave beyond two days is permitted for the next two months.Senior management sources, including those on the board, denied the directive had anything to do with the post-April 22 tension. The official reason - from Ordnance Factory Chandrapur to Jabalpur - is that they have missed production targets for April and are catching up. Officials at Chandrapur cited pressure of global export orders.MIL said it put its employees on ""alert mode"" after the Pahalgam attack. ""If there is urgency to expedite our production, we should be able to do it... But there is no official decision to cancel leave of employees across the 12 factories,"" a senior MIL official told TOI.On condition of anonymity, an official at Jabalpur’s Ordnance Factory-Khamaria said the order was issued “in view of national security”. An official at Ordnance Factory-Itarsi echoed this.In case of emergency, employees can apply to the “appropriate authorities”, says the order issued Thursday.At Gun & Shell Factory-Cossipore in Bengal, an employee confirmed that an order had been issued on Friday, cancelling leaves in the “current scenario”. An officer in Kolkata refused to confirm or deny the development but said it would be “logical if leaves were cancelled given the current situation”.Leaves of all employees of Badmal Ordnance Factory in Balangir, Odisha, have also been cancelled for 60 days. There is, however, no such order at OF-Bhandara (Maharashtra) under MIL, which manufactures powerful explosives RDX and HMX.A senior official from the Department of Defence Production, under which the ordnance factories come, told TOI, “We have not issued any official circular in this regard to ordnance factories. But some PSUs have internally instructed their employees to avoid going on leave due to the current scenario.”Mukesh Singh, president of Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS), one of the largest unions of the ordnance factories, told TOI, “We have come to know from our employees working in MIL that their leave has been cancelled. However, we have not got any official communication from the company as yet.”The Pune-headquartered MIL is the main ammunition manufacturing company under ministry of defence. The 12 units under it produce the Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher, IAF bombs, armour-piercing tank ammunition, high-explosive tank ammo and artillery shells, plus infantry weapons like 81mm and 51mm mortar bombs, and hand grenades (including a multi-mode type that can be switched between offensive and defensive modes). They also produce 5.56mm, 7.62mm and 9mm bullets for the full range of firearms used by infantry.At OFK and OF-Chandrapur, all 7,000 employees have been told no extended leaves will be allowed, and those sanctioned stand cancelled. The same held for OF-Itarsi.OFK is one of the largest ammunition manufacturers for the military. In the Balakot air strike, 1000-pound bombs made at OFK were used by IAF to pound locations across the LoC. And during the Kargil War, OFK supplied the fuzes for Bofors shells that smashed Pakistani positions atop mountain tops.Leaves have not been cancelled at non-MIL ordnance factories — like the five in Kanpur and Jabalpur-based Gun Carriage Factory, which manufactures the Dhanush 155mm artillery guns.A senior officer of Ordnance Factory Chandrapur (OFC) said cancellation of leaves is aimed at accelerating production. Apart from orders from Indian armed forces, MIL — a defence PSU carved out of erstwhile Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) — is also sitting on a huge export order, said sources.","MIL, agglomerate of the 12 ordnance factories across the country, has cancelled long leaves of its employees at most plants.

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been registered against renowned singer Sonu Nigam following allegations of disrespectful comments about the Kannadiga community during a musical programme in Bengaluru.The complaint was initiated by Dharmaraj A, who heads the Bengaluru city district unit of Karnataka rakshana vedike , an organisation advocating for Kannada interests.The allegations claimed that Sonu Nigam made ""objectionable and emotionally provocative"" remarks that offended the Kannadiga community's sensibilities and fostered discord amongst various linguistic groups in Karnataka.The official complaint stated, ""This complaint is lodged against the renowned singer Shri Sonu Nigam for making objectionable and emotionally provocative statements during a musical event held on April 25 and 26, at East Point College of Engineering and Technology, Virgonagar, Bengaluru, which falls under your police station's jurisdiction.

A video of Shri Sonu Nigam's statement has gone viral, causing widespread outrage among millions of Kannadigas across the state.""The event took place while the singer was performing at East Point College of Engineering and Technology in Virgonagar, Bengaluru, on April 25. When a fan persistently requested him to perform a Kannada song, Sonu refused, stating that the fan was making demands in an aggressive manner. He then stated, ""Yahi kaaran hai, Pahalgam mein jo hua hai na. Yahi kaaran hai jo kar rahe ho, jo kiya tha na abhi. Dekho toh kaun saamne khada hai."" The response drew severe backlash from not just the Kannadiga community but also from public across India, who spoke against making the comparison.Police officials have registered the case under Sections 351(2), 352(I), and 353 of the Indian Penal Code and have commenced their investigation.The controversial remarks were delivered during a stage performance and were recorded on video, which subsequently spread across social media platforms, triggering significant backlash from Karnataka residents.","FIR has been registered against renowned singer Sonu Nigam.

The estimated total cost is $131 million. “The principal contractor will be Hawkeye360, located in Herndon, Virginia,” the statement said.HawkEye 360, an American geospatial analytics private company, collects and analyses radio frequency (RF) signal location with a constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit. These satellites detect and geolocate radio frequency (RF) emissions. They track communication signals from ships, aircraft, vehicles, and coastal systems. Some vessels, which ‘go dark’ to roam undetected in disputed areas and evade tracking after turning off their Automatic Identification System (AIS), can also be detected with this advanced technology.Indian forces can now identify illegal fishing, smuggling and perform effective surveillance in the Indian Ocean Region with the help of this technology.With this technology, India gains deeper visibility across its Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently, the Indian Navy uses P8i reconnaissance aircraft and Sea Guardian drones to monitor strategic locations and detect vessels keeping their AIS switched off.The Hawkeye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers. Each layer improves detection, verification and classification of threats. EO satellites capture high-resolution daytime imagery; infrared sensors identify thermal emissions from engines and exhausts; and SAR satellites capture radar-based images regardless of weather and time. This layer confirms ship size, speed, and location. The system combines speed, precision, and adaptability and works continuously across all weather and time conditions.“The proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions,” the US statement said.","The HawkEye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday announced a series of sweeping punitive measures against Pakistan, halting all imports, suspending mail services, and denying port access to Pakistani vessels with immediate effect.The move marks a sharp escalation following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, most of them tourists.A notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on May 2, and now incorporated into the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023, states: “Direct or indirect import or transit of all goods originating in or exported from Pakistan, whether or not freely importable or otherwise permitted, shall be prohibited with immediate effect, until further orders.” Any exemptions will require explicit government approval.The Department of Posts has simultaneously suspended the exchange of all categories of mail and parcels from Pakistan via air and land routes. A government official said this suspension is in response to ""cross-border linkages"" identified in the Pahalgam strike and vowed “severe punishment to those involved in the attack.”India has also barred ships bearing the Pakistani flag from docking at any Indian port. The directive, issued in the interest of national security, also prohibits Indian-flagged vessels from visiting Pakistani ports. “This order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure, in public interest and for interest of Indian shipping,” the notification reads.Trade data reveals limited bilateral exchange in recent years. From April 2024 to January 2025, India imported just $2.88 million worth of goods from Pakistan—mainly fruits, nuts, oilseeds, and medicinal plants—while exports stood at $1.18 billion, dominated by organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

"'Born to serve J&K police and my country': Cop, family spared deportation to Pakistan after HC steps in",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/born-to-serve-jk-police-and-my-country-policeman-iftkhar-ali-family-spared-deportation-to-pakistan-after-hc-steps-in/articleshow/120847465.cms,"NEW DELHI: “I am born to serve the Jammu and Kashmir Police and my country, India,” said 45-year-old policeman Iftkhar Ali on Saturday, days after he and his eight siblings narrowly escaped being deported to Pakistan.The intervention of the Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh high court saved them from being sent across the border, a move Ali called a “conspiracy” rooted in false claims about their nationality.Ali, a resident of Salwah village in Mendhar sub-division near the Line of Control in Poonch district, has served in the police force for 27 years, earning multiple commendations for his dedication and bravery. “I have served all the wings in the police department over the past 27 years, which is evident from the scars on my body, and the citations and rewards which I have received from the department for shedding my sweat and blood for the country,” he said.Ali was among over two dozen individuals, mostly from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), who were issued 'Leave India' notices in Poonch, Rajouri, and Jammu districts last week. Many were taken to Punjab for deportation.However, after filing a petition, Ali and his siblings—Mohd Shafiq (60), Nashroon Akhter (56), Akseer Akhter (54), Mohd Shakoor (52), Naseem Akhter (50), Zulfqar Ali (49), Koser Parveen (47), and Shazia Tabasum (42) -- were brought back to their native village when the court stayed the deportation order.Justice Rahul Bharti, hearing their plea, stated, “(The) petitioners are not asked or forced to leave UT of Jammu & Kashmir. This direction is, however, subject to objections from the other side.” The Deputy Commissioner of Poonch has been asked to submit an affidavit detailing the petitioners’ property status, with the next hearing scheduled for May 20.Ali claims the deportation notice was triggered by a long-standing land dispute with his maternal uncle. “We have a land holding of nearly five hectares with another two hectares illegally usurped by my maternal uncle... The deportation notice is the outcome of that very dispute because they do not want to return our land,” he said.According to officials, Ali’s parents—Faqur Din and Fatima Bi—had crossed into PoK during the 1965 war and spent years in a Tralkhal refugee camp before returning to Salwah in 1983 with their children. Between 1997 and 2000, the J&K government admitted them as permanent residents, though their citizenship status remains pending with the Centre.The family’s ordeal came amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan following the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists. In response, the Centre announced strict measures, including downgrading diplomatic ties, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and ordering all Pakistanis on short-term visas to leave India by April 27.“We have a centuries-old history of being the bona fide residents of Salwah with both our parents and other ancestors buried in the village… the notice came as a shocker to our family comprising more than 200 members, including some serving in the Army,” Ali said. He currently serves in Katra, the base camp for pilgrims visiting the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine, and lives with his wife and three children aged 6 to 11.Despite the trauma, Ali expressed confidence in India’s leadership. He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, saying, “I am confident that the country's leadership will not allow [my] handing over to the 'enemy nation' on the 'mere conspiracy' that they belong to the part of J&K which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan.”“The most painful moment of my life was when I was told that I did not belong to this country,” he recalled. “I do not belong to Pakistan and nobody is there for me. I belong to India and this is my country. I love the police from the core of my heart and I am ready to sacrifice my life for the country.”Ali also expressed gratitude to his legal team and socio-political activist Safeer Choudhary, who supported the family during the crisis. “I also come from Mendhar and I know they have a genuine case so I came forward on humanitarian grounds to mobilise support in their favour so that they are not deported to Pakistan,” Choudhary said.","Iftkhar Ali and his eight siblings narrowly escaped being deported to Pakistan.

More man-portable air defence missile systems coming soon amid rising India-Pakistan tensions over Pahalgam attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/more-man-portable-air-defence-missile-systems-coming-soon/articleshow/120858890.cms,"Poll Do you believe that current procurement processes for defence systems are efficient? No, they need improvement Yes, very efficient

NEW DELHI: The Army is going in for the procurement of another lot of man-portable air defence missile systems , which can intercept and destroy hostile fighter jets, aircraft, drones and helicopters at ranges up to 6-km, amid the ongoing tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror massacre.The defence ministry-Army on Friday issued the tender or RFP (request for proposal) for 48 launchers, 48 night-vision sights, 85 missiles and a missile test station of the very short-range air defence system-new generation ( VSHORADS-NG ). Vendors have been told to submit their bids by May 20.""The fire-and-forget VSHORADS-NG, based on infra-red homing technology, are needed by Army to meet the evolving dynamic air threat. There are major shortages in such man-portable systems for terminal and point defence against all types of aerial threats,"" an officer said.The RFP said the all-weather air defence system, which should have anti-jamming characteristics and be capable of being para-dropped, will be employed across all kinds of terrain, ranging from plains and deserts to high-altitude areas of around 4,500-metres.The indigenous VSHORADS being developed by DRDO is still not ready for production and induction, with the latest set of trials being conducted in Feb this year. Consequently, the Army and IAF had earlier also inducted a limited number of such systems under emergency provisions due to the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh with China.They included the Russian Igla-S man-portable air defence systems, assembled in India by Adani Defence. While the Army and IAF have the old Igla-1M systems since 1989, the shoulder-fired Igla-S is an improved variant with a longer interception range of up to 6-km.Now, the tense situation with Pakistan seems to have triggered a fresh round of procurements. A tri-Service case for acquisition of 5,175 VSHORADS and associated equipment was initiated way back in June 2009, which eventually led to the Igla-S system being selected over the French and Swedish systems in the fray. But the major project, which was to include an initial off-the-shelf purchase followed by technology transfer to Bharat Dynamics for subsequent production, did not take off.In Jan 2023, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council had accorded ""acceptance of necessity"" for procurement of the infrared-homing VSHORADS missiles under design and development by DRDO at a cost of Rs 1,920 crore, as was then reported by TOI","The defence ministry-Army on Friday issued the tender or RFP for 48 launchers, 48 night-vision sights, 85 missiles and a missile test station.

No, people form their opinions independently. Yes, they can significantly impact views.

SRINAGAR: National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah said Saturday the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack that left 26 people dead could not have taken place without local assistance. “I don’t think these things can happen unless someone supports them,” he said.Abdullah also reiterated his party’s longstanding opposition to Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying the agreement has harmed the region’s interests and must be reviewed.His comments about local support in the Pahalgam attack drew criticism from PDP president and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti. She called his remarks “deeply disturbing” and “regrettable”.“As a senior leader, that too as a Kashmiri, his statement risks fuelling divisive narratives providing ammunition to certain media channels to further stereotype & stigmatise Kashmiris and Muslims,” Mufti said in a post on X. “This isn’t only misleading but fatal at a time when students and traders from J&K are already facing heightened vulnerability and attacks.”NC pushed back against Mufti’s interpretation of the remarks. Party chief spokesman Tanvir Sadiq accused her of twisting Abdullah’s words and demanded an apology.“It’s shocking that someone who has served as CM would stoop this low. Farooq Abdullah never mentioned ‘Kashmiris’ or ‘locals’,” Sadiq said in a statement. “At a time when we’re trying to protect Kashmiri students, traders, and families across India, it’s shameful to misrepresent his words and endanger them further.”Abdullah visited the family of Syed Adil Hussain Shah, the pony handler killed in the attack, at Hapatnar in Pahalgam. He welcomed central govt’s announcement to suspend the water treaty with Pakistan and urged govt to divert Chenab water to Jammu and build power infrastructure on Jhelum in Kashmir.“We do not want their (Pakistan's) water supply to be stopped, but we have a right on our rivers. Today if you go to Jammu, you see there is a huge shortage of water,” he said.Abdullah recalled that his government had tried to draw water from the Chenab to Jammu but was blocked by the World Bank under IWT restrictions. “Today is the opportunity for us to divert this water from there to Jammu,” he said.“In Kashmir we are deprived of electricity. We can generate thousands of megawatts,” he added, calling on the government to build hydropower infrastructure on the Jhelum.Referring to the Pahalgam attack, Abdullah said: “They (terrorists) have lost it. It has been proven today that we are not going to get scared. Kashmir was and will always be a part of India.

'Will take firm & decisive action against terrorists': PM Modi on Pahalgam attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-take-firm-decisive-action-against-terrorists-pm-modi-on-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120858701.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is committed to taking “firm and decisive” action against the terrorists who perpetrated the Pahalgam attack and those who support them, said PM Narendra Modi amid repeated calls by the global community for restraint and de-escalation and as tensions soar with Pakistan. After a bilateral meeting with visiting Angola President João Manuel Lourenço, Modi said both leaders agreed that terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity.Modi delivered his media statement after the meeting in Hindi but switched over to English while talking about the April 22 attack and India’s resolve for decisive action against the perpetrators. The PM had done the same 2 days after the attack while speaking in Madhubani in Bihar where he, in his first response to the tourist massacre, pledged to identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers.Modi’s remarks on the Pahalgam attack, particularly about action against those who support terrorists, are significant as these suggest India hasn’t given up on the military option for pursuing those who perpetrated the attack and their backers. Lourenço, who currently holds the chairmanship of the African Union, also strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed solidarity with the Indian people.As the government weighs punitive measures against Pakistan for its role in the attack, it has come under some serious pressure from friends and partners like the US, EU and Gulf countries to avoid any escalation and resolve the cross-border terrorism issue with Pakistan diplomatically.Modi was speaking days after US secretary of state Marco Rubio urged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate and work for peace in South Asia. His counterpart S Jaishankar had responded by saying that the perpetrators must be brought to justice. Rubio’s comments were followed by remarks by US Vice President JD Vance that India’s response to the attack should not lead to any broader regional conflict. Unlike Rubio though, Vance seemed to throw a noose around Pakistan’s neck by explicitly asking it to work with India “to the extent that they are responsible” and ensure that the terrorists “sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down”. The state department too said Modi had full support of the US on terrorism, in comments apparently meant to assure India that Washington is not tone-deaf to India’s anxieties about Pakistan’s backing of terrorists.Modi was also speaking a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh cancelled his visit to Moscow for Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on May 9.“I thanked President Lourenço and the people of Angola for their condolences on the loss of lives in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam. India is committed to taking firm and decisive action against the terrorists and those who support them. We thank Angola for their support in our fight against cross-border terrorism,’’ said the PM, while announcing an expansion of the energy partnership with the southwestern African country that is an important supplier of oil and gas to India. Modi also announced a $ 200 million defence credit line for the modernization of Angola’s armed forces.","India committed to taking ‘firm and decisive’ action against the terrorists who perpetrated the Pahalgam attack and those who support them, said PM Narendra Modi.

‘Move doesn’t reflect desire for justice, but is diversionary ploy’



Poll Do you believe that Pakistan's proposal for a 'neutral' probe is genuine? No, it is a deception Yes, it is genuine

NEW DELHI: India has rejected Pakistan's proposal for a ""neutral"" probe into the mass killings at Pahalgam by dismissing it as a deception meant to distract attention from Islamabad's complicity in the slaughter of innocent tourists. ""They are pursuing their familiar playbook of deception and duplicity.The term 'neutral' is nothing but a loaded euphemism for the blatant lie that those making the offer were not complicit in the carnage. They are trying to pull the wool over the world's eyes,"" an official told TOI.It does not reflect a desire for justice, but is a diversionary ploy. They are trying to deflect international attention, evade scrutiny and accountability and undermine India’s right to defend its sovereignty and security.”Another source said, “Neutrality in investigation implies a dispute over facts, but here the facts about the identity of the perpetrators and their masterminds are incontrovertible and consistent with the pattern of use of terror gangs as an instrument of proxy war. It is the Pakistani state itself that has been using terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e Mohammad to further its objectives.” Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif first spoke of “a credible and neutral probe”, and found endorsement from China. Then, US secretary of state Marco Rubio last week asked India to work together with Pakistan, raising eyebrows here.“The focus must not be merely on individual perpetrators but on the Pakistani state that has enabled, equipped and exported terrorism. It is time for the international community to hold Pakistan accountable for not just the Pahalgam killings but also for raising and sustaining a terror infrastructure that has been responsible for killings in different countries. Falling for Pakistan’s neutrality rhetoric is a betrayal of justice for the victims of Pahalgam but also of victims of all the terror attacks that have been traced to Pakistan,” said a source, pointing to the arrests of Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh, one of the plotters of the 9/11 attack, in Pakistan.India’s contempt for the idea of an allegedly neutral probe is rooted in the bitter experience it has had with Pakistan over the decades. Sources pointed out that Islamabad had denied any link to the 26/11 assault on Mumbai until investigation forced them to acknowledge Ajmal Kasab’s Pakistani citizenship. India agreed to a joint probe into the attack on the Pathankot airbase only to realise that Pakistan used the mechanism to stall the investigation and protect the perpetrators.“Blaming the alleged non-state actors for the terror attacks they organise is a tactic which has no takers now. They have deployed it right since 1947, when their army regulars disguised themselves as tribal lashkars to invade J&K. It was put to use in 1965 as part of Operation Gibraltar when their soldiers masquerading as locals unsuccessfully tried to trigger an uprising; and at the time of incursions in Kargil in 1999 when their regulars and terrorists were responsible,” said a source, pointing out that no action was taken against the perpetrators of 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, 26/11 terrorist strikes and Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy despite India providing irrefutable evidence.“Hafiz Saeed and Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi continue to play with impunity. The worst thing is the brazenness with which they go about this. They lied to the world that Sajid Mir, one of the masterminds of 26/11, was dead but he was found to be alive. Then they claimed that he was in jail.”","India rejects Pakistan's proposal for a 'neutral' probe into the mass killings at Pahalgam.

Somewhat concerned Very concerned

NEW DELHI: Days before the Pahalgam massacre, terror chatter picked up from across the border indicated terrorists' plans to hit tourist places in J&K, particularly hotels on outskirts of Srinagar, more specifically areas like Dachigam, etc, senior officials following the investigations told TOI on Saturday.J&K Police sources, however, insisted that while intelligence was available on likely terror plans to target tourists and hotels, it was generic in nature, also naming non-local migrant labourers, Hindu pilgrims and Kashmiri pandits as potential targets and several areas like Kulgam, Pulwama, etc, as ""vulnerable spots"". There was no mention of Baisaran, which had no history of terror activity or attacks, in these inputs. The intelligence was followed up, with J&K Police brass camping in Srinagar to ensure that security at several prominent tourist places and hotels was tightened.Sources said the two local terrorists - Adil Thoker and Asif Sheikh - in the Pahalgam attack team had blended in with the tourists before herding them into the food stalls area, making it easier for the male victims to be segregated. They added that the entry and exit to Baisaran, which is open round the year barring periods of heavy snowfall and Amarnath Yatra - is ticketed and a fence installed since a tender to manage it for three years was awarded to a Bijbehara businessman last year.The outskirts of Srinagar in the foothills of Zabarwan range were seen as prone to attacks as a group of Pakistani terrorists linked to two attacks in Oct 2024 - at Gagangir, in which six non-local labourers and a doctor were killed, and at Buta Pathri, which left two Army personnel and two Army porters dead - was supposedly active there. Investigations so far suggest that Hashim Musa, the Pakistani assailant in Pahalgam also involved in Gagangir and Buta Pathri attacks, was in Tral along with another Pakistani and two local terrorists, days before they struck in Baisaran.An officer said agencies have looked into the possibility of terrorists having initially planned to strike during PM Modi's April 19 visit to J&K to flag off a train service between Katra and Srinagar. The motive of the terrorists, backed by Pakistan's ISI, could have been to divert attention from the major rail infrastructure upgrade, a source said adding that when the PM's visit was called due to bad weather, the terrorists, who were possibly hiding in Tral by then, waited until April 22 to execute the attack.A second police officer said the terrorists chose to hit tourists to demolish the 'normalcy' narrative, with the record tourist arrivals in the Valley being cited as a barometer of normalcy. Overground support, another functionary said, was a reality with three of every 10 OGWs being hardcore, ideologically committed cadre. Hitting the other seven, who may be working for some quick money, by having their houses demolished may be counter-productive as they also double up as intelligence assets, it was stressed. The houses of nearly nine OGWs in J&K were demolished in the wake of Pahalgam attack; the Omar Abdullah govt is said to have requested the Centre to exercise caution.Officials on Saturday flagged use and recovery of sophisticated weapons - suspected to be left behind by NATO troops in Afghanistan - in Kashmir.","Terror chatter picked up from across the border indicated terrorists' plans to hit tourist places in J&K.

NEW DELHI: In a significant escalation of economic offensive in the wake of the Pahalgam attack , govt on Saturday moved to choke trade flows from Pakistan by imposing a blanket ban on all shipments - direct or routed through third countries, as well as mails and parcels from its hostile neighbour.It also barred Pakistan-flagged ships from entering Indian ports and prohibited Indian vessels from docking in Pakistan, signalling a hardening stance amid deteriorating bilateral ties.""This comprehensive ban, including indirect imports, will enable custom authorities to prevent Pakistani goods from entering India through circumvention,"" an official told TOI. This is the second major non-military offensive after visa restrictions were announced.While direct trade is relatively low, third-party trade is estimated to be in multiples of direct trade between the two countries. Govt’s decision to impose 200% tariff on Pakistani imports and withdrawal of MFN (most favoured nation) status after the Pulwama attack has resulted in more consignments flowing through other countries as direct imports from Pakistan crashed from nearly $500 million in 2018-19 to $480,000 in 2023-24. Horticulture produce, cement, salt and cotton yarn were the most affected products, sources said.Even before this, considerable amounts of goods were entering from Pakistan via third countries. After 2019, these flows increased, particularly through UAE and Sri Lanka, possibly by misusing trade agreements — an issue that Indian authorities failed to adequately monitor.A lot of Pakistani fruits, dry dates, leather and textiles are repackaged and relabelled in UAE, while chemicals and specialty products are routed through Singapore. Indonesia is said to be the transit route for cement, soda ash and raw materials used by the textiles sector. Similarly, dry fruits, salt and leather goods are reprocessed and routed through Sri Lanka using SAFTA benefits. If the ban is strictly imposed, the flow of goods through these routes can be choked but it’s unclear how govt wants to tackle this.

NEW DELHI: In a first of its kind initiative, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) - India's premier agri research organisation - has developed the country's first genome-edited climate-resilient varieties of rice to boost yields and conserve water.The ICAR claimed that the cultivation of these improved rice varieties -- ‘ DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)’ and ‘ Pusa DST Rice 1 ’ -- in about 5 million hectares of the recommended area will produce 4.5 million tons of additional paddy and save a minimum 7,500 million cubic meters of irrigation water. Besides, it will also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (32,000 tons).Genome-editing, particularly the CRISPR-Cas technology , is being recognised as a breakthrough in precision breeding. It enables scientists to make targeted changes in the native genes of living organisms, creating new and desirable traits without introducing foreign DNA.""Development of these two varieties using genome editing technology has paved the way for using this innovative method in other crops too for higher yields, climate resilience and improved quality to achieve the targets of Viksit Bharat,"" said an official note, released by the ICAR, on late Saturday. Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will formally release these two varieties on Sunday.Recognizing the transformative potential of new technology, the ICAR initiated a genome-editing research project in rice in 2018 and selected two widely cultivated mega rice varieties -- ‘Samba Mahsuri (BPT5204)’ and ‘MTU1010 (Cottondora Sannalu)’ -- to further enhance their qualities through technological interventions.The ICAR scientists eventually enhanced these varieties with better stress tolerance, improved yield, and climate adaptability without compromising their existing strengths, and developed two new genome-edited varieties ‘Kamala’ and ‘Pusa DST Rice 1’.""The initiative marks a significant step forward in India’s efforts to ensure food security and sustainable agriculture in the face of mounting environmental challenges. There are few concerns about the Intellectual Property Rights of the technology which are being looked after and will be resolved in times to come,"" said the ICAR.The genome-edited 'DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' is recommended for cultivation across major rice-growing states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The other new variety - ‘Pusa DST Rice 1' - is also recommended for cultivation in most of these states.Currently, genome-editing programmes have also been initiated by the ICAR in many crops including oilseeds and pulses.","Indian Council of Agricultural Research has developed the country's first genome-edited climate-resilient varieties of rice.

Police response and current situation

NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions following the murder of Hindutva activist Suhas Shetty, the Mangaluru Police have imposed a prohibitory order across the city from Friday until May 6. Shetty, a known rowdy sheeter and Hindutva activist, was killed by a group of unidentified assailants late Thursday evening within the Bajpe police station limits in Mangaluru City.On Thursday evening, around 8:30 pm, Suhas Shetty was traveling with five associates—Sanjay, Prajwal, Anvith, Latheesh, and Shashank—when their vehicle was intercepted near Kinnipadavu Cross by a group of assailants.The attackers, numbering around six, were traveling in a Swift car and a pickup truck. They ambushed Shetty and his group, assaulting him with deadly weapons, inflicting severe injuries.Despite being rushed to AJ Hospital, Shetty succumbed to his wounds. The police have since registered a murder case and are actively working to identify and apprehend the perpetrators.Shetty was a well-known rowdy sheeter with five criminal cases—four in Mangaluru City and one in Dakshina Kannada district.Given Shetty's affiliations, his murder is considered a sensitive issue, prompting the police to launch a manhunt to locate the perpetrators.Notably, he was one of the accused in the 2022 murder of Mohammed Fazil, a 23-year-old resident of Mangalapete in Katipalla. Fazil's killing had already stirred significant tensions across the coastal region.In response to the incident, police issued the prohibitory order under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, enforced across the entire Mangaluru City Police jurisdiction.City police commissioner Anupam Agrawal, who also serves as the additional district magistrate, announced that public gatherings, meetings, processions, sloganeering, and the carrying of items that could be used as weapons are prohibited during this period. The measure aims to prevent any potential flare-ups and maintain public order in the aftermath of the murder.Preliminary investigations suggest that the attack on Shetty was premeditated, though the exact motive remains unclear. The police have confirmed that investigations are ongoing.Following the murder, Bajrang Dal had called for a city bandh late on Thursday night, and some miscreants attempted to pelt stones at buses.

"Kash Patel, Indian-origin FBI director, accused of spending more time at nightclubs than office",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patel-indian-origin-fbi-director-accused-of-spending-more-time-at-nightclubs-than-office/articleshow/120851560.cms,"Kash Patel is accused of spending more time in Las Vegas home and at night clubs than in his FBI office.

Chaos at FBI headquarters; Kash Patel works from Las Vegas home remotely



Senate Democrats call for probe into Patel's usage of jets



A former FBI official on MSNBC's Morning Joe program commented that FBI director Kash Patel, despite the fear that was spread ahead of his confirmation that he would dismantle the system if he became the FBI director, has surprisingly taken a backseat.Former FBI counter-intelligence official Frank Figliuzzi said Kash Patel is spotted more at nightclubs and less at the office, but people are not complaining because they think things would have been bad, had he been trying to run them, given his experience or the lack of it.""Yeah well, reportedly, he's been visible at nightclubs far more than he has been on the seventh floor of the Hoover building,"" Figliuzzi replied. ""And there are reports that daily briefings to him have been changed from every day to maybe twice weekly. """"So this is both a blessing and a curse, because if you, if he's, really trying to run things without his experience, without any experience level, things could be bad. If he's not plugged in, things could be bad. But he's allowing agents to run things so we don't know where this is going.""Figliuzzi said people tell him that the FBI headquarters is chaos as nobody is clued in about the everyday activities and Kash Patel spends a lot of his time at his home in Las Vegas. "" People don't know what's happening from day to day. There's also been reporting, I believe, from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, that Patel spent a lot of his time at his home in Las Vegas –– he's been sort of working remotely for at least part of the week.""Some Senate Democrats have called for a probe into Patel's use of FBI's private fleet of jets for his personal purposes, including trips to visit his girlfriend and attend hockey games and other sporting events. If there is an investigation, then the US Government Accountability Office will look into the reason behind Patel's frequent trips, how much they cost the government.","Former FBI counter-intelligence official Frank Figliuzzi said Kash Patel is spotted more at nightclubs and less at the office.

In a historic political shift, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is poised to form government in Delhi after 27 years, securing a commanding two-thirds majority in the assembly elections 2025. The BJP's resounding victory ends over a decade of governance by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by Arvind Kejriwal The last BJP government in Delhi served from 1993 to 1998, marking this win as a significant comeback for the party.Of the 70 assembly constituencies, the BJP clinched 48 seats, while AAP managed to secure only 22. This landslide victory saw several prominent AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia , former minister Satyendra Jain , and Saurabh Bharadwaj, losing their constituencies.In a closely watched contest, Kejriwal lost the New Delhi assembly seat to BJP's Parvesh Verma by a margin of 4,089 votes. Meanwhile, Congress' score remained zero as the party failed to secure any seat.Here's are the winners and losers in the Delhi assembly elections 2025Yet again, he was BJP’s mascot, chief campaigner and the man who had to compensate for the local party unit’s lack of a formidable ﬁgure. That he led BJP to a big victory proves he remains a big vote-getter and a great motivator for party cadre. He adroitly wooed both lower-income groups and middle classes. His high-decibel campaign speeches against AAP’s ‘corruption’ framed BJP’s charge against AAP chief. The Delhi victory, coming on top of BJP’s Haryana and Maharashtra wins, has pretty much restored Brand Modi, which had taken a few knocks after Lok Sabha elections.So, that’s one more job off his 'to-do' list. Delhi had eluded Modi’s BJP since 2014 and Shah had strategised hard both in 2015 and 2020. He did it again this time, framing a broad strategy as well as ﬁxing the nuts and bolts. Getting the party cadre to believe that Kejriwal was beatable was not easy. But, helped by Modi’s aggressive dubbing of Aam Aadmi Party as ""AAP-da"" (disaster), he managed to turn the mood around. His decision to ﬁeld Pravesh Verma against Kejriwal was a master stroke typical of BJP’s no.2.Humble, accessible, ﬁercely honest, a new kind of politician who promises a new kind of politics. That was his image in 2013, when he burst onto the political scene. Now? Hubristic, yet another leader who allegedly uses govt for political funding, a politician who's lost touch with those who made him a success, seemingly uncaring that the city he governed became a byword for urban mismanagement. Kejriwal's rise to power and prominence was as spectacular as his fall from grace. That he — humiliatingly — couldn't even RETAIN the seat he's won three times since 2013 makes it even worse.His star rose with Kejriwal's. But he had an early intimation of trouble in the last assembly polls. He had just scraped through in Patparganj in 2020 and shifted to Jangpura this time. That made him look like he was running away. The defeat in Jangpura has dealt him a severe political blow. Like it's for Kejriwal, his successes — supposedly the brain behind AAP's transformation of govt schools in Delhi — are now a distant memory. Not a mass politician on his own, what happens to his political career depends entirely on whether Kejriwal can recover from this defeat.Daughter of academics and plucked out of obscurity by Kejriwal, she became a media star for AAP, followed by her appointment as an advisor to the then-deputy CM Sisodia. She was the SAFE choice for Kejriwal when he had to GIVE UP CMship after being sent to jail. No one took her seriously in that job, including many in AAP. She was CM for 135 days and could do nothing to change the perception of non-governance by AAP. Her win, after a big scare during counting, is of little consolation to either her or her party.For the Gandhis, nothing's worked since Congress turned in an impressive show in Lok Sabha elections. Delhi is the third election loss since LS, and 2025 is the third time Congress has scored a duck in the city. Brother and sister campaigned in the capital but made little difference to overall results. But, funnily, all’s not bad for the Gandhis. That Congress may have cost AAP votes and that AAP was beaten roundly is, ﬁrst, revenge for Congress and, second, a buffer against other regional satraps’ critiques. Had AAP won, TMC, SP would have come down hard on Gandhis and their party.","BJP secured a commanding two-thirds majority in the assembly elections 2025.

BJP-AAP vote share gap is quite small. So, what swung the election decisively in BJP’s favour? Some short takes:

Saffron's long march

Taking the middle out



‘Fakes’ among freebies

Brand Kejriwal loses sheen



Modi hai toh…

NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday witnessed a saffron tsunami with the BJP securing a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.Aam Aadmi Party, however, maintained a stronghold in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated constituencies.What seemed to have worked in favour of the BJP was the, middle class andfactor (excise policy case), along with the ""sheeshmahal"" attack on AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal during the poll campaign.What seemed to not have worked in AAP's favour were issues like poor roads, traffic congestion, Yamuna pollution, and poor air quality.BJP’s campaign for Delhi started much before polls were announced. Every bad headline against AAP was followed by a sustained BJP campaign, hurting the incumbent. Closer to elections, ‘sheesh mahal’, as BJP cleverly named the generously refurbished CM residence, hurt AAP’s image even more.After initially criticising AAP’s freebie game, BJP, too, made populist promises with gusto. BJP also talked up the idea of a double-engine sarkar, even as perceptions of govt dysfunctionality took hold, in part thanks to the LG-AAP fight. By the time polls were held, many voters had bought BJP’s argumentVote-share stats make it clear AAP has lost little of its core low-income vote. BJP would have always strategised with that assumption — and therefore it targeted Delhi’s neo-middle class and middle class, who were more upset with the state of roads, traffic, Yamuna, and air pollution than they were impressed by free water, power and primary health care.To that, BJP added the announcement of the 8th Pay Commission — Delhi voters include many govt employees and their families — and the Budget’s income tax cuts.BJP campaigned hard against some elements of AAP’s welfare policy regime. ‘Fake medicines’ and ‘ghost patients’ in free mohalla clinics was one such campaign. AAP contested these claims hotly.But some of those charges stuck when coupled with demonstrable failures like Yamuna ﬂowing as dirty as ever and desperate AAP claims like Haryana’s BJP govt ‘poisoning’ Yamuna water.That AAP suffered big losses in seats along the Haryana border tells this story powerfully.Kejriwal started as a ‘humble man of the people’ who didn’t want to stay in govt bungalows. But he came into these polls as a very different leader. He and his colleagues didn’t recognise that aside from anti-incumbency against AAP, there was anti-incumbency against Kejriwal himself.When things turned against AAP, Modi’s appeal, dormant in the last two assembly polls, came to the fore. He was front and centre in BJP’s campaign and his sharp attacks and promises of smooth coordination between the Centre and Delhi made an appreciable difference","The BJP secured a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.

KejriWall to KejriFall: How a crusader lost his way & vision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwall-to-kejrifall-how-a-crusader-lost-his-way-vision/articleshow/118080246.cms,"Once upon a time, there was an Arvind Kejriwal . A crusader against corruption, he brought back forgotten words, such as integrity and idealism, into the political discourse and created immense possibilities of an alternative model of clean governance. His first swearing-in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan in the winter of 2013 didn’t feel like a momentary celebration of people’s power.It was more like the beginning of a movement for positive change in the way politics was conducted in the country. Thousands of ageing men and women had turned up from every corner of India Ignored, from distant states like Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Even his off-key rendition of, “Insaan ka insaan se ho bhaichara ” (film: Paigham), was no dampener.For them, in short, Kejriwal was an icon of hope for a new, fearless India.In the weeks and months that followed, Kejriwal grew in reputation as an individual and politician. Often dressed in a bush shirt, carrying a cheap ballpoint pen in his shirt pocket and wearing ordinary chappals, he became the perfect picture of austerity. And he kept his electoral promise of free water and electricity, schemes that endeared him to the city’s teeming lower-income class.When AAP , formed in 2012, returned a second time to office in 2015 with a crushing majority to stop the ModiShah juggernaut, Kejriwal became a hero of everyone opposed to BJP. And, yes, despite the ever-present cough and the comforting muffler around his head, he slept on the streets of Delhi in the winter cold as a protesting chief minister. Those days the former-IRS-of ficer-turned-activist-turned-politician — also a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay award — walked the talk.But over the years, slowly but surely, the hallowed persona of a CM with a frugal lifestyle wore off. And, on Saturday, the after-effect was seen in the outcome of the Delhi assembly polls. Two full terms and 49 days since it first assumed office in 2013, AAP suffered a shattering and humbling defeat. And Kejriwal, the party’s founder and beating heart, who had once bested then formidable CM Sheila Dixit by over 25,000 votes, lost his own seat by more than 4,000 votes. AAP still managed a healthy 44% votes, but that’s 9 percentage points lower than the previous assembly polls.Journalist Ashutosh, formerly a prominent member of AAP, says that two things massively damaged Kejriwal’s image: the 2022 liquor case and the CM bungalow controversy. “Nobody expected a man, who used to say that ministers and CMs should be living in two-room flats, to spend over Rs 40 crore on his own bungalow. Kejriwal entered politics hoping to change it. In stead, politics changed him,” he says.The multi-crore liquor case, which is still in court, led to Kejriwal spending five months in Tihar. These developments, says Ashutosh, caused Kejriwal to lose his moral aura in the last five years. “It was his calling card in the first three assembly elections, the reason for AAP’s massive victories in 2015 and 2020,” he says.Social commentator Santosh Desai, too, talks about the chipping away of the AAP leader’s personal aura due to the liquor case and the house renovation controversy. But he also adds that BJP stymied Kejriwal and his party from any meaningful local government action. “Their hands were tied and the room to manoeuvre was dramatically reduced,” he says.Desai also says that Kejriwal’s situation was akin to someone who, to stay politically relevant, reaches a place unrecognisable from the original point of his journey. “He may not be communal personally, but to neutralise the right wing, he started practising a version of it, so that the party is not vulnerable on that front. Kejriwal lost clarity on who he was and what he represented, enabling the BJP to maximise on the situation to its advantage. Put together, it created a situation where the public felt that Kejirwal was no longer the figure he once was,” he says.Free electricity (200 units), free water (20 kilolitres), improved govt schools, better functioning of govt hospitals (including free medicine) — Kejriwal created a positive playbook for freebies that exhilarated the lower-income classes, making them his dedicated constituency. AAP also offered free bus rides to women, but the deteriorating condition of Delhi’s roads and the unchecked pollution underlined that the party wasn’t paying enough attention to its core jobs and the city’s middle class.Desai says that AAP took its eyes off the ball, from its main calling card, which is taking civic governance seriously. “They were just living off what was done in their early years. After that, it became much more about retention of power,” he says.Political scientist Dipankar Gupta offers a fresh angle to the list of explanations. He says that AAP emerged out of a movement but, over the years, lost the “movement dimension” — participatory, enthusiastic and goal-oriented — of the party. “Without the ‘movement’ element, it lost its raison d’etre and became a competitor of the established parties. Structurally, AAP was never an administration-oriented party,” he says.Hilal Ahmed of CSDS offers a similar view. He avers that AAP had lost its ideological uniqueness even before this election. “The cadres or leaders associated with it were relying heavily on the success of the party over the years. After this defeat they might not find any attraction in the party or the figure of Kejriwal,” he says.So what next for Kejriwal?“He must find a new language for democracy, not just representation and election. Otherwise, he will remain caught up in the numerical pathology of the welfare state,” says social scientist Shiv Visvanathan. In other words, Kejriwal needs to reinvent his politics. The question is: does the street-fighter of the past have the stomach for a scrap in a hopelessly slanted battle?","Arvind Kejriwal was an icon of hope for a new, fearless India.

""The fine is imposed on those who commit wrong.

He stressed that better enforcement of these laws could regulate the sector more effectively.Parameshwara acknowledged differences in approach but emphasised the need for a dedicated law.Karnataka government is now set to address the governor's concerns and resubmit the ordinance, keeping its objective of preventing borrower harassment intact.","Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot rejected Karnataka Micro Finance (Prevention of Coercive Actions) Ordinance 2025.

How Jodhpur's restored stepwells are becoming cultural hubs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-jodhpurs-restored-stepwells-are-becoming-cultural-hubs/articleshow/118079874.cms,"OLD SPACE, NEW USE: Surface, an exhibition at Toorji ka Jhalra, uses the heritage setting dating back to the 1740s to showcase the country’s rich textile traditions

On a typical afternoon at Jodhpur's Toorji ka Jhalra , an ancient stepwell within the walled part of the old city, one can spot local teens flinging themselves off its intricately carved ledges before vanishing into the cool, green water below only to surface seconds later, grinning. A few steps away, a photographer trains his camera on a young couple against its ancient carvings while a weary tourist lounges on another step with his headphones on.Nearby, a sarangi player keeps passersby entertained with familiar Rajasthani folk tunes appropriated by Bollywood.Watching them, it's almost impossible to believe that this 18th-century relic was a dumping ground, buried under decades of stagnant water, not too long ago.Commissioned in the 1740s by Maharaja Abhaya Singh's queen, Toor, in keeping with the tradition of royal women patronising public waterworks, these cisterns - shaped like upside-down pyramids - were a lifeline in the desert. Persian wheels, powered by oxen, once hauled up water from their sandstone recesses. But with modern plumbing, they fell into disuse. Until now.Toorji ka Jhalra too seemed destined for the same fate until it got a second chance. Today, it stands restored at the heart of Stepwell Square, an Insta-friendly hotspot with high-end boutiques, artisanal cafes, and a chic heritage hotel flanking its steps.The transformation began with a casual conversation between brothers Dhananjaya and Nikhilendra Singh, cousins of the Maharaja of Jodhpur. Fresh off their success restoring an 18th-century Rajput mansion into the luxury boutique hotel Raas, they wondered: ""Why can't we rejuvenate the whole neighbourhood?"" The idea birthed the JDH Urban Regeneration Project, an initiative using design, technology, fashion and culture to revive Jodhpur's gullies, havelis, and bazaars for contemporary creative use.Over the past fortnight, Toorji ka Jhalra and the havelis surrounding it have played host to Surface, an exhibition where Jodhpur's centuries-old architecture is in quiet conversation with textile traditions, with embroidered textile installations stretched, draped, and suspended across alcoves of old havelis.At Achal Niwas, one of the first things that catch your eye is the mehrab - the classic arch motif seen all over Jodhpur. Textile designer Chinar Farooqui reinterprets it in thread, deconstructed into embroidered panels filled with clusters of smaller arches, floral patterns, and jali screens - each a fresh take on an architectural silhouette that defined such homes.Inside Anoop Singh ki Haveli - a still-lived-in space where the family gathers for evening aarti, a patchwork of textiles tell a cross-country story - quilts from Bihar and Bhuj Lambani (Banjara) embroidery revived by the Porgai Artisans Association in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and even an Australia-India collaboration where aboriginal artists and embroiderers from Bengaluru have woven ancestral stories across continents.Curator Mayank Singh Kaul sees Surface as part of a larger effort to take exhibitions beyond institutional or sterile white cube spaces into communities. ""I've done similar projects at an old govt school in a weaving village in Andhra Pradesh, repurposing three heritage homes in Hampi's Anegundi and the 125-year-old Lakshmi Mills in Coimbatore for a show on khadi,"" he says."" These exhibitions, he says, act as ""mobile libraries,"" bringing textile archives to regions where such resources don't exist. ""They become reference points for designers, artisans and students who otherwise have no access.""To understand the scale of Jodhpur's stepwell revival, one has to look beyond Toorji ka Jhalra. Across the city, multipronged efforts are on to reclaim these subterranean marvels. ""Stepwells weren't just water sources,"" explains Anu Mridul, a Jodhpur-based architect leading several of the city's stepwell restoration efforts. ""They were community spaces. Merchants traveling on spice or silk routes would rest here and within cities, they served as gathering spots for locals. Sadly, most of them were abandoned once piped water became the norm,"" says Mridul whose team has restored several stepwells including the 300-year-old Mayla Bagh and Naulakha Bawdi, with work now underway at Tapi Bawdi, one of Jodhpur's oldest stepwells.Cleaning up a stepwell is just the first step, says Dhananjaya Singh. ""If you don't find a meaningful way to use a restored space, it fades into obscurity again."" One way is by turning them into cultural hubs, like Toorji ka Jhalra. At Mayla Bagh ka Jhalra, a 150-ft-deep stepwell built in 1775-76, Mridul has partnered with the non-profit Scwedia Foundation to maintain the space, provide Wi-Fi, and host public events. On any given day, students study its stones and architecture, locals lounge and play cards while some even bring their laptops to work.Sauryansh Singh of Scwedia has been at it for six months now. ""We've cleaned it up, added ambient lighting along the jharokhas and steps and are now building a transparent stage over the water, so performers will literally be floating while the audience watches from the perimeter,"" he says. Later this month, Mayla ka Jhalra will host a three-day festival of music, dance and talks. ""It's fascinating how a centuries-old structure can still supply water and generate revenue for the community,"" adds Mridul.","The JDH Urban Regeneration Project uses design, technology, fashion and culture to revive Jodhpur's gullies, havelis, and bazaars for contemporary creative use.

Delhi's Modi garden: BJP sweeps out AAP in big win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhis-modi-garden-bjp-sweeps-out-aap-in-big-win/articleshow/118079653.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi has once again proved that he can pull out big wins, this time by leading BJP to a historic victory in the Delhi assembly elections This triumph not only marks BJP's return to office in the Capital after a gap of 26 years, but it also shatters the ""myth"" that PM Modi's appeal is confined to national elections .The Delhi polls were seen as a litmus test for Modi's influence beyond the national stage as the saffron party didn't project any face and the PM was the sole mascot.His critics had long argued that while Modi could secure a landslide for BJP in national elections, his charm was less effective in state-level contests due to localised issues and regional identities. However, the results from Delhi tell a different story. BJP, under Modi's leadership, has not only won but has done so decisively, clinching 48 out of 70.Modi's campaign strategy in Delhi was multi-faceted, focusing on development, governance and a personal connection with the electorate. Unlike previous elections where regional leaders often took precedence, Modi himself became BJP's mascot for these polls.His rallies were not just about national achievements such as the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya or the abrogation of Article 370 but also addressed Delhi-specific issues like pollution, infrastructure gaps and the cleaning of Yamuna.This victory underscores Modi's ability to translate his national narrative into local victories, blending his overarching vision for India with the immediate needs of Delhi's residents. His speeches, particularly the one at the BJP headquarters post-victory, emphasised building Delhi as a ""modern city"" with a focus on urban infrastructure, mobility and heritage preservation, resonating with the urban voter's aspirations.The political narrative around Modi's electoral ""invincibility"" has been a subject of debate.In the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP under Modi swept all seven seats in Delhi, reinforcing his image as a national leader with strong voter appeal. However, the Delhi assembly elections of 2015 and 2020 saw AAP under Arvind Kejriwal clinch victories, fuelling the narrative that Modi's influence might not extend to regional politics. Saturday's result challenges that notion, showing that Modi's personal guarantees and BJP's campaign strategy can indeed sway voters at both levels.Moreover, this victory comes at a time when BJP's national popularity had shown signs of plateauing after the 2024 general elections, where it fell short of an outright majority.The Delhi win, coming close on the heels of Haryana and Maharashtra, is seen as a rejuvenation of Modi's political aura, proving that his leadership can still sway voters in regional contests.BJP's strategy also involved highlighting governance failures of AAP, especially when it came to allegations of corruption against its leaders, which played a significant role in swaying public opinion. Modi's promise to make Delhi a part of the 'Viksit Bharat' vision, aligning local governance with national development goals, was well-received.The Delhi outcome not only dispels the myth about Modi's limited regional appeal but also sets a precedent for how national leaders can engage with state politics.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

Delhi election results 2025: As the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to form government in Delhi, one question that people are asking is - can Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma become the Chief Minister of Delhi, even if he loses the New Delhi assembly constituency seat against former CM Arvind Kejriwal?BJP’s Parvesh Verma is locked in a very tight battle against AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi assembly constituency.The leading and trailing candidates are changing with every round of counting. In such a situation, what will happen if Kejriwal defeats Parvesh Verma?

If BJP forms the government and chooses Parvesh Verma to be the chief minister, then Parvesh Verma will have to win a Delhi assembly seat in 6 months time. Usually in such cases, the winning party asks one of its MLAs to vacate a relatively ‘safer’ seat for the chief minister, and then bypolls are held.Originating from an influential political family in Delhi, Parvesh Verma is the son of former BJP leader and Delhi chief minister Sahib Singh Verma. His uncle, Azad Singh, previously held the position of North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor and contested from Mundka constituency as a BJP candidate in the 2013 assembly elections.His political journey began in 2013 when he emerged victorious in the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections from the Mehrauli constituency.Subsequently, he clinched the West Delhi parliamentary seat in 2014 and secured a remarkable re-election in 2019, winning by a substantial margin of 5.78 lakh votes.Ahead of the 2025 Delhi elections, Parvesh Verma launched a campaign titled ""Remove Kejriwal, Save the Nation"", highlighting the alleged failures of the current AAP government in delivering their core promises.During his campaign, Verma sharply criticised the Delhi government's administrative capabilities, particularly their approach towards pollution management, women's safety, and urban infrastructure development. He emphasised their unfulfilled promise regarding the cleaning of the Yamuna River, which continues to pose a significant environmental issue for Delhi.","BJP's Parvesh Verma is locked in a very tight battle against AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi assembly constituency.

NEW DELHI: Riding on the wave of recent successes in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections just a few months ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) registered a big win in the Delhi assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest.The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly.AAP , which had dominated the previous two terms with a substantial majority, managed only 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.The BJP and its NDA allies celebrated the Delhi win, attributing it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The Congress, however, maintained that the results reflected a verdict on AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rather than Modi's governance.The Congress defended its decision to contest against Aam Aadmi Party, criticising those who questioned their stance. They pointed out that similar concerns about opposition unity were not raised when AAP contested elections in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana and other states, potentially dividing the secular vote.The BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept the Delhi assembly elections with a comfortable majority. This victory marks the third major electoral success for the BJP in the last four months after winning the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. With this, the 27 years exile of the BJP in Delhi also comes to an end. This major win also indicates approval by the middle class to Modi government’s big tax relief in the Union budget 2025 last week have got the approval of middle-class consumers.With this, PM Modi yet again proves to be the star campaigner for the BJP.In a high-stakes battle for New Delhi assembly seat, BJP leader Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant slayer by defeating former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by 4,089 seats.Son of former CM Sahib Singh Verma, Parvesh was was entrusted to take on Kejriwal who has held in to the seat last three times. In 2013, Kejriwal had emerged as giant slayer by defeating then CM and Congress veteran Sheila Dixit.After dethroning the three-time CM, Verma is also in now a strong contender for the top post.BJP leader Tarvinder Singh Marwah emerged as another giant slayer as he defeated former deputy CM and AAP senior leader Manish Sisodia. Marwah defeated three-time MLA Sisodia to win Jangpura seat by 675 votes. Sisodia had switched seats from Patparganj to Jangpura this time hoping for a comfortable win.Marwah, who was in Congress for a long time and elected three-time MLA from Jangpura, had switched to BJP in 2022 after complaining of not getting time with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for a meeting.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade As the heavyweights of Aam Aadmi Party fell one by one, Atishi stood tall and won the Kalkaji assembly seat. In a high-stakes contest, Atishi won by 3,521 votes defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress's Alka Lamba.""I thank the people of Kalkaji for showing trust in me. I congratulate my team who worked against 'baahubal',"" Atishi said.""We accept the people's mandate. I have won but it's not a time to celebrate but continue the 'war' against the BJP,"" the 43-year-old said.Her victory is a standout for the AAP as its top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia lost their constituencies.With the defeat served to Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, Atishi may now also take charge as the leader of opposition in Delhi assembly.The Congress leader may have lost the contest today but he surely has emerged as the 'Baazigar' of this poll season. Son of veteran Congress leader and three-time CM Sheila Dikshit, Sandeep got his ultimate revenge against Arvind Kejriwal today.Though he did not win the New Delhi seat, he managed to eat in to Kejriwal's votes that eventually led to the AAP chief's defeat.It was a matter of prestige for Sandeep, who was finally given a ticket from New Delhi, his mother's bastion, which had been the stronghold of Kejriwal since 2013.It's no surprise there. The one at the top of this list is AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The politician, who rose to power as a anti-graft crusader found himself embroiled in corruption cases.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.The AAP suffered a major blow this election and now will have to look at ways to reinvent itself.The former deputy chief minister of Delhi and second-in-command of AAP, Sisodia, also faced defeat against BJP candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah in the Jangpura constituency.Having previously served as a three-term MLA from Patparganj in east Delhi, he chose to contest from Jangpura in this election.Following his arrest in 2023 over alleged corruption in the liquor policy case, Sisodia was imprisoned for approximately 18 months until he secured bail. Similar to Kejriwal's stance, he declined to accept a governmental position prior to receiving the ""people's verdict"".Delhi, however, decided to give him another chance this time.After governing Delhi for a decade, AAP faced significant anti-incumbency and lost the election to BJP. This is the first time since its inception that AAP will not hold power in Delhi.With the Delhi loss, AAP is now in power only in Punjab. With this, the national expansion plan of the party has hit a roadblock.The party will now have to regroup and reorganise itself as it now sits in opposition in Delhi.The Congress party has recorded its third consecutive blank in the Delhi assembly elections, marking a stark contrast to its earlier dominance when it governed the capital for 15 consecutive years from 1998 to 2013.Delhi's electorate has consistently rejected the party in three successive assembly elections.After snapping alliance with AAP for Delhi elections , Congress mounted an assertive campaign with former party president Rahul Gandhi spearheading the criticism against Arvind Kejriwal.Despite these efforts, the party failed to secure any constituencies in Delhi. Their sole minor comfort lies in achieving a modest improvement in vote share, rising by approximately 2% from its previous figure of less than 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.Omar Abdullah’s X post captured the mood of INDIA bloc today -- 'Aur lado aapas mein'. The jibe came as AAP and Congress fought against each other which eventually benefitted BJP.With the bitter and ugly fight and AAP’s eventual loss in Delhi, the focus now turns to if it's an end to INDIA bloc.The AAP defeat also comes as an embarassment to Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party who actively campaigned for AAP in Delhi.While Congress may have not been able to open its account in Delhi once again, Rahul Gandhi cannot be put in the list of losers. Rahul, who personally took charge to dent Kejriwal's image during the election campaign, was successful in his mission.The defeat also limits AAP within the INDIA bloc who had the capability to challenge Congress' position as a national party. The Delhi blow also gives Congress a little immunity within the bloc where allies SP, TMC, Sena (UBT) chose Kejriwal's party over Congress.","The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly. Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest.

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal 's dream run in Delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - Kejriwal's AAP has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections. The BJP has finally managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The former Delhi chief minister, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, ran a very aggressive campaign against the BJP and also targeted the Congress.So, why did Kejriwal lose? Here's a look at some of the tricks that failed to click for the AAP chief.Arvind Kejriwal, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, resigned as chief minister of Delhi in September 2024, months ahead of elections to take a high moral ground on the issue of corruption.""I am ready for Agni Pariksha. Two days later, I will resign as chief minister. I will not sit on that chair till the people announce their verdict,"" Kejriwal had said at the time of resignation.Kejriwal, who had refused to resign even when he was in jail, eventually gave up his chair amid turmoil faced by him in the Delhi excise policy case. Several top leaders, including Kejriwal himself, faced accusations of accepting bribes from liquor companies in exchange for favorable policies. Eventually, several AAP leaders were jailed in connection with the case.Kejriwal's claim to fame in his first two terms was his transparent and pro-people governance model. The AAP chief claimed credit for transforming Delhi's government schools and his Mohalla clinics provided cheap medicare to the poor. In the 2020 elections, Kejriwal sought votes for his work and AAP campaign centred around the change it had brought to the lives of the people. However, this time around AAP's campaign was centred around its attacks on the BJP leadership and the Congress. Kejriwal, who along with top AAP leadership faced several corruption charges, focused less on development and governance narratives. He called BJP ""Gali Galauj Party.""In the middle of the campaign, Kejriwal dropped a bombshell as he accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna waters to kill people of Delhi. Kejriwal's charges gave a toxic turn to Delhi campaign with both BJP and Congress going all out against the AAP chief. At the end, as the results show - the people of Delhi were not swayed by his ""concerns"" for them.Arvind Kejriwal tried to woo the middle class by unveiling his party’s manifesto for them. He claimed that the middle class were ignored by successive governments and accused other political parties of treating them as ""just an ATM for the government"". Ironically though, Kejriwal's manifesto did not mention what he would do for the middle class if voted to power but only listed seven demands from the Centre to improve their lives. Little wonder, at the end the Centre's sops for the middle class in the Uunion Budget appealed more to Delhi voters than the AAP's demands.Confrontation has been a part of Kejriwal's politics right from the beginning. This time around it was no different. Right through his campaign, Kejriwal trained his guns at Delhi Police and the Election Commission. Kejriwal accused the Election Commission and Delhi Police of colluding with the BJP to subvert the electoral process and prevent AAP from campaigning. Kejriwal targeted Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and alleged that he ""wants a job post-retirement"" and was ""destroying the country"" for the post. Kejriwal's decision to take on the Congress along with the BJP boomeranged as on several seats, AAP's margin of defeat is less than the votes polled by the Congress candidate. Both Kejriwal and Rahul made relentless attacks against each other giving an opportunity to mock the allies-turned-rivals and take digs at opposition unity.",Arvind Kejriwal's dream run in Delhi has come to an end.

NEW DELHI: Delhi has given its verdict and its 'ghar wapsi' for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after 27 years. According to the Election Commission, the BJP has 47 of a total of 70 seats in its bag. Arvind Kejriwal's AAP, which has ruled the union territory for a decade, managed to get only 23 seats.This marks the third major win for the BJP in the last four months after Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections.The Aam Aadmi Party, established in 2012, secured governance in Delhi in 2013 and had maintained its administrative control since 2015.The Kejriwal/Atishi government, however, failed to fight anti-incumbency. AAP's recognition of public dissatisfaction was evident in its selection of candidates.Despite making eleventh-hour alterations to the list, these changes proved insufficient to address the negative perception of certain MLAs, who were criticised for being unreachable and distant from their constituents.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Union budget gambit seems to have paid off as Delhi decided to give BJP a chance after 27 years. With a focus on the middle class, the Union finance minister announced a big tax relief to middle class just three days before the Delhi elections.Kejriwal's AAP had emerged from middle-class dissatisfaction with existing political systems but is now largely perceived as an organisation focused solely on underprivileged sections, offering benefits like complimentary electricity units and free transport for women.Also read: Winners and Losers of Delhi assembly election 2025 Although Kejriwal attempted to address middle class issues during his pre-election addresses, these efforts appeared insufficient and delayed.Since 2013, Kejriwal's AAP government has been able to establish 'Delhi model' in which it implemented several freebies/welfare schemes for the underprivileged. The BJP, however, did an Uno reverse on AAP in Delhi and announced several freebies and incentives.The BJP leadership, including PM Modi, while previously criticising welfare programmes as 'revadis', took a notably different stance in Delhi. They explicitly assured voters that all existing AAP government schemes would continue under BJP rule. The PM's personal guarantee on this matter carried significant authority and effectively countered AAP's assertions that BJP governance would deprive the underprivileged of their current benefits.The party, in its three-part manifesto, promised financial assistance of Rs 2,500 monthly to women from poor families under 'Mahila Samriddhi Yojana', LPG cylinders for Rs 500 to women from poor families, and one free cylinder each on Holi and Diwali.After years of blame-game by the Kejriwal government, it seems people of Delhi have had enough. This time, Delhi decided to go for a ""double-engine sarkaar"", which promises effective governance with the BJP government in the state and at the Centre.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade During the elections led by PM Modi, the BJP went all out to attack Kejriwal for non-governance in the last decade. Kejriwal, on the other hand, had time and again blamed the Centre and the LG for creating hurdles. The AAP also attributed the deteriorating road conditions and inadequate civic infrastructure to project delays caused by the LG.The voters appear to have concluded that a BJP-led government would operate more effectively with the Centre-appointed LG.A big credit for the BJP's win in Delhi could also be given to Rahul Gandhi. The Congress leader took upon himself to personally roast and attack Kejriwal.During the campaign, he singled out Kejriwal and even equated him with PM Modi, alleging that they were two sides of the same coin. Taking a direct jab at the AAP supremo, Rahul had said, “Arvind Kejriwal WagonR mein aaye, sweater pehne aur khambe pe chadh gaye. Phir khambe se utre aur seedha sheesh Mahal mein gaye (Arvind Kejriwal came in a small car—a WagonR—wearing a sweater and climbed an electric pole. After coming down, he went straight to the 'Sheesh Mahal' (glass palace) with automatic doors and big TVs)"".The AAP had secured governance by pledging to eliminate corruption in Delhi. The party's reputation, however, faced significant challenges due to the liquor policy controversy and various corruption allegations against its leadership.Prominent AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh have been at the centre of corruption charges.After getting out on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the CM post and gave the charge to Atishi. He had sought validation as 'Mr. Clean' from the voters. Delhi, however, decided to not give him another chance.In 2020, reducing Delhi air pollution was one of the 10 “guarantees of Kejriwal”. However, this year, “Kejriwal’s guarantee” did not mention pollution anywhere. In the last 10 years, the AAP government has pointed fingers at neighbouring states and refused to take responsibility for air pollution.The BJP, however, vowed to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 levels by half in the next five years.Targetting Kejriwal, BJP also promised to clean Yamuna water in the next five years.Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again proved to be the star campaigner for the BJP. Despite having no CM face in Delhi, BJP registers yet another win in assembly elections riding on PM Modi's popularity. During the election campaign, PM Modi personally took charge of targeting Arvind Kejriwal.True to his style, PM Modi started calling Kejriwal's party an 'AAPda' (disaster) for Delhi. He also took 'Farziwal' jibes at Kejriwal accusing him of being fake and corrupt.In fact, PM Modi also focused on attacking Kejriwal during his Lok Sabha speech a day before Delhi elections.During the Delhi assembly elections, the BJP tailored its message and underplayed Hindutva this time. Focussing on the anti-incumbency of Kejriwal, BJP focussed on governance and middle class.Much of the BJP campaign targetted Kejriwal who, along with Manish Sisodia, was jailed in a corruption case relating to a now-scrapped liquor policy over the past two years. The relentless focus on Kejriwal’s ""sheesh mahal"" may have also helped the BJP sway public opinion in favour of the party.The BJP's comprehensive campaign strategy amplified the demand for transformation in Delhi, capitalising on AAP leader Kejriwal's diminishing reputation amidst corruption allegations and perceived deviation from his original principles, particularly highlighted by the 'sheesh mahal' controversy.BJP officials managing different regions in the capital noted that their extensive 2020 campaign failed to gain traction because voters associated AAP's initial five-year tenure with positive developments in education, healthcare, and popular welfare schemes including complimentary bus travel for women and free electricity.The absence of significant corruption allegations during AAP's first term contrasted sharply with the present scenario, with BJP strategists noting that the ruling party had few achievements to highlight from their second term.""Out vote share grew significantly even in 2020 but there was no serious erosion in AAP's vote share. This time we succeeded in chipping away at its support base while keeping our votes intact,"" a BJP leader said.The BJP has won Delhi elections, but it also has Congress to thank. Congress and AAP, allies under INDIA bloc, decided to contest the Delhi assembly elections individually. During the campaign, both AAP and Congress accused each other of being the B team of the BJP.Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi opened a personal attack on Kejriwal while the AAP chief also left no stone unturned to discredit Congress. Eventually, though Congress was not able to open its account in Delhi, the Gandhis definitely dealt a big blow to the credibility of Kejriwal.","Arvind Kejriwal's AAP, which has ruled the union territory for a decade, managed to get only 23 seats. According to the Election Commission, the BJP has 47 of a total of 70 seats in its bag. This marks the third major win for the BJP in the last four months after Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118061985,imgsize-1716105,width-400,resizemode-4/118061985.jpg"

AAP’s setback and Kejriwal’s challenges



AAP’s uncertain future



A shifting political landscape



What lies ahead?



NEW DELHI: In 2013, with a pen in his pocket, a muffler around his neck, loose sweater and blue WagonR, Arvind Kejriwal embodied the ""aam aadmi"" when he entered public life. His decision to name his political party after the ""aam aadmi"" resonated strongly with the public.After twelve years, the aspirations of establishing a nationwide party and emerging as a national leader are diminishing for the civil servant-turned-activist who ventured into politics by establishing his own party rather than joining an existing one.The Aam Aadmi Party , which governed Delhi for 10 consecutive years and established a government in Punjab, suffered defeat in the capital city's election on Saturday, securing 22 seats whilst the BJP won 48.In his statement, Kejriwal assured that AAP members would continue their social work, emphasising that politics was only a means to serve the people. However, his political future remains uncertain.Kejriwal’s loss after a decade in power, coupled with the defeat of several AAP heavyweights, raises crucial questions about the party’s governance, strategy, and long-term vision. The AAP, which once held a brute majority in the Delhi assembly, now faces an existential crisis, struggling to maintain its relevance.Adding to Kejriwal’s woes are multiple legal battles. He was jailed on corruption charges related to the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy and is currently out on bail. With ongoing investigations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Kejriwal’s legal troubles are far from over. If convicted in the money laundering case, he could face a minimum of seven years in prison.Moreover, the Haryana government has filed a case against Kejriwal under the Disaster Management Act over his statement about ""poison"" in Yamuna water from Haryana. These legal entanglements make his political comeback even more challenging.Following the Delhi loss, AAP’s influence has been significantly curtailed. The party remains in power only in Punjab, and its expansion efforts in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Goa have yielded little success. With the party now leaderless in the Delhi assembly and its national ambitions derailed, AAP is at a crossroads.For Kejriwal, the road ahead may require a return to his roots—street-style activism, which first propelled him to prominence during the Anna Hazare movement. However, his biggest challenge will be keeping his party intact. AAP, once a force driven by volunteers and grassroots support, now risks fragmentation in the absence of political power.Nationally, Congress may see AAP’s weakening as an opportunity to reclaim lost ground in Delhi and beyond. Kejriwal’s diminished political standing could also make him a less favored ally among opposition parties, further isolating him in national politics.Speculation is already rife about Kejriwal potentially shifting focus to Punjab, where AAP still holds power. However, such a move could trigger further instability within the party and raise questions about its leadership structure.Kejriwal’s immediate focus will likely be on his legal battles. His political fate hinges on whether he can clear his name and rebuild his credibility. Meanwhile, AAP must reassess its strategies and find a way to stay relevant in the evolving political landscape.For now, both Kejriwal and AAP face their most challenging phase yet—navigating a period of political uncertainty, internal churn, and legal hurdles that could define their future trajectory.","The Aam Aadmi Party suffered defeat in the capital city's election on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Pumped up by the BJP's historic win in the Delhi assembly elections, West Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari on Saturday shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee , saying after the national capital Bengal would vote for the BJP by the uproot ruling TMC.""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai...2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai...(Delhi's victory is ours...in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.The BJP leader claimed that his party won easily in most of the Bengali majority areas of Delhi.""'AAP-da ki vidaai ho gayi hai'... People have given them a befitting reply... Only PM Modi can bring back the glory of Delhi and make it a clean city... I campaigned in Bengali-majority areas of Delhi but the infrastructure is in a very bad situation... They had destroyed Delhi... BJP saw an easy victory in most of the Bengali majority areas of Delhi,"" he told ANI.Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly, took to X to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the victory, calling it a decisive mandate against AAP.""Huge Victory for @BJP4Delh I express my heartiest congratulations to Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi Ji for leading from the front and orchestrating this very special victory over ""AAP-da"". Now the People of Delhi will receive the benefits of Double Engine Govt in the National Capital as Mr Farziwal has been swept out of power,"" Adhikari posted on X.The Bengal BJP unit also hailed the party's good performance in the Delhi polls, terming it a rejection of corruption and nepotism, while the TMC, which had backed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), maintained silence on the outcome.State BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said the verdict in Delhi reflected people's faith in development and would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.The BJP is poised to form a government in Delhi after more than 26 years, with the latest Election Commission trends showing the saffron party ahead in 45 of the 70 assembly seats and AAP in 21 seats.""The people of Bengal will also vote for the BJP in the next assembly polls and reject the TMC,"" Majumdar told news agency.The 2021 West Bengal assembly election resulted in a decisive victory for the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, securing 213 out of 294 seats.

Delhi polls 2025: How good governance trumped freebies in assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-polls-2025-how-good-governance-trumped-freebies-in-assembly-elections/articleshow/118070246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi on Saturday joined a growing list of states where the lotus has managed to bloom with a vengeance. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which was struggling to even get double-digits in seat share in the past two assembly polls, won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats. Breaking the 27-year jinx, the BJP is again coming back to form the government in the national capital with the promise of development and good governance.The Aam Aadmi Party's defeat this time around has shown that freebie politics cannot hold its sheen for long if not coupled with on-the-ground development and infrastructure improvement.In this year's assembly election, BJP and Congress both followed the AAP's manifestos giving free electricity, water and bus services for women and even financial aid. This seemed like a freebies vs freebies contest where the BJP's advantage stemmed from two factors: voters' assessment of implementation records, with the BJP's performance in Madhya Pradesh outweighing AAP's shortcomings in Punjab; and the understanding that welfare schemes must be complemented by good governance.Reiterating the BJP's strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the party's historic win in Delhi, stating that ""development and good governance"" had won.""Jana Shakti is paramount! Development wins, good governance triumphs. I bow to my dear sisters and brothers of Delhi for this resounding and historic mandate to @BJP4India. We are humbled and honoured to receive these blessings. It is our guarantee that we will leave no stone unturned in developing Delhi, improving the overall quality of life for the people and ensuring that Delhi has a prime role to play in building a Viksit Bharat,"" he said in a tweet.Freebies, though a good strategy in the short term, failed to get votes for AAP this time. There was a lack of infrastructural development that raised questions among voters regarding AAP and its effectiveness in governance. In Delhi, AAP had promised to give clean tap water but there were many areas where the people didn't even have access to tap water. Long queues behind water tankers were a common sight across the city.For this year's elections, Kejriwal also promised to give financial support to priests, sparking a debate over whether the party's ideology revovled merely around ""revdi"" politics.In the last two elections, the AAP's main strong point was Mohalla clinics and municipal schools but one cannot fight only on the basis of these two pillars. Delhiites were looking for more evidence of developmental works that AAP had done in the last decade, and the party came up short.Another factor that lent itself to AAP's defeat was its frequent run-ins with the Lt Governor's office. Considering Delhi's governance structure under the National Capital Territory Act, the constant bickering created an impression of administrative inefficiency by AAP.Kejriwal's decision to retain his CM position whilst in custody over the excise policy scam case appeared to convince voters that administrative efficiency was being compromised for political advantage.This also resulted in postponed Cabinet sessions and administrative standstill. Saturday's results suggest that stepping down in March 2024 and maintaining ethical standards would have been a more prudent political strategy.",The Bharatiya Janata Party won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats.

First Congress lost allies, then votes



Had the outcome been different if INDIA bloc contested together?



NEW DELHI: In the bustling newsrooms, as vote counting began for the Delhi elections, two names dominated the airwaves: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Conspicuously absent from the conversation was the Congress party – once the dominant force in Delhi's political landscape. As the day went by, the only thing that remained constant was the grand old party's score on the scoreboard - zero.The Congress party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, went through a fourth consecutive defeat, ""humbly"" accepting the mandate as it had no other choice.""We humbly accept the mandate of Delhi. Heartfelt thanks to all Congress workers for their dedication and to all voters for their support. The fight for Delhi’s progress and the rights of Delhiites—against pollution, inflation, and corruption—will continue,"" the party leader Rahul Gandhi said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his victory speech said that the Congress ""drowns and takes down its allies with it"".Political analysts have often wondered if it's the Congress that's the weak link in INDIA bloc or is it the only pan India uniting force.When outcomes are analysed, INDIA bloc has lost crucial battles since it came into existence- Lok Sabha elections and Maharashtra. However, on the other side, it did secure victory in the politically crucial poll battle of Jammu and Kashmir- but the Congress could only manage six seats, leaving the National Conference as the largest party.Likewise, the opposition bloc swept the Jharkhand polls with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leading the way with 34 seats. Congress could win only 16.What's noticeable here is that the INDIA bloc has always won where the regional parties have taken the steering wheel.States where the opposition bloc did not contest together- Haryana & Delhi- did end up becoming each other's vote cutters, paving a smooth way for the BJP.The story of Congress's downfall in this election began well before the first vote was cast. The fractures within the INDIA bloc, a coalition of opposition parties, became apparent when heavyweight leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav chose to back AAP's Arvind Kejriwal instead of their supposed ally, Congress.""It feels like the BJP government will be formed,"" admitted Congress candidate Sandeep Dikshit from the New Delhi constituency, his words reflecting the party's diminishing expectations. The exit polls had already predicted this outcome, with most projections pointing to a clear BJP victory.Rahul Gandhi during the poll campaigns led a fierce attack on AAP, targeting Kejriwal over corruption allegations, while Kejriwal hit back, raising the National Herald case against Rahul.Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah criticized INDIA bloc allies AAP and Congress for contesting as rivals in the Delhi elections, as trends indicated significant gains for the BJP.""Aur lado aapas mein (fight more), "" Omar said reacting to trends.The results raised an inevitable question: Could the outcome have been different if the INDIA bloc had maintained unity? Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut seemed to think so, suggesting that a combined opposition could have secured victory against the BJP within the first hour of counting.""The early trends show a sharp competition. Had Congress and AAP been together, the results may have been different. The political opponent of AAP and Congress is BJP. Both of them fought to keep BJP from coming to power, but they fought individually. If they had been together then BJP's defeat must have been confirmed in the first hour (of counting),"" Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said.The division of opposition votes, a phenomenon also witnessed in the Haryana assembly elections, appeared to play directly into the BJP's hands. The very alliance that was formed to unite the opposition against the BJP ended up exemplifying its disunity.As Delhi's political landscape continues to evolve, the Congress party struggles to stay relevant. The party that once commanded the capital's political narrative now finds itself searching for relevance in a city it once called its own.","The Congress party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, went through a fourth consecutive defeat.

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party 's (AAP) loss in the Delhi assembly elections has sparked speculation about its political clout in Punjab, with opposition leaders in the state predicting a similar downfall.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a decisive victory in Delhi, reclaiming power after 26 years and dealing a severe blow to Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP, whose senior leadership struggled to hold ground.This marks the second major setback for AAP following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections , in which the party secured only three of the 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab.In contrast, AAP had secured a sweeping victory in the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, winning 92 out of 117 seats.Before the Delhi polls, Punjab's AAP unit, including chief minister Bhagwant Mann , cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, actively campaigned in the national capital.Mann, as the party’s key campaigner, conducted roadshows and highlighted the achievements of his government, such as providing 50,000 government jobs, offering 300 units of free electricity, setting up 850 'mohalla clinics,' and acquiring a private thermal power plant.With AAP now governing only Punjab, opposition parties in the state strongly criticised the party, asserting that the Delhi electorate has exposed its ""lies and deceit"".""It is a defeat of Arvind Kejriwal's lies, deceit and dishonesty. People of Delhi today showed that you cannot rule the state for long by making false promises,"" Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma told news agency PTI.He further claimed that AAP's governance had left Delhi in a ""miserable"" condition and warned that Punjab’s AAP leaders would face an even worse fate.Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa predicted internal strife within AAP’s Punjab unit, claiming, ""There would be an internal power struggle between Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal.""He blamed the Delhi defeat on corruption, inefficiency, and arrogance within AAP's leadership.BJP leader Preneet Kaur expressed satisfaction over her party's victory, adding that AAP’s much-touted ""Delhi model"" failed to deliver on its promises.""We have seen that their ""Aam Aadmi clinics"" did not work here. What they had promised, they did not keep them,"" she said.Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira described the outcome as a setback for ""fake revolutionaries"" who had failed to uphold their commitments on issues like VIP culture, Lokpal, Swaraj, and corruption.Punjab BJP vice president and former MLA Arvind Khanna called the Delhi mandate a rejection of AAP’s governance model, arguing that it signalled ""the beginning of AAP's downfall in Punjab as well"".He emphasized that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, India had experienced significant progress, making it crucial for Punjab to embrace BJP for real development.Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu echoed similar sentiments on X, posting, ""History rewritten in Delhi! After 27 years, the people have given BJP a resounding mandate, embracing PM @narendramodi's vision of Viksit Bharat. This victory is a testament to trust, development, and a brighter future. Thank you, Delhi.""He further accused AAP of harbouring ""the most corrupt leaders"" and suggested that the party’s downfall in Punjab was imminent.With AAP facing a critical juncture, its future in Punjab remains uncertain as political opponents ramp up their attacks, sensing an opportunity to weaken the party’s hold on the state.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a decisive victory in Delhi, reclaiming power after 26 years.

Contrary to predictions, Congress and its allies won 216 seats.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls have frequently missed the mark in recent elections. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, they overestimated the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) performance, while in the Haryana assembly election, they incorrectly projected a tilt towards Congress. Predictions also varied widely across states. However, in the Delhi assembly election, exit polls were notably accurate, closely aligning with the actual results.On the counting day, the BJP secured 48 seats, while the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 22 seats displaying its worst performance since 2013.While most exit polls correctly predicted a BJP victory, their estimates for AAP varied significantly.Exit polls broadly captured BJP's lead, though many overestimated AAP's tally, reflecting the inconsistencies that have plagued past election predictions.Based on the Delhi election results (BJP: 48, AAP: 22, Congress: 0), P-Marq emerged as the most accurate, predicting AAP at 26 and BJP at 44, with a deviation of just four seats for both parties. Poll Diary followed closely, precisely forecasting AAP’s 22 seats and coming within two seats for BJP, though it slightly overestimated Congress.Axis My India also performed well, underestimating AAP by just two seats and missing BJP’s tally by the same margin, making it one of the more reliable projections for the BJP.Chanakya Strategies and People’s Insight had a six-seat deviation for BJP and a five-seat deviation for AAP, making them relatively accurate but not the best. Similarly, JVC Poll showed a comparable margin of error.Further down the accuracy rankings, MATRIZE significantly overestimated AAP’s strength (35 seats, 13 more than actual) while underestimating BJP’s performance (38 seats, 10 fewer than actual). DV Research followed a similar pattern, overestimating AAP by eight seats and underestimating BJP by the same number.The Poll of Polls compilation had a four-seat error for AAP and a five-seat error for BJP, placing it in the middle of the accuracy rankings. Peoples Pulse-Codema was significantly off, underestimating AAP by seven seats and overestimating BJP by eight seats. However, WEPRESIDE was the least accurate of all, overestimating AAP by a massive 27 seats while underestimating BJP by the same margin, making it the most incorrect prediction overall.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade AAP leaders dismissed the projections before the results were announced, citing historical inaccuracies. Party spokesperson Reena Gupta pointed out that in 2013, 2015, and 2020, exit polls had consistently underestimated AAP’s performance. Sanjay Singh went further, mockingly calling them ""surveys by massage and spa companies.""However, this time, exit polls were closer to reality, with BJP securing more seats than projected and AAP underperforming.Exit polls also stumbled in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

NEW DELHI: 'Aur lado aapas mein' - J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah's tweet on Saturday said it all as the BJP ended the decade-long rule of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi. The decision of AAP and Congress, who were allies during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, to turn rivals in assembly elections may have played a big role in BJP's victory.Former chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, chose to contest independently, shutting down any possibility of an alliance with Congress even before the election dates were announced.According to the Election Commission of India (ECI), the BJP is set to form the government in Delhi after 27 years, with 47 seats, while AAP could secure only 23 seats. Congress, on the other hand, failed to open its account for the third consecutive time.The decision of AAP and Congress to go solo seems to have played a decisive role in splitting the anti-BJP vote.A closer analysis of the election data suggests that an AAP-Congress alliance could have altered the results in at least 15 seats. The combined vote share of the two parties in key constituencies like Rajinder Nagar, Chhatarpur, Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash, and others shows that AAP could have emerged victorious had it contested with Congress’ support.With Congress failing to make an impact on its own, a partnership could have provided both parties with a stronger electoral footing.For instance, in Rajinder Nagar, AAP secured 45,440 votes while Congress got 4,015. If these votes were combined, AAP’s tally would have reached 49,455, enough to defeat the BJP. Similarly, in Chhatarpur, AAP’s 74,230 votes combined with Congress’s 6,601 would have pushed the total to 80,831, securing a win. The same pattern holds in other constituencies like Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash, and Timarpur, where an alliance could have led to AAP’s victory.In seats like Badli and Nangloi Jat, Congress’s strong presence further underlines how a joint front could have been a game-changer. In Badli, AAP secured 35,668 votes while Congress got 31,130. Their combined tally of 66,798 would have comfortably beaten the BJP. Nangloi Jat tells a similar story, with AAP’s 48,907 votes and Congress’s 31,918 combining for a total of 80,825—enough to win the seat.Even in tight contests such as in Narela, where BJP barely edged ahead, an AAP-Congress alliance might have changed the final outcome.Beyond numbers, the election results signal a potential strategic miscalculation by AAP. While the party has governed Delhi for a decade, its recent friction with Congress over seat-sharing in other states might have influenced its decision to contest alone. The split in opposition votes ultimately benefited BJP, allowing it to regain control of Delhi after nearly three decades.","The BJP is set to form the government in Delhi after 27 years, with 47 seats, while AAP could secure only 23 seats.

AAP's heavyweights swept off

NEW DELHI: In a stunning political shift for Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) marked a historic comeback in 27 years, securing 48 out of 70 assembly seats. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ), which had governed the capital for two consecutive terms, suffered a massive setback, managing to secure just 22 seats.What made the defeat more striking was the loss of several top AAP leaders, including former chief minister and party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal Despite AAP’s overall poor performance, a number of relatively low-profile candidates played a crucial role in keeping the party's presence known in the Vidhan Sabha as barely any key names were able to get a win.AAP’s Atishi secured a hard-fought victory in Kalkaji, successfully defending her seat against BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress’s Alka Lamba with a margin of 3,521 votes. She was among the few high-profile leaders in the party to retain their constituencies. Alongside her, three former Delhi government ministers—Gopal Rai (Babarpur), Mukesh Ahlawat (Sultanpur Majra), and Imran Hussain (Ballimaran)—also clinched wins. Imran Hussain registered a decisive victory in Ballimaran with a margin of 29,823 votes, while Gopal Rai secured Babarpur by 18,994 votes. Additionally, Amanatullah Khan emerged victorious in Okhla, defeating his opponents by 23,639 votes.Thus, the lesser known names became a saving grace for the party, raising a possibility of modifications in AAP's top command. Here is a list of the underdogs that won:Here’s the list without bold and bullets:Several key AAP leaders faced setbacks in the elections, including some of the party’s most prominent figures. Delhi's ex-CM Kejriwal suffered a surprising defeat in New Delhi, losing to BJP’s Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma by 4,089 votes. Former deputy CM Manish Sisodia also fell short in Jangpura, where he lost to BJP’s Tarvinder Singh Marwah by a narrow margin of 675 votes.Senior leader Saurabh Bharadwaj was defeated in Greater Kailash to BJP’s Shikha Roy by 3,188 votes. Meanwhile, ex-minister Satyendar Jain faced one of the biggest losses for AAP, losing Shakur Basti to BJP’s Karnail Singh by a significant 21,000 votes.As the Delhi elections swept away key leaders, a significant challenge now arises in determining who will emerge as the primary opposition, with the BJP's lotus blooming in the capital.With Atishi's victory, she becomes a leading contender to spearhead the opposition, but her path could be complicated. Without the backing of major figures like her predecessor Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Satyendra Jain, Atishi must navigate a party with MLAs, who until now, have lacked a strong presence in top command. This leadership gap might pose a challenge as AAP works on diminished presence and the possible risk of workers jumping ship.Additionally, the 'underdogs' have the task of keeping the party's momentum going, and to work in hopes to regain the lost glory AAP had for two terms.Thus, while BJP’s sweeping victory dominated the election results, the winning AAP candidates proved that grassroots leaders and lesser-known names could still command the trust of voters over key leaders' assurances. As Delhi’s political landscape undergoes a drastic shift, these victories are AAP's silver lining in an otherwise dismal electoral performance.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) marked a historic comeback in 27 years, securing 48 out of 70 assembly seats.

AHMEDABAD: A wave of despair spread across many parts of Gujarat as 33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar after they were deported from US. Faces covered by masks, without any luggage and a few with backpacks, they were taken to Gujarat Police vehicles stationed at the airport and whisked away to their homes.Having paid Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore to chase their 'US dreams', all they were left with were shattered dreams and mounting debts.All of them were deported under the 'catch and release' policy of Trump administration and were part of a larger group of 104 Indians who were sent back from the US this week.""My sister was handcuffed during the deportation. She hasn't talked much with us. She had gone to US on a tourist visa . We have no idea why she was deported,"" said Varun, brother of 29-year-old Khushbu Patel of Luna village in Vadodara. Many deportees, including Khushbu, chose to go incommunicado to avoid the intense social scrutiny.Of the 33 deportees, 18 were caught just as Trump took oath as the US president. They stepped on US soil on Jan 19 and 20 and walked straight into the hands of American authorities, sources said.All 18 are from north Gujarat, a region known as a hub for human smuggling operations . ""They were smuggled into US through Mexico border,"" said a source connected with human smuggling network. ""The smugglers pushed them to enter US way before Trump took the oath, fearing stricter immigration policies. But for some reason, they could not cross over in time. They were caught and marked for deportation almost immediately,"" the source added.Sources said the remaining 15 Gujaratis had been in US for periods ranging from one month to four years. They did not get permission to stay even though they sought asylum, citing political persecution. Some deportees like Jignesh Zala, a native of Gandhinagar, said illegal immigration was a traumatic experience that should never be attempted. He had crossed into US with his wife and 11-year-old twin daughters four months ago. ""We went from Delhi to Paris to Madrid to Salvador before reaching Mexico and crossing the border. We were sent back with hands and legs in cuffs. It was a traumatic experience for our entire family,"" Zala said on Thursday.","33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar.

Deep dent of controversies

The unprecedented fall

NEW DELHI: Revolution. New politics. Political startup. That's all echoed ten years back as people, particularly in New Delhi, witnessed a ""glint of hope"" radiating from Ram Lila Maidan.When the ruling Congress at the Centre faced heat over the unravelling of corruption cases in 2011, the iconic ground in Delhi galvanised the people against what seemed indomitable dispensation.At the centre of the historic Ram Lila Maidan protest were Anna Hazare and his protege Arvind Kejriwal , leading the masses with a key demand -- Jan Lok Pal .The India Against Corruption movement peaked when the Congress-led UPA regime ordered cops to infiltrate the historic ground to disperse the crowd. The move backfired. It earned the protest nationwide sympathy and made the chances of the government leaner.Unable to make a big impact from apolitical movement and lack of legislative might, team Kejriwal decided to float a party to bring a ""real change"" in India's political landscape.Consequently, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came into existence on October 2, 2o12, which also marked the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.The political canvas was fresh and blank for Kejriwal to leave an indelible imprint in 2013 when he made his political debut against Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government.The promise of alternative politics served Kejriwal with a decent electoral dividend as he defeated Sheila Dikshit from the New Delhi seat by a whopping margin of 22,000 votes. However, the party failed to secure a majority as it won 28 seats, only 8 short of the magic mark.In a first surprise call, the AAP declared to form a government with Congress's support -- the same party protesting against which it had come to prominence. It was, however, seen as an arrangement to navigate through the deadlock the hung mandate had created.As expected, the government was short-lived as Kejriwal resigned in 49 days because the Lokpal Bill (anti-corruption law) was not passed due to alleged opposition from its ally Congress.In 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) decimated the BJP and Congress by recording a landslide victory as it won 67 of the 70 seats in the Delhi assembly elections , halting the Modi juggernaut in its tracks.The AAP won more than 90 per cent of the seats, a feat achieved only twice before in Sikkim and Bihar.Driven by its strong focus on governance and welfare policies, the Kejriwal-led government implemented several popular schemes, such as free electricity (up to 200 units), free water (up to 20,000 litres), improved government schools, and Mohalla Clinics for healthcare. These initiatives resonated with the common people, particularly the lower and middle classes, who saw direct benefits in their daily lives.The strategy of projecting Kejriwal as a ""work-oriented leader"" helped AAP secure a massive victory, winning 62 out of 70 seats in the 2020 Delhi Assembly.AAP transitioned from a local party in Delhi to a national party after its massive breakthrough in the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, where Kejriwal's party won a landslide victory with 92 out of 117 seats, forming its second full-fledged state government. This victory established AAP as a key contender beyond Delhi.The two controversies that put AAP and Kejriwal's credibility under serious scrutiny were the 'sheesh mahal' and the Delhi liquor policy case, with critics arguing that the party, which once promised clean politics did not walk the talk.While the Sheesh Mahal controversy has dented Kejriwal’s image as a leader of simplicity, the liquor policy scam has given the opposition fresh ammunition to attack AAP’s anti-corruption stance. The party, however, remained defiant, insisting that both controversies were politically motivated.This came after several of the founding members of the party left the AAP, accusing Kejriwal of functioning in a ""dictatorial way"" and taking unilateral decisions.Riding high on the anti-incumbency and on the back of the corruption charges, AAP lost its Delhi bastion in the 2025 assembly election. The BJP has managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The saffron party won 48 seats in the 70-seat assembly.When it rains it pours, as the adage goes, the AAP not only lost the election but its chief Arvind Kejriwal was also trounced by BJP's Parvesh Verma by more than 4,000 votes from the same New Delhi assembly seat, which Kejriwal used for his political debut.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came into existence on October 2, 2o12, which also marked the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Son of former CM Saheb Singh Verma, Parvesh, who twice won the West Delhi Lok Sabha seat, is seen as a good Jat face and can help deepen the connect with the community, which appears to have supported BJP.Vijender Gupta, leader of BJP in the outgoing assembly, is also seen as a strong contender. He scored his third consecutive victory from Rohini.""It is too premature,"" a party source said. ""The leadership is not going to be rushed into a decision and, in all likelihood, it will be taken after PM Modi's return from the US on Friday.""BJP is known to spring surprises in state appointments, often opting for low-profile figures to bring an element of control and freshness.

"Ctrl+Alt+Delhi: Arvind Kejriwal loses own seat 1st time, city reboots after 10 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ctrlaltdelhi-arvind-kejriwal-loses-own-seat-1st-time-city-reboots-after-10-years/articleshow/118079287.cms,"Lotus bloom vs pehle AAP: It was a matter of 2% points

Delhi's is among the smallest of many elections held in the world's largest democracy - but on Saturday, the national capital sent out some massive national political messages.First, BJP's post-Lok Sabha elections loss of lustre is now a firmly closed chapter. Modi is back again as a political super-force and the most saleable political brand.Second, following from the first, Rahul Gandhi is back to looking like he used to before Congress won 99 seats in Lok Sabha polls.Nothing he does or says seems to matter when it comes to elections.Third, Arvind Kejriwal's status as a big national opposition player has, for now at least, been severely diminished. Seldom has a political brand taken as big a hit as his took after the Delhi results.Fourth, the opposition alliance is now in tatters.Fifth, at least in urban areas, freebies alone can't win elections, as became clear via Delhi voters punishing AAP for bad infrastructure.In Delhi, there was a sense of one era ending and another beginning in the city. BJP returned to office after 27 years, and AAP was voted out after a decade. Kejriwal will not return as Delhi CM, nor will Atishi. All eyes are on who Modi-Shah pick as BJP's CM.The last time BJP was voted to office in Delhi, in 1993, Yamuna still had aquatic life, Appu Ghar was the biggest city attraction, Delhi Metro looked like a distant dream, and city air wasn't toxic. A city that has changed so radically, for good and bad, gave a verdict that was equally dramatic.The sense of stunning change was heightened by Kejriwal losing the New Delhi seat. His 4,089-vote loss to Parvesh Verma, ex-BJP CM Sahib Singh Verma's son, in a seat he'd won by 21,000-plus votes in 2020, capped an awful day for AAP's brass.How Delhi apportioned its votes was an interesting story by itself. BJP’s 48-seat haul in the 70-seat assembly came on the back of a 45.6% vote share. AAP’s 22-seat tally, less than half of BJP’s, was coupled with a substantial 43.6% vote share.That a 2-percentage point difference in vote share could change fortunes so comprehensively said five things.First, this is the first time ever that a party with a 40%-plus vote share in Delhi has lost elections. Second, the 10-percentage point fall in AAP’s vote share between 2020 and 2025 didn’t erode its low-income voter base substantially.Therefore, third, middle class Delhi voters swung against the party and made a pivotal difference to the results.Fourth, middle class anger against AAP was centred around the party’s seemingly uncaring attitude towards city infrastructure, an anger AAP either missed or downplayed.Fifth, at the margins, that AAP and Congress fought separately and waged a bitter campaign against each other, made some crucial difference to the overall outcome.Breaking up the verdict by Delhi sub-regions shows just how far-reaching BJP’s victory is. Its wins largely came from the outer Delhi areas bordering Haryana in north and west, and from New Delhi and East Delhi. BJP won nine of 10 seats in the West Delhi parliamentary constituency area, eight each in North West Delhi and East Delhi, and seven in New Delhi. In the 2020 polls, BJP had failed to win a single seat in West Delhi and New Delhi, while it had emerged victorious in one seat in North West Delhi. It also won six seats in Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha area, where it had no legislators in the last term.Plus, BJP also managed to make inroads in Dalit-dominated areas, winning four of the 12 reserved SC constituencies. Capping all this was the party wresting the Muslim-dominated seat of Mustafabad, where it benefitted from a four-cornered fight.","BJP returned to office after 27 years, and AAP was voted out after a decade.

Now these projects and a new Metro link from Indra Prastha to North Block would be expedited, they added.Addressing the party workers after BJP's poll sweep, Modi said, ""This is for the first time since Independence when every state in the NCR has BJP govts. All neighbouring states (of Delhi) - Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana - have BJP govts. This is a happy coincidence. This single coincidence will open numerous avenues for development. Our efforts will be to undertake a lot of work in this area with regard to mobility and infrastructure development.""Stating that Delhi being the country's capital ""deserves the best urban infrastructure"", Modi said the BJP govt will develop it as a ""modern city"", while asserting that people have seen the central govt's ""stellar"" performance in the housing and road sector.He also slammed the AAP govt's approach towards Metro Rail projects.TOI has learnt that the Delhi-SNB and Delhi-Panipat RRTS projects are at the appraisal stages. So far the Delhi govt, being a partner in the projects, had given in-principle approval while suggesting that though it supported them, the funding should come from Centre. However, complying with a Supreme Court direction it had submitted token amounts for these projects.In his address, the PM said while the earlier governments looked at urbanisation as a ""liability and concern"" and treated it as ""means for earning personal wealth, his govt sees it as an opportunity and a means to strengthen the urban poor.Just before the polls were announced, the seven Delhi MPs had sought construction of three major highway projects costing around Rs 12,000 crore to decongest Delhi.

BJP reclaimed Milkipur from SP in a political grudge match, while DMK proved too strong for its opponent in Erode (East) - actor-politician Seeman's NTK, a Tamil nationalist organisation.BJP candidate Chandra Bhanu Paswan defeated SP's Ajit Prasad by 61,710 votes in the bypolls held on Feb 5, necessitated after his father Awadhesh Prasad vacated the seat upon his election to LS from Faizabad in Ayodhya district in 2024.The victory served as BJP's response to its shock defeat in Faizabad within a few months of PM Modi inaugurating the Ram temple in Ayodhya. In 2022 UP elections, BJP had won four of the five seats within Faizabad LS constituency, of which Milkipur is an assembly segment.In Erode (East), DMK's VC Chandhirakumar won with a margin of 91,374 votes, securing 74% of the vote share and providing a happy tonic to CM MK Stalin's party before next year's assembly elections. AIADMK, BJP, and allies stayed away from the bypolls.NTK's MK Seethalakshmi polled 24,151 votes (15.5%), while NOTA came third with 6,101 votes - among the highest in a TN assembly election. There were 44 other candidates, most of them independents.BJP's third win in Milkipur after 1991 and 2017 reaffirmed CM Yogi Adityanath's position as the party's key electoral strategist in UP, underscoring his ability to mobilise Dalit, OBC, and upper-caste voters. Party's Hindutva-driven messaging proved effective in countering SP's ""Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak"" (PDA) strategy.Yogi framed the win as a reaffirmation of public trust in the party's ""double-engine"" governance - Modi at Centre and a committed UP govt.Voters had supported Yogi in seven out of nine seats where bypolls were held. In Milkipur, the tenth seat, people responded to his appeal, political experts said. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav dismissed the result as a ""false victory"". He said BJP's LS defeat in Ayodhya ""is many times heavier"" than the Milkipur win.","BJP reclaimed Milkipur from SP in a political grudge match.

Though he didn't lose from this constituency, the people here - who once propelled him to political stardom - spoke of his downfall as if it were their own reckoning. This was, after all, where his political journey took root, the karambhoomi where his hunger strike against corruption and taxation in 2013 first captured national attention.But amid the post-mortem of his political loss , another name surfaced just as often - Santosh Kohli.Kohli's story remains a painful chapter in Sunder Nagri's history. The social activist, whose mother played a crucial role in helping Kejriwal establish his Parivartan NGO, was tragically killed in a hit-and-run incident in 2013. ""In this very house, Kejriwal staged his hunger strike. Now my daughter's picture still hangs on these walls. She introduced him to the very people he championed. But when she was taken from us, he turned his back,"" her mother Kalavati told TOI.Today, that very house - once the birthplace of Kejriwal's political career - now wears the colours of the BJP, a stark reminder of shifting tides. Kalavati, now 64, is resolute in her support for the saffron party. ""Not just us, but many former AAP loyalists feel betrayed. I have worked in the social sector for years, and I understand the struggles of my people. And now, almost everyone here supports the BJP-his biggest rival.""For some, his defeat is seen as poetic justice. ""He ignored Kohli's family when they needed him the most. Now, he is facing the consequences of his karma."" Others attribute his loss to his alleged involvement in the liquor scam. ""We once supported him because he stood against corruption. But then his name started surfacing in scandals. It feels like he has come full circle - his rise was built on fighting corruption, and now, corruption has led to his downfall,"" said Vinod Kumar Jain (50).As one wades through the weekly market crowd, the disenchantment is clear. ""What has he truly done for us? I wouldn't mind paying my bills if it meant we had safer roads, cleaner water, and proper sewage systems. But the worst part is how he abandoned the very people who once treated him like family. He didn't even visit after Santosh Kohli's death,"" said a frustrated resident.""We thought he would change the system, but in the end, he became just another politician,"" said another voter.Yet, some still stand by Aam Aadmi Party . ""We are grateful for free water, electricity, and better schools. That's why we continue to vote for AAP. We are sad he lost, but he will always be one of our own,"" admitted one voter.However, in Sunder Nagri's Muslim-majority pockets, Kejriwal's continued support comes with resignation rather than enthusiasm. ""We vote for AAP because we don't have better options. We can't afford to lose subsidies. We don't know how we will pay our bills now,"" said Mehfooz Khan, 52.Kejriwal's absence from Sunder Nagri in recent years has not gone unnoticed.

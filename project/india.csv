Marvel Meets Maharashtra Politics, AI Reels On Civic Polls Turn Thanos, Hulk, Spider-Man Into Netas

PUNE: Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar acknowledged Tuesday that bitterness between the two factions of NCP has eased after they came together for Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, holding out hope for a possible patch-up with his uncle and party founder Sharad Pawar He denied holding talks with Sharad Pawar, 85, on a merger or continued alliance but left the door open. ""There has been no discussion with Pawar Saheb at all. However, I want to make it clear that there are no permanent enemies in politics,"" Ajit Pawar said in an interview to TOI.""People can make whatever inferences they want from my statement,"" he said. ""All I want to say is that I am a follower of Yashwantrao Chavan and I believe in the politics of addition, not subtraction.""Ajit Pawar, 66, and Sharad Pawar formally split in July 2023 when the nephew broke away with several MLAs and joined BJP -led state govt as deputy CM. The rupture followed an earlier, short-lived alignment with BJP in Nov 2019. Now, after months of acrimony that spilled into Lok Sabha and assembly campaigns last year, the two NCP groups have allied for key civic polls in Pune and neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad.Asked whether the alliance would extend beyond the municipal elections, Ajit Pawar said no decision had been taken but acknowledged its immediate impact.""When such an alliance happens, it automatically helps reduce the bitterness on both sides,"" he said, adding that neither group has traded barbs since the pact was sealed.Party workers were instrumental in bridging the divide. ""My section convinced me to ally with them. Similarly, workers from other group conveyed the same message to their seniors,"" he said. Ajit Pawar said he met the netas from Sharad Pawar camp, including Supriya Sule and Rohit Pawar, after which city units negotiated seat-sharing.The deputy CM said the contest in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, initially seen as tilted towards BJP, has tightened. ""Residents are not only listening to us but also responding positively,"" he said, contrasting it with the response he saw while campaigning for his wife Sunetra Pawar during the Lok Sabha elections.He credited the improved mood to the reunion of NCP base. ""NCP supporters have always given their first preference to Pawar Saheb. A section of them also likes my style of working,"" he said. ""When we split, our supporters were divided. Now... both sections have reunited.""Reflecting on his work ethic, Ajit Pawar traced it to his uncle's influence. ""I was in Class III when Pawar Saheb became an MLA,"" he said, recalling serving tea to visitors. ""I've been following the same principle in my political career for over three decades.""Responding to opposition allegations that NCP and BJP had made tacit adjustments by not forming alliances in PMC and PCMC, Ajit Pawar pushed back. ""There is no match-fixing between us,"" he said. ""They are trying to strengthen their party and I am trying the same for mine.""He said the decision for Mahayuti partners to contest separately in the two civic bodies was taken by CM Devendra Fadnavis, citing BJP's numerical strength in both corporations. ""Had talks of an alliance between BJP and Sena failed early, we would have probably got Eknath Shinde's party on our side in both civic bodies,"" he added.","Ajit Pawar, 66, and Sharad Pawar formally split in July 2023.

Infirmities in anti-graft law clause that shields babus: SC; but bench split on nixing it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infirmities-in-anti-graft-law-clause-that-shields-babus-sc-but-bench-split-on-nixing-it/articleshow/126515844.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday held that Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, which bars police and agencies from probing corruption complaints against public servants without prior govt approval, suffered from infirmities. But an SC division bench differed on its implication - while one judge declared it outrightly illegal, saying the provision will protect corrupt officials, the other judge said striking it down would amount to ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" and the defect could be cured by roping in Lokpal/Lokayukta to take a decision on sanction.The split verdict was pronounced by a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan on a PIL challenging the validity of Section 17A.The split verdict by the Supreme Court bench came on a PIL challenging the validity of Section 17A that was introduced in 2018 in the PC Act after a similar provision of Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act was struck down by SC in 2014.Terming Section 17A a ""resurrection"" of the quashed Section 6A of the DSPE Act and saying that ""it is old wine in a new bottle"", Justice B V Nagarathna held that Section 17A has to be struck down for being contrary to the judgments of the larger bench and constitution bench of this court.Justice K V Viswanathan, however, was of the view that there is deficiency in the provision as it does not provide an independent mechanism to impartial examination of corruption complaints against public servants and the task cannot be entrusted to the govt department of the official concerned. He said Section 17A is constitutionally valid, subject to the condition that grant or refusal or the approval by the competent authority mentioned therein will depend on the recommendation of Lokpal or Lokayukta in case of states. In view of divergent opinion, the bench directed the registry to place the case before the CJI for constituting of an appropriate bench to consider afresh the issues which arise in this matter.Emphasising that ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" is not an option, Justice Viswanathan said, ""The panacea of striking down will turn out to be worse than the disease.""He said there was a need to protect honest officers in discharging their duties without fear of frivolous complaint against them and that object is sub-served by Section 17A, but the only aspect missing expressly from the statute is the provision for an independent screening mechanism.""Civil servants should have the necessary freedom to take administrative decisions and express their views fearlessly without any threat of frivolous or vexatious complaints, for if they were to be exposed to such complaints in the future, there will be a chilling effect on them and their hands will be shackled. The net result will be a policy paralysis. It will be the tendency of every civil servant then to play it safe by taking no decision at all,"" Justice Viswanathan said. The judge agreed with the Law Commission's 254th report, which also suggested involving Lokpal/Lokayukta in the process under Section 17A.Emphasising that there should be zero tolerance towards corruption, Justice Nagarathna said the provision would protect a corrupt official as mandatory prior sanction would embolden officials to toe the line of their superior to make themselves safe. ""In all the above circumstances, prior approval under Section 17A of the Act may not be granted by the department even when public servants have to ideally be inquired/enquired/investigated within the meaning of Section 17A of the PC Act. This means the mechanism of a prior approval would be used to protect public servants who would align and against those who do not fall in line by a threat of commencing an inquiry/investigation against them,"" she said.She said there is need for an independent and autonomous person or body, who or which has nothing to do with the formulation and implementation of departmental policies or in the making of a recommendation or taking of a decision, to consider a request under Section 17A of the PC Act. ""Such a body within the govt as per the said provision is conspicuous by its absence inasmuch as the same is not spelt out in the provision,"" Justice Nagarathna said, adding there is ""lack of objectivity, neutrality and fairness"" in the provision.""In my view, there ought to have been an independent body which is not controlled by the govt to consider a case for grant of prior approval to conduct an inquiry/enquiry/investigation by a police officer. In the absence of such an independent and autonomous body which can make an impartial consideration with objectivity, Section 17A of the PC Act would be effectively frustrated for being vague and lacking in any guidance,"" Justice Nagarathna said.Justice Viswanathan said if Section 17A is invalidated on the ground that prior approval should not exist at all, the immediate consequence would be that any complaint alleging corruption in official decision-making could straightaway result in a police inquiry or investigation.""This would permit immediate registration of FIRs, commencement of investigation and resort to coercive steps in cases involving recommendations and decisions in discharge of duty, regardless of whether the complaint is frivolous, motivated or based on hindsight. Such a result would be regressive,"" he said.","Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act bars police and agencies from probing corruption complaints against public servants without prior govt approval.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

NEW DELHI: Jammu & Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Tuesday ordered the termination of five J&K govt staffers over alleged links with terror outfits and their Pakistan-based commanders working with ISI to plot and execute terror attacks in India.Among the employees dismissed under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution are laboratory technician Tariq Ahmad Rah and forest field worker Farooq Ahmad Bhat, both from Anantnag. The two, along with ex-MLA Gul Mohammad Akhoon, are accused in a case taken over by the J&K state investigation agency (SIA) in Sept 2023, facing charges of a criminal conspiracy to extend logistical support to Hizbul Mujahideen (Hizb) divisional commander Mohammad Amin Baba alias Aabid and facilitate his escape to Pakistan in 2005 via the Attari-Wagah border. Amin Baba was Tariq’s uncle and divisional commander of Hizb from 1998 to 2005. Farooq, who was then informally working as a personal assistant to Akhoon, helped Tariq plan Amin Baba’s escape. Farooq used his government identity card to avoid security checks at nakas and dropped Amin Baba at the international border. Ex-MLA Akhoon provided a government Gypsy vehicle, with his personal security officers and driver, to transport Amin Baba to the international border.“Amin Baba is currently operating from Islamabad and attends regular meetings with ISI, LeT and Jaish operatives, to plot terrorist activities in India. He trains HM cadres in PoJK terror camps and recruits Kashmiri youths for terror,” sources shared.Both Tariq and Farooq were arrested in 2024 but later got bail. Inputs suggest they have since resumed their terror activities.Others sacked on Monday include school teacher Mohd Ishfaq who was arrested in 2022 before he could execute a Lashker e Taiba plot to kill a police officer in Doda; and driver Mohd Yousf who, on the direction of Pakistan-based HM terrorist Bashir Ahmad Bhat, was procuring arms and transporting terror funds in Ganderbal area. Also fired was assistant lineman Bashir Ahmad Mir for having provided shelter to two LeT terrorists before they were neutralised by the security forces in his house in September 2021.With the latest set of dismissals, the total number of J&K govt employees terminated by the Manoj Sinha administration so far has risen to 85. ""Since 2021, the LG has decisively removed terrorists and their enablers from government service, while simultaneously extending opportunities and dignity to the genuine victims of terror by providing them employment,"" a J&K govt official told TOI.As per the dossiers on the five sacked J&K govt staffers accessed by TOI, Mohd Ishfaq was working for LeT and was in regular contact with Pakistan-based LeT commander Mohd Amin alias Abu Khubaib, designated by India as an individual terrorist. Ishfaq was put under surveillance and arrested in April 2022 before he could execute an LeT plan to kill a police officer in Doda. Investigators found he was misusing his position as a teacher to influence youth to join terror groups.Bashir Ahmed Mir was found to be operating as an overground worker of LeT in Gurez area of Bandipora. “He was guiding the movement of terrorists, providing them logistical support and sharing information on movement of security forces. His role came to light in Sept 2021 when anti-terror operations were launched at his house and two terrorists hiding there were neutralised,” an officer told TOI.Two AK-47 weapons and ammunition were recovered from Bashir’s house. He was arrested but later got bail on medical grounds.Mohd Yousf, a govt hospital driver posted at Bemina, Srinagar, was in regular contact with Pakistan-based Hizb operative Bashir Ahmad Bhat. On July 20, 2024, the police intercepted a vehicle in which Yousf and his associate Eashan Hamid were travelling, and recovered one pistol, ammunition, grenade and Rs 5 lakh in cash. Yousf revealed he was delivering the consignment to a terrorist on the direction of his Pakistani handler. He also confessed to providing phones to jailed terrorists to establish communication with their Pakistan-based handlers.","Jammu & Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Tuesday ordered the termination of five J&K govt staffers over alleged links with terror outfits.

Shaksgam Valley Row Deepens As China Rejects India’s Claim And Defends CPEC Infra Project With Pak

NEW DELHI: BJP has raised several sticking points - ranging from border tensions to trade issues - in India-China ties in its interaction with a visiting Communist Party of China (CPC) delegation, emphasising that these were not helpful to their relations, as the two parties touched base after a gap of over six years amid signs of a possible thaw in the bilateral equation.The meeting on Monday with the Chinese delegation led by Sun Haiyan, vice minister of CPC's international liaison department, a senior rank in Beijing's foreign ministry hierarchy, was sought by the Chinese embassy here, and it sparked a war of words between BJP and Congress.Congress accused the governing BJP of ""hypocrisy, pretence and deceit"" as it recalled the relentless attack it has faced for allegedly signing an MoU with China's governing party. It demanded to know details of the meetings.BJP described the interaction as a ""formal meeting"" following ""improved"" relations between the two countries and hit back at Congress, saying it had nothing to hide as it was not entering into any secretive MoU with CPC. It also pointed to the meeting that leader of opposition - then Congress president - Rahul Gandhi had with the then Chinese ambassador during a tense standoff at Doklam in 2017.BJP sources said party's representatives - general secretary Arun Singh and foreign department head Vijay Chauthaiwale - brought up the border issues, export curbs like on tunnel boring machines as well as rare and critical minerals. These are not helpful for the professed desire to improve ties.CPC was keen on resumption of party-to-party ties with BJP, which had stalled since Singh led a party delegation to China in 2019, sources said, emphasising that the meetings, including with RSS on Tuesday, were requested by the visitors.On X, Chauthaiwale said they discussed at length ""the means to advance inter party communications"" between BJP and CPC. Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong also joined the delegation.RSS sources have said it was a courtesy meeting at the request of the visitors and was done with ministry of external affair's approval.Slamming BJP, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said people had a right to know what transpired in its closed-door meeting with the CPC delegation, alleging govt had pursued a policy of meek surrender in handling China.There was no problem in a political party engaging in dialogue with a party of another country, he said, accusing BJP of double standards. The CPC delegation also met Congress's foreign department head Salman Khurshid. Khera said govt had approved the meeting.BJP spokesperson Tuhin Sinha retorted that his party had nothing to hide. Congress was unable to explain its MoU so many years after it was signed, he said.The meeting, initiated at the request of CPC, has followed a thaw in the ties between two countries, with resumption of flights and ongoing efforts to boost trade, he noted.

'Wrong call': Gautam Gambhir slammed for risking Washington Sundar; reminded of 'injured' Shubman Gill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand/gautam-gambhir-slammed-for-risking-washington-sundar-reminded-of-injured-shubman-gill/articleshow/126497172.cms,"Gautam Gambhir and Shubman Gill (AFP Photo)

Harshit Rana press conference: 'Team wants to groom me as an all-rounder'

NEW DELHI: Washington Sundar ’s decision to walk out to bat despite a visible injury during the first ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara has sparked debate around the Indian team management’s handling of injured players. Sundar was seen limping and struggling to walk but still came out to the middle when India needed support for KL Rahul in a tense chase of 301 runs.The spin-bowling all-rounder was risked despite his fitness concerns, and the move backfired as his injury worsened. Sundar remained unbeaten on 7 off 7 balls in the series opener, playing a supporting role as Rahul guided India to a four-wicket win. However, shortly after the match, Sundar was ruled out of the remainder of the series and was replaced by Ayush Badoni.Sundar’s appearance at the crease raised several questions, particularly about the Gautam Gambhir-led team management’s approach to player welfare. Among those critical of the decision was former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif , who openly questioned the logic behind sending an injured player into the middle.Kaif pointed out what he described as a double standard, drawing parallels with Shubman Gill ’s injury management during the South Africa Test series.He reminded the Indian team management that Gill was rested and not allowed to bat to prevent aggravation of his injury.""You will remember when Shubman Gill was injured, he did not come out to bat in that Test match, the Kolkata Test. It was a high-scoring game and people thought that even 20 or 30 runs from him could help India win, but he still did not bat. That was done to give full protection to the player so the injury would not aggravate. But the same approach was not applied with Sundar. That is why I feel it was a wrong call. KL Rahul's running between the wickets was affected. Even though India won the match, I feel there were higher chances of aggravating the injury in yesterday's game,"" Kaif said on his YouTube channel.Kaif further explained why sending Sundar in such a situation carried unnecessary risk.""If he is injured and you need runs at a run-a-ball, you should first try someone else. When a player is injured and you send him in under pressure, the injury can worsen. He couldn't run doubles even though the ball was going to deep point or square leg, and he was only managing singles. Although the required run rate was around a run-a-ball and the match was under control, I felt that sending an injured player was risky. What might have been a one-week or ten-day injury could stretch to 20, 25, or even 30 days,"" he added.""I believe that was a wrong call. You could have sent Kuldeep, or anyone else, even Siraj or Prasidh Krishna, if you just needed to play out the run-a-ball situation. Only when it becomes absolutely unavoidable, right at the end, should you send Washington Sundar,"" Kaif asserted.Sundar is part of India’s squad for the T20 World Cup 2026, which begins on February 7, making his fitness a key concern going forward.","Washington Sundar was seen limping and struggling to walk during the first ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara.

Vande Bharat Sleeper: Top Features

Vande Bharat sleeper launch soon! Indian Railways is all set to launch its first Vande Bharat sleeper this week, with PM Narendra Modi expected to flag off the new train on January 117 between Howrah and Kamakhya (Guwahati). Ahead of the launch, Indian Railways has announced the fare structure and ticket prices for the Vande Bharat sleeper train.Built specifically for overnight travel and long-distance routes, the Vande Bharat sleeper is a fully air-conditioned trainset developed in-house by Indian Railways. These trains are intended for routes spanning roughly 1,200 to 1,500 kilometres, catering to passengers travelling across states during night hours.For the Vande Bharat Sleeper service, Indian Railways has set a minimum chargeable distance of 400 km for fare calculation.During test runs on the Kota–Nagda section, the Vande Bharat sleeper achieved its designed top speed of 180 kmph. One of the highlights of the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained steady without spilling, even at speeds exceeding 180 kmph.Although the train is designed for semi-high-speed operations of up to 160 kmph in regular service, trials have been conducted at 180 kmph.Actual operating speeds will depend on the condition and capability of tracks on different sections of the network.The sleeper version is designed as the long-haul, overnight counterpart to the Vande Bharat chair car services currently operating across India.Drawing inspiration from European rail design, the sleeper coaches feature cushioned berths for improved comfort and redesigned access to upper berths for easier movement.Passenger amenities include soft night lighting, integrated audio-visual passenger information systems, CCTV surveillance and modular pantry units.The trains will be equipped with aircraft-style bio-vacuum toilets, including facilities for persons with disabilities, baby care areas and shower units with hot water in the first-class coach.Safety systems include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision technology, while regenerative braking will be used to enhance energy efficiency, similar to existing Vande Bharat chair car trains.Additional features include sealed gangways and automatic inter-coach doors to maintain air quality and cabin temperature, along with personal reading lights, charging points, foldable snack tables and interiors finished with GFRP panels.Train doors will open automatically at designated stations. A centralised coach monitoring system and emergency communication facilities will allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive pilot when necessary.","Vande Bharat sleeper will have 11 AC-3 tier coaches, 4 AC-2 tier coaches and one AC First coach.

Trump’s fresh blow: 25% tariffs on countries trading with Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-fresh-blow-25-tariffs-on-countries-trading-with-iran-what-does-it-mean-for-india/articleshow/126495757.cms,"India already faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US.

Donald Trump’s Iran Trade Tariff Warning Puts India In A Bind Over Exports, Chabahar And US Ties

How Will 25% Additional Tariffs Impact India?



India-Iran Trade Overview

In a fresh round of global tariffs, US President Donald Trump has announced that countries doing trade with Iran will attract a 25% tariff from the world’s largest economy. The move is seen as a pressure tactic on Iran over its response to nationwide protests that have reportedly claimed nearly 600 lives.Trump has repeatedly warned that his administration could consider military action if it determines that the Iranian government is using lethal force against demonstrators. Trump described this as a threshold Iran is ‘beginning to cross,’ prompting discussions within his national security team on what he called ‘very strong options’.The tariff decision was announced by Trump in a social media post on Monday, where he said that measures would take effect immediately. Several major economies, including China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, and India maintain trade ties with Iran.“Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!,” Trump posted on Truth Social.India already faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US. While 25% of this figure are ‘reciprocal’ tariffs’, the remaining 25% are a penal duty for India’s crude oil imports from Russia.India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.India’s key exports to Iran span a range of products, including rice (especially basmati), tea, sugar, pharmaceutical goods, man-made staple fibres, electrical equipment, and imitation jewellery. In return, India mainly imports items such as dry fruits, inorganic and organic chemicals, and glassware from Iran.In 2023, rice was India’s largest export item to Iran at $734 million, followed by soybean meal valued at $96.8 million and bananas worth $52 million. On the import side, India’s purchases from Iran were dominated by acyclic alcohol derivatives that are halogenated, sulphonated or nitrated, amounting to $309 million.Also read: 'Seize and hold the cities'; 5 takeaways from Reza Pahlavi's declaration amid Iran protests

Iran is a crucial market for Indian basmati rice, typically purchasing more than one million tonnes each year, according to reports. Iran has traditionally been among the biggest overseas markets for Indian basmati rice. Reports suggest that Iran purchases close to 12 lakh tonnes each year, with the trade estimated at around Rs 12,000 crore.However, Iran is not among its top 5 trading partners in terms of both imports and exports. India’s top exporting destinations are currently the United States of America, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, China, United Kingdom - accounting for 41% of India’s exports according to the Ministry of Commerce dashboard.Beyond merchandise trade, the development of the Chabahar port remains a cornerstone of India-Iran economic cooperation. Situated in Iran’s Sistan-Balochistan province along the country’s resource-rich southern coastline, the port is being jointly developed to strengthen regional connectivity and expand trade links.From a trade and strategy perspective, India also has a major stake in Iran’s Chabahar port. Last year, the US extended its sanctions waiver for Iran’s Chabahar port by an additional six months to April this year. The waiver had earlier been withdrawn in September 2025 when the US State Department cancelled the exemption first issued in 2018, which had allowed India to develop the port as a gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia while avoiding routes through Pakistan, as part of efforts to increase pressure on Tehran.If the exemption were to lapse, entities involved in operating the port or engaging in related activities could be exposed to US penalties under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act.Chabahar has gained strategic relevance for India’s outreach to Afghanistan, especially as engagement with the Taliban administration in Kabul has been gradually improving.","India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years. Iran is a crucial market for Indian basmati rice, typically purchasing more than one million tonnes each year. The development of the Chabahar port remains a cornerstone of India-Iran economic cooperation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126495799,imgsize-38246,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-tariffs.jpg"

Why the German Type-214NG was selected



Make in India at the core



Pakistan, Karachi and the logic of sea denial



China’s expanding undersea footprint



Strategic timing of Merz’s visit



French-origin Scorpene follow-on plan put on hold as Project-75I gained priority



Long-term impact on India’s naval posture



NEW DELHI: More than five decades after Indian naval strikes crippled Karachi during the 1971 war, undersea power is once again at the heart of New Delhi’s strategic thinking. As German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began his visit to India on Monday amid a more volatile regional and global security environment, discussions around Project-75I have acquired fresh urgency.The Indian Navy’s plan to induct six next-generation conventional submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion reflects a convergence of hard lessons from history, renewed friction with Pakistan following recent crises, and China’s expanding undersea presence in the Indian Ocean. Together, these factors are pushing India towards one of its most consequential naval procurement decisions in years, one that blends deterrence, indigenisation and long-term strategic signalling.Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel-electric submarines equipped with fuel-cell-based air-independent propulsion, advanced sensors, torpedoes and missile systems. The Ministry of Defence issued the Request for Proposal for the project in July 2021 under the Strategic Partnership Model, describing it as a key pillar of the government’s Make in India push, according to a PIB statement.The project envisages indigenous construction, long-term technology transfer and the creation of a domestic submarine-building ecosystem. The estimated cost was over Rs 40,000 crore at the RFP stage, with current assessments placing the final contract value closer to $8 billion, or about Rs 72,000 crore, based on configuration and lifecycle support.For the Indian Navy, the programme addresses a critical gap. Its conventional submarine fleet is ageing even as undersea activity by China and Pakistan increases in the Indian Ocean and along India’s maritime approaches.The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine, edging out Spain’s S-80 Plus offered by Navantia, defence sources said. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system, acoustic stealth and lower lifecycle risk.AIP allows submarines to remain submerged for weeks without surfacing or snorkeling, reducing detection risk. In contested waters, endurance and silence are decisive. The Type-214’s AIP technology is widely regarded as operationally proven, while competing systems are still undergoing validation.In undersea warfare, reliability and survivability often outweigh novelty. That calculus appears to have guided the Navy’s choice.Under the proposed framework, all six submarines will be built in India at MDL, with TKMS providing design authority, engineering expertise and technical consultancy. Indigenous content is expected to start at around 45 percent and rise to nearly 60 percent by the final boat, aligning with Atmanirbhar Bharat goals.TKMS and MDL signed a memorandum of understanding in June last year to jointly pursue the project, laying the groundwork for the partnership. MDL’s prior experience building Scorpène-class submarines under the earlier Project-75 strengthened its case as the Indian strategic partner.The ministry of defence has repeatedly stressed that Project-75I is not only about acquiring platforms but about absorbing complex submarine design and construction technologies, as outlined in the 2021 PIB release.India’s emphasis on undersea capability is rooted in history. During the 1971 war, the Indian Navy’s attacks on Karachi port crippled Pakistan’s maritime logistics and fuel supply, accelerating Islamabad’s defeat. That episode stressed how control of the seas can shape outcomes on land.The relevance of that lesson resurfaced during Operation Sindoor in May 2025, when tensions with Pakistan escalated following a major terror provocation. Between May 8 and May 11, India placed its naval forces on heightened readiness, with Karachi again emerging as Pakistan’s most critical vulnerability.Karachi handles the bulk of Pakistan’s maritime trade and energy imports. India’s ability to credibly threaten that hub, even without firing a shot, highlighted the deterrent value of naval and undersea power. New submarines with extended underwater endurance would sharpen that leverage.Beyond Pakistan, China looms large in India’s maritime threat assessment. The People’s Liberation Army Navy operates a rapidly expanding submarine fleet, including nuclear-powered platforms that have increasingly deployed into the Indian Ocean.Chinese submarines have docked at regional ports and conducted patrols close to Indian waters, while Pakistan, with Chinese assistance, is also upgrading its submarine arm. For Indian planners, this twin challenge has made restoring conventional submarine strength an urgent priority.Project-75I is designed to plug that gap by giving India a survivable, persistent undersea capability suited to monitoring choke points, tracking adversary submarines and conducting sea-denial operations.Chancellor Merz’s visit from January 12–13 comes amid a broader effort by Germany to expand its strategic footprint in the Indo-Pacific. Berlin and New Delhi are also working toward an EU-India free trade agreement, as noted by AFP.For India, the potential submarine deal fits into a wider diversification of defence partnerships beyond legacy suppliers such as Russia. For Germany, it represents an opportunity to anchor a long-term industrial and security relationship with the world’s largest democracy.According to informed defence sources cited by idrw.org, the final contract is not expected to be signed during Merz’s visit but could be concluded within the next three months, with the high-level engagement expected to provide political momentum.In October 2025, India put on hold plans to build three additional French-origin Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, even as it moved decisively to push ahead with Project-75I, which envisages the construction of six new-generation German-origin diesel-electric submarines at the same shipyard, The Times of India reported.Top government sources told TOI that the proposal for the three additional Scorpenes, estimated to cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “was not being pursued” at the time, although a formal decision to scrap it had not been recorded. While cost negotiations for the Scorpene follow-on order had concluded in the previous fiscal, final clearance from the Prime Minister-led Cabinet Committee on Security remained on hold.Officials told TOI that the German submarines under Project-75I were considered “a generation ahead” in terms of technology and capability. Concerns also existed about MDL’s ability to simultaneously execute two complex submarine construction programmes. The six original Kalvari-class submarines had already been built at MDL under the earlier Project-75 contract signed in October 2005, with the first boat INS Kalvari commissioned in December 2017 and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, inducted in January 2025.All six Kalvari-class submarines were slated to be retrofitted with the DRDO-developed air-independent propulsion system to improve underwater endurance. AIP allows a diesel-electric submarine to remain submerged for nearly two weeks, compared to boats without the system that must surface or snorkel every few days to recharge batteries.In contrast, the submarines planned under Project-75I, to be built in partnership with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, were designed to incorporate AIP from the outset, along with land-attack cruise missiles and other next-generation technologies, TOI reported.Sources told TOI that the decision to proceed with final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines, with an option for three more at a later stage, followed extensive deliberations involving the defence ministry, the Navy and the National Security Council Secretariat. Formal contract negotiations began in September 2025.“These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” a source told TOI.Despite the pause on the Scorpene extension, officials indicated that France’s broader strategic partnership with India remained strong. Negotiations progressed on additional Rafale fighters for the Indian Air Force’s proposed 114 multi-role fighter aircraft programme, as well as a collaboration to co-develop a powerful jet engine with French major Safran for India’s fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft was nearly finalised.At the time, the Navy’s conventional submarine strength stood at six Scorpenes, six ageing Russian Kilo-class boats and four German HDW submarines, alongside two nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. China, by comparison, operated more than 50 diesel-electric and around 10 nuclear submarines and was in the process of supplying eight Yuan-class AIP-equipped submarines to Pakistan, a development seen as a major capability boost for Islamabad, TOI reported.Once inducted, the six Type-214NG submarines will significantly enhance the Indian Navy’s capacity for covert surveillance, sea denial and precision strike missions. Their sensors, weapons and endurance will form a key layer of India’s maritime deterrence architecture.Equally important is the industrial legacy. By absorbing advanced submarine technologies, India positions itself for future indigenous designs and follow-on projects. MDL’s role would be strengthened, and a specialised domestic supply chain would be deepened.Project-75I marks one of the most consequential naval procurement decisions India has taken in years. It addresses hard lessons from 1971, recent operational realities with Pakistan, and the growing challenge posed by China’s undersea expansion.As Germany’s chancellor arrives in India, the submarine negotiations underscore how defence industrial cooperation has become central to New Delhi’s foreign policy. From Karachi’s burning docks in 1971 to the silent depths of the Indian Ocean today, India’s maritime strategy is being reshaped through capability, indigenisation and strategic foresight.",Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel- electric submarines. The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system.

Congress questions BJP’s China dealings

BJP hits back, cites ‘improved’ ties

TMC alleges ‘double standards’

NEW DELHI: A visit by a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to New Delhi has triggered a sharp political row with the Congress and the BJP trading accusations over transparency and India’s China policy.The row began after a CPC delegation led by its international department’s vice minister Sun Haiyan visited the BJP headquarters on Monday. Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong was also part of the delegation.A BJP team headed by party general secretary Arun Singh discussed “the means to advance inter-party communications between the BJP and the Communist Party of China”, BJP's foreign affairs department in-charge Vijay Chauthaiwale wrote on X.The delegation also called on RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Tuesday in what PTI sources described as a courtesy visit requested by the Chinese side.The CPC delegation also met Congress leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid. The Congress said the meeting took place at the delegation’s request and with the approval of the government of India.Latching on the visit, the Congress mounted an attack on the BJP accusing it of double standards and demanding full disclosure of its engagements with the CPC.He questioned whether the BJP or the RSS raised issues such as border transgressions, trade imbalance, rare earth supplies and Chinese support to Pakistan. “We have no problems that you meet… The issue is that do you raise critical questions when you meet behind closed doors?” Khera asked.""The BJP has taught even a chameleon how to change its colours. Those who were supposed to show 'red eyes' to China have instead rolled out a 'red carpet' for it. The BJP has held meetings with China's party, the CPC. Even when they were not in power, they used to visit China and hold meetings; RSS members even went there for training,"" he added.Demanding transparency, he said, “This must include public disclosure of the agenda, outcomes and minutes of all closed-door meetings held between representatives of the CPC and BJP/RSS functionaries.”The BJP rejected Congress’s allegations saying its meeting with the CPC was formal and open. BJP spokesperson Tuhin Sinha said, “It was a process of a formal meeting. A formal meeting takes place when a situation improves. We do it very openly.”“We do not secretly sign any such MoU which we can not explain for years,” he added.Sinha said the meeting took place because “things have improved”, pointing to the resumption of flights and ongoing trade talks. He also attacked Rahul Gandhi, saying he had lost the right to question the government’s foreign policy.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said the Congress had “no locus” to raise border issues, claiming the roots of the China problem lay in the Nehru era. “Nevertheless, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government has been working to resolve it. And that effort is continuing unabated,” he said.The Trinamool Congress also criticised the BJP over the CPC visit. TMC Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose accused the ruling party of hypocrisy, saying China had lent “open military support” to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor and had reiterated its claim over the Shaksgam Valley.“Just imagine if an opposition leader or party had done this.

JAMMU: Gunshots rang out in the air Tuesday after security forces launched a joint search operation in Najote, a remote village in J&K’s Kathua district, based on information about the presence of terrorists there. The area lies near Kamadh Nallah in Kahog forest belt, where an encounter had erupted on Jan 7. The same evening, officials said two “drone-like objects” were spotted hovering over a village in Rajouri district.“Intermittent firing was reported from Najote forest area in Billawar, about 10km from Kamadh Nallah,” an official said, adding that suspected terrorists fired a few rounds upon spotting the search party, attracting retaliatory fire. The cordon was subsequently fortified while troops continued hunting the ultras.“DIG (Jammu-Samba-Kathua Range) Shiv Kumar Sharma and Kathua SSP Mohita Sharma were present at the spot and monitored the ongoing operation till late Tuesday.

"ICMR eyes single test to detect multiple diseases, cut delays in right treatment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/icmr-eyes-single-test-to-detect-multiple-diseases-cut-delays-in-right-treatment/articleshow/126512868.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant effort to speed up diagnosis of serious infections - a move that experts say could also help reduce unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and mitigate the risk of anti-microbial resistance - Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has moved to develop a single diagnostic test capable of detecting multiple infections simultaneously.Patients arriving at hospitals with fever, breathlessness or severe illness are often subjected to a cascade of tests - dengue, influenza, Covid and typhoid - as doctors rule out infections one by one. Each negative report delays diagnosis and treatment, sometimes with serious consequences.To change this, ICMR has drawn up a plan to develop multiplex molecular diagnostic tests that can identify several infections in a single run, sharply cutting diagnostic delays and improving clinical decision-making.Currently, hospitals rely largely on symptom-based provisional diagnosis. ""Once a patient comes to a hospital with a suspected infectious cause, samples are sent for testing based on the provisional diagnosis,"" said Dr Hitender Gautam, professor of microbiology at AIIMS. ""If the test is positive, definitive diagnosis is made and treatment started. But if it is negative, testing for other pathogens follows - and this often leads to delay in diagnosis and delay in correct treatment. ""ICMR has flagged that this step-by-step approach not only raises costs, but also risks missing the actual cause, as many infections present with overlapping symptoms. The planned single-test model is intended to screen for priority pathogens in one go, allowing clinicians to move faster from suspicion to confirmation.The diagnostic delays have wider clinical consequences. While test results are awaited, doctors often initiate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. ""Empirical antibiotic therapy is started during the provisional diagnosis phase and broadly covers many microorganisms,"" Gautam said. ""If this continues for long without a positive report, it increases the chances of antimicrobial resistance,"" he said.Concerns over this trend are reflected in the ICMR-Antimicrobial Resistance Research & Surveillance Network (AMRSN) annual report 2024, which shows that several routinely used antibiotics are rapidly losing effectiveness against bacteria most frequently isolated from hospitals.Faster, syndrome-based diagnosis could help reverse this pattern by enabling an early shift to targeted therapy, which carries a much lower risk of resistance. ICMR has also linked quicker diagnosis to stronger outbreak surveillance, citing lessons from Covid, when delayed detection allowed early silent transmission.The proposed tests will be tailored to India's disease burden, using national surveillance data. ICMR will support Indian manufacturers and research institutions to develop, validate and scale up these kits, including rapid production during outbreaks and future pandemics. Proposals are due by Jan 25.","Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has moved to develop a single diagnostic test. Currently, hospitals rely largely on symptom-based provisional diagnosis.

NEW DELHI: Holding that the constitutional goal of fraternity can be achieved only when a rickshaw puller's child studies in a school alongside the child of a multi-millionaire or a Supreme Court judge, the apex court Tuesday initiated the exercise to ensure that all schools make available 25% free seats for children from poor and disadvantaged sections, as mandated under Right to Education Act (RTE).A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said the RTE Act envisages elementary education for all children in a shared institutional space without differentiating them on the basis of caste, class, gender or economic status. Writing the judgment, Justice Narasimha said, ""It makes it possible, normatively and structurally, for the child of a multi-millionaire or even of a Judge of the Supreme Court of India to sit in the same classroom and at the same bench as the child of an autorickshaw driver or a street vendor. This is the way Section 12 seeks to concretise the constitutional principle of fraternity alongside equality and liberty.""Dispelling the skepticism of many holding the traditional but mistaken view that 'fraternity' is non-enforceable, SC said, ""Unlike equality and liberty, which are frequently framed as individual rights-claims, fraternity is relational; it operates through institutional arrangements that enable individuals to 'lose suspect identities' based on caste, class or other hierarchies and to form solidaristic bonds.""In this sense, the 25% inclusion under Section 12, in unaided neighbourhood schools, is not an isolated welfare measure but a vehicle through which the constitutional commitment to fraternity and the 'development of the child' as recognised in Article 21A and Article 39(f) is sought to be realised,"" it said. The court also cited the Kothari Commission report's emphasis on the Common School System wherein children from every section of society get equal education without discrimination.It quoted HRD ministry's statement: ""The often-voiced concern about how 25% children from disadvantaged groups and weaker sections can cope in an environment where rich children exist can be resolved when teaching-learning process and teachers use these children as sources of knowledge so that their esteem and recognition go up and they begin to be treated as equals."" The bench said it is necessary and compelling to formulate subordinate legislation by issuing necessary rules and regulations, prescribing the method and manner by which children of weaker and disadvantaged sections are to be admitted in neighbourhood schools.""We direct the appropriate authorities to prepare and issue, in consultation with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and SCPCRs, as the case may be, as well as the National and State Advisory Councils, necessary rules and regulations under Section 38 of the Act for implementing the mandate of Section 12(1)(c) of the Act,"" it said.""We further direct NCPCR to collate information about the issuance of rules and regulations by the states and UTs and file an affidavit before this Court by March 31,"" the bench said, listing the matter for further hearing on April 6.",The apex court Tuesday initiated the exercise to ensure that all schools make available 25% free seats for children from poor and disadvantaged sections.

It said that the provision contemplates ""maintenance of dependants"", including ""widowed daughter in-law"" from the estate of her father-in-law.""A son or the legal heirs are bound to maintain all the dependent persons out of estate inherited i.e. all persons whom the deceased was legally and morally bound to maintain. Therefore, on the death of son, it is the pious obligation of father-in-law to maintain widowed daughter-in-law, if she is unable to maintain herself either on her own or through the property left behind by the deceased son.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shortlisted 11 medical institutions across the country for a study to define what is medically normal for Indian children and adolescents - a move expected to significantly improve diagnosis and treatment.At present, many of the ""normal ranges"" used to interpret children's blood tests and other investigations are based on data from western populations, which doctors say may not accurately reflect Indian children's health profiles. The new study aims to address the gap by generating India-specific reference values. ""These reference values are crucial in helping doctors decide whether a child's test result falls within a healthy range or requires medical attention,"" said Dr Tushar Sehgal, in charge or hematology section in department of laboratory medicine of AIIMS and one of the principal investigators.""Children are not small adults, and Indian children are influenced by distinct genetic, nutritional and environmental factors. Using reference values developed for other populations can lead to errors. Creating indigenous reference ranges will greatly improve diagnostic accuracy and help avoid both unnecessary treatment and missed diagnoses,"" Dr Sehgal said. He added so-called ""normal"" blood test values can vary depending on where people live and their nutritional background.People living at high altitudes, for instance, naturally have higher haemoglobin levels because their bodies adapt to lower oxygen levels.The shortlisted institutions include AIIMS Delhi, Jodhpur, Raipur, Bhopal, Kalyani and Gauhati along with NIMHANS and others medical institutes. Under the study, data will be collected from healthy children and adolescents to establish reliable baseline health values that clinicians can use across hospitals and diagnostic laboratories.","The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shortlisted 11 medical institutions across the country for a study.

J&K: Pakistan drones sighted along LoC; second time in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-pakistan-drones-sighted-along-loc-second-time-in-48-hours/articleshow/126508334.cms,"Suspected Pakistani Drones Spotted Along LoC, IB Near Samba, Rajouri & Poonch Districts In J&K

NEW DELHI: Another drones were sighted along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir , prompting the Indian Army to activate counter-Unmanned Aircraft System measures, ANI sources said on Tuesday.The drones were sighted second time in last 48 hours alonf the international border and LoC.The development comes amid a sharp warning from Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi to Pakistan over active terror camps across the border.ANI sources said the drones were detected in forward areas and were engaged using counter-UAS protocols to prevent any potential threat. Further details are awaited.The sightings come a day after security forces detected suspected Pakistan-origin drones along both the International Border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir’s Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts. Officials said the flying objects were seen entering from the Pakistan side, hovering briefly over Indian territory and then returning.Following the sightings, ground search operations were launched across the affected areas. In the Nowshera sector of Rajouri district, Army troops opened fire with medium and light machine guns after observing drone movement over Gania-Kalsian village around 6.35 pm, officials said.Another drone was spotted over Khabbar village in the Teryath area of Rajouri district around the same time. In Samba district, a drone-like object with a blinking light was seen hovering for several minutes over Chak Babral village in the Ramgarh sector around 7.15 pm. A similar object was also noticed moving from the direction of Tain towards Topa in the Mankote sector along the LoC in Poonch district.The heightened alert along the border comes as Army chief General Dwivedi said that Operation Sindoor , launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack, remains ongoing and warned Islamabad against any future misadventure.“At least 6 terror camps still active across the LoC & 2 across the International Border after Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Will act, if any (nefarious) attempts are carried out,” the Army chief said while addressing the annual Army Day press conference.Reflecting on the operation, he said, “Operation Sindoor was conceptualised and executed with precision. Through 22 minutes of initiation on 7th May and an orchestration that lasted 88 hours up to 10th May, the operation reset strategic assumptions by striking deep, dismantling terror infrastructure, and puncturing the longstanding nuclear rhetoric.”General Dwivedi said Indian forces destroyed seven of the nine identified targets and later played a key role in ensuring a calibrated response to Pakistani actions. He also said about 100 Pakistan Army personnel were killed in firing along the LoC and International Border during the period of heightened tensions.“The entire country stands with the Army,” he said, adding that any future response would be resolute and coordinated across services.Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes under Operation Sindoor on the intervening nights of May 6 and May 7, destroying terror hideouts in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and mainland Pakistan, including facilities linked to Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke. India has said the strikes were aimed solely at terror infrastructure, while subsequent Pakistani missile and drone attempts were intercepted by Indian air defence systems.","The drones were sighted second time in last 48 hours alonf the international border and LoC.

The case so far



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday continued hearing the case on stray dogs, warning that states will likely pay a compensation for 'not doing anything' for every bite that leads to death or injury to either children or the elderly.The apex court also asked for accountability from those claiming to be dog feeders, telling them to continue their activity from their house. The hearing took place in front of three-judge special bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N.V. AnjariaJustice Nath said, ""For every dog bite, death or injury caused to children or elderly, we are likely going to fix heavy compensation by state, for not doing anything. Also, liability and accountability on those who are saying we are feedings dogs. Do it, take them to your house.

The organisation that is feeding them? You want us to shut our eyes to the problem.""The SC had refused to examine allegations of harassment of women dog feeders and caregivers, reiterating that such complaints fall under law and order issues and that affected individuals can lodge FIRs. Hearing arguments in the stray dogs case, the apex court also declined to consider claims that derogatory remarks were being made against women in the course of the debate.The three-judge special bench observed that some of the submissions made before it were 'far from reality' and pointed to several videos showing stray dogs attacking children and elderly persons.The court was hearing a batch of pleas, including those filed by dog lovers, seeking modification of its earlier orders as well as petitions demanding strict enforcement of existing directions.The bench clarified that it had never ordered the removal of all stray dogs from the streets and that its directions were limited to the treatment of stray canines in accordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules.It also flagged widespread non-compliance by civic bodies, noting that people were dying not only due to dog bites but also because of road accidents caused by stray animals.Citing an “alarming rise” in dog bite incidents in institutional areas such as schools, hospitals and railway stations, the Supreme Court on November 7 directed that stray dogs be relocated to designated shelters after due sterilisation and vaccination. It also ordered that dogs picked up should not be released back at the places from where they were removed.The court further directed authorities to ensure the removal of cattle and other stray animals from state highways, national highways and expressways.The Supreme Court is hearing the matter as a suo motu case initiated on July 28 last year following media reports on stray dog attacks leading to rabies, particularly among children, in the national capital.","The Supreme Court is hearing the matter as a suo motu case initiated on July 28 last year following media reports on stray dog attacks leading to rabies, particularly among children.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka's opposition BJP on Tuesday launched a sharp attack on the Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar for allegedly prioritising Rahul Gandhi over German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who landed in Bengaluru for his visit to India.The allegations follow the Congress leaders' presence in Mysuru to receive senior party leader Rahul Gandhi, who was transiting to neighbouring Tamil Nadu.In a post on X, LoP in the state assembly R Ashoka accused the Congress government of ""misplaced priorities and missed opportunities"". He said that welcoming the head of government from one of the world’s strongest economies had been relegated to the back seat, while ""political loyalty and high command pleasing"" were given precedence over Karnataka’s global standing.The LoP wrote, ""Whose interests come first, Karnataka's or the High Command's? Today, the Chancellor of Germany—one of the world's most powerful economic forces—arrived in our Karnataka. Any responsible Chief Minister would welcome such a global leader and leverage this meeting for the state's progress. They would view this encounter with a global leader as a golden opportunity to boost investment, job creation, and industrial development in our state.He further went on to lay charges on the leaders to betray Karnataka. ""This isn't merely a lapse in protocol; it's a betrayal of Karnataka's interests,"" he wrote.Merz, on the second day of his two-day official visit to India, arrived in Bengaluru and visited the Bosch campus at Adugodi.He also visited the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) at the Indian Institute of Science before departing from the city, official sources said.Ashoka further went on to add that the German chancellor’s visit was of ""immense diplomatic, economic and strategic significance"" for Karnataka. ""But while the German chancellor landed in Bengaluru, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar chose to be in Mysuru to receive Rahul Gandhi, who was merely transiting to Ooty (Gudalur in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu).

Deal St: Cognizant inks over $1bn contract with Novartis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-st-cognizant-inks-over-1bn-contract-with-novartis/articleshow/126473146.cms,".

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, sources told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant’s biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades.When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Sources said Cognizant’s EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. “CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability.These deals now typically span seven to ten years and combine transformation, run, cloud, data and AI under a single commercial construct, making the headline value appear larger even though annual spend is often comparable to legacy budgets,” he said. Fersht added that AI-led modernisation has become non-deferrable, as enterprises cannot pause core system renewal, cloud migration, cybersecurity or data platform investments, pushing deal sizes higher as “change plus continuity” are brought together.Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of US-based Everest Group, said Cognizant has been the most aggressive among Indian-based providers in combining a strong vision for AI transformation with very competitive pricing. “This has positioned them to take share in a hyper-competitive market. The vendor consolidation trend, of which the Novartis transaction is a leading example, is ripe for this approach. We are aware of other large transactions where Cognizant is in the lead,” he said.Healthcare contributes around 30% to Cognizant’s revenue. Early in its growth journey, the company rapidly expanded its healthcare footprint, counting nine of the top 10 payers—including United, Anthem, Cigna and Aetna—as customers, along with nearly 30 major pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly.Novartis operates three state-of-the-art centres in India across two cities—Hyderabad, where it has facilities at the Novartis Corporate Center (NOCC) and Genome Valley, and Mumbai. The company employs around 8,500 people in the country.India serves as a key hub in Novartis’s global operations, supporting the development of breakthrough medicines across therapy areas including cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology and global health. The India centres support a wide range of global functions such as global clinical operations, technical R&D, patient safety and pharmacovigilance, regulatory affairs and advanced quantitative sciences, among others.","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis.

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi briefly met Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar at the Mysuru airport on Tuesday, fuelling speculation amid the ongoing power tussle between the two state Congress stalwarts.The interaction took place on the tarmac during Gandhi’s transit halt while returning to Delhi from Tamil Nadu. He spoke to both leaders, separately and together. Gandhi transited through Mysuru twice during the day—while travelling to Tamil Nadu and again on his return—with Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar present on both occasions.While the contents of the discussion are not known, party sources said it centred on the Congress’ “Save MGNREGA” campaign and the Karnataka government’s contribution to push for restoration of the 2006 legislation implemented by the erstwhile Congress-led Union government. The meeting came as both leaders were seeking an appointment with Gandhi.Siddaramaiah is reportedly pressing for a Cabinet reshuffle, while Shivakumar wants clarity on a leadership change. Party insiders believe approval for a reshuffle would indicate Siddaramaiah is set to complete his full term, weakening the prospects of Shivakumar, who also heads the party's state unit.Speculation over a potential leadership change has intensified since the Congress government crossed the halfway mark of its term in November last year, amid reports of an unconfirmed power-sharing arrangement at the time of government formation in May 2023.Siddaramaiah later told reporters there was “no confusion” within the party and said no political discussions took place during his meeting with Gandhi.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi briefly met Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar at the Mysuru airport on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: In a classic case of fence eating the grass, a UP trial court was cast in an adverse light when one of its court clerks, taking advantage of a man's drinking habit, made him sign a sale deed for a portion of his ancestral property and a civil judge gave orders to police to enforce the sale.Allahabad HC found that using the judicial process, the court clerk threw out a woman and her three children from the house using the sale deed signed by her husband in a drunken stupor. HC ordered the court clerk to restore the property to the woman within 48 hours and pay her Rs 1 lakh, and recommended disciplinary proceedings against the clerk and civil judge.Senior advocate H S Phoolka tried his best to project the clerk as an innocent victim of conspiracy before Supreme Court and said the HC had been unusually harsh. However, he failed to evoke sympathy from a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi.The CJI said such an act by a court clerk should have been adequate reason for the district judiciary to send him packing. ""Sometimes, we need to pass such harsh orders when it is found that a conspiracy is hatched within the four walls of the court, where people come for justice,"" the bench said.""We must send the right message. If we do not pass harsh orders in such incidents, it will be difficult for people to repose faith and trust in the judiciary. We see no ground to change a single word in the HC judgment. HC is absolutely right in passing the order,"" it added.Dismissing the court clerk's appeal, SC said, ""In the peculiar circumstances of the case, HC has issued these unusual directions to ensure public faith and trust in the judicial system is maintained. HC directions are befitting the facts of the case. None of the observations and consequential directions require our interference.""The court clerk, a peshkar in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, obtained a sale deed in his favour from the woman's husband dated Feb 14, 2024 for a portion of the undivided residential house, despite knowing full well that the property had not been divided between the brothers and co-sharers of the property. On Jan 13 last year, the woman resisted eviction action initiated through an interim order passed by the trial court. Following this, the court clerk obtained another decree and, with the help of police, evicted her.SC said it was unprecedented for a civil court to pass a decree on the day a suit was filed, and without issuing notice to co-sharers, who were not made parties to the suit.","Allahabad HC found that using the judicial process, the court clerk threw out a woman and her three children from the house using the sale deed signed by her husband in a drunken stupor.

Army modernising force for future warfare: General

NEW DELHI: General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday the Army is ready to induct women in the infantry but that is contingent on societal acceptance.Stressing that women should not be seen as a “vulnerable commodity”, the General, during a media briefing, said the Army's focus is on “gender neutrality”. “If standards are same, if capabilities are same, and in India as a nation, society is ready to accept it, it (combat role) can be done tomorrow,” he said.He said uniform standards are essential, but achieving them remains a challenge due to medical and operational constraints. Gen Dwivedi said performance data of women officers will determine the opening of more roles, starting with supporting arms, followed by combat arms and eventually special forces, calling it a “sequential and welcome social change.”Giving an estimate of the number of women in the Army currently, the Army chief had last year said, “In the NDA as of today, we have 60 women Army cadets and every year, we are looking at (inducting) 20 cadets. Also, in the Officers’ Training Academy (OTA)—Chennai and Gaya—we are looking at 120 per year.” When it comes to inducting women in the other ranks (ORs), it involves a change in Section 12 of the Army Act, he had said.The Army was looking at a 12 times increase in women’s induction in ORs by 2032. “Currently, the total number of women officers is 8,000,” he had said. The Territorial Army opened up for women and 110 vacancies will come up for women, he had added.Taking lessons from conflicts going on around the world, General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday modernisation remains the urgent focus of the Indian Army. Dedicated regiments of drones with enhanced capabilities, rocket cum missile force, loitering munitions, new battalions like Bhairon equipped with modern technologies and advanced weapons and anti-missile defence radar and systems are on the cards.He said over 90% ammunition is now indigenised, underscoring the push towards self-reliance. “After Operation Sindoor , drones got a new thrust,” he said, adding that new drone formations have been raised and each command now has the capability to manufacture up to 5,000 drones depending on operational requirements. This capability can be enhanced to 20,000 or even one lakh drones depending upon the threat perception or conflict, he said.“As of today, we have raised 13 Bhairav battalions, which are meant to bridge the gap between lethal platoons and special forces within infantry battalions,” the Gen said.“Moving on to artillery, we have created a Divyastra battery. It will be part of the artillery regiment and will provide support to a division commander. Again, this involves UAS equipment. For counter-unmanned aircraft system ammunition, we have our powerful regiment, which we are currently raising three units of, and will later raise 12 more. We will then expand this further,” he added.","General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday the Army is ready to induct women in the infantry but that is contingent on societal acceptance.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

NEW DELHI: When its third phase failed on Monday, Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload. However, a football-sized Spanish satellite called KID (Kestrel Initial Demonstrator), survived, though it transmitted “critical data” back to Earth for only about 3 minutes.The 25-kg satellite separated “against all odds” from PSLV's fourth stage despite the third-stage anomaly that caused the mission to fail. The satellite’s developer, Orbital Paradigm, said on X, “Our KID capsule... separated from PSLV C62, switched on, and transmitted data…”KID, designed for re-entry testing towards a splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean, endured peak deceleration forces and thermal stresses that would pulverise most experimental hardware. “We’re reconstructing trajectory. We survived peak heat and peak g-load (~28g recorded). We have internal temps. Full report will come,” the company said.Developed with French partner RIDE, KID validates Orbital Paradigm’s reusable re-entry technology, crucial for future satellite servicing and de-orbiting.The startup plans a detailed report soon and is likely to accelerate Kestrel’s full-scale development programme.Tragedy struck PSLV when an “anomaly” in the third stage diverted the rocket from its flight path, preventing sun-synchronous orbit insertion of its payload.Isro chairman V Narayanan said on Monday, “Near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected.” After his statement, it was assumed that all the 16 satellites, including primary payload EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a hyperspectral earth imaging satellite developed by DRDO for national security and surveillance, were lost.KID turned out to be the only to survive long enough to transmit signals. Orbital Paradigm is yet to confirm if the capsule later burned out or splashed down on Earth.","Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload.

For SC, ST and OBC candidates, the percentile has been reduced from 40 to zero, with the corresponding cut-off score fixed at -40 out of 800 (due to negative marking).The decision was notified by National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), which revised qualifying percentiles across categories to expand eligibility for counselling and admissions. Officials said around 2.4 lakh candidates appeared for NEET-PG this year, but a high cut-off had left thousands of seats unfilled.Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals and strain healthcare delivery, particularly in govt institutions that rely heavily on resident doctors. The relaxation followed a representation by Indian Medical Association (IMA), which had written to Union health minister JP Nadda on Jan 12, seeking a rational revision of cut-offs to prevent large-scale vacancies.Explaining the move, NBEMS officials said the entrance exam is meant to generate a merit list, not to reassess the competence of doctors who have already cleared MBBS and university exams. ""You can't afford to let 9,000-10,000 PG seats go to waste,"" an official said.The official acknowledged that sharp percentile reductions attract criticism but said the admission cycle was already delayed. ""Earlier, cut-offs were lowered in stages. This time, we are late. The focus is to fill seats and avoid losing national medical resources,"" he said.NBEMS clarified that the cut-off change does not alter exam scores or ranks, but only decides who is eligible to participate in counselling. Officials said the percentile system is used to rank already qualified doctors, and the cut-off was lowered simply to ensure enough candidates are available to fill all PG seats.IMA warned that vacant PG seats worsen resident doctor shortages, increase workload, disrupt academics and hurt patient care, especially in government and peripheral hospitals.","Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals.

Love, Anger, Fear, Sympathy: How Indians See Stray Dogs | I Witness

NEW DELHI: As dog lovers and feeders are pressing Supreme Court to roll back its order on making public institutions free of strays, the apex court on Tuesday asked them whether they can take responsibility in case of injury or death caused by stray dog bites and indicated that it will fix heavy compensation for victims.""For every dog bite, death or injury caused to children or elderly, we are going to fix heavy compensation for the victim to be paid by the state for not doing anything. Also, liability and accountability on those who are saying we are feeding dogs. Why should dogs be loitering around, biting, scaring people?...Who should be held accountable when dogs attack a nine-year-old? The organisation that is feeding them? You want us to shut our eyes to the problem?"" the court asked.Hearing the stray dogs issue for the fourth day, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria observed that people are very sympathetic towards stray dogs but not so towards homeless people and orphans as no one comes forward to take care of them. The hearing in the case has so far taken nine hours and still remains inconclusive. Around three dozen activists and lawyers have till now argued in the case.SC said those who are interested in feeding stray dogs should think of adopting them and keep them in their homes.The bench said arguments in court were going on and on, and observed that it has become a public platform for them - animal lovers - rather than for court proceedings. It said that the court wanted to take the Centre, states and municipal bodies to task for failure to implement the law to deal with the problem of strays, but it has not been able to do so because of large number of people turning up to argue the case which is repetitive in nature.""Our request to all the lawyers is to allow us to take to task the Union, state authorities and other bodies on steps taken by them. Allow us to pass an order. We need to spend half a day with the states and the Union. To see whether they have a plan of action or not. The problem has multiplied a thousand times. We just want implementation of statutory provision. Allow us to do that. Allow us to work. Allow us to proceed further. The same things are coming again and again. This has become a public platform rather than a court proceeding,"" the bench said.As some of the lawyers alleged that it would cost around Rs 26,000 crore to remove all strays from institutions and keep them in shelter homes, and urged the court that the amount could be better used for homeless people, SC said that why people, who are so sympathetic to animals, do not reach out to homeless people and support them.""A young counsel just showed us statistics of orphans on the streets. Perhaps some lawyers could argue for adoption of those children. Since 2011, since I was elevated to SC, these are the longest arguments I have heard. And, till now no one has argued so long for human beings,"" Justice Mehta observed.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, Vikas Singh, Pinky Anand, Menaka Guruswamy, Percival Billimoria along with others argued the case. The hearing will resume on Thursday.","Supreme Court says it will fix heavy compensation for victims of stray dog bites.

Pakistan sent Sindoor SOS after seeing Indian forces’ movement; 8 terror camps still active along Pakistan-side of border: Army chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-sent-sindoor-sos-after-seeing-indian-forces-movement-8-terror-camps-still-active-along-pakistan-side-of-border-army-chief/articleshow/126513131.cms,"Operation Sindoor Turning Points Revealed: Army Chief Tells What Forced Pakistan To Seek Ceasefire

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Tuesday said the moves made by Army, Air Force and Navy on the morning of May 10 following the govt’s directive to prepare for a possible escalation of Operation Sindoor , acted as the decisive signal for Pakistan to seek suspension of the conflict. He also said that eight terrorist camps are currently active along the Pakistani side of the LoC and international border.The three-day conflict was triggered after India on May 7 last year targeted terror camps deep inside Pakistan and POK in retaliation against the jihadi terror attack at J&K’s Pahalgam in April. “The first (turning point) was the 22-minute strike on terrorist targets,” he said. The strike on terrorist targets “derailed the opposite side’s decision-making, and they took time to take that all in,” Gen Dwivedi said. “Due to this, there was confusion among them, and that led to mismanaged responses, which were met with our calibrated response,” he said.“The second turning point was that on the morning of May 10, the tri-forces of India were given certain directions about what to do if this war had escalated. They (Pakistan) had understood it, and hence, they called our DGMO,” General Dwivedi said in what marked the first formal confirmation of the govt’s decision to prepare for a full-scale conflict.“They (Pakistan) had complete information about which (Indian) ship, which strike or pivot, which core unit, or which aircraft was moving where, all from satellites. When they connected these dots, they said that the time has come to stop this war,” Dwivedi said. The General’s observations also marked yet another repudiation of US President Donald Trump’s incessant claims about having brokered the pause in the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.He also spoke about the nuclear sabre-rattling by Pakistani politicians during the eventful four days (May 7-May 10). “As far as nuclear rhetoric is concerned, I would like to clarify that there was no discussion on the nuclear issue in the (India-Pakistan) DGMO talks. Whatever nuclear rhetoric was given by politicians or the public in Pakistan. I have no indication that anything of that sort came from the military,” he said.Emphasising that Operation Sindoor was “the best example of the tri-services’s synergy under clear-cut political directive and full freedom to act or respond”, Gen Dwivedi said, “The Army successfully destroyed seven out of the nine targets, and thereafter, played a pivotal role in ensuring a calibrated response to Pakistan’s actions.” He further said 100 “people associated with Pakistan” were killed in the firing along the Line of Control (LoC) or International Border (IB) during Operation Sindoor.On the current situation of terror hubs, the Army chief said, “There are six terror camps along the LoC and two along the IB. As per our knowledge, there is a presence of 100-150 terrorists there. If we spot any (mischievous) activities, we will definitely deal with it.”On sightings of multiple suspected Pakistani drones along the LoC and IB on Jan 10 and 11, the General said that India has conveyed a clear warning to Pakistan, saying New Delhi has told Islamabad that such activity is “not acceptable”.About violence in J&K, Dwivedi said 65% of the total terrorists eliminated in the UT last year were Pakistanis. He said 31 terrorists in total were eliminated by the armed forces in 2025 under Operation Mahadev, of whom three were the perpetrators of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack . “Active local terrorists are now in single digits. Terrorist recruitment is almost non-existent, with only two in 2025,” he said. Mentioning “clear indicators of positive change in J&K”, the Army chief cited examples of robust development activity, the revival of tourism and the peaceful Amarnath Yatra, which saw over 4 lakh pilgrims, exceeding the five-year average.","Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Tuesday said the moves made by Army, Air Force and Navy on the morning of May 10 acted as the decisive signal for Pakistan to seek suspension of the conflict.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Tuesday told Supreme Court that scrutiny of citizenship during SIR of voter lists was only meant to ensure deletion of non-citizens from electoral rolls and did not extend to termination of citizenship or deportation. EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that Article 326 of the Constitution mandated that only Indian citizens were entitled to be included in the electoral rolls.For this purpose and this alone, EC was entitled to inquire and conclude whether a person was an Indian citizen, entitling him to be a voter. ""If a person is found not to be a citizen of India by EC, then his name will either not be included in the voter list or, if it is there, then it would be struck off,"" he said.Dwivedi said no person with a shadow of doubt over citizenship could be included in the voter list. However, such a determination by the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) would not automatically result in a declaration that s/he was not a citizen of India - which was the domain of the competent authorities. ""The ERO's conclusion about a voter's citizenship being doubtful and the resultant removal of his name from the voter list can be set aside by a court of law only if it finds that the procedure adopted for such determination was perverse and illegal,"" he said.""Under the SIR exercise, the citizenship of an individual for the purposes of Citizenship Act, 1955, will not terminate on account of the fact that he/she is held to be ineligible for registration in the electoral rolls,"" EC said.Since the documents that could be used to establish citizenship were within a person knowledge, the burden of proof lay with the individual, it said.Dwivedi said when doubts arose about an elected representative's citizenship, the President or the governor was constitutionally bound by EC's opinion on whether the MP or MLA had incurred disqualification over being a non-citizen. This meant EC had the power to inquire into citizenship of MPs or MLAs if doubts arose, he said.Arguments in the matter will resume Thursday.","Election Commission told Supreme Court scrutiny of citizenship only meant to ensure deletion of non-citizens from electoral rolls.

NEW DELHI: To check the trend of highway contractors and consultants quickly getting a court stay on debarment and blacklisting orders issued by authorities for defaults, the government is working on a two-pronged strategy: studying the pattern through which such legal relief is secured and largely eliminating the scope of debarment, which can be challenged in courts.The road transport ministry has proposed changes in the contract conditions under which a contractor will be ineligible to bid for national highway (NH) projects after a recorded “major or catastrophic failure” in any ongoing project for two years. This would make it difficult for errant contractors to legally challenge such restrictions.TOI has learnt that the issue of contractors and consultants getting quick relief from courts was flagged at a high-level meeting held recently to review the highway sector. Highway agencies have debarred or suspended over 60 contractors and consultancy firms in the past two years and have imposed penalties of over Rs 307 crore.“It was felt that a detailed assessment should be carried out to detect if there is any pattern behind contractors and consultants getting immediate relief,” said an official.On the introduction of ""major or catastrophic incident"" conditions in contracts, another official said that these will include collapse of bridge, viaduct, elevated stretch and reinforced wall, and severe road damage.“Once you ban a contractor or consultant, they can approach a court for relief. It also impacts their business as they don’t get any work across departments and states. So, our eligibility condition linked to major incidents will impact contractors in getting NH projects and such players will have hardly any scope to challenge it,"" said an official.He added that since debarments hit companies hard, jeopardising their business, contractors and consultants try to get relief one way or the other.",The road transport ministry has proposed changes in the contract conditions under which a contractor will be ineligible to bid for national highway projects.

While the party sought judicial intervention to restrain the agency from ""prejudice, misuse and dissemination"" of seized data during the search operations, the ED alleged interference in its investigation, and prayed for transferring the probe into January 8 developments to the CBI.The ED has made Banerjee a respondent in its petition, along with some officers of the state.

"Delhi govt to implement Carbon Credit Monetisation Framework, earn from green projects",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-govt-to-implement-carbon-credit-monetisation-framework-earn-from-green-projects/articleshow/126510693.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, the Delhi government gave a nod to implement the 'Carbon Credit Monetisation Framework' in the national capital, following in the footsteps of Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Indore city.The Department of Environment, Forests and Wildlife said in a statement that Delhi's ongoing initiatives such as the electric vehicle rollout, urban forestry, Yamuna restoration, solar energy adoption and waste-to-energy plants would generate tradable carbon credits, creating new funding for environmental protection without any financial burden on the government.It further said work was underway to convert the city's existing green projects into revenue-generating assets for pollution control and sustainability, subject to Cabinet approval.It added that for every one metric tonne of carbon dioxide reduced through Delhi's climate initiatives, one carbon credit would be generated, which could be sold in carbon markets in India and abroad.The no-financial-liability model would help existing green efforts across departments, including transport, power, forests, Delhi Jal Board, and urban development, according to the statement.Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the implementation of the Carbon Credit Monetisation Framework will provide the government with an additional source of revenue, thereby accelerating development works.Gupta further said this will not only promote environmental conservation, but the revenue generated will also be deposited into the Consolidated Fund of the State and utilised for public welfare schemes.According to her, the initiative will enhance the efficiency of various departments and provide citizens with the benefits of a cleaner and healthier environment.The chief minister said that through this initiative, the Delhi government is not only leading India's commitments against climate change, but is also opening new financial pathways for sustainable development, and that Delhi will emerge as the country's leading state to harness the benefits of the carbon market.The scheme will cover various initiatives being implemented by different departments, with the environment department acting as the nodal department for the entire process, officials said.At present, the Delhi government is operating electric buses, undertaking large-scale plantation drives, promoting solar energy and implementing waste management initiatives, all of which contribute to reducing carbon emissions.Under the new policy, the reduction in pollution achieved through these initiatives will be scientifically measured and registered as carbon credits.These carbon credits can then be sold in national and international carbon markets, enabling the Delhi government to earn revenue.According to the Department of Environment, the most significant feature of the scheme is its financial model.Through a transparent tender or request for proposal process, the department will select a specialised agency, which will identify schemes that can generate carbon credits. It will also undertake documentation and registration in accordance with international standards, officials said.The entire process will be based on a revenue-sharing model, meaning the government will not have to incur any expenditure.A portion of the revenue generated will go to the agency, while the larger share will accrue to the government exchequer, they said.All revenue generated through the framework will be deposited directly into the Consolidated Fund of the state and reflected in the financial accounts of the Delhi government.The funds can be utilised to further strengthen development initiatives and environmental improvement efforts.""These efforts will help unlock economic value from pollution reduction while also supporting environmental goals,"" Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said.He further added that this framework allows us to quantify these achievements, certify them under global standards like VERRA, Gold Standard, and the Indian Carbon Market, and monetise them transparently. The revenue will fuel further pollution control and climate mitigation, making Delhi a model for urban sustainability.Explaining the core objectives of the framework, the ministry said it aims to create a structured system to identify, verify and register emission-reduction projects across sectors.It added that developing a strong 'Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV)' mechanism would ensure accurate data, transparency and international auditability.The ministry said other objectives include enabling smooth issuance and trading of carbon credits through approved platforms, strengthening departmental capacity for long-term participation in carbon markets, and positioning Delhi as a leader in climate finance aligned with national goals.The statement said expert agencies would be engaged on a success-fee basis, meaning payments would be made only after revenue is earned, ensuring zero upfront cost to the government. Up to three agencies will be empanelled to ensure scalability and wider participation.It added that the process of engaging these agencies would begin shortly and would cover project assessment, documentation, validation, registration, issuance of credits, trading strategies and capacity building.Revenue generated would be used through a dedicated mechanism for pollution control, climate adaptation and environmental management.If utilised effectively, Delhi's carbon credit potential could run into hundreds of crores, creating a steady funding source for environmental protection, the statement claimed.

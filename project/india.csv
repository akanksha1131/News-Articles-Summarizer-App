Among the late-night arrivals is Manish Kumar, 45, who has just got off the LTT Rajgir Express from Mumbai. He strikes a deal with an auto driver to travel home, around 40km across the Ganges. ""Bihar has changed. It is no longer the old Bihar,"" he says smiling.Two decades ago, such a scene would have been unthinkable. Once darkness fell, Patna Junction became a place of fear. Travellers locked themselves in waiting rooms or lay sleepless on station floors rather than risk stepping outside into the so-called ""jungle raj"".For nearly 30 years, Bihar's politics has been haunted by that phrase. Coined during the 1990-2005 tenure of Lalu Prasad and wife Rabri Devi, ""jungle raj"" became a shorthand for kidnappings, extortion and the breakdown of law and order. The opposition wielded the phrase relentlessly - a warning of chaos that might return if RJD regained power.Now, as Bihar moves towards its election, ""jungle raj"" is again echoing in speeches - though with diminished force. On Oct 23, PM Modi revived the phrase, saying ""people will not forget jungle raj in Bihar for another 100 years..."" The comments coincided with RJD mascot Tejashwi Prasad's formal declaration as Grand Alliance's CM candidate.The two-phase polling - a first in decades - has itself become a talking point. Union home minister Amit Shah recently argued that the shorter schedule, compared with the six phases held in earlier years, was proof that law and order had improved.But this time, the old narrative may no longer strike fear - especially among 1.6 crore voters between 18 and 29 years who never lived through the years of ""jungle raj"". ""After governing Bihar for 20 years, JDU and BJP are still contesting on the jungle raj narrative. It shows they don't have much work to speak about. Yes, law and order have improved, but crimes still happen every day,"" said Mohammad Jilani, 28, an auto driver at Patna airport.""If NDA keeps talking about jungle raj, it will sound like they are looking backward rather than forward,"" said Anurag Kumar, a first-time voter from Patna. Tanvir Aeijaz, associate professor at Ramjas College, said the ""politics of fear"" is waning as memories fade and aspirations rise.","""Jungle raj"" became shorthand for kidnappings, extortion and breakdown of law and order.

Tejashwi Yadav Named INDIA Bloc’s CM Face; Watch Key Highlights from Mahagathbandhan Presser

NEW DELHI: Tej Pratap Yadav on Friday ruled out any possibility of returning to the Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ), saying he would “choose death over returning to that party.” The elder son of the former CMs Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi said he was guided by “principles and self-respect,” not political power.In an interview with PTI, Tej Pratap - who was expelled from the RJD by his father earlier this year - said, “I am not hungry for power. Principles and self-respect are supreme for me.”Having launched his own political outfit, the Janshakti Janta Dal (JJD), Tej Pratap is contesting from Mahua, the seat from where he made his electoral debut in 2015. “I have been attached to this constituency since much before I entered politics,” he said, adding that residents often tell him they were happy with his work as MLA.Tej Pratap dismissed the challenge from sitting RJD MLA Mukesh Raushan, a close aide of his younger brother Tejashwi Yadav , and said, “People tell me they have nobody to turn to for help now.”The former minister filed his nomination papers carrying a photograph of his late grandmother Marichiya Devi. “Of course, she was the one with whose blessings my father rose in politics,” he said. Asked if he had sought his parents’ blessings, he added, “We have not talked for some time.But I know their blessings are with me.”On Tejashwi, who has been declared the INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, Tej Pratap said, “It is politicians' trait to make announcements of various kinds. But power is enjoyed only by one who gets the people's blessings.”He also remarked, “Of course, as a younger brother he used to have my blessings. I could not have unleashed the Sudarshan Chakra on him.”The JJD] chief maintained his opposition to the BJP-RSS, saying, “People are not going to be deceived by the nefarious designs of the BJP-RSS combine anymore.”Asked how this election differs for him now that he is not with the RJD, Tej Pratap replied, “Nothing is different. People of Mahua are my family. I am contesting elections under my own party, the symbol of which is blackboard.”Pointing to an elderly companion during the interview, he said, “Somebody who has seen Mahatma Gandhi with his own eyes is travelling with me. What else do I need?”On Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor, Yadav said, “He is at best a trader. He does campaign work for parties by assembling resources.

NEW DELHI: Flagging the increasing threat posed by ‘deep fakes’ and synthetically generated content capable of manipulating the electoral processes, the Election Commission on Friday directed all such content to be clearly marked with the labels ‘AI-generated’, ‘digitally enhanced’ or ‘synthetic content’, covering a minimum 10% of the display area or audio clip, and also identify the entity responsible for its generation.In an advisory issued to the heads of all recognised political parties, the poll panel restricted the publishing or forwarding of any content that is unlawful or misrepresents the identity, appearance or voice of any person without his consent “in a manner reasonably likely to mislead or deceive the electorate”. If any such hyper-realistic, synthetically-generated or AI-altered image, audio, video, misinformation or manipulated content is detected on official party handles, “it shall be taken down within three hours of being noticed or reported,” it ordered.While directing that the label ‘AI generated’, ‘digitally enhanced’ or ‘sythetic content’ shall be carried on top hand of the screen, EC asked such content to also prominently disclose the name of the entity responsible for its generation, in the metadata or accompanying caption.The commission also asked the political parties to maintain internal records of all Al-generated campaign materials, including creator details and timestamps, for verification when sought by the ECI.These directions — issued in continuation of the EC advisories dated May 6, 2024 and January 16, 2025 — come into immediate effect and shall henceforth be applicable during all general and bye-elections, EC said while reminding all the parties of their responsibility to ensure compliance with the IT Rules, 2021 and all its advisories.EC drew attention to AI-generated and hyper-realistic synthetically generated content depicting political leaders making electorally sensitive messages, saying that it was disrupting fair and equal conditions for all political participants, “which is a sine qua non for preserving the integrity of the political campaigning during elections”.Describing such campaigns as a deep threat and challenge because of their ability to masquerade as the truth and unwittingly trap political stakeholders into incorrect conclusions, EC said it finds it imperative to ensure that transparency and accountability is maintained to preserve electoral integrity and voter trust.Earlier in May 2024 and January 2025, EC had issued guidelines regarding responsible and ethical use of social media platforms and specifically addressing concerns around labelling of synthetic and Al generated content used for election campaigning.","The Election Commission on Friday directed all such content to be clearly marked with the labels ‘AI-generated’, ‘digitally enhanced’ or ‘synthetic content’ The labels must cover a minimum 10% of the display area or audio clip, and also identify the entity responsible for its generation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124798335,imgsize-790046,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case





BENGALURU: Bengaluru Rural police have arrested three youths in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a 27-year-old woman near Nelamangala Tuesday night. The survivor, originally from West Bengal, works as a beautician for weddings and other functions and lives with her husband and two sons. Another woman from her hometown and a man from Assam, a friend of her husband, also reside in the adjacent rented house. Her husband was at work when the incident occurred, according to sources.As per the survivor's complaint, five men barged into the house, claiming to be local police, around 9:30pm on Oct 21. ""They accused us of possessing ganja and being involved in a flesh trade, and demanded Rs 1 lakh. They then attacked me and another woman with a cricket bat and a machete. My friend nearly lost consciousness, but I managed to resist. They gagged my younger son and my husband's friend, locking them in the toilet. Three of them dragged me to a room in the adjacent house and raped me. They also robbed Rs 25,000 and two mobile phones,"" the survivor stated in her complaint.Her elder son, who was outside at the time, contacted the police control room. A patrolling Hoysala police vehicle soon arrived at the scene, but the suspects had fled the scene by then.The survivor, who was immediately shifted to a nearby hospital, filed her complaint from her hospital bed. Madanayakanahalli police registered a case of gang-rape under Section 70 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and launched a manhunt and in less than two days, cops detained a few suspects, including juveniles, for questioning.""By Wednesday night we arrested the accused – Naveen, Kartik, and Glani – and Thursday afternoon, three more suspects—Suyog, Jangli Prithvi, and Seena—were taken into custody. We are still searching for the prime suspect—Mithun, who orchestrated the attack and involved others,"" a senior from Bengaluru Rural police officer said.Preliminary investigations revealed that Mithun, a local resident, had disputes with the survivor. ""The family has been living here for six months. Mithun and the survivor had frequent arguments, and he had threatened to teach her a lesson. That is why he brought his associates, posing as police, to carry out the attack,"" the officer added.Police said while three men allegedly raped the woman, two accused have stated they only beat her and stole cash and phones. Both the survivor and the accused have undergone medical examinations, and the reports are expected to provide further clarity on the incident.",West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case.

""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

CNBC

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Even AI roles can face cuts

Research roles are being redefined

Adaptability matters more than titles

Understanding resources is part of the job

Career stability comes from flexibility

The takeaway

When Meta announced that around 600 employees from its artificial intelligence division would be leaving, it drew attention across the tech world, reports. The cuts affected teams within Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) and Meta Superintelligence Labs, two groups that sit at the center of Meta’s AI efforts.The decision came as part of a larger restructuring plan to make the company’s AI operations more efficient and faster to execute. Meta said it wanted to reduce layers of management and remove decision-making delays. At the same time, it plans to continue investing heavily in AI infrastructure and hiring new specialists in the field.For many in the technology sector, this move is a reminder that even in areas that appear secure, change can come quickly. The layoffs reflect how large companies are rethinking their approach to AI: fewer research-heavy roles, more focus on applied innovation, and a stronger link between research and product outcomes.Here are some lessons from Meta’s restructuring that can help current and future tech workers prepare for a shifting industry.Artificial intelligence is seen as one of the most promising fields in technology, but the Meta case shows that growth alone does not guarantee stability.The company continues to spend heavily on AI, yet it reduced positions that did not align directly with its immediate goals.For professionals, this is a sign that it is not enough to simply work in a trending area. It is important to stay relevant within that space. Learning how to apply AI skills to real-world problems, understanding how your work connects to products or business goals, and keeping pace with new tools can help maintain your edge.The changes within FAIR highlight a shift in how companies value research. Many organizations want their research teams to be more closely connected to products and to contribute to measurable outcomes. Long research timelines without clear applications are becoming harder to sustain.For students, PhD graduates, or early-career professionals interested in research, this means thinking more broadly about impact. It helps to link your research goals to how they can be used in practice, explain your work in simple terms, and remain open to collaboration with non-research teams.Mark Zuckerberg said Meta wants a structure that moves faster and works with fewer layers. This direction values flexibility and problem-solving over position or tenure.In many large companies, being adaptable can now be more valuable than seniority. Workers who can learn quickly, adjust to new priorities, and cooperate across departments are often the ones who continue to grow, even during organizational changes. Technical knowledge is essential, but the ability to adjust and work well with others is equally important.Meta’s restructuring was also driven by competition for limited computing power among its AI teams. Decisions on which projects to fund or scale often came down to available resources and strategic focus.This shows why tech professionals should understand more than just their technical work. Knowing how budgets, data access, or computing capacity influence a project can make it easier to adapt and to communicate your work’s value to decision-makers. The broader your understanding of how technology and business align, the stronger your position becomes.The people affected by Meta’s layoffs were skilled and experienced, but even they were not shielded from change. However, many of them will find new opportunities because their skills can transfer easily across companies and sectors.For today’s workers, the main takeaway is to build careers that can move with the industry. Strengthen your core skills, keep learning, and maintain professional networks. Instead of relying on one employer or project, focus on how your skills can create value in different settings. Flexibility has become a key part of long-term career stability.Meta’s layoffs are more than a company update. They reflect how technology work is evolving and how priorities in the AI field are shifting. The message for professionals is clear: keep learning, stay adaptable, and connect your work to real outcomes. As the industry changes, those who continue to grow with it will find the most opportunities.",Meta announced that around 600 employees from its artificial intelligence division would be leaving. The cuts affected teams within Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) and Meta Superintelligence Labs. The decision came as part of a larger restructuring plan to make the company’s AI operations more efficient and faster to execute.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124777463,imgsize-949450,width-400,resizemode-4/meta-ai.jpg"

Karoline Leavitt Calls Indian Trucker Illegal Alien After Deadly California Road Accident Kill Three

Gurdaspur: The family of trucker Jashanpreet Singh, who smashed into multiple vehicles , allegedly under the influence of drugs, and killed at least three people in California, is numb with shock and disbelief.""He was an 'Amritdhari (baptized Sikh)' who never took drugs or alcohol. He was disciplined and god-fearing. It must have been an unfortunate accident, not negligence,"" said his maternal uncle, Gurbaksh Singh, in Purana Shala village of Punjab's Gurdaspur district. They are praying for the victims who lost their lives, he said, while also appealing for mercy for Jashanpreet. ""Save my son,"" his mother Jasveer Kaur pleaded with everyone she saw at her doorstep. The atmosphere in the small house was heavy with grief Friday as news broke of Jashanpreet's arrest and the video of his truck barrelling into California traffic went viral.The 22-year-old took the 'dunki route' to the US but only to support his family back home, said relatives.Jashanpreet's father Kulwinder Singh, who works as a school bus driver, can barely speak as relatives and villagers visit to console the family.""Please help our boy. He went abroad only to build our future, not harm anyone,"" his mother said, in barely a whisper. Gurbaksh said the family's modest home was built through loans. Kulwinder spent nearly Rs 40 lakh, much of which he borrowed, to send Jashanpreet abroad - though illegally.""He wanted to work hard, repay the debt, and start a small business,"" said Gurbaksh, adding, as a baptized Sikh, Jashanpreet never touched drugs or alcohol. Farmer leader and social activist Ranjit Singh, who visited the family, urged both Centre and Punjab govt to take up the matter with US authorities.","Jashanpreet Singh, 22, allegedly under the influence of drugs, killed at least three people in California.

Hyderabad: A journey at the end of a joyful festive weekend turned into a nightmare for passengers aboard the private bus travelling from Hyderabad to Bengaluru. In an instant, the vehicle was engulfed in flames and thick smoke, jolting them awake to a scene of sheer horror.Panic erupted as people scrambled to escape, using whatever they could - mobile phones, laptops, even elbows and knees - to break windows and jump out.For many, the ordeal unfolded in mere seconds but felt like an eternity. Nelakurthi Ramesh, 36, was on his way back to Bengaluru with wife Sri Lakshmi and their two children after visiting relatives over the weekend.Recounting the terrifying moments, he said: ""When I woke up, all I could see was flames - bright yellow and orange. I could barely breathe. My first thought was my wife and children; I knew I had to get them out safely. With my bare fists, I smashed the rear window and pushed my family out of the burning bus. Others followed us, and we ran as far as we could. The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital.""Ghantasala Subramanyam, 26, a resident of Bahadurpally, was awakened by a fellow passenger's urgent shake.

‘US Controlled Pak Nuclear Arsenal’: Ex-CIA Agent’s Bombshell, Says ‘Pak Can’t Win Against India’

'US expected India to strike back after 2002, 2008 terror attacks'



Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has revealed that the United States provided millions of dollars to Pakistan under former President Pervez Musharraf , in effect “purchasing” his cooperation.He also claimed that Musharraf handed over control of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal to the US. ""When I was stationed in Pakistan in 2002, I was told unofficially that the Pentagon controlled the Pakistani nuclear arsenal, that Musharraf had turned control over to the United States because he was afraid of exactly what you just described (nuclear weapons falling into terrorist hands),"" Kiriakou told news agency ANI.Kiriakou also revealed that the US refrained from targeting Abdul Qadeer Khan, the architect of Pakistan's atomic bomb, after “direct intervention” by the Saudi government.""A colleague of mine was dealing with A Q Khan,"" Kiriakou said, as quoted by the ANI. ""If we had taken the Israeli approach, we would have just killed him. He was easy enough to find. We knew where he lived. We knew how he spent his day. But he also had the support of the Saudi government. And the Saudis came to us and said, 'Please leave him alone. Please. We like A Q Khan. We're working with A.Q. Khan. We're close to the Pakistanis...They named Faisalabad after King Faisal. Just leave him alone.""Kiriakou called this diplomatic pressure a major US policy failure, describing it as a ""mistake"" by Washington. ""This was a mistake that the US government made, not confronting A Q Khan head-on,"" he said.Khan was born in Bhopal in 1936, moved to Pakistan with his family in 1952 after Partition, and died in Islamabad in 2021 at the age of 85.Kiriakou said the US had expected India to retaliate after the 2001 Parliament attack and 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, but it did not. ""At the CIA we called the Indian policy strategic patience. The Indian government would have been perfectly within its rights to respond by striking Pakistan and they didn't. And I remember at the White House people were saying, wow, the Indians are really exhibiting a very mature foreign policy here. We expected the Indians to, to strike back and they didn't. And that kept the world from what might have been a nuclear exchange. Right? But India's gotten to the point where they can't risk strategic patience being misunderstood as weakness. And so they had to respond,"" he said.He added that Musharraf allowed the US to operate freely. ""Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. It was General Pervez Musharraf at the time. And look, let's be honest here. The United States loves working with dictators. Because then you don't have to worry about public opinion and you don't have to worry about the media anymore. And so we essentially just purchased Musharraf.""Kiriakou said Musharraf allowed the US to operate freely. ""We gave millions and millions and millions of dollars in aid, whether it was military aid or economic development aid. And we would meet with Musharraf regularly, several times a week. And essentially he would let us do whatever we wanted to do. Yes. But Musharraf also had his own people that he needed to deal with,"" he said.He added that Musharraf maintained the support of the military while pretending to cooperate with the US on counterterrorism, but continued activities against India. ""He had to keep the military happy. And the military didn't care about Al-Qaeda. They cared about India. And so in order to keep the military happy and keep some of the extremists happy, he had to allow them to continue this dual life of pretending to cooperate with the Americans on counterterrorism while committing terror against India,"" Kiriakou said.","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has revealed that the United States provided millions of dollars to Pakistan under former President Pervez Musharraf.

Bengaluru Doctor Arrested For Allegedly Killing Wife With Anesthesia Overdose Months After Wedding

MUMBAI: A 24-year-old Parel resident repeatedly stabbed his ex-girlfriend with a knife in the middle of a road in full public view, chased her into a nursing home 50m away, and kept stabbing her there till she collapsed near Chinchpokli in central Mumbai on Friday morning.

Within seconds, Barai pulled out a kitchen knife and began stabbing Yadav on the road, an eyewitness told TOI.""I was walking right behind them.

'

'Pakistan committed terrorism in India — and nobody stopped it'

'Pentagon once controlled Pakistan’s nukes'

'US-Saudi ties are transactional — oil for weapons'

NEW DELHI: Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has said that Pakistan ""cannot win a conventional war against India"" and needs to realise that nothing good will come out of fighting with India.In an interview with ANI, Kiriakou, who served 15 years in the CIA, including as chief of counterterrorism operations in Pakistan said, ""Nothing, literally nothing good will come of an actual war between India and Pakistan because the Pakistanis will lose. It’s as simple as that. They’ll lose. And I’m not talking about nuclear weapons, I’m talking just about a conventional war.""He added that Islamabad must ""come to a policy conclusion"" that provoking India only hurts its own interests.India has repeatedly maintained that it will not tolerate Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail and will respond firmly to any act of terrorism. Over the years, New Delhi has demonstrated this stance through decisive military actions — from the surgical strikes on terror launchpads across the LoC in 2016, to the Balakot airstrikes in 2019, and most recently, Operation Sindoor in May this year.Kiriakou claimed that during his tenure, the US pumped ""millions and millions of dollars"" into Pakistan under then-President Pervez Musharraf, effectively ""buying"" his cooperation.""Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. It was General Pervez Musharraf at the time. And look, let's be honest here. The United States loves working with dictators.

And so in order to keep the military happy and keep some of the extremists happy, he had to allow them to continue this dual life of pretending to cooperate with the Americans on counterterrorism while committing terror against India,"" he revealed.Kiriakou alleged that Washington effectively ""bought"" Pakistan’s intelligence and military establishment with cash.""The US threw millions of dollars at Pakistan under Musharraf. We paid tens of millions in cash to Pakistan’s ISI"" he said, adding that corruption ran deep in the country while ""leaders like Benazir Bhutto lived lavishly abroad as common people starved.""Kiriakou said Pakistan’s support for terrorism against India was an ""open secret"" even during the 2001 Parliament attack and 2008 Mumbai attacks.Reflecting on the 2008 Mumbai attacks, he said, ""I don't think this is Al-Qaeda. I think this is the Pakistani-supported Kashmiri groups. That turned out to be exactly the case. The bigger story was that Pakistan was committing terrorism in India and nobody did anything about it.""Recounting his time in Pakistan in 2002, Kiriakou said he was told unofficially that the Pentagon had control over Islamabad’s nuclear arsenal at the time. ""Musharraf had turned control over to the United States. But over the last 23 years, Pakistan has insisted that’s not true — that their generals control the nukes,"" he said.However, he expressed concern about who truly holds power in Pakistan today, saying that political instability and the military’s influence make the country ""dangerously unpredictable.""Kiriakou on the US-Saudi relationship bluntly said that, ""Our foreign policy in Saudi Arabia really is as simple as we buy their oil and they buy our weapons. That's it."" According to him, ""almost the entire Saudi military is Pakistanis. It's the Pakistanis that protect Saudi Arabia on the ground.""Reflecting on global shifts, Kiriakou also noted that, ""We’re sitting on an ocean of oil. We don’t need the Saudis anymore. They’re hedging their bets, improving ties with China and India. The world is transforming before our eyes.""Kiriakou, who famously blew the whistle on the CIA’s torture program in 2007, said he spent 23 months in prison but remains unapologetic.

SRINAGAR: BJP sprang a surprise on National Conference Friday in J&K's first Rajya Sabha election since the abrogation of Article 370 , clinching one of the four seats at stake with 32 votes – four more than its current strength of 28 in the assembly.BJP candidate Sat Sharma's victory came amid allegations of cross-voting by the governing party, which had secured ally Congress's backing and the opposition PDP's conditional support for the election. Supporters of BJP and NC were briefly locked in a confrontation outside the assembly after the results were declared.While NC's victorious trio – Choudhary Mohammad Ramzan, Sajad Ahmad Kichloo and Shammi Oberoi – were expected to win the election at a canter, Sharma's triumph led People's Conference legislator Sajad Lone to label it a ""fixed match"". Lone abstained from voting.""Why did NC poll extra votes for candidate 3? They didn't need to. They polled 31 votes for candidate 3 when 29 would have sufficed. Even 28.

And who was hand-in-glove?"" he said.Sharma, who heads the J&K unit of BJP, thanked all legislators who supported him.

""All of NC's votes were intact across the four elections, as endorsed by our election agent after seeing each polling slip. So, where did the extra votes of BJP come from?

Wrong. WHO has denied ever making such a recommendation and cautions against using a metric used to facilitate inter-country comparison as a benchmark for health human resource planning at the national level.The head of WHO's hea-lth workforce unit, Dr Giorgio Cometto, told TOI: ""WHO does not have a blanket recommendation of 1 doctor/1,000 population. This is a factoid that is not backed up by any WHO document or reference, but unfortunately, it is quoted quite often.""Govts have used the 1:1000 doctor-population ratio to calculate doctor shortage and to push for increasing MBBS seats in existing medical colleges and opening new colleges, even if many of these are poorly equipped.Cometto pointed out that every country ought to consider its unique epidemiology, demography, finances and health system setup in planning for the workforce it will need to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Other public health experts, too, have said the same thing while pointing to the extreme skew in distribution of doctors among states and between rural and urban areas, none of which are being addressed by blanket expansion of medical colleges.WHO uses a threshold of 4.45 doctors, nurses and midwives per 1,000 population, based on the minimum density of health workers generally associated with attaining a median level of coverage of essential SDG services. But this does not reflect the heterogeneity of countries in terms of baseline conditions and health system needs, said Cometto.Medical historian Dr Kiran Kumbhar, who had published an essay on his quest to track the root of this ""invented figure"", found that the earliest official reference was in Medical Council of India's ""Vision 2015"" report in March 2011. It doesn't cite WHO, merely says ""after detailed inputs from various working groups"", there was consensus that ""targeted doctor-population ratio would be 1:1000"".According to Kumbhar, it is the 14-member High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage for India that called 1:1000 a ""WHO norm"" in its report released in Oct 2011. it is citing data from a WHO report, which in turn is citing data from a 2004 report put together by a group of global health experts. The 2004 report observed that countries with fewer than 2.5 healthcare professionals per 1,000 population failed to achieve 80% coverage rate for deliveries by skilled birth attendants or for measles immunisation.","WHO has denied ever making such a recommendation and cautions against using a metric used to facilitate inter-country comparison as a benchmark for health human resource planning.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case

NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old woman doctor working at a government hospital in Maharashtra ’s Satara district has died by suicide, accusing a police sub-inspector of rape and a software engineer of mental harassment.The case has sparked outrage across the state, with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ordering an immediate suspension of the officer named in her note and a thorough investigation.The doctor, who hailed from Beed district and was posted in Phaltan tehsil, was found hanging in a hotel room in Phaltan late on Thursday night. In a message written on her palm, she alleged that police sub-inspector Gopal Badane had raped her multiple times, while another man, Prashant Bankar, had mentally harassed her over several months.Police officials told PTI that the woman had called Bankar, who works as a software engineer in Pune, shortly before taking her life, and that the two had exchanged text messages. Investigators added that she lived as a tenant in a flat owned by Bankar’s father.Satara Superintendent of Police Tushar Doshi confirmed that a case of rape and abetment to suicide had been registered against Badane and Bankar. “The doctor’s body has been sent for post-mortem.We are also investigating the allegations mentioned in the suicide note on the victim's palm,” he said.Following the development, Badane was suspended from service. “The accused PSI has been suspended from duty with immediate effect. Police have launched an investigation into the case,” SP Doshi said.A relative of the doctor claimed that she had been under pressure from police and political figures to alter post-mortem and medical examination reports. “There was a lot of police and political pressure on her to make wrong mortem reports. She tried to complain about it. My sister should get justice,” her cousin told ANI.Maharashtra Women’s Commission chief Rupali Chakankar said, “We have taken cognisance of the matter and ordered Satara Police to take strict action against the accused.”Locals in her native village of Kotharban-Kavadgaon described her as “bright and ambitious”. “She was under pressure at work and that is why she took this extreme step. The culprits must be punished,” her aunt Prayaga Munde told PTI.","28-year-old woman doctor found hanging in hotel room in Maharashtra.

Petitioners also argued the notifications resulted from an invalid exercise of state's powers under statute and were, therefore, illegal and unenforceable. HC accepted these contentions.However, it clarified state was at liberty to issue a fresh notification, under Section 40(4), for conferring immunity envisaged under the provision to persons or classes of persons covered by the statute.",Kerala HC quashes ownership certificates issued by state govt to actor Mohanlal for two pairs of ivory tusks and 13 ivory artefacts.

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court (HC) on Friday revoked interim protection against ""coercive steps"" by Bengal authorities that assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari had since Dec 2022. Justice Jay Sengupta, while passing the order, held that ""any interim order by way of protection cannot continue for an unlimited period"".

But the single-judge bench dismissed 15 other pending cases. The cases under investigation include an alleged job scam case registered in Kolkata; another was initiated following Adhikari's alleged threat to Tamluk cops.Another single-judge bench of Justice Rajasekhar Mantha had restrained the state in Dec 2022 from taking any ""coercive measures"" against Adhikari in 29 cases. Justice Mantha had also directed the state not to lodge any criminal case against Adhikari without the court's permission.A division bench of Justices IP Mukerji and Biswaroop Chowdhury had later observed that Article 361 of the Constitution provided blanket protective covers only to the President and state governors. But they told cops to seek the court's permission before taking any ""coercive steps"" against Adhikari and directed the state director-general of police to submit reports on FIRs lodged against Adhikari.The state then moved SC against Justice Mantha's order providing a ""blanket stay"" on FIRs against Adhikari.

Raipur: Dependent wife of a missing govt employee can challenge his ex parte termination and claim service benefits of the employee who has been presumed dead after law-mandated absence of seven years, Chhattisgarh high court ruled earlier this week.With this, the court dismissed a writ petition filed by Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP), upholding an order mandating the company to provide all consequential service benefits to family of the missing employee.A division bench comprising Justice Sanjay K Agrawal and Justice Radhakishan Agrawal directed BSP to expeditiously finalise the service benefits for the woman. The bench rejected SAIL's challenge against the order of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Bilaspur bench, which had set aside the employee's removal from service.The employee, a senior technician at BSP's Rajhara mines, went missing on Jan 14, 2010. His wife had lodged an FIR regarding his disappearance. Despite receiving an official intimation about his missing status, BSP proceeded to issue a charge sheet against the absent employee on Dec 11, 2010, and subsequently removed him from service through an ex parte order dated Sept 17, 2011.CAT allowed the woman's application, setting aside the removal order and directing BSP to grant all consequential benefits.SAIL/BSP challenged this order in HC, arguing that the woman lacked locus standi to file the plea without a civil court declaration presuming her husband's death.The HC bench, however, held that since the employee had not been heard from for more than seven years, presumption of death under Section 108 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872, applied. The court noted that a civil court declaration under Specific Relief Act, 1963, was unnecessary when the fact of the seven-year absence was undisputed. HC said BSP committed a legal error by terminating the employee's service despite being aware of his missing status.","Chhattisgarh high court rules that wife of missing govt employee can claim service benefits.

This court highlighted that although Part III of the Constitution does not have a separate article declaring privacy as a fundamental right, yet the broader scheme of Part III portrays and contains in it the various aspects of privacy, Article 25 being one of them,"" it said.The court categorically noted that ""freedom of conscience as ensured under Article 25 falls within the zone of purely private thought process"". It was also emphasised that privacy is a condition precedent for the rights under Article 25 to come into being. ""This court also read privacy rights in other rights pertaining to religious belief under Articles 26 and 28, respectively,"" the bench said.It also drew a similarity on how choosing one's partner is a legitimate constitutional right in which consent of family or community or clan is not necessary once two adults agree to enter into wedlock.Referring to another SC verdict, the bench said, ""It held that the right to marry a person of one's choice is integral to Article 21 of the Constitution as an expression of one's right to life.

""""The court, while observing that the Constitution guarantees the right to practice, profess and propagate religion, held that an individual's autonomy is supreme in choices of faith and belief which are intrinsic in matters of marriage.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar Calls Out UN, Pakistan on Terror, Warns 'All Is Not Well'

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar Friday raised the issue of Pakistan 's support to the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, while highlighting the challenge that UN faces from terrorism . Speaking on United Nations Day, Jaishankar also said all was not well with the organisation as its decision-making neither reflected its membership nor addressed global priorities.Without naming Pakistan, the minister said a member of UN Security Council had openly protected the group that claimed responsibility for the April 22 attack.Pakistan is currently a non-permanent member of UNSC and had worked with China to dilute council condemnation of the attack. Islamabad also managed to omit from the statement a mention of The Resistance Front, a proxy of the Pakistan-based LeT, which twice claimed responsibility for Pahalgam.Jaishankar said few examples were more telling about the challenges facing UN than its response to terrorism. ""When a sitting security council member openly protects the very organisation that claims responsibility for the barbaric terror attack such as at Pahalgam, what does it do to the credibility of multilateralism,"" asked Jaishankar.He also slammed efforts to draw an equivalence between India and Pakistan after Operation Sindoor that targeted terrorist headquarters and camps in Pakistan and PoK.""Similarly, if victims and perpetrators of terrorism are equated in the name of global strategy, how much more cynical can the world get? When self-proclaimed terrorists are shielded from the sanctioning process, what does it say for the sincerity of those involved?"" he said.The minister said UN debates had become increasingly polarised and any meaningful reform obstructed using the reform process itself. However, Jaishankar also stressed that commitment to multilateralism must remain strong as the world could not abandon hope. ""Howsoever flawed, United Nations must be supported in this time of crisis. Our faith in international cooperation must be reiterated and indeed renewed. It is in that spirit that we all meet to mark this occasion and seek to build a better world,"" he said.",S Jaishankar raises issue of Pakistan's support to the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

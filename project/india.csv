NEW DELHI: War of words has erupted between Congress leaders Shashi Tharoor and Udit Raj following Tharoor's comments on the recent Pahalgam terror attack The controversy began when Tharoor supported the central government's position, stating that no nation could guarantee ""100 per cent foolproof intelligence.""Tharoor drew parallels with Israel's intelligence failure during the October 7 attack, suggesting that accountability should be demanded after the crisis is resolved. ""Just as Israel is waiting till the end of the war before they demand accountability, similarly, I think we too should see the present crisis through before demanding accountability from the government,"" Tharoor stated.This stance prompted Udit Raj to question Tharoor's political loyalty, asking whether he was aligned with the Congress or the BJP. Tharoor responded firmly, stating, ""I speak for myself. I am not anyone's spokesperson. I think everybody knows that I am not a BJP spokesperson.""Raj intensified his attack on Tharoor by suggesting that Tharoor's positions might be influenced by fear of central agencies like the ED, CBI, and the Income Tax department. He criticised Tharoor's limited participation in protests and questioned his praise for Prime Minister Modi's diplomatic engagements, particularly regarding the meeting with US President Trump.""Is he scared of ED, CBI and Income Tax? He continually seeks opportunities to defend PM Modi and criticise the Congress party. In how many protests has Shashi Tharoor participated, and how many times has he been arrested?"" Udit Raj questioned.The former BJP MP turned Congress leader also challenged Tharoor's apparent defence of the government, particularly when the administration had acknowledged security lapses in the Pahalgam attack that claimed 26 lives, including a Nepali citizen.Raj argued that as a Congress leader, Tharoor should be demanding stronger action against Pakistan, reminiscent of Congress governments' responses during the 1965 and 1971 wars.","Congress leaders Udit Raj, Shashi Tharoor lock horns over Pahalgam remarks.

They speak for themselves and do not reflect the Congress's views,"" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said on Monday.The attack, which took place last Tuesday at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam and killed 26 people, is one of the deadliest in the valley since the 2019 Pulwama bombing that killed 40 CRPF personnel.",Mallikarjun Kharge has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Poll What should the international community focus on more? Strengthening global cooperation against terrorism Holding countries accountable for terrorism

NEW DELHI: India on Monday hit out at Pakistan at the United Nations, highlighting Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif's ""open confession"" about his country's role in supporting and training terrorists.Speaking at the UN, India's Deputy Permanent Representative Yojna Patel condemned Pakistan for misusing the international platform to spread propaganda and make unfounded allegations against India. She specifically referenced Asif's televised confession about Pakistan's history of terrorist support.""It is unfortunate that one particular delegation has chosen to misuse and undermine this forum. To indulge in propaganda and make baseless allegations against India. The whole world has heard Pakistan's Defence Minister, Khwaja Asif, admitting and confessing Pakistan's history of supporting, training and funding terrorist organizations in a recent television interview,"" Patel said.""This open confession surprises no one and exposes Pakistan as a rogue state, fueling global terrorism and destabilizing the region. The world can no longer turn a blind eye,"" she added.Also read: Pahalgam massacre: Pakistani terrorist former para commando, says probe Patel highlighted India's status as a victim of cross-border terrorism , noting that the recent Pahalgam attack resulted in the highest civilian casualties since the 2008 Mumbai attacks . She also expressed gratitude for the international community's solidarity and support following the Pahalgam incident, which claimed 26 lives.""India deeply appreciates and values the strong unequivocal support and solidarity extended by leaders and governments across the world in wake of the recent terrorist attack at Pahalgam Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. This is a testimony to the international community's zero tolerance for terrorism. The Pahalgam terrorist attack represents the largest number of civilian casualties since the horrific 2611 Mumbai attacks in 2008,"" Patel said.""Having been a victim of cross border terrorism for decades, India fully understands the long lasting impact such acts have on victims, their families and society. As the UN Security Council in its statement has said, perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of reprehensible acts of terrorism must be held accountable and brought to justice,"" she added.This comes days after Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif admitted on Sky News that Pakistan harbours and funds terror organisations, saying that it has been “doing the West’s dirty work for decades”. He also said the Pakistan-based terror groups are “not multiple organisations” but “one single organisation religiously organised with different faces”.He said terror groups in Pakistan were “used as proxies by the USA”, and earlier the same terror groups had been treated like VIPs in Washington. “When we were fighting the war on their side in the ’80s against the Soviet Union, all these terrorists of today, they were wining and dining in Washington. Then came 9/11. Again the same situation was created. I think our government then made a mistake.Asif also said that his country would respond “in kind” to any attack by nuclear rival New Delhi in retaliation for Pahalgam and called on US President Donald Trump to “bring sanity to the situation”.After the Pahalgam attack claiming 26 lives, the government implemented several diplomatic responses, including shutting down the Attari ICP, cancelling the SVES for Pakistani nationals with a 40-hour departure notice, and reducing diplomatic staff at both High Commissions.","India hit out at Pakistan at the United Nations, highlighting Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif's ""open confession"" about his country's role in supporting and training terrorists.

Extreme monsoon may lead to dip in sea fish catch: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extreme-monsoon-may-lead-to-dip-in-sea-fish-catch-study/articleshow/120710761.cms,"Global warming is expected to bring stronger and more unpredictable monsoons to the region. How might these changes affect fish life in the Indian Ocean? A team of researchers tried to answer this question by looking at what happened in the deep past, through evidence left behind in plankton shells dating back 22,000 years on the seabed of the Bay of Bengal. What they found is not reassuring.Monsoon extremes over the past 10-20,000 years led to disruptions in ocean ecosystems and a crash in marine productivity in the Bay of Bengal, showed their study, published in Nature on Monday. Combining these historical patterns with climate projections, researchers found that intense monsoons caused by global warming could result in similar disruptions in marine productivity in the future.""We argue that as the monsoon becomes stronger and more variable, productivity collapses,"" said Kaustubh Thirumalai, the study's lead author and a scientist at the University of Arizona. That's important, he notes, because although the Bay of Bengal covers less than 1% of ocean area, it generates almost 8% of global fishery production. ""The hilsa fishery by itself sustains the protein needs of one of the most densely populated regions in the world,"" he said.For the study, researchers analysed fossilised foraminifera, microscopic single-cell zooplankton that hold a record of environmental conditions in their calcium carbonate shells to reconstruct the history of the Indian summer monsoon. Interestingly, they found that both extremes of rainfall - low and high - led to similar disruptions in ocean ecosystems, suggesting that marine productivity depends on a specific range of environmental conditions.Weak monsoons occurred in a cold phase between 17,500 and 15,000 years ago, while strong monsoons occurred during a period of warming in the early Holocene around 10,000 years ago. Marine productivity declined in both periods.How does monsoon rainfall over land influence ocean processes? One way is through river runoff which brings fresh water from the Ganga and other rivers into the Bay of Bengal. This fresh water forms a layer on the surface of the ocean, preventing the mixing of water. ""If the water doesn't mix, you don't have nutrients replenishing the surface ocean, the sunlit part of the ocean where plankton photosynthesise,"" said Thirumalai. Plankton are the foundation of the ocean's food chain.Warmer oceans - and the Indian Ocean is already warming - can also increase this ""stratification"" of water layers, and prevent the mixing of nutrients-rich waters. ""Climate projections under future boundary conditions show stronger monsoon rainfall, warmer surface waters, and weaker winds - all conditions that echo the past extremes we studied,"" said Tirumalai.The new study is a collaboration between scientists from US, India, and Europe.Another study, from researchers at the Central University of Kerala published last week, came up with similar findings through the analysis of sediments from the Andaman Sea as well as the Bay of Bengal.","Monsoon extremes over the past 10-20,000 years led to disruptions in ocean ecosystems and a crash in marine productivity in the Bay of Bengal.

NEW DELHI Ceasefire along the Line of Control with Pakistan continues to fray, with the exchange of fire between the rival armies for the first time spreading from Kashmir to the Jammu region as well in the aftermath of the Pahalgam massacre .The operational situation, however, has not yet escalated to the deadly artillery duels that were regular before the fresh ""understanding"" reached between the Indian and Pakistani director-generals of military operations in Feb 2021 to maintain peace and tranquility along the 778-km LoC.Defence minister Rajnath Singh met PM Modi Monday morning to discuss the overall situation, as govt contemplates military action in the shape of limited punitive strikes against Pakistan.As the gun duels, with assault rifles and light machine guns continued along the LoC for the fourth consecutive night, Indian Army said that Pakistan Army had initiated ""unprovoked"" small arms fire across LoC at its posts in Kupwara and Poonch districts, among other places.""Firing till now was taking place in Kashmir region like Tutmari Gali, Rampur, Uri, Gurez & Sunderbani sectors. But now, it has taken place in Poonch in Jammu region as well,"" a senior officer said.The Army has recorded at least a dozen ""clear-cut"" ceasefire violations (CFVs) by the Pakistan Army in the last four days, all of which have been responded to ""in double measure"". A CFV is generally said to occur when over 25 rounds of small arms fire are witnessed in one particular place.Any use of heavy-caliber weapons like 155mm artillery guns or 120mm mortars, of course, constitutes a violation. ""There was just one CFV in 2022, zero in 2023 and two in 2024,"" another officer said.Before Feb 2021, India often used targeted artillery and heavy-mortar fire on Pakistan Army posts and bunkers to impose costs for actively aiding and abetting infiltration of terrorists from launch pads into J&K, often by giving ""covering fire"".""The Army has the capability to conduct strikes against terror launch pads, camps and staging areas along the LoC. The military pressure on Pakistan Army can certainly be enhanced with concentrated artillery barrages as well as sniping operations to disrupt their patrols.

NEW DELHI: India will get its first Rafale-Marine jet in mid-2028 and all 26 by 2030 under the mega Rs 63,887 crore (almost Euro 7 billion) deal inked with France on Monday for the omni-role fighters that will primarily operate from indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant’s deck.The delivery of nine Rafale-M jets with their decidedly deadly weapons package in 2028, 12 in 2029 and 5 in 2030 will bolster Indian aircraft carrier operations in the Indian Ocean and beyond at a time when China ’s ever-expanding naval forays and hunt for logistical bases in the region have become a clear and present threat, officials told TOI.“The Rafale-M is a carrier-borne combat-ready aircraft with proven operational capabilities. It will be a potent force multiplier, substantially boosting India’s air power at sea,” an official said.These omni-role 4.5-generation maritime strike and reconnaissance jets will add to the 36 Rafales, which are also capable of delivering nuclear weapons, already inducted by the IAF under the Rs 59,000 crore contract inked in Sept 2016. They are deployed at the Ambala and Hasimara airbases to cater for the Pakistan and China fronts.The two major Rafale deals make the French fighter the frontrunner in the long-pending project to manufacture 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration in India, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 1.25 lakh crore and is now being fast-tracked, as reported by TOI earlier.Apart from the inter-governmental agreement (IGA) on the Rafale-M jets, inked remotely by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart Sébastien Lecornu, the aircraft supply protocol with fighter-manufacturer Dassault Aviation and weapons protocol with missile-maker MBDA were also signed here.The exchange of documents took place in the presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, Navy vice chief Vice Admiral Krishna Swaminathan and French ambassador Thierry Mathou, among others.The direct acquisition of 22 single-seater Rafale-M jets and four twin-seater trainers includes training for Indian pilots and technicians, a simulator, associated equipment, weapons and five-year performance-based logistics. It also includes additional equipment for the existing 36 Rafales of the IAF.The Rafale-M jets will be armed with long-range precision strike weapons like the IAF fighters. In addition to the 70-km range Exocet AM39 anti-ship missiles, they will have the over 300-km range `Scalp’ air-to-ground cruise missiles and the top-notch Meteor air-to-air missiles, which have a strike range of 120 to 150-km to take on enemy jets.While there is no overall transfer of technology in the deal, the IGA includes the integration of indigenous weapons like the Astra air-to-air missiles and the naval short and medium-range anti-ship missiles (NASMs) being developed by DRDO with the Rafale-M fighters in the future.It also includes setting up of a production facility for aircraft fuselage as well as MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) facilities for engines, sensors and weapons in India. “The Rafale-M’s procurement will substantially enhance joint operational capability, besides optimizing training and logistics for both Navy and IAF,” the official said.The Navy currently has only 40 of the 45 MiG-29K jets, inducted from Russia at a cost of $2 billion from 2009 onwards, to operate from the decks of its two over 40,000-tonne aircraft carriers, the older Russian-origin INS Vikramaditya and the new indigenous INS Vikrant. Moreover, the MiG-29Ks have also been dogged by poor serviceability and other problems over the years.China, incidentally, already has three aircraft carriers, the 60,000-tonne Liaoning, the 66,000-tonne Shandong and the over 80,000-tonne Fujian, and is fast building more such warships with nuclear-propulsion.","India will get its first Rafale-Marine jet in mid-2028 and all 26 by 2030 under the mega Rs 63,887 crore (almost Euro 7 billion) deal inked with France on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said that 'Court of Kazi', 'Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat' and 'Sharia Court' have no legal status or recognition in law and any declaration by them, including fatwa issued by them, is not binding on anyone and is unenforceable.A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Ahsanuddin Amanullah said SC's verdict in 2014 settled the issue of legal status of Sharia courts and reiterated its findings while allowing the maintenance plea of a Muslim woman who is living separately from her husband who invoked 'Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat' to get a talaqnama .""Court of Kazi, Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat, Sharia Court, etc, by whatever name styled have no recognition in law. As noted in Vishwa Lochan Madan (case), any declaration/decision by such bodies, by whatever name labelled, is not binding on anyone and is unenforceable by resort to any coercive measure. The only way such declaration/decision can withstand scrutiny in the eye of law could be when the affected parties accept such declaration/decision by acting thereon or accepting it and when such action does not conflict with any other law. Even then, such declaration/decision, at best, would only be valid inter-se the parties that choose to act upon/accept the same, and not a third party,"" the bench said.In this case, the wife had invoked the family court's jurisdiction to get maintenance which was denied on the ground that it was the second marriage of both husband and wife and she was herself responsible for living separately.Quashing the orders of the family court and Allahabad HC which, too, rejected the maintenance plea, SC said court was not an institution to sermonise society on morality and ethics. Interestingly, the state govt also opposed her plea of maintenance. ""In her application for maintenance filed under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code, the appellant contended that respondent No.2 (husband) had caused cruelty to her as she was not able to fulfil his demand for a motorcycle and Rs 50,000. On this aspect, the family court noted that since it was their second marriage, there is no possibility of demand of dowry by him, as he would be trying to rehabilitate his house. Such reasoning/observation by the family court is unknown to the canons of law and is based on mere conjecture and surmise,"" SC said.""The family court will do well, henceforth, to bear in mind the observation in Nagarathinam v State, that the 'court is not an institution to sermonise society on morality and ethics'. The family court could not have presumed that a second marriage for both parties would necessarily entail no dowry demand,"" it said while granting monthly maintenance of Rs 4,000 to the wife.","Court of Kazi, Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat, Sharia Court, etc, by whatever name styled have no recognition in law.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing signs of an imminent retaliation against Pakistan over the Pahalgam terror attack , Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.“It is now your duty to strengthen the nation’s economy; it is your duty to strengthen the country’s internal security; it is your duty to develop modern infrastructure; and it is your duty to bring about fundamental improvements in the lives of workers,” he said on Saturday while distributing employment letters to little over 51,000 new recruits at a virtual event.The exhortation came days after the PM publicly declared his determination to avenge the terror attack by “tracking and pursuing” the perpetrators and the masterminds of the plot until the “end of earth” to hand them a punishment they could not have imagined. It was being seen as an attempt to rally people for any eventuality.The PM said he was confident of the new recruits discharging their responsibilities with utmost devotion.In his address, Modi said govt is taking several steps to create new opportunities for employment and self-employment. He added that it’s time for unprecedented opportunities for youngsters while mentioning that the International Monetary Fund has said India will remain the fastest-growing major economy.The PM said in recent times, the production and exports have achieved new milestones, particularly in the automobile and footwear industries, sectors that provide substantial employment to young people. Highlighting the achievement in transportation of cargo through inland waterways, Modi said goods transport through inland water transport has surged to 145 million tonnes (MTs) from 18 MTs before 2014.On women taking the lead in every field, Modi cited the recent UPSC results where the top two positions were secured by female candidates, and three out of the top five toppers were women. “Women are reaching new heights in fields ranging from bureaucracy to space and science. Our govt is focused on empowering rural women through initiatives like self-help groups, Bima Sakhis, Bank Sakhis, and Krishi Sakhis, which have created new opportunities,” he said.Earlier, personnel minister Jitendra Singh said that nearly 28% of the new recruits (14,796) are women.","PM Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday lashed out at Pakistani leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari , who had threatened that ""blood would flow"" in the Sindhu river if India stopped water under the suspended Indus Waters Treaty Reminding Zardari of the repercussions of terrorism, Owaisi asked: ""Who killed your mother?""""He is new to politics. He should first think about who killed his mother. His mother was killed by homegrown terrorism. If he cannot understand that, how can anyone reason with him? If terrorism killed his mother, then the attacks that took the lives of our mothers and daughters are also terrorism. He needs to understand this,"" said the Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP.Benazir Bhutto, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, was assassinated on December 27, 2007, after addressing a rally in Rawalpindi. As she was leaving the venue, a gunman fired at her and then detonated a suicide bomb, fatally injuring Bhutto.While the Pakistani government blamed the Pakistani Taliban and militant leader Baitullah Mehsud for the attack, serious suspicions have persisted about the involvement of elements within Pakistan’s military and intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Zardari, who is a former Pakistani foreign minister, threatened India days after New Delhi formally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, following the deadly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.""India has accused Pakistan of the Pahalgam incident, with Modi making false allegations to conceal his own weaknesses and deceive his people. He has unilaterally decided to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, under which India had acknowledged that the Indus belongs to Pakistan.

Either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will,"" Bhutto, speaking in Sukkur alongside the Indus River, had said.Before Owaisi, Union minister Hardeep Puri had flayed Bhutto, saying the PPP chief needs to get his ""mental condition checked"".“Enough is enough,” Mr. Puri said, warning that India’s patience has worn thin.“Tell him to get his mental condition checked, what kind of statements he is giving... We will no longer tolerate this. Now wait for a few days,” Mr. Puri said, while speaking to news agency ANI.Union minister for commerce Piyush Goyal also slammed Bhutto and expressed confidence that many Pakistani nationals would not even agree with the ex-Pakistan foreign minister's views.""Pakistan is a despondent country and they don’t have any priority apart from spreading terror. It is unfortunate for the world that there is a presence of such politicians in it.

KOLKATA: A Kolkata court acquitted last week a 31-year-old man who spent eight years behind bars for the murder of a friend, sharply criticising police for failing to send key evidence for forensic testing and mishandling the investigation.Kolkata resident Raja Paik , arrested in Sept 2017 for the murder of 24-year-old Chiranjib Gupta in the city, was cleared Thursday by Alipore sessions judge Surajit Mandal.Chiranjib's mother said in the police complaint that her son - a drug addict and habitual drunkard - was found dead with a pillow on his face on the first floor of their two-storey home at Eastend Park in Garfa area when she returned home at 6.30pm after buying medicine for her daughter. Her daughter, returning from school at 3pm, said Chiranjib had opened the door for her.The judge faulted police for not sending the bloodstained pillow and a cotton belt - the alleged murder weapons - for forensic examination .""That aspect creates a doubt with respect to the manner in which the investigation has been handled,"" Mandal said. He also expressed surprise that the cotton belt, cited by police as a key weapon, was similarly ignored. The prosecution had argued that Paik's possession of Chiranjib's mobile phone linked him to the killing. But the court rejected that logic, questioning why a murderer would hold onto such incriminating evidence.",Kolkata resident Raja Paik was arrested in Sept 2017 for the murder of 24-year- old Chiranjib Gupta in the city.

The intensive and rigorous training regimen focuses on physical conditioning and mental fitness, besides strategic thinking. SSG commandos are adept at handling sophisticated weapons as well as in hand-to-hand combat, and have high navigation and survival skills.A senior officer said Musa's army background - confirmed during the questioning of 15 Kashmiri overground workers (OGWs) who have emerged as key suspects in the Pahalgam attack probe for facilitating the Pakistani assailants by arranging logistics and helping in reconnaissance - is being seen as evidence of ISI's role in the Pahalgam terror attack, as also in earlier strikes in Kashmir.The latter include Oct 2024 terror attacks at Gagangir, Ganderbal, in which six non-locals and a doctor were killed, and at Buta Pathri, Baramulla, which left two army personnel & two army porters dead.Musa has emerged as the common perpetrator in all three attacks.

NEW DELHI: As it looks to mobilise international opinion against Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism, the government also briefed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan about the common neighbour’s links with the April 22 Pahalgam attack . According to sources, Taliban’s acting foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi strongly condemned the terrorist attack in a meeting with an Indian delegation headed by MEA joint secretary Anand Prakash, who handles Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, underscoring the need to punish the perpetrators.The visit by Prakash came in the middle of soaring India-Pakistan tensions over the attack. India’s ties with the Taliban dispensation in Kabul have improved dramatically in the recent past, contrary to the fear in August 2021 - after the Taliban took over Kabul – that the armed militia would act as a proxy government run by the ISI. All this while, Pakistan’s own ties with the Taliban have seen a stead deterioration, mainly because of the activities of Pakistan Taliban (TTP).The Taliban, in fact, had categorically condemned the Pahalgam attack last week too, saying such incidents undermine efforts to ensure regional security and stability. Given the current circumstances, Afghanistan is unlikely to allow Pakistan any “strategic depth” that it has always sought in the country in the event of a military conflict with India.Prakash was in Kabul on Sunday to review progress in bilateral ties and was reported to have conveyed to Muttaqi that India is ready to restart work on its projects in the country and also invest in other infrastructure projects.

AGRA: Vrindavan 's famous Banke Bihari temple has dismissed suggestions from right-wing groups protesting against the Pahalgam attack that Muslims rendering services to the shrine be boycotted.Banke Bihari priest and member of the temple's administration committee, Gyanendra Kishore Goswami said Monday: ""It is not practical. Muslims, particularly artisans and weavers , have deep-rooted contributions here. They've played a major role in weaving the dresses of Banke Bihari for decades.

The groups also asked Muslim shop-owners to ""write proprietors' names on business establishments"".Goswami told TOI: ""In Vrindavan, some of the intricate crowns and bangles for the deity are made by them (Muslims). Yes, those terrorists (in Pahalgam) should be punished severely and we're totally with govt. But in Vrindavan, Hindus and Muslims live together in peace and harmony.""

'Not common for rustic people to be aware of mental illness'

NEW DELHI: An anganwadi worker leading a happy family life in a Chhattisgarh village inexplicably bludgeoned her daughters, aged five and three, to death with a crowbar, cried incessantly after the act and claimed she was possessed by ""invisible powers"" at that time.She was convicted by both trial court and HC for murder and given a life term. But a Supreme Court bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and N Kotiswar Singh on Monday found that the intention to murder was completely absent.Justice Singh reasoned that being possessed by 'invisible powers' could be a temporary medical condition and converted her conviction to culpable homicide not amounting to murder .

Taliban Wants To Help India Fight Pakistan? Stunning Move After Islamabad 'Runs To' China | Pahalgam

NEW DELHI: India is the fifth-largest military spender globally, spending almost nine times more than Pakistan. But it also has to contend with China, another nuclear-armed neighbour which spends almost four times more.With the global military expenditure registering the steepest year-on-year increase since the end of the Cold War to reach a record $2,718 billion due to ongoing conflicts and geopolitical turmoil, India is ranked after the US, China, Russia and Germany.The global military expenditure increased by 9.4% in real terms in 2024, with the top five spenders accounting for 60% of the total with a combined spending of $1,635 billion, as per the latest data released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday.The report comes at a time when the ceasefire along the Line of Control with Pakistan has frayed after the Pahalgam terror massacre, while China continues with its forward deployment of over 100,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control though disengagement has taken place in eastern Ladakh.""India is probably the only country with two active and long unresolved borders with nuclear-armed neighbours. We must cater for both,"" a senior Indian military officer told TOI.SIPRI said the 10 largest military spenders are US ($997 billion), China ($314 billion), Russia ($149 billion), Germany ($88 billion), India ($86 billion), UK ($82 billion), Saudi Arabia ($80 billion), Ukraine ($65 billion), France ($65 billion) and Japan ($55 billion). Pakistan was placed at the 29th spot with $10bn.India may be a big military spender but somewhat flounders in getting the biggest bang for its buck despite the two-front challenge. Just around 22% of the Rs 6.8 lakh crore ($80 billion) annual defence budget for 2025-26, for instance, is earmarked for capital procurements of new weapon systems and platforms. The rest is gobbled up by salaries and day-to-day operational costs for the 1.4-million-strong armed forces as well as the huge pension bill for over 3.4 million ex-servicemen and defence civilians.India spends just 1.9% of its GDP on defence when at least 2.5% is needed to effectively deal with the collusive threat from China and Pakistan. Apart from the relatively weak defence-industrial base, which makes India the second largest arms importer in the world, another major problem is the relative absence of concrete long-term plans to systematically build military capabilities in tune with the country's geopolitical aspirations.Consequently, the armed forces continue to grapple with major operational shortages on several fronts, ranging from fighters, submarines and helicopters to air defence systems, anti-tank guided missiles and night-fighting capabilities.Also read: 'This time no compromise, Pakistan will be brought to its knees': Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri China is rapidly modernizing its two-million-strong military across the traditional domains of land, air and sea as well as nuclear, space and cyber, recording its 30th consecutive year-on-year hike in its official military budget, which experts say is far less than what it actually spends. Pakistan also is no pushover.""China, the world's second-largest military spender, allocated an estimated $314 billion to its military in 2024, up by 7% from 2023. This was the largest year-on-year percentage increase in China's military spending since 2015,"" SIPRI said.China ""unveiled"" several improved military capabilities in 2024, including new stealth combat aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and uncrewed underwater vehicles. ""China also continued to rapidly expand its nuclear arsenal in 2024 and moved to strengthen certain types of counter-space and cyberwarfare capabilities. It established separate aerospace and cyberspace forces in 2024,"" it added.","India is the fifth-largest military spender globally, spending almost nine times more than Pakistan.

It will form the basis for recommending to states a template of a survey for creating a robust database of existing registered properties and new ones to be added in the future,"" Union minority affairs secretary Chandra Shekhar Kumar told TOI.There are over 8.72 lakh properties registered as waqf and more than half are in the category of 'Waqf by User', as per data shared by states with the minority affairs ministry. Waqf properties are spread over around 39 lakh acres of land across the country, according to the ministry.However, officials said data on the survey of registered properties shared by states on the Waqf Assets Management System of India (WAMSI) portal to authenticate registration details, usage and revenue are severely lacking, resulting in absence of a robust record of onground status of properties. They said it has been noticed that properties being registered by boards were not always being surveyed for verification, resulting in ambiguity and opening up the possibility for disputes.For instance, the portal shows that digitisation data of records is available for just about 3.3 lakh properties. Officials said the problem is that as of now it is not mandatory under law for states to put out information. However, this will change under the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, they said, citing provisions in the law that lay down the contours for monitoring and accountability of waqf properties.""The exercise was assigned to IIT-Delhi in Jan.

People can swap batteries - exchanging discharged batteries with charged ones - at these centres by paying an amount.To begin with, the upstream subsidy for battery swapping stations is likely to be provided for setting up facilities for electric buses, trucks, two wheelers and three wheelers, sources said. Swapping of batteries of cars will take time as the standards for this have not been notified yet.The issue of setting up the stations was discussed at length last week by officials from Prime Minister's Office and ministries concerned.The proposal comes at a time when the share of electric vehicles (EVs) in all registered vehicles in 2024-25 increased to 7.3% from barely 0.01% in 2014-15. As per govt data, around 56.8 lakh EVs are registered in the country and the numbers are going to grow considering the govt's big push for green vehicles .The plan also gains significance considering that the govt has identified 61 national highways corridors - totalling 25,639km - for setting up public charging stations at every 100km on both sides for buses and trucks, and at every 20 km on both sides for cars.Officials said battery swapping stations can either be co-located with EV public charging stations or be standalones. ""The details of subsidies that can be provided would be worked out. Setting up battery swapping stations will be a big boost for operating more electric buses and trucks on long routes as these will meet their requirement,"" one of them said.Once the battery swapping protocol for cars is in place, it will revolutionalise EV penetration in the country.Some of the highway stretches put on the priority list for creating battery charging facilities include Delhi-Chandigarh, Delhi-Jaipur, Bangalore-Mumbai, Coimbatore-Bangalore, Goa-Pune, Chennai-Bangalore, Kochi-Kanyakumari, Prayagraj-Patna, Guwahati-Jorhat and Kharagpur-Visakhapatnam.",People can swap batteries - exchanging discharged batteries with charged ones - at these centres by paying an amount.

NEW DELHI: Security tensions and terror attacks on India have been taking a heavy toll on Pakistani patients desperate for advanced treatment across the border with the issuance of visas crashing from over 1,600 in 2016 to barely over 200 in 2024. It could shudder to a halt altogether after the latest terrorist atrocity.A significant disruption came in 2017 with the clash over Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav , whom Pakistan had convicted as an Indian spy, refusing to release him despite a full-blown diplomatic crisis and India urging his release.The medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals in 2016 were 1,678, but the number fell sharply after the Jadhav episode.However, things got complicated further in 2019 as India was rocked by the Pulwama terror attack which brought the two countries to the brink of an armed confrontation. Between 2019 and 2024, data available with TOI shows, only 1,228 medical visas were issued to Pakistani nationals - 554 in 2019, 97 in 2020, 96 in 2021, 145 in 2022, 111 in 2023 and 225 in 2024.In the wake of fresh escalation in the already fraught relationship following the Pahalgam terror attack , healthcare industry experts say the latest tit-for-tat measures between the two countries may sound the death of medical tourism from Pakistan to India, at least in the foreseeable future. Medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals will be valid only till 29 April 2025, the ministry of external affairs announced last Thursday in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.In the aftermath of sentencing of Jadhav in 2017, govt had announced new rules for issuance of medical visas to Pakistani nations which mandated a recommendation letter from adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, to process genuine and urgent cases.""Patients from Pakistan used to visit India mostly for advanced surgeries such as liver transplant and treatment of birth defects that aren't widely available in their country and would cost a lot in other developed nations such as the US or the UK. But in the last six to seven years, the numbers have reduced drastically and now after the Pahalgam incident it is unlikely to go up anytime soon,"" said an official of a medical travel assistance company.""Until 8-9 years ago, many patients from Pakistan came to us for liver transplantation every month. However, their numbers have dwindled over time. We have transplanted just two patients from there in the past year - the last one seven months ago,"" Dr Arvinder Soin, chairman and chief surgeon, Medanta Institute of Liver Transplantation, said.A source at Fortis healthcare also confirmed that Pakistani nationals visiting their hospitals for treatment has reduced significantly over the years.

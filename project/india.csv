One of the classmates involved stated, ""Like we do every Diwali, we also thought of his comrades in arms, who suffer harsh climes and the enemy from across the border. We thought this would be a nice gesture for soldiers, who spend Diwali away from their families.""Colonel Mahadik died in November 2015 after being critically injured during an operation in the Haji Naka forest area of Kupwara. He was known for his exceptional skills as a football goalkeeper, horse-rider, and boxer. His leadership in challenging terrains was highly respected among his peers.The sweets were transported from Chandigarh to Srinagar airport by an Air Force aircraft.

NEW DELHI: An analysis by Centre for Science and Environment has drawn attention to the season’s first smog — on Diwali day. It also said that the PM2.5 concentration this Diwali was 34% higher than in 2022, despite both occurring in the month of October.Diwali night this year also had higher nitrogen oxide levels than in 2023. In addition to the local cracker bursting, there was also a sharp rise in pollutants resulting from harvest stubble burning, accounting for 27% of the city’s pollutants that day. The analysis fo und that PM2.5 showed a spike of 46% from Oct 28 through to Oct 31, the festival day.The study said that by midnight on October 31, PM2.5 hit a peak of 603 micrograms per cubic metre, 13% higher than Diwali peaks recorded in both 2022 (when Diwali occurred on Oct 24) and 2023 (Nov 12).It established that PM2.5 in the pollution between 6am and 4pm on Diwali was 92% higher than last year , reflecting high local and regional pollution aided by the sharp increase in the share of farm pollutants.However, the analysis noted that pollution dispersed quickly this year. “The reasons behind this late buildup and early dissipation of pollution on Diwali day were warm atmospheric conditions with relatively more efficient natural ventilation and adequate wind in the city,” the analysis explained.CSE said there was a massive build-up of pollution in different parts of the city on Diwali night, reaching ‘severe’ levels. “This year, nine of the 38 air quality monitoring stations recorded PM2.5 concentrations exceeding the critical threshold of 900 micrograms per cubic metre on Diwali night,” the report said. “The highest levels were observed at Nehru Nagar, reaching 994 microgram per cubic metre, followed by Anand Vihar at 992, Pusa IMD at 985, Wazirpur at 980 and JLN Stadium at 963.”The report noted the sudden escalation in farm fires on Diwali, which accounted for 27% of pollution in Delhi. “According to IARI data, the fire count increased from 60 on October 30 to 605 on October 31. Punjab ac counted for the highest share at 80%, followed by Uttar Pradesh at 13% and Haryana at 7%. North-westerly winds prevailed during the day on October 31, amplifying the impact of stubble burning on Delhi’s air quality,” the report said.The city’s air quality turned from ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ even when the share of smoke from farm fires was less than 3%, indicating the impact of local air pollution sources. As for vehicular pollution, the report stated that ITO had the highest NO2 levels.“Diwali night this year had higher NO2 levels compared with last year’s Diwali night. NO2 levels in the last three years have been higher on Diwali night and also the nights preceding it, which is indicative of congestion and high traffic conditions in the city leading to the festival night. ITO had the highest NO2 levels in the city with a night-time average of 182 microgram per cubic metre. JLN Stadium and Patparganj, with 104 and 101 micrograms per cubic metre were the other NO2 hotspots on Diwali night. Lodhi Road, with just 2 microgram per cubic metre of NO2, was the least affected area in the city,” the report said, while warning that the upcoming cold and calm weather might intensify the pollution status.","Diwali night this year also had higher nitrogen oxide levels than in 2023.

NEW DELHI: World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has, in its latest report on tuberculosis globally, acknowledged progress made in India to eliminate the infection.According to the report, TB incidence in India has declined by 18%, from 237 per lakh population in 2015 to 195 per lakh population in 2023. This is more than double the pace of decline as compared to the global decline of 8%, the UN health agency suggests.""This leap in coverage has been a result of the momentum India has created and sustained around TB case finding and reflects the efforts of decentralisation of healthcare services through over 1.7 lakh Ayushman Arogya Mandir across the country,"" a health ministry official said.While WHO had downsized its estimation of TB mortality in India last year, the current report documents the sustained reduction in deaths due to TB achieved by India from 28 per lakh population to 22 per lakh population, a 21% decline. ""The TB budget saw a historic 5.3-times leap in allocation from Rs 640 crores in 2015 to Rs 3,400 crores in 2022-23,"" the health ministry said. The WHO report notes that a majority of the funding of the TB programme comes from govt resources.The Centre, health ministry sources said, is procuring over 800 AI-enabled portable chest x-ray machines to complement India's extensive TB laboratory network - the largest in the world, with 7,767 rapid molecular testing facilities and 87 culture & drug susceptibility testing laboratories spread across the country.In Sept, govt approved introduction of the BPaLM regimen - a novel treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) under its National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) as a highly effective and shorter treatment option. India has notified 19.8 lakh TB patients (Jan - Sept 2024) as compared to 19 lakhs during the same period in 2023, a 4% increase.","World Health Organisation ( WHO ) acknowledged progress made in India to eliminate the infection.

DEHRADUN: National Green Tribunal ( NGT ), in response to a report filed by amicus curiae Gaurav Bansal in the matter of forest fires in Uttarakhand, directed that “Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change be impleaded through principal secretary of environment, principal chief conservator of forest, chief wildlife warden, divisional forest officer of Dehradun and Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun”, and instructed them to submit their comprehensive reply in the matter within three weeks.NGT had appointed advocate Bansal as amicus curiae in April to assist with proceedings regarding leaf burning in Badkot forest range along RishikeshDehradun road. While submitting his report, Bansal emphasised that Uttarakhand suffers from a “glaring lack of essential infrastructure required for efficient forest fire management .”The report, furnished last week, stated “it was imperative to address critical deficiencies and violations hindering effective forest fire management in state.” “This encompasses a lack of firefighting equipment such as protective goggles, protective gear, weapons, etc, insufficient patrolling vehicles to access remote areas, and a dearth of communication devices such as wireless and satellite phones essential for coordination and timely response during fire emergencies,” it stated.The report highlighted that forest department was facing infrastructure challenges , including a shortage of new structures to meet increasing demands. The forest guard or forester chowkis being situated in remote areas, devoid of basic amenities, also poses a critical hurdle.Bansal said “ construction and maintenance of fire lines is fundamental for effective fire management but Uttarakhand govt has not reviewed its fire lines for a considerable period, compromising the state’s fire management endeavours.”The report said for every 2,448 hectareforest, there was only one forest guard, who is also responsible for controlling illicit tree felling, mining, wildlife poaching, and other forest and wildliferelated offences. “What exacerbates the situation is that in Uttarakhand, there is a system of recovery for loss of revenue due to illicit felling from salary of forest guards or foresters. Safeguarding by sole forest guard is nothing but an unattainable task,” it stated. This year, Uttarakhand recorded a significant number of forest fires, with 1,276 cases reported, impacting 1,771.6 ha, as per govt data.","NGT had appointed advocate Bansal as amicus curiae in April to assist with proceedings regarding leaf burning in Badkot forest range along RishikeshDehradun road.

NEW DELHI: Good weather spared Delhiites a “severe” punishment a day after Diwali as widespread use of fireworks, a spike in the share of stubble burning , and emissions from other local sources releasing toxic gases pushed the city’s air quality into the upper level of “very poor” late Thursday night and Friday morning.High ventilation by winds of up to 16km/h and above-normal temperatures kept AQI within the “very poor” range, making it the second cleanest post-Diwali day since 2015.With clear skies, the day after Diwali was good in comparison to years like 2020 and 2021 — when air quality had plummeted to severe — and even last year, when AQI was 358. However, despite favourable conditions and lack of winter chill, post-Diwali 2024 still managed to spill a toxic cocktail of pollutants into the air.On Thursday, while some areas of south Delhi refrained from bursting crackers on a mass scale, the majority of the city made up for it. A spike in the share of stubble burning in the city's PM2.5 level also made a difference, with the share of stubble burning soaring to 27.61% on Diwali day (Thursday), compared to 8.4% on Wednesday and 1.8% on Tuesday.AQI peaked at 362 at 9am on Friday morning as the pollution load kept increasing until that time. However, after that, it gradually improved. By noon, it had improved to 354 on Friday, while the day’s average AQI was 339 against 328 on Thursday.""Even though the air quality on Diwali was in the very poor category — hitting severe levels during midnight — these conditions dissipated quickly the next day to reach moderate levels by the afternoon. This is mainly because of relatively warm conditions with reasonable wind speed and natural ventilation. The deep calm winter inversion conditions are yet to set in. Despite this, the month of October has also seen more poor and very poor days than previous years, even when the contribution of farm fires has been just around 1-3%, indicating a very high impact of local and regional pollution,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE ).Friday morning also turned hazy, which cleared with the winds and sun. According to the weather department, the wind speed was between 12- 16km/h until midnight on Diwali, which dropped to 3-7 km/h towards midnight but increased again on Friday morning, helping with ventilation and dispersal of pollutants.However, even as post-Diwali AQI 2024 turns out to be the second cleanest since 2015, what's concerning is the hourly spike in PM2.5 levels in some areas, which, as per the DPCC, spiked to more than 30 times the national permissible limits. ""In addition to pollution from firecracker bursts, stubble burning incidents in Punjab are on the rise, signalling that post-harvest burning is ramping up and will likely exacerbate pollution in DelhiNCR over the next two weeks. Immediate intervention from authorities is crucial to manage this issue,"" stated Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts.According to Abhishek Kar, senior programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), while the wind speeds reaching over 2m/s between 7am and 4pm on Friday helped the city, the air quality is yet to see a breather. ""The air quality will remain an issue in the coming days due to an increase in stubble burning in the upwind states of Punjab and Haryana. According to the AQEWS, the AQI for the next seven days is expected to be consistently above 350 and will occasionally breach the 400- mark,” said Kar.","High ventilation by winds of up to 16km/h and above-normal temperatures kept AQI within the ‘very poor’ range. Despite favourable conditions and lack of winter chill, post-Diwali 2024 still managed to spill a toxic cocktail of pollutants into the air.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114861127,imgsize-22038,width-400,resizemode-4/114861127.jpg"

A broader pattern of violence

NEW DELHI: In a concerning escalation of violence, Jammu and Kashmir has witnessed multiple terror attacks over the past two days, prompting security forces to intensify their operations in the region. The attacks have resulted in injuries to several security personnel and have raised alarm among local political leaders .A Pakistani terrorist belonging to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was killed during an encounter in the Khanyar area of Srinagar on Saturday morning. Security forces launched a cordon and search operation following intelligence regarding the presence of terrorists. As the operation unfolded, the terrorists opened fire, prompting a retaliatory response from the security forces.""During the operation, a fire broke out in the house where the terrorists were holed up, creating a thick plume of smoke,"" an official reported. The slain terrorist was noted to be one of the senior-most members of the LeT, according to a senior police officer.Two Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and two policemen sustained injuries and were transported to the Army's 92 Base Hospital, where their condition remains stable.In a separate incident, security forces neutralized two more terrorists in Anantnag during an ongoing anti-terrorist operation in the Halkan Gali area. ""Based on specific input, a Joint Operation was launched by the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir Police, and the CRPF. The terrorists opened indiscriminate fire on our troops, which led to effective retaliation,"" the Chinar Corps reported on X.The operation continues in Anantnag, with further updates expected as the situation develops.Two labourers from Uttar Pradesh were shot at by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Budgam district on Friday evening, officials said. Sufiyan and Usman were injured after they came under attack in the Mazhama area of Magam in the central Kashmir district, they said, adding that the duo were taken to a hospital, where their condition was stated to be stable.This was the fifth terror attack in the Kashmir valley since a new government was formed in the Union Territory last month.The recent wave of attacks has sparked condemnation from various political figures.Chief minister Omar Abdullah and National Conference (NC) President Farooq Abdullah expressed their sorrow over the attack on civilians in Mazhama, Budgam, where two non-local labourers were shot by terrorists.He also demanded an investigation in Budgam terror attack and said that he have a doubt that is it done by the people who were trying to destabilise the government in Jammu and Kashmir.""It should be investigated. How is it that the government has come and this is happening? I have a doubt that is it done by the people who were trying to destabilise the government...If they (terrorists) are caught then we will get to know who is doing this. They should not be killed, they should be caught and asked who is behind them...We should check if there is an agency who is trying to destabilise Omar Abdullah,"" Farooq Abdullah said.Former Deputy CM Kavinder Gupta described the attack as a cowardly attack during festivities.""There are some people here who are working as per the instructions of Pakistan, this is a cowardly attack on a festive occasion. This is wrong...there is a need to identify people who are carrying out these attacks. There are so many people here who still work as Over Ground Workers and Underground Workers,"" he said.NC MP Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi also questioned the sudden rise in attacks post-elections, asserting that the BJP regime should be held accountable for the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir. ""Why this sudden rise in these attacks immediately after the recent elections?"" he asked.Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Tariq Hameed Karra condemned the violence, calling it ""most unfortunate,"" while Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari described the attack as ""the worst form of cowardice.""The Peoples' Conference, led by Sajad Lone, also condemned the violence, labeling it as ""senseless."" ""We strongly condemn the cowardly attack on two innocent individuals who were shot at by militants in Budgam,"" the party stated.Terming the recent terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir as ""unfortunate"", Union defence minister Rajnath Singh said there is no security lapse, adding that security forces are giving befitting reply to the terrorists.Singh claimed that the number of attacks taking place in the valley have been reduced compared to the earlier times.Speaking to reporters in UP's Kanpur, Singh said, ""This is not an issue of security lapses. Compared to earlier times, attacks have been reduced. Our security forces are on alert, such a situation will come that from there (J-K) terror activities will be fully wiped out and J&K will develop fast.""""The attacks that happened were unfortunate, our security forces are giving befitting reply also, so many terrorists have been killed,"" he said.After a terrorist attack in Budgam district, Jammu and Kashmir National Conference leader and MP from Srinagar Ruhullah Mehdi said that the central-led BJP government should be held responsible for the attack.However, he expressed grief over the attacks and extended his prayers to the victims and their families.Holding the BJP responsible for the recent attack, Mehdi further alleged that there was an increase in attacks immediately after the recent legislative elections concluded in the territory in which the NC-Congress alliance won a majority and formed their government.In a post on X, Mehdi wrote, ""Saddened by the news of the terrorist attack on the civilians in Mazhama Budgam. My sympathies and prayers with the victims and their families. The BJP regime which is directly in control of the security in J&K should be held accountable for these repeated failures. Also want to ask why this sudden rise in these attacks immediately after the recent elections?""These incidents are part of a broader pattern of violence in the region. Since the formation of a new government last month, this marks the fifth terror attack in Kashmir. Previous attacks included the tragic deaths of two soldiers and two Army porters on October 24 and the killing of a doctor along with six construction workers on October 20.As security operations continue and investigations unfold, the local populace remains on edge, grappling with the harsh realities of ongoing violence in their communities.","Two labourers from Uttar Pradesh were shot at by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Budgam district on Friday evening.

The incident, which took place at the Primary Health Center in Gardasari, prompted a public outcry and has led to the suspension of two staff members.According to the CMHO’s order, Dr. Chandrashekhar Singh, the medical officer at Gardasari’s primary health center, has been reassigned to the Community Health Center in Karanjia. Additionally, Nursing officer Rajkumari and ward assistant Chhoti Bai Thakur have been suspended with immediate effect.The CMHO, Dr. Ramesh Maravi, addressed the incident, saying, ""This took place on 31 October. Following complaints from the woman’s relatives, notices have been issued to the medical officer, nursing officer, and ward assistant involved. We will forward their replies to the District Magistrate and proceed with any necessary actions.""The case drew attention after a video surfaced showing Roshni Marawi, the pregnant widow of Shivraj Marawi , cleaning the bloodied hospital bed. Shivraj, 40, was taken to Gardasari health centre for emergency treatment following a brutal attack that left three family members dead due to a land dispute. He died shortly after his arrival.Reports indicate that the violent attack, involving 25 assailants armed with sticks, rods, and axes, took place on 31 October in Lalpur Sani village. Shivraj, his father, and his brother were attacked over an ongoing land dispute that had been resolved in the family’s favour by a 2018 court ruling. The attackers, identified as relatives, allegedly sought revenge by ambushing the family as they approached their paddy field.Dr. Chandrashekhar Tekam of the health centre later commented to the media that Roshni was not explicitly instructed to clean the bed but may have collected blood-stained materials to preserve evidence. Nonetheless, the viral video spurred outrage, leading to immediate disciplinary measures.The police have arrested four suspects and continue searching for three more individuals involved.",The chief medical and health officer of Dindori has taken disciplinary action following a disturbing incident.

Without mentioning specific countries, Jaishankar noted instances where partners have commented on India’s domestic issues, often with a prefaced call for “honest conversations.”""Some friends may also be more complicated than others. They may not always share the same culture of mutual respect or ethos of diplomatic etiquette. We have from time to time seen comments on our domestic issues accompanied by a prefaced desire to have honest conversations,"" he said.The EAM said that friendships between nations are not exclusive, particularly in a multipolar world. He highlighted that it is to be expected that nations, even allies, will seek to maintain their own options while limiting those of others.""Even friendships will not be without some hedging. Relating to other major powers is also a challenge in itself. The more global they are, the broader their range of activities and interests,"" he said.""Friendships are also not exclusive, particularly so in a multipolar world. It is only to be expected that others, even friends, will seek to maintain their options while restricting ours,"" the EAM added.According to Jaishankar, the nation’s diplomatic efforts generate a sense of goodwill and have led to closer international engagement. He referred to this strategy as “diplomacy 101”.Jaishankar remarked on India’s unique position in the world, referring to it as a “Vishwamitra,” or friend to all, driven by a commitment to global good. ""We seek to be friends with as many as possible,” he said.Reflecting on the book’s insights, Jaishankar noted the role of strategic interests in forming alliances. While sentiment and values are influential, he argued, they must be aligned with national interests for relationships to thrive.He cited India's partnerships with key nations like the United States, Japan, and Australia, noting how these ties have flourished within the QUAD and have overcome “the hesitations of history.”""If all these ties have changed so much in the last decade, I am sure you would agree with me that much of the credit should go to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his personal interest and leadership, because remember, at least three of them have not even seen a high-level visit for three decades,"" the EAM said.Jaishankar summarised his view of friendship, saying, “Friends are about comfort and convergence, with an easy ability to work with each other.” True friends, he added, respect each other’s challenges and strive to find common ground. However, he cautioned that friendships are rarely straightforward or static. “They may have their challenges but are no less for it.

'Cancelled' Diwali event

NEW DELHI: India has lodged a protest in the strongest terms in regards to the ""absurd and baseless"" references made by a Canadian minister about home minister Amit Shah , the external affairs ministry said on Saturday, adding that it also formally protested to the Justin Trudeau government regarding recent revelations that Indian diplomats in Canada were placed under ""audio and video surveillance"".Speaking during a press conference, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: ""Regarding the latest Canadian target, we summoned the representative of the Canadian High Commission on Friday ... It was conveyed in a diplomatic note that the Government of India protests in the strongest terms to the absurd and baseless references made to the Union Home Minister of India before the Committee by Deputy Minister David Morrison. In fact, the revelation that top Canadian officials deliberately leak unfounded insinuations to the international media as part of a conscious strategy to discredit India and influence other nations only confirms the view that the government of India has long held about the current Canadian government's political agenda and behavioural pattern. Such irresponsible actions will have serious consequences for bilateral ties.""The latest row between Canada and India erupted after Morrison confirmed Shah's name during a parliamentary session, linking him to actions targeting Sikh activists.Morrison had also told Canadian Parliament members of the national security committee that he had confirmed Shah's name to The Washington Post, which first reported the allegations. While addressing the Parliament members, Morrison did not say how Canada knew of Shah's alleged involvement.The ""baseless"" allegations against the home minister, follow accusations made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about Indian agents' involvement in the murder of pro-Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , which has deteriorated India-Canada ties.Amid rising tensions, India recently expelled 6 Canadian diplomats and recalled its High Commissioner to Canada.In addition to these accusations, Canada has labeled India as an ""adversary"" in its National Cyber Threat Assessment, further straining diplomatic ties.The report suggests that Indian state-sponsored cyber actors may conduct espionage against Canada.Reacting to the report, the MEA said: ""We see this as yet another Canadian strategy to attack India. Canadian senior officials have openly confessed that they are seeking to manipulate global opinion against India ... as on other occasions, these imputations are made without any evidence.""Jaiswal further said that some consular officials were recently informed by the Canadian government that ""they have been and continue to be under audio and video surveillance"".""Their communications have also been intercepted. We have formally protested to the Canadian government as we deem these actions to be a flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions. By citing technicalities, the Canadian government cannot justify the fact that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation. Our diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence. This action of the Canadian Government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices,"" the MEA said.On the reports of a cancelled Diwali celebration at Canada's Parliament Hill, Jaiswal said: ""We have seen some reports in this regard. It is unfortunate that the prevailing anti-India atmosphere in Canada has reached high levels of intolerance and extremism.""After severe backlash from the Hindu community, leader of the Conservative Party Pierre Poilievre had clarified that the event was not cancelled but rather rescheduled to a different venue. This clarification came from Poilievre, following initial reports that suggested the event was canceled due to recent geopolitical tensions between Canada and India.On the reduction in the number of visas by the Canadian government, the MEA spokesperson said: ""We are monitoring the well-being of our students and professionals who are working in Canada. Our concern for their safety and security remains strong.""","India has lodged a protest in the strongest terms in regards to the ""absurd and baseless"" references made by a Canadian minister about home minister Amit Shah.

Ongoing dialogue on deportations

NEW DELHI: In response to recent US sanctions against Indian entities, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) affirmed on Saturday that India is actively engaging with American authorities to address concerns surrounding the measures. The sanctions, imposed by the US State Department, target 19 Indian companies and two individuals accused of allegedly supplying materials and technology to Russia, allegedly aiding its military in the ongoing Ukraine conflict .Randhir Jaiswal, MEA spokesperson , remarked on India's adherence to strict non-proliferation policies, saying, ""India has a robust legal and regulatory framework on strategic trade and nonproliferation controls. We are a member of key multilateral export control regimes and effectively implement relevant UNSC sanctions, including Resolution 1540 on non-proliferation.""Despite the US accusations, Jaiswal emphasized that the transactions in question do not violate Indian laws, underscoring India’s commitment to keeping its export control provisions updated and ensuring companies understand applicable restrictions. ""Our understanding is that the sanctioned transactions are not in violation of Indian laws. We are in touch with the US authorities to clarify issues,"" he added.The companies affected by the sanctions, such as Shreegee Impex Private Limited and TSMD Global, asserted that the sanctions would not affect their operations. Praveen Tyagi, director of Shreegee Impex, expressed confusion over the decision, saying, ""I don't know why these measures have been imposed on us. But it will not have any impact on us, because we neither import from the US nor export to the US""Rahul Kumar Singh, Director of TSMD Global, voiced similar sentiments, explaining, ""We are suppliers of automobile parts and agricultural implements, and we don't engage in any business with the US Our business with Russia will continue as usual.""Economists suggest the sanctions may signal a larger geopolitical message. Manoranjan Sharma, chief economist at Infomerics Ratings, commented on the timing, noting, ""This could be an attempt to influence the American elections on November 5. While it sends a message to both governments, it’s unlikely to have a significant impact on either India or Russia.""Sharma continued, ""These measures will have an extremely limited impact,"" downplaying any major strain on India-US relations amid an ongoing discussion on India’s policies concerning Sikh extremism issues.As part of India-US discussions, Jaiswal also touched on recent deportations of Indian nationals from the US “We have a regular dialogue with the United States on migration and mobility... facilitating the movement of people who are in the US illegally. This ongoing cooperation aims to create more legal migration opportunities,” Jaiswal noted, emphasizing India’s continued efforts to mitigate illegal immigration.","US sanctions target 19 Indian companies and two individuals accused of allegedly supplying materials and technology to Russia, allegedly aiding its military in the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

Except for a couple of bypolls, BSP has not contested byelections here,"" Mayawati said at the presser.""They have so far been contesting elections with a mutual understanding, but now with the BSP contesting the bypolls, the troubles of their 'alliance' have increased,"" she added.Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya responded by distancing BJP from the 'Batenge toh Katenge' slogan, asserting, ""We will not let the opposition succeed with its dirty game of calling ‘Batenge toh Katenge’ BJP’s slogan. Our party’s slogan is the one coined by our top leader Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’.""The slogan was first used by Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath in Agra in August and was later endorsed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).Mayawati urged people not to be swayed by ""empty"" slogans, stating that BSP's rule was the best. She accused SP of allowing criminals to run the government during its tenure and suggested that SP was discreetly encouraging such elements to help them in the bypolls.Bypolls in Uttar Pradesh are scheduled for November 13, and votes will be counted on November 23.The contested seats are in Katehari, Karhal, Meerapur, Ghaziabad, Majhawan, Sishamau, Khair, Phulpur, and Kundarki. Eight seats fell vacant as their MLAs were elected to the Lok Sabha, while the Sishamau by-election resulted from the disqualification of SP MLA Irfan Solanki following a criminal conviction.In the 2022 Assembly elections, the SP won Sishamau, Katehari, Karhal, Milkipur, and Kundarki. The BJP won Phulpur, Ghaziabad, Majhawan, and Khair. The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) won Meerapur.","Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Sunday accused the Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Samajwadi Party ( SP ) of being ""hand in glove"" The BSP is contesting the November 13 bypolls for nine Assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114888584,imgsize-628593,width-400,resizemode-4/114888584.jpg"
'Classic shoot and scoot brand': Hardeep Puri slams Congress amid row over unkept poll promises,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/classic-shoot-and-scoot-brand-hardeep-puri-slams-congress-amid-row-over-unkept-poll-promises-rahul-gandhi-kharge-bjp/articleshow/114883648.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Saturday hit out at Congress party, saying that it has got back to its classic ""shoot and scoot brand"" of social media policy drawn from ""lies, fabricated figures and fake data"". The minister said that the Narendra Modi-led government has fostered growth for the country on multiple fronts, while senior leaders of the Congress party don't pay attention to facts before expressing their ""misguided opinions"" publicly.The minister's remark adds to the war of words that has erupted between his party and Congress over ""unfulfilled"" poll promises . Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday claimed that “Modi ki guarantee” was a cruel joke on the people, while PM Modi latched on to the latter's advice to his state workers that they should be guided by ""fiscal viability"" and an unplanned approach could lead to financial difficulties.""Congress Party's classic shoot and scoot brand of social media policy based on lies, fabricated figures and fake data is back in action. Even their senior most leaders do not check facts before going public with their delusional opinions,"" the Union minister posted on X along with a graphic video.“Under leadership of PM @narendramodiJi, India has witnessed significant employment growth over the years. Employment has increased by nearly 36%, adding around 170 million jobs between 2016-17 and 2022-23.”“Let me also remind them that India’s economic trajectory demonstrates sustained job creation across key sectors. We are on our way to becoming the world’s 3rd largest economy very soon from the 11th spot their famed economists and policies left us in 2014,” he added.The oil minister said that the creation of both direct and indirect job opportunities for India's youth has contributed to an average GDP growth of more than 6.5 percent during this time. Puri claimed there are positive changes in employment, saying that the unemployment rate dropped to 3.2 percent in 2022-23.“According to PLFS, youth (age 15-29 years) unemployment rate has declined from 17.8 percent in 2017-18 to 10 percent in 2022-23. EPFO has reached 131.5 lakh in 2024 while Gig Economy workforce is expected to grow to 2.35 crore by 2029-30,” he wrote.The minister also said that agriculture sector remains dominant, employing over 45% of the workforce, which he claimed was a gradual shift toward manufacturing and services.Hitting out at Congress president Kharge over his allegations that the Central government had failed to fulfill their poll promises, the oil minister remarked that while Kharge perceives ‘stampedes,’ he is unable to see that the Worker Population Ratio has risen by nearly 26 percent from 2017 to 2023“He is clearly looking at all the wrong places and getting fake data, or maybe is just too preoccupied with trying to hold his imploding party together and buys whatever lies his advisors sell to him; or he is just too fixated with the ‘unemployment’ of his party’s travelling Shehzada,” he said.The tussle broke out when PM Modi, in a recent series of tweets, accused Congress of making empty promises during election campaigns. PM Modi on Friday said, ""The Congress Party is realizing the hard way that making unreal promises is easy, but implementing them properly is tough or impossible. Campaign after campaign, they promise things to the people, which they also know they will never be able to deliver.""PM Modi highlighted problems in Congress-ruled states, stating that the ""developmental trajectory and fiscal health are deteriorating"" in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, and Telangana. He claimed that Congress's unfulfilled promises were deceiving the poor, youth, farmers, and women, and that existing welfare schemes were being overlooked. Modi urged the public to remain alert against what he referred to as the ""Congress-sponsored culture of fake promises,"" citing the recent election results in Haryana as proof of the people's rejection of Congress.Reacting to the PM's charge, Kharge said that lies, deceit, fraud, loot and publicity are the five adjectives that best define the BJP government at the Centre.""Lies, Deceit, Fakery, Loot & Publicity are the 5 adjectives which best describe your Govt! Your drumbeating regarding a 100-day plan was a cheap PR stunt! On May 16, 2024, you also claimed that you took inputs from more than 20 lakh people for the road map for 2047. RTI filed in PMO declined to put forth details, exposing your LIES!"" Kharge said.","Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Saturday hit out at Congress party, saying that it has got back to its classic ""shoot and scoot brand"" of social media policy.

I’m pointing out that terrorists are coming from Pakistan—why aren't they being stopped? What actions is the Modi government taking? It is the government’s duty to prevent these incidents and apprehend the perpetrators.

The injured were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and are reported to be in stable condition.","National Conference Farooq Abdullah demands investigation into rising terror attacks.

Prashant Kishor explains why Jan Suraaj chose 'school bag' symbol: 'In 35 years of Lalu-Nitish rule ... ',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prashant-kishor-explains-why-his-party-chose-school-bag-symbol-in-35-years-of-lalu-nitish-rule-/articleshow/114883963.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj supremo Prashant Kishore on Saturday criticised the 35-year rule of Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar , saying that it has stripped Bihar 's children of their school bags and replaced them with the burdens of labor. Kishor explained the significance of the school bag as his party's election symbol, saying that education is essential for ending poverty, creating jobs, and curbing migration.“In 35 years of Lalu-Nitish rule, the school bag has been removed from the backs of the children of Bihar, and a sack of labour has been tied on them,” Kishore declared.“The Jan Suraaj symbol is the school bag because the path to ending poverty, creating jobs, and stopping migration lies in education. Only through education can Bihar’s people develop and eradicate poverty,” he explained.The Election Commission recently allotted the “school bag” symbol to all four candidates fielded by Jan Suraaj in the Bihar by-elections scheduled for November 13. Alongside Ramgarh, by-polls will take place in Imamganj, Belaganj, and Tarari constituencies, following vacancies created earlier this year.Earlier at a rally in Ramgarh, Kishor had alleged that Bihar’s backwardness is partly due to the electorate's tendency to vote based on “jaat” (caste) and “bhaat” (free rations). Using a catchy rhyme to make his point, he urged people to break away from supporting parties solely for caste loyalty or minor handouts, stating that such voting patterns have fuelled chronic poverty and lack of progress. “Lalu Prasad and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar kept Bihar trapped in ‘jaat’ for 35 years,” he said. “For the past 10 years, Modi has been short-changing you in exchange for five kgs of ‘bhaat’.”Kishore accused both the state and central governments of failing to address the pressing needs of Biharis, particularly in education and economic opportunities. Critiquing Nitish Kumar’s governance, he accused the Chief Minister of replacing one form of “terror” with another. “The terror of criminals during Lalu’s era has been replaced by the terror of an unbridled bureaucracy,” he claimed, referring to the issues caused by recent mandatory smart pre-paid electricity meters and a disruptive land survey that, according to him, have further distressed the public.He also warned against voting for the BJP, which he claims has made clear it would support another term for Nitish Kumar in next year’s assembly polls. “If you support the BJP, it will strengthen the hands of Nitish, and your woes will continue,” he said.","Jan Suraaj supremo Prashant Kishore criticised the 35-year rule of Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar.

Houses stand vacant, mere shadows of families who’ve sought refuge elsewhere. Only a few remain — mostly men — who now sleep outside on high cots stationed beneath the sprawling branches of a neem tree, taking turns to guard against a familiar creeping death: poisonous snakes.India leads the world in snakebite deaths, with nearly 58,000 lives lost annually out of 3-4 million bites — a statistic to which UP heavily contributes. Despite govt’s National Action Plan to curb snakebite deaths, ingrained practices continue to drive the toll higher as communities choose to count on traditional healers and methods rather than seek medical aid. When a TOI team fanned out in the UP hinterland to find out what countless citizens of the state were doing to battle snake bite incidents, it saw some startling rituals still much in vogue.In village after village, superstition often guided action (or the absence of it). In the town of Jehangirabad in Bulandshahr, when 22-yearold Mohit Kumar was bitten by a snake in April, his family suspended his body over the Ganga river, toes grazing the water. They believed that the venom would be drawn out by the current. He remained in that position there for two days — a ritual that concluded only with his cremation.Next door in Shahjahanpur , two children were buried alive in cow dung by their family in 2021 after being bitten by a snake, certain in the mystical healing power of dung. They died.National Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) recently launched National Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Snakebite Envenoming (NAPSE). According to NAPSE’s guidance document, “Only a small proportion of snakebite victims across countries report to clinics and hospitals and the actual burden of snakebite is grossly underreported.”","India leads the world in snakebite deaths, with nearly 58,000 lives lost annually out of 3-4 million bites.

Born under uncertain circumstances and abandoned shortly thereafter, Krishna was discovered clinging to life in the branches of a tree after being thrown from a bridge in Hamirpur.When rescued, he bore roughly 50 injuries and a serious bite wound on his back - possibly crows - that left him in critical condition. Krishna's unlikely saviour was the large tree by the bridge, which cushioned his fall and saved him from an otherwise fatal plunge. The tiny child held on.The baby was rushed to Hamirpur's district hospital before being referred to Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) Hospital in Kanpur. The infant's arrival at LLR on Aug 26, coinciding with Janmashtami that celebrates the birth of Lord Krishna, inspired staff members to name him after the beloved deity. As the staff worked tirelessly to nurse him back to health, Krishna became much more than just a patient to them - he became family.During his two-month stay at LLR, the medical teams formed deep emotional bonds with Krishna. Nurses sang lullabies from a distance to soothe his cries.""When we finally held him, it was on the day of his discharge. We are overjoyed with his recovery and wish him all the happiness in life,"" said neonatal ICU nurse Lakshmi, who developed a particularly strong connection with Krishna.Against the odds, Krishna's recovery was complete after six weeks of dedicated care. On Oct 25, the emotional moment of his departure was shared by the hospital staff, many of whom shed tears as he was handed over to police and the child welfare committee.","A newborn boy, now known as Krishna, has captivated the hearts of hospital staff and onlookers across Uttar Pradesh.

PRAYAGRAJ: Every arrest and detention does not amount to custodial torture, Allahabad HC observed while dismissing a writ petition filed by one Shah Faisal of Maharajganj , seeking compensation from UP govt for an alleged ""inhuman act"" against him by cops, reports Rajesh Kumar Pandey .Noting that the petitioner had a case filed against him, court said: ""It may not be prudent to accept the claims of human rights violation by persons having criminal records in a routine manner for awarding compensation. If this is allowed then it would lead to a wrong trend and every criminal arrested or interrogated would turn up and file a petition seeking heavy compensation against the action of police officers."" HC maintained that there was no evidence of custodial torture against the policemen accused by the petitioner.In his petition, Faisal had alleged that two policemen from Partawal police outpost in Maharajganj took him to the outpost, where an SI and a constable demanded Rs 50,000, threatening that otherwise he would be framed in a criminal case. He alleged that when he showed his inability to pay, he was beaten up in the lock-up.Faisal said he went to Shyam Deorwa police station the following day to lodge an FIR against the policemen, and also approached the SP later, but no action was taken. HC noted that there was an FIR against the petitioner, wherein he was accused of beating one person with a rod. He was called to the police station for interrogation in connection with the said case.","Allahabad HC dismisses writ petition filed by one Shah Faisal of Maharajganj seeking compensation from UP govt for an alleged ""inhuman act"" against him by cops.

'We are not Kukis': Manipur community rejects British-era tag,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-not-kukis-manipur-community-rejects-british-era-tag/articleshow/114896774.cms,"Representative Image (IANS Photo)

GUWAHATI: Manipur 's Thadou community rejected the colonial-era classification & post-independence bureaucratic nomenclature designating it as a constituent of Kuki group, asserting that this label was arbitrarily imposed without its explicit consent.""Thadou is a distinct ethnic group, with our own distinct language, culture, traditions, and history. Thadou is not Kuki, or underneath Kuki, or part of Kuki, but a separate, independent entity,"" states the declaration of Thadou Convention 2024, which concluded Saturday in Guwahati. The convention said among all those touched by ethnic violence in Manipur since May 3 last year, Thadous were most affected.The state's sectarian strife has claimed over 225 lives and displaced around 60,000 people, creating a deep divide between Kuki-Zo tribal people of the hills and Meiteis of Imphal valley. The convention extended sympathy to survivors of the violence and their kin and affirmed its solidarity with Thadou people of Myanmar, who were affected by the ongoing political unrest in the country.It also affirmed that Thadou people constitute an independent, indigenous community among Manipur's 29 native tribes, as recognised by the 1956 Presidential Order. ""Thadous have always been known and recorded as Thadou, without any prefix or suffix to it, and it has been the single largest tribe in Manipur consistently since the first census of India in 1881 till the latest census in 2011 that recorded Thadou population at 2,15,913,"" the declaration states.It said Thadous reject and disown the term 'Kuki', which was ""coined by colonial rulers, supposedly known as a conglomerate of several constituent tribes, without which it is non-existent and irrelevant. The term has never been accepted by any of the other kindred tribes (Aimol, Gangte, Hmar, Kom, Mizo, Paite, Simte, Vaiphei, Zou, etc). Thus, any attempt to conflate or confuse Thadou identity with Kuki will be construed as the imposition of Kuki upon Thadous with divisive and malicious intentions, and it will never be acceptable to Thadou people""."," Manipur's Thadou community rejects colonial-era classification & post- independence bureaucratic nomenclature designating it as a constituent of Kuki group.

Kharge said an RTI query has found that of the 18,940 sanctioned posts in 46 central universities, 27% teaching posts are vacant. ""Among those, more than 38% seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBC) are lying vacant.""The party fielded senior functionaries to counter the PM's allegationsregarding delivery on poll promises in Congress-governed states.

Same-Sex Dating: ‘Our twins have daddy and papa’: A portrait of gay fatherhood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/our-twins-have-daddy-and-papa-a-portrait-of-gay-fatherhood/articleshow/114886838.cms,"We met almost 13 years ago through a same-sex dating website and felt an instant connection. Soon after, we started living together and with time our love blossomed. Five years into our relationship, we chose to come out, first to our sisters and then to our parents. It was a difficult reality for our middle class, small-town parents but with time and effort they understood our love and became our strongest support system.While we have distinct personalities, we have similar values. More than anything else, we both harboured a strong desire to be fathers. But we had no idea how or whether it would ever be possible. Our journey to fatherhood started when we got our first furry baby home and then the second. However, we continued to yearn to become fathers to human babies too. The pandemic made us realise the fragility of life and made us determined to not further delay our fatherhood journey . We shared this thought with our immediate families. They warned us to be completely sure of our decision as it was a life-changing one and had social implications too. Once they were sure of our determination, they wholeheartedly supported our decision and this meant a lot to us.After evaluating all possibilities, we chose to go for surrogacy. This was late 2020, more than a year before the surrogacy laws of the country were amended (single men and women are not allowed surrogacy since December 2021). We were blessed with a boy and girl in June 2021 and life changed forever. The memory of the day we first held them in our arms still leaves us with happy tears.From day one, we have been learning how to handle infants and with every passing day we keep getting better. Right from giving them a massage and a bath to feeding them at regular intervals (not to forget burping them after every feed) and singing lullabies while putting them to bed to getting them ready for school every morning, we learnt everything on the job. Both our parents were also elated to become grandparents. They have been of great help to us, both physically and mentally. Seeing our septuagenarian parents relive their childhood with our grandkids brings us extreme joy.Now, our babies are a little more than three years old. At every milestone of the journey, we have been absolutely open about our family and haven’t hidden anything from anyone. Yes, there have been occasional raised eyebrows and some fleeting comments here and there, but we have largely been well-accepted by people around us. One of the most beautiful experiences happened during the ‘Family Day’ function at our kids’ school when we stood on the stage and shared our story in front of more than 100 so-called conventional parents. Everyone in the audience appreciated our journey and till date we haven’t been treated differently by anyone at school.Another heartwarming experience was when our son, while watching an animated series on Bal Ganesha, shared with someone that like Ganeshji has Shivji and Parvati Mata, we have daddy and papa. Our babies are small now and we are sure someday we will have to explain our unconventional family to them. We hope to gradually introduce them to our story. We also realise they might have to answer some questions outside too and for that we are giving them the right upbringing and the value systems which will empower them to chart their journeys. As parents, we will always be with them and by them.We are extremely proud of our family. We live in Bengaluru with both sets of parents, our human babies and our furry babies under the same roof. It is a multicultural family as one of us is Bengali and one Punjabi . Our kids are growing up in a wholesome atmosphere. We celebrate Durga Pujo and Lohri with equal fervour. They speak Bengali, Hindi, English and a bit of Kannada too. They enjoy their fish curry as much as their kadi chawal. They are growing up under the love and care of two doting fathers and two amazing sets of grandparents. They also have a lovely extended family of aunts, uncles and cousins who are part of our lives too — we all come together to celebrate every festival. Our family might be unconventional, but it is beautifully complete.Basu is a retail professional. Kalra is a SAP architect.","We met almost 13 years ago through a same-sex dating website.

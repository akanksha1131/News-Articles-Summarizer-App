NEW DELHI/HONG KONG:

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani targets a 2025 Mumbai listing for his telecom business Jio, valued by analysts at over $100 billion, and plans to launch his retail unit’s IPO much later, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.Reliance Industries’ boss Ambani hasn’t updated his IPO timelines after saying in 2019 that Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail would “move towards” a listing within five years. In recent years, Ambani, Asia’s richest man, raised $25 billion collectively for digital, telecom and retail businesses from the likes of KKR, General Atlantic and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing both ventures at above $100 billion.The two sources said Reliance has now firmed up plans to launch the Reliance Jio IPO in 2025 as it internally believes it has achieved a stable business and revenue stream in becoming India’s No. 1 telecom player with 479 million subscribers.But the retail business IPO is not expected until after 2025 as the company first needs to address some internal business and operatio nal challenges, said the first source. Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment.Reliance aims for the 2025 Jio IPO to be India’s biggest ever, overtaking Hyundai India’s record $3.3 billion IPO this year, said the first source. Both the sources, who declined to be named as the discussions are private, said the IPO timelines can still change.","Reliance Industries’ boss Ambani hasn’t updated his IPO timelines after saying in 2019 that Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail would “move towards” a listing within five years.

School Holiday November 24th: Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji's Martyrdom Day

November 2024 ushers in the heart of India’s festive season, as schools and colleges across the country remain in celebration mode. Following the vibrant Diwali festivities on October 31, students enjoy a series of significant religious holidays in early November.In many states, schools remain closed for Govardhan Puja and Bhai Dooj, extending the Diwali break into the first week of November. Schools in several states will reopen on November 4, but the festivities continue as holidays are observed for Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, and Karthik Purnima later in the month.While these holidays bring joy and cultural connection, they also signal a shift towards the academic season’s end. November marks the beginning of the pre-exam period for students, with upcoming term-end exams and the first round of dates for major entrance exams, such as the JEE, announced.The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students gradually transition from the festive season to exam season. Here’s a rundown of November’s key school holidays:Here's a closer look at the school holidays in November Govardhan Puja, celebrated the day after Diwali, marks Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. Devotees prepare traditional food offerings and worship the Govardhan Hill to express gratitude for nature’s abundance. This festival is celebrated in several regions, and schools in some states remain closed for students to participate in the rituals and celebrations.Bhai Dooj, celebrated just two days after Diwali, is a festival symbolizing the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being, and brothers offer gifts in return. This occasion fosters family unity, with schools closed for students to spend time with their families and partake in this cherished ritual.Chhat Puja, a deeply revered festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to worshipping the Sun God. The festival involves fasting and prayers for the well-being and prosperity of family members. Schools close in regions observing Chhat Puja, allowing students to participate in the early morning and evening rituals along the riverbanks.Guru Nanak Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is one of the most significant days in the Sikh calendar. Celebrated with grand processions and community services, it emphasizes values of equality, compassion, and humility. Schools in many states declare a holiday, enabling students to partake in the celebrations and observe the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Karthik Purnima, observed on the full moon day of the Karthik month, holds importance for both Hindu and Sikh communities. Celebrations often include holy baths and offerings at rivers, temples, and gurudwaras. The holiday allows students and families to engage in these spiritual practices.Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji’s Martyrdom Day honours the ninth Sikh Guru's sacrifice for the freedom of religion. His martyrdom is commemorated with solemn services, kirtans, and processions, emphasising the Guru’s courage and dedication to human rights. Schools observe a holiday in some states to let students remember and honour this legacy.","The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students transition from the festive season to exam season.

It came back to base after several hours on Monday evening and reported there were no hindrances put up by the PLA on the way,” he added.With the “task” assigned to the patrol being “completed”, the Army will now also send patrols to the other four PPs in Depsang. “The ball has been set in motion,” the officer said, after the new pact led to disengagement in the remaining two of the seven major face-off sites that arose after multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.“This is yet another positive step towards maintaining peace and tranquillity on the Line of Actual Control,” the Leh-based 14 Corps also said in a post on `X’ late on Monday night, with a “file photo” attached to it.Though the Army now has “unrestricted access” to the five PPs in Depsang and two in Demchok, which was earlier blocked by Chinese soldiers, long-duration patrols to certain areas will be a “tough task” due to the approaching winter. “We will patrol some areas throughout the winter, but it will not be possible in a few other places due to weather conditions,” he said.Also read: Did US play any role in India-China LAC agreement? State department responds The PLA, too, is conducting similar patrols with advance information to India to prevent the possibility of any clash. As part of the earlier verification patrols, Indian soldiers had gone up to PP-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13 in Depsang Plains for the first time in almost five years through the “Bottleneck”, the area around 18-km inside Indian territory where the PLA was blocking them from going any further since April-May 2020.After the Depsang-Demchok pact, India now wants the restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established after previous rounds of disengagement till September 2022.These buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.There is, of course, still a long way to go for India’s demand for de-escalation and de-induction of the over 50,000 PLA troops forward deployed in eastern Ladakh, with another 90,000 across Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector, to be accepted by China.","The Army ""successfully"" undertook a full-fledged patrol to one of the five patrolling points (PPs) in the Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh on Monday.

Here are the top updates:



Peel regional police arrested and criminally charged three individuals over the incident. ""Earlier today, Peel Regional Police were present at a demonstration held at a place of worship in Brampton. The event was subsequently relocated to two different locations within the city of Mississauga As a result of these demonstrations, three individuals have been arrested and criminally charged for their actions. Several acts of unlawfulness continue to be actively investigated by our 21 Division Criminal Investigation Bureau along with 12 Division Criminal Investigation Bureau,"" the statement read.

Indian High Commission in Canada slammed the ""violent disruption"" by 'anti-India' elements outside a consular camp in Brampton and raised concerns over the safety of Indian nationals in the country. The High Commission said that any further events will be organised ""contingent on security arrangements"" made by the local authorities. ""We have seen violent disruption today (Nov 3) orchestrated by anti-India elements outside the consular camp co-organised with the Hindu Sabha Mandir , Brampton, near Toronto,"" the statement read.

The High Commission said that any further events will be organised ""contingent on security arrangements"" made by the local authorities. ""We have seen violent disruption today (Nov 3) orchestrated by outside the consular camp co-organised with the , Brampton, near Toronto,"" the statement read. Canadian Prime Minister Justin said that every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely. Taking to X, Justin Trudeau thanked the local authorities for the swift response to protect the community and probe this incident. ""The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely,"" Trudeau said.

Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre said that the Conservatives condemned the attack and promised to unite the people and end the chaos. ""Completely unacceptable to see violence targeting worshippers at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today,"" the opposition leader said.

Attacking the Trudeau administration, Canadian MP Chandra Arya said that he started believing that there is a small grain of truth in the reports that in addition to the Canadian political apparatus, Khalistanis have effectively infiltrated Canada's law enforcement agencies. ""A red line has been crossed by Canadian Khalistani extremists today. The attack by Khalistanis on the Hindu-Canadian devotees inside the premises of the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton shows how deep and brazen Khalistani violent extremism has become in Canada. I begin to feel that there is a small grain of truth in the reports that in addition to Canadian political apparatus, Khalistanis have effectively infiltrated into our law enforcement agencies,"" he said in a post on X.

Ontario Sikhs and Gurdwara Council also condemned the incident and said that the attack is a distressing reminder of the need for understanding and mutual respect in our community. ""OSGC is committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of all community members and supporting an environment where people can feel safe and respected, regardless of their beliefs. We call upon local authorities to thoroughly investigate this incident, reaffirming that violence has no place in our society. We also encourage community leaders and members to come together, support one another, and foster an atmosphere of unity and compassion,"" the statement read.

The recent attack adds to a series of such incidents in recent years. Earlier, a Hindu temple in Windsor suffered defacement with anti-India graffiti, sparking widespread condemnation and calls for action from both Canadian and Indian officials. Earlier incidents in Mississauga and Brampton saw temples similarly targeted, drawing strong reactions from the Indian community in Canada. In July, Arya had voiced deep concern over the violence directed at Hindu-Canadian communities. In a post on X, he wrote, ""The Hindu temple BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton is vandalised again. During the last few years, Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area, British Columbia, and other places in Canada are being vandalised with hateful graffiti.""

International working president in Vishva Hindu Parishad Alok Kumar condemned the attack and said that the incident is a matter of regret and anguish. ""This causes a great concern, more so because the Indian consulate was invited by the Hindu temple to organise a camp there over facilities for Indians travelling to India. The Indian Consulate has informed the police authorities about it and had requested for security. Despite advance information and declining security atmosphere, it is a matter of regret and anguish that Canadian police did not make any arrangements and rioters were given a free run."" Kumar said.

Hours after the incident, city's mayor, Patrick Brown announced that he will be bringing in a motion in the city council to prohibit protesting at places of worship in the city. Brown said he has asked the city solicitor to look into the legality of the law for the next scheduled meeting of city council. ""Places of worship should safe spaces that are free of violence and intimidation. I have asked our City solicitor to look into the legality of such a by-law for our next scheduled meeting of City Council,"" read a post by the mayor on X on Monday.

Indian-American Congressman Shri Thanedar also criticised the Canadian government for what he describes as political manoeuvring and failure to protect Hindu communities amid rising incidents of religious violence. Speaking on recent attacks targeting Hindus in Canada, Thanedar said, ""The Canadian government is playing politics with this issue, they are trying to please certain minority groups in Canada. The attack against Hindus are purely terroristic acts. Canada government's protection of these terroristic activities needs to be deplored, it needs to be opposed."" He stressed the need for Canada to uphold the human rights of Hindu minorities, comparing the situation to the rights struggles faced by Hindu communities in countries like Bangladesh. Thanedar added, ""I have done a lot including putting pressure on the Biden administration to address these atrocities.""

Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu accused Trudeau of creating divisions among different communities in Canada and said,""The news reports coming in over the past few days, the situation that has formed in Canada do not pertain one particular religion. Be it Hindu or Sikh, PM Justin Trudeau has divided everyone there."" Bittu criticized both those advocating for pro-Khalistan slogans and the Canadian police for their support, stating that the Indian Government will respond to the situation with a more decisive action. ""Khalistanis came outside religious places to disturb people in festive season. Their Police seem to be standing in support of Khalistanis...These will not be tolerated. We will move against the Govt of Canada, wherever we have to approach...These people who are raising Khalistani slogans are on their payroll,"" Bittu said.

The ministry of external affairs (MEA) condemned the recent violence at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton, Ontario, with spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal urging Canada to protect places of worship and bring those responsible to justice. ""We condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists,"" Jaiswal said, reaffirming India’s commitment to supporting Indian nationals and Canadian citizens amid ongoing intimidation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the recent attack on a Hindu temple in Canada, describing it as a ""deliberate"" act and criticising attempts to intimidate Indian diplomats. He affirmed that such acts of violence would not weaken India's resolve and called on the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday voiced a strong condemnation of a recent attack on Hindu temple in Canada, calling it a ""deliberate"" act. He also denounced ""cowardly attempts"" to intimidate Indian diplomats, asserting that such violence would not weaken India's resolve.""I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,"" Prime Minister tweeted.Earlier in the day, ministry of external affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal expressed the government’s grave concerns, urging Canadian authorities to ensure the safety of places of worship and bring those responsible to justice.""We condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton, Ontario yesterday.

We remain deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada. The outreach of our Consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike will not be deterred by intimidation, harassment and violence,"" Jaiswal said.In a widely circulated video, a violent group of men were seen wielding sticks and attacking devotees outside the temple. The mob was also seen carrying flags associated with pro-Khalistani groups.According to the community organisation Hindu Canadian Foundation, women and children were also attacked in the violent mob.Meanwhile, Peel regional police arrested and criminally charged three individuals over the incident.In a statement issued by the police, it said that several acts of unlawfulness continue to be actively probed.""Earlier today, Peel Regional Police were present at a demonstration held at a place of worship in Brampton.

'JMM letting infiltrators for political gains'

""

'JMM-Cong disrespected Champai Soren'



PM Modi slams Congress over 'derogatory remarks' against women

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a blistering attack against the INDIA bloc partners on Monday as he addressed two rallies in poll-bound Jharkhand . The BJP 's election campaign is in full swing, with the Prime Minister's visit coming a day after Union home minister Amit Shah addressed three rallies in the state.At the two rallies, PM Modi accused the JMM led coalition government in Jharkhand of letting infiltrators from Bangladesh and putting the state's tribal population in danger. PM Modi termed the JMM-Congress coalition of beinginfiltrators' alliance and a ""mafia's slave"".The remarks from the PM come as BJP is relentlessly attacking the Hemant Soren-led government, accusing it of allowing Bangladeshi infiltrators to settle in the state and change the demographics. ""Bangladeshi infiltration is causing a sharp decline in tribal population in Jharkhand. The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance is encouraging it for petty political gains,"" Union home minister Amit Shah said at a rally in Ghatshila on Sunday.PM said that only the BJP can guarantee Jharkhand ""suvidha"" , ""suraksha"", ""sthirta"" , and ""samriddhi"" , calling it as ""Modi's guarantee"".""Appeasement politics has reached its pinnacle in Jharkhand, where the JMM-led coalition is busy supporting Bangladeshi infiltrators. If this continues, the tribal population in Jharkhand will shrink. This is a threat to tribal society and the country,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi said that Congress and its allies intend to keep the tribal community ""poor and in deprivation"" for a long time while BJP is committed to remove poverty from Jharkhand. Further, he alleged the ruling JMM of disrespecting former chief minster Champai Soren and former JMM member, who jumped ship to the BJP recently.""What did these people (JMM) do to Champai Soren ji... these people left no stone unturned in insulting a tribal son. Those for whom nothing is bigger than their family, how will they care for you people? Such selfish parties have to be taught a good lesson. Further, he exuded confidence that people of the state are seeing it and are keen to bring BJP back to power in the state.Champai Soren, who is often referred to as the ""Kolhan tiger"" joined the BJP after an internal tiff broke out in JMM over ""insult and humiliation"" by the party. He also claimed he was put under surveillance by Jharkhand govt in Delhi, Kolkata, which strengthened his resolve to join the BJP.""BJP can save tribals'' identity, check infiltration in Jharkhand''s Santhal Pargana,"" he had said.Previously, he was the chief minister of Jharkhand , shortly after Hemant Soren resigned as the CM before being arrested by the ED in a money laundering case. In less than two months, Soren had to step down to allow the return of Hemant Soren to the chair following the latter's bail in the case.Champai Soren is now set to fight from Seraikela, which he has won six times since 1991. Champai is also working hard as he won Seraikela by a margin of a little over 15,000 votes in 2019.PM Modi also singled out the Congress-led INDIA bloc for its silence over Shiv Sena leader Arvind Sawant's ""imported maal"" against Shaina NC, a BJP leader who switched sides to the Shinde Sena faction to contest the November 20 Maharashtra election.The opposition used ""foul language"" against a woman leader"", PM Modi said.""Mothers and daughters are in shock and the people of the state will teach them a lesson,"" the Prime Minister said, also pointing out to another incident of the Congress for ""humiliating"" Sita Soren , BJP's candidate and sister-in-law of chief minister Hemant Soren.The PM also drew parallels between the Britishers pre-independence barbarism and the Congress, whom he said practiced the same with the ""blood of tribals"" in Jharkhand. ""In the 1980s when Congress was in power both in Bihar and Delhi and Jharkhand was part of Bihar back then - Gua Goli Kaand happened - the kind of barbarism the Britishers have committed here, Congress did the same with the blood of tribals"".PM Modi also accused the grand old party of of failing to deliver on its promises and said that he was shocked to see that even Congress Mallikarjun Kharge has also accepted that Congress' false promises will destroy states.""Government employees had to hold protests to get their DAs and salaries in Himachal Pradesh. The people of Telangana are suffering because of the false promises of Congress... I am shocked to see that even Congress Mallikarjun Kharge has also accepted that Congress' false promises will destroy states. This is why, you should not trust the fake promises of Congress,"" PM Modi added.Meanwhile, CM Hemant Soren, who held a rally of his own countered the BJP's allegation that the JMM government is providing ""shelter to Bangladeshi infiltrators"" and asked how the Centre could allow deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina to land and seek refuge in India.""Please tell us on what basis you allowed the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh to land in India and seek asylum. Infiltrators from Bangladesh enter India through BJP-ruled states. They are saying it themselves,"" Soren said addressing an election rally in the Garhwa Assembly seat on Sunday.The PM's visit marks the first since announcement of the assembly elections, which are scheduled to take place in two phases on November 13 and 20. The vote counting scheduled for November 23.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses two rallies in poll-bound Jharkhand.

'I have been framed': RG Kar rape accused Sanjay Roy; trial to begin Nov 11,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-have-been-framed-says-rg-kar-rape-accused-sanjay-roy-as-west-bengal-court-files-charges/articleshow/114944588.cms,"NEW DELHI: West Bengal's Sealdah Court on Monday framed charges against prime accused Sanjay Roy under section 103(1), 64 and 66 Bhartiya Nyay Sahita in the RG Kar rape-murder and the trial is set to begin from November 11. However, while being taken away from the court, Sanjay Roy denied charges, claiming that he was being framed in murder of the trainee doctor.""I have been framed. I told the judge that I am innocent but they did not listen to me,"" says accused Sanjay Roy while being taken out of Sealdah court.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is leading the investigation, had filed a charge sheet against Sanjay Roy about a month ago. The other two arrested in connection with the August 9 rape and murder of the junior doctor – former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh and ex-Tala OC Abhijit Mandal – were accused of conspiracy and evidence tampering.Previously, a Sealdah court had ordered that charges be formally filed on November 4, with an in-camera trial set to commence on November 5, running four days per week. Roy faced charges under specific sections relating to rape and murder, which, if proven, could result in the death penalty.In the charge sheet submitted on October 7, the CBI claimed that Roy’s involvement in the crime was “clearly established” through 11 points of evidence, including oral testimonies, documents, forensic findings, and other supporting evidence. CCTV footage confirmed Roy’s presence on the third floor during the night of August 8-9, while his phone records aligned with his presence at that location. Roy’s defense has signaled plans to challenge the charges.The evidence against Roy appears significant. The police, who initially handled the investigation, found Roy’s jeans and shoes with the victim’s bloodstains. DNA analysis confirmed matches between Roy and the victim. Additionally, it was confirmed that Roy sustained injuries between the night of August 8 and midday on August 9, coinciding with the timeframe of the crime. A Bluetooth device at the scene was also linked to Roy’s phone.","West Bengal's Sealdah Court on Monday framed charges against prime accused Sanjay Roy in the RG Kar rape-murder.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has moved the bypolls for nine assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh from November 13th to November 20th. This decision, citing festival considerations, has sparked controversy, with Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) of manipulating the schedule to sway the outcome.Yadav, in a post on social media platform X, said, ""First the Milkipur bye-election was postponed, now the date of bye-elections for the rest of the seats has been rescheduled. The BJP was never so weak."" He further alleged that the BJP fears a defeat and is employing delaying tactics.The SP leader argued that the original election date coincided with the return of migrant workers to Uttar Pradesh for Diwali and Chhath Puja holidays. These workers, Yadav suggested, are disillusioned with the BJP and would have voted against them.By postponing the elections, he claimed, the BJP aims to disenfranchise these voters who will likely return to their places of work before the new polling date.The ECI, however, maintains that the decision was taken following requests from multiple political parties, including the Congress, BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). These parties argued that holding elections during the festive season would negatively impact voter turnout.Responding to Yadav’s accusations, BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla dismissed them as politically motivated. He said, ""The bypoll date shift was demanded as the date coincided with Hindu festival. But Samajwadi Party has to do politics in everything. More so in this case as they are least bothered about majoritarian sentiment but about their vote bank.""The nine assembly constituencies facing bypolls are Katehari, Karhal, Meerapur, Ghaziabad, Majhawan, Sishamau, Khair, Phulpur, and Kundarki.Eight of these seats were vacated by MLAs elected to the Lok Sabha , while the Sisamau seat requires a by-election due to the disqualification of its former SP MLA .","The Election Commission of India (ECI) has moved the bypolls for nine assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh from November 13th to November 20th.

Similarly, the poll dates for both phases of the 2022 Manipur assembly elections were altered due to the first phase coinciding with a Sunday.In the 2012 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, voting dates were changed due to Barawafat. The 2013 Mizoram assembly elections also saw polling and counting dates adjusted for social events and Sunday observance. Additionally, in the 2023 Rajasthan Elections, the poll date was modified forDevuthan Ekadashi , and recently in Haryana, the date was changed due to Asoj Amavasya.As a result, one assembly constituency in Kerala, four in Punjab, and nine in Uttar Pradesh will now hold polls on November 20.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It was akin to a Diwali surprise - several IAS officers belonging to the Kerala cadre got ""added"" to a new WhatsApp group on October 31, labelled 'Mallu Hindu Officers.'The WhatsApp group, which included only Hindu officers in the cadre, was created from the phone number used by IAS officer K Gopalakrishnan . It led to immediate objections, with many officers finding it inappropriate and contrary to the secular principles that officers are expected to uphold.The WhatsApp group was disbanded a day after its creation, with Gopalakrishnan claiming that his phone was hacked. He stated that multiple groups were formed using his contacts without his consent. It is learnt that the officer also filed a police complaint in this regard.The incident comes on the heels of another high-profile controversy involving senior IPS officer MR Ajith Kumar. Kumar was removed from his position as ADGP (law & order) after it was revealed that he covertly met senior RSS functionaries, allegedly without the knowledge of the LDF govt in Kerala. Though govt has not officially acknowledged this as the reason for his transfer, it was forced to transfer Kumar after even LDF ally CPI took a tough stand on it.""There are several WhatsApp groups among officers, but a WhatsApp group on religious lines is something new,"" a senior officer told TOI, on condition of anonymity. He said WhatsApp groups among officers differentiated between junior and senior officers, are intended for various services and there are others based on different considerations including language, but many of them are largely inactive in nature. A group explicitly created on religious grounds, however, was unprecedented.A senior intelligence officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that the agency was alerted about the group by a few officers who were added to it. These officers provided evidence, prompting the agency to take the matter seriously and prepare a report. Intelligence agencies, both at the state and Central levels, are now looking into the matter.","Several IAS officers belonging to the Kerala cadre got ""added"" to a new WhatsApp group on October 31, labelled 'Mallu Hindu Officers' The WhatsApp group was created from the phone number used by IAS officer K Gopalakrishnan.

Nothing wrong in PM Modi's visit to my residence for Ganpati puja: CJI Chandrachud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-wrong-in-pm-modis-visit-to-my-residence-for-ganpati-puja-cji-chandrachud/articleshow/114962239.cms,"NEW DELHI: Addressing the controversy over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to his residence for Ganpati prayers, Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud on Monday said there was ""nothing wrong"" in it and underscored the need for a ""sense of maturity in political sphere"" on such issues. Following the PM's visit to the CJI residence, opposition parties led by the Congress and a section of lawyers had raised concerns over propriety and separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive. The BJP, on the other hand, dismissed the criticism as unwarranted and said it was a ""part of our culture"".Speaking at an event organised by the Indian Express, CJI Chandrachud said one has to respect that the dialogue between the judiciary and the executive takes place as a part of the robust inter-institutional mechanism and separation of powers does not mean the two will not meet.""The separation of powers concept does not postulate that judiciary and executive are antagonist in the sense they will not meet or not engage in a reasoned dialogue. In the states, there is a protocol of chief justice and the administrative committee of the high court meeting the chief minister and on the chief minister meeting the chief justice at their residence. In most of these meetings, you are discussing basic issues like budgeting, infrastructure, technology, etc,"" he said.On the prime minister's visit, the CJI shared, ""The PM visited my residence for Ganpati puja. I do feel, there is absolutely nothing wrong as these are continuing meetings between the judiciary and the executive even at the social level. We meet at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Republic Day, etc. We are in conversation with the prime minister and the ministers. This conversation does not involve the cases which we decide but life and society in general.""The CJI, who demits office on November 10, said, ""There has to be a sense of maturity in the political system to understand this and trust our judges because the work we do is evaluated by our written word. Everything we decide is not kept in wraps and is open to scrutiny.""He said a robust dialogue taking place between the executive and the judiciary on the administrative side had nothing to do with the judicial side.""What the separation of powers postulates is that the judiciary should not be performing the role of the executive which is defining policies because the power to frame policy belongs to the government. Likewise the executive does not decide the cases. So long we have this in mind. Dialogue has to take place because you are dealing with the careers and the lives of people in the judiciary,"" he said.The CJI said the dialogue between the judiciary and the executive had nothing to do with how cases were decided. ""That has been my experience.""Even his statement of having prayed to God for a solution to the Ayodhya Ram Mandir dispute had attracted considerable clamour.CJI Chandrachud called himself a ""person of faith"" who respected all religions equally.""It is a problem of social media. You must have the backdrop of where I was speaking. I visited my village which is 1.5 hours from Pune. It is predominantly an agricultural community. The question which I was asked was that in the arena of conflict in the court how do you stay calm.""I said everyone has his own mantra and my mantra (not religious) of life is to spend time on reflection on myself. When I said that I sit before a deity, I am not defensive about the fact I am a man of faith. I have my own faith and equally respect all faiths,"" he said.""My being a person who professes a particular faith has nothing to do with how I will treat people of different faiths who come to me seeking justice. Every case is decided in accordance with law and the constitution. If someone's faith gives a sense of calm and degree of objectivity to look beyond conflict so be it and that people must accept. The fact that you belong to a particular faith has nothing to do with your ability to do justice to people of different faith,"" he said.His statement had come while addressing the residents of his native Kanhersar Village in Khed Taluka during a felicitation ceremony, when he said he had prayed to God for a solution to the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute and asserted God will find a way if one has faith.""Very often we have cases (to adjudicate) but we don't arrive at a solution. Something similar happened during the Ayodhya (Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute) which was in front of me for three months. I sat before the deity and told him he needs to find a solution,"" he had said.""One look at our cause list, would indicate the diversity which comes to our court,"" the CJI added.When asked about his take on presser by four Supreme Court judges in 2018 against ex-CJI Dipak Misra, Chandrachud said there has to be institutional discipline and he believed that there is always a room for a dialogue.Commenting on CJI-designate Justice Sanjiv Khanna , Chandrachud said he is an objective and calm human being and can smile even in serious conflict.""The Court is in safe and secure hands post my retirement,"" he added.When asked if he would like to tweak the frame of the Ganesh Puja picture and include the Leader of Opposition (LoP) and judges of the apex court, Chandrachud, in a lighter vein, said that he would not include the LoP as it was not a selection committee for appointment of Central Vigilance Commissioner or Director of CBI.""On occasion such as marriages, deaths, there are social visits. When my mother died, I had a visit from the chief minister of the state. These are elementary courtesies. We must understand that judiciary has a sense of maturity. The fact is that deals are never cut like these, so trust us. We are not here to cut deals. To cast impute motives on judges is denigrating the society,"" he added.Responding to a question on delay in hearing on the bail plea of former JNU student Umar Khalid in Delhi riots case, CJI Chandrachud said in media a particular case assumes significance and then the court is criticized on that particular case.""After I took over as CJI, I decided to prioritise bail cases as it pertains to personal liberty. It was decided that at least every bench of the top court should hear 10 bail cases. Between November 9, 2022, and November 1, 2024, 21,000 bail cases were filed in the Supreme Court. During this period, 21,358 bail cases have been disposed of.""As many as 967 Prevention of Money Laundering Act cases were filed during this period and 901 cases have been disposed of. A dozen political cases involving prominent ones, where bail has been granted in recent months. Very often, in media, a certain facet or atmospherics of a case are being made out.""When a judge applies mind to the record of a case, what emerges may be quite different from what is portrayed in the media on the merits of that particular case. The judge applies his mind to the concerned cases and then decides the case. Speaking for myself, I have granted bail from A to Z (Arnab Goswami to Zubair) and that's my philosophy,"" Chandrachud said at the event.","CJI D Y Chandrachud said there was ""nothing wrong"" in the PM's visit to his residence for Ganpati prayers. He underscored the need for a ""sense of maturity in political sphere"" on such issues. Opposition parties had raised concerns over propriety and separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114962239,imgsize-57716,width-400,resizemode-4/114962239.jpg"

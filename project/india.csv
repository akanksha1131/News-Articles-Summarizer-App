Interpol issues first silver notice at India’s request against ex-French embassy officer in visa fraud case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/interpol-issues-first-silver-notice-at-indias-request-against-ex-french-embassy-officer-in-visa-fraud-case/articleshow/121453280.cms,"File Image

NEW DELHI: Interpol, for the first time, has issued a Silver notice at India's request to monitor former French embassy officer Shubham Shokeen, who is involved in visa fraud.The Silver notice, introduced in January, is designed to track illicit assets globally. Italy's request initiated this pilot programme, which India has joined.Interpol utilises nine different colour-coded notices for specific information requests from member countries. These include Red for fugitive detention, Blue for additional information, Black for unidentified bodies and Yellow for missing persons.India participates alongside 50 other nations in the initial phase of Silver notice implementation, continuing until November. Each participating country is permitted to publish nine Silver notices during this pilot phase.The CBI stated on Tuesday that Silver notices and Diffusions enable member countries to request information about assets connected to criminal activities, including fraud, corruption, drug trafficking and environmental offences.This notice system helps locate and identify information about laundered assets, including properties, vehicles, financial accounts and businesses.Countries can use this information for bilateral engagement, including asset seizure and confiscation, within their legal frameworks.I t is pertinent to mention that the CBI has secured two Silver notices: one on May 23 against Shokeen, who served as Personnel Visas and Local Law Officer at the French Embassy in Delhi, and another on May 26 against Amit Madanlal Lakhanpal, sought by the Enforcement Directorate.From September 2019 to May 2022, Shokeen allegedly facilitated Schengen visa issuance by collecting illegal payments ranging from ""Rs 15,00,000 to Rs 45,00,000"" per applicant. He reportedly used these proceeds to acquire Dubai properties worth 7,760,500 dirhams (""Rs 15,73,51,250"").The CBI, India's nodal agency for Interpol matters, had previously obtained a Blue notice to locate Shokeen. All Indian law enforcement agencies coordinate their Interpol requests through the CBI.Meanwhile, Lakhanpal allegedly created an unrecognised cryptocurrency, MTC, collecting ""Rs 113.10 crore"" from investors without proper authorisation. He reportedly misappropriated funds and falsely claimed to represent the Ministry of Finance.India has submitted additional Silver notice requests for cases under investigation by the CBI, Enforcement Directorate, and Narcotics Control Bureau.","Interpol has issued a Silver notice at India's request to monitor former French embassy officer Shubham Shokeen.

Excited about impact of experiments part of the mission: Tibor Kapu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/excited-about-impact-of-experiments-part-of-the-mission/articleshow/121453843.cms,"Excerpts:

What are the most exciting scientific experiments/innovations you hope to contribute to during the mission?

How has your engineering & research background influenced your approach to space missions?

Given your tech background, what future advancements do you believe will impact space exploration?

What does it feel like to be part of a private mission like Ax-4?

With your experience in high-stakes environments, how do you prepare for the challenges of living and working in space?

For months now, Tibor Kapu and India’s Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla have trained side by side—navigating spacecraft systems, running emergency drills, enduring isolation simulations, and even learning to fly—preparing for a shared journey that will carry them far beyond Earth. When they launch aboard the Axiom-4 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on June 8, Kapu will represent Hungary on its historic first spaceflight. In an exclusive interview to TOI, Kapu reflects on how his research-driven mindset shapes his approach to space missions, the Hungarian experiments he's taking to orbit, and the technologies he believes will redefine our future in space.I’m particularly excited about the diversity and potential impact of the Hungarian scientific experiments. One highlight is studying how microgravity affects the human microbiome — understanding its effect on bacterial, viral, and fungal communities in the body could be vital for long-term spaceflight and even medicine on Earth. We’re also testing a medical device: a novel, nanofibrous eye insert without any active pharmaceutical ingredients. Another project spins a water sphere to mimic planetary dynamics—an engaging way to teach physics.We’ll also be testing microfluidic drug chips and a Hungarian-developed personal dosimetry device for radiation monitoring.My background has greatly helped me in preparation. Analytical skills and problem-solving techniques I've developed over the years have been valuable while training for space exploration. Engineering principles guide my understanding of spacecraft systems and mission protocols, while my research experience helps me appreciate scientific objectives and experiments. This combination allows me to contribute effectively to mission execution, ensuring we maximise scientific return while maintaining safety and efficiency.I believe the future lies in space radiation protection, advanced materials, and autonomous systems. These are key to long-duration missions. New materials will improve spacecraft durability, while autonomy will allow deeper exploration with less human input. These technologies will also benefit life on Earth—enhancing medicine and sustainability. Satellite constellations and on-orbit data processing are also exciting; we’re beginning to shift high-energy activities into orbit, easing Earth’s burden.It’s incredibly special, especially to represent Hungary on its first mission to the ISS. Growing up, I was fascinated by space. This mission is a dream come true—not just for me, but for many aspiring scientists back home. It’s a proud moment that showcases Hungary’s contribution to international collaboration and will hopefully inspire future generations.We’ve undergone comprehensive training across physical, technical, and psychological domains. This includes learning spacecraft systems, practising emergency procedures, and maintaining fitness. Psychological readiness is equally crucial—we focus on resilience and effective communication. In Hungary, we had an intense two-year selection and training process: survival training, aerobatics, hyperbaric chamber testing, and private pilot licensing. We studied rocket theory, space engineering, and space health, and underwent isolation training. In the US, this was expanded with demanding simulations—from donning pressurised suits to emergency drills inside full-scale ISS mockups. Every phase has prepared us for the rigours of spaceflight.",Tibor Kapu and India’s Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will launch aboard the Axiom-4 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on June 8.

Thiruvananthapuram: A couple and their two sons were found dead at their home in Vakkom, in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram district, on Tuesday. Police suspected a suicide pact, with a preliminary inquiry suggesting a financial crisis as the possible trigger.The deceased were identified as Anil Kumar (55), his wife Sheeja (50), and their sons, Ashwin (25) and Akash (22). Anil worked as a senior clerk at Vakkom Service Cooperative Bank while Sheeja was a daily-wage worker at the legislative assembly. Ashwin had completed BCom and was searching for a job, while Akash was an engineering student in Chirayinkeezhu. Sheeja often spoke about the family's mounting debts, said ward member Santhamma S. The financial strain began after they took a large bank loan to renovate a house purchased some years ago. ""Matters worsened in 2019 when Ashwin was seriously injured in an accident, resulting in multiple fractures. He was hospitalised for six months, and the family incurred heavy medical expenses, adding to their already growing debt,"" Santhamma said.","The deceased were identified as Anil Kumar (55), his wife Sheeja (50), and their sons, Ashwin (25) and Akash (22) Police suspected a suicide pact, with a preliminary inquiry suggesting a financial crisis as the possible trigger.

Advantage taxpayers

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns for the assessment year 2025–26.

Advice that breaks the mold



Eyes on the stars, feet on the ground

The academic world constantly flaunts “quantity” and the number of hours studied ostentatiously. But here’s a topper who stole the spotlight not only for his exceptional performance in the CBSE Class 10 board exams, but also for his not-so-followed study strategy. Meet Rudra Pratap Singh , a student of Stone Ridge International School, Rudrapur, who secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams. His secret to success? Consistency and smart work. Shattering all the age-old adages that equate long hours with high scores, Rudra said: “I studied for just two hours a day.”At first glance, Rudra’s story seems like one of prodigious intellect. But a deeper conversation reveals something more universal and profoundly human—a story of clarity, self-discipline, and purpose-driven learning, all while shouldering responsibilities that transcend far beyond textbooks.From training with NASA and ISRO under their Young Scientist and Citizen Science programmes to interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during government-led youth initiatives, Rudra’s resume reads like a page out of an adult professional’s LinkedIn profile.“I’ve worked with the Ministry of Youth Affairs for programmes like Viksit Bharat and Leaders Dialogue,” he said. He also holds certifications in astrophysics from IIT Kanpur and IIT Bhubaneswar, and serves as a Brand Ambassador for KIIT University, Russia.At such a young age, Singh has earmarked his name as the world record-holding author, certified by the World Record Committee (USA) as the youngest writer of juvenile fiction. He perceives this as part of a larger mission. “I’m advocating for youth welfare, teen upliftment, and mental health activism,” he says with the composure of someone twice his age.So what is the secret behind a teenager with international commitments and so many other feathers in his cap finding time to top the board exams?It isn’t something very typical, nor something entirely different, Rudra says—“just prioritisation and consistency.”He didn't believe in marathon study sessions. “Quality over quantity—I never went beyond two hours a day. But I made sure those two hours were fully focused. I broke large tasks into smaller ones and checked them off daily.”Rudra admits to feeling demotivated several times during the journey. “Sometimes I wondered if two hours were enough,” he said. “But then my inner voice reminded me—you’ve made a promise to yourself and to the people who believe in you. That belief became my fuel.”Rudra’s love for learning isn’t confined to math or science. “I’ve always loved social sciences,” he said. His interests in geopolitics and climate science saw him working with Oxford Academy and participating in the UN Climate Science Olympiad. He’s also been a member of the United Nations World Parliament.He allocated separate time for each subject. “I gave 45 minutes each to English, Hindi, and Social Science, and a bit more to Mathematics because solving problems requires practice,” Rudra says. He made sure he was gaining conceptual clarity in every subject.Like every success story, Rudra’s too has its cornerstone. “My family, my teachers, and the environment around me,” he says without a pause. “There were times when my parents believed in me more than I believed in myself.”He credits his online mentors at PhysicsWallah for helping him build strong conceptual clarity and appreciates the flexibility that digital learning offers. “When we study online, we must show our face to the teacher—not just out of respect, but to stay accountable to ourselves.”For someone his age, Rudra is remarkably self-aware. “Motivation is temporary, but when discipline becomes your motivation, it stays.”Rudra’s message to juniors is both enriching and grounded in experience. “People told me, ‘To top CBSE, you have to study more.’ I wanted to prove them wrong—that even with just two hours of focused study a day, it’s possible. And I did.”But here’s the catch: “It only works if you’re consistent, humble, and willing to learn from others. Don’t be overconfident. Learn from your mistakes—and better still, from others’.”He also doesn’t shy away from acknowledging the pressure that comes with expectations. “In some internal exams, I missed two or three questions. It shook me. But I adapted—reduced my time on social media, focused on weak spots, and reminded myself why I began.”Currently in Class 11, Rudra is focused on the PCM stream, but his ambitions are far broader than just cracking an entrance exam. Whether it’s working with ISRO again, continuing his writing, or influencing youth policies, Rudra sees learning as a lifelong journey, not a series of marksheets.And as he moves forward, the lesson he leaves behind is a compelling one—you don’t need long hours, you need deep intent.In an age where academic excellence is too often equated with burnout, Thakur Rudra Pratap Singh stands as proof that with purpose, even two hours a day is enough to chase the stars—and catch them.",Rudra Pratap Singh secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams.

Made in India 5th-gen fighter jet: Government clears indigenous stealth fighter jet project as China arms Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/made-in-india-5th-gen-fighter-jet-india-clears-indigenous-stealth-fighter-jet-project-as-china-arms-pakistan/articleshow/121442084.cms,"Pakistan's JF17 Aircraft Runs Into Russia Trouble? India Seeks 'Friend' Putin's Help | Report

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday green-lighted the 'Made in India' fighter jet programme to produce a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities to bolster its air power.The AMCA, along with the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), is expected to form the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the coming decades.""In a significant push towards enhancing India's indigenous defence capabilities and fostering a robust domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) Programme Execution Model,"" the ministry of defence said.The ministry added that private sector companies are invited to participate in the project.""They can bid either independently or as a joint venture or as consortia. The entity/bidder should be an Indian company compliant with the laws and regulations of the country,"" the ministry said in a statement.The development also comes amid heightened tensions with Pakistan following Operation Sindoor which claimed over 100 terrorists.The government has focused on enhancing India’s air power, especially in light of China's rapid advancements in the domain.Meanwhile, China now accounts for over 80% of Pakistan's arms imports.A recent US intelligence report claimed that Pakistan is the ""primary recipient"" of China’s economic and military generosity and foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan's armed forces are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China.""Foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programs are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transshipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. However, terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers who support China Pakistan Economic Corridor projects has emerged as a point of friction between the countries; seven Chinese nationals were killed in Pakistan in 2024,"" it added.Also read: Why India is fighting a Pakistan armed by China ""Pakistan primarily is a recipient of China’s economic and military largesse, and Pakistani forces conduct multiple combined military exercises every year with China’s PLA, including a new air exercise completed in November 2024,"" the report said.Last year, the Cabinet Committee on Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, granted in-principle approval to the AMCA programme. The indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet project is expected to play a pivotal role in strengthening the IAF’s combat capabilities.The estimated development cost of the AMCA project stands at approximately Rs 15,000 crore.The IAF has long advocated for the AMCA programme, given its long-term strategic requirements and the absence of a fifth-generation fighter jet in its current fleet. In contrast, China has already inducted its Chengdu J-20 jets, which it claims to be fifth-generation air superiority fighters with precision strike capabilities.India’s confidence in the AMCA initiative received a major boost following the successful development of the LCA Tejas.Developed by state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Tejas has proven to be a capable platform for air combat and offensive missions, with secondary roles in reconnaissance and anti-ship operations.Meanwhile, the IAF is also in the process of acquiring 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) to enhance its operational readiness. In April 2019, the IAF issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the procurement, estimated at around USD 18 billion. The MRFA deal is considered one of the largest military procurement programmes globally in recent years.","India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet.

Bombay high court halts Mumbai airport's bid to replace Turkey's Celebi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-high-court-halts-mumbai-airports-bid-to-replace-turkeys-celebi/articleshow/121414031.cms,"File photo (ANI)

NEW DELHI: In a temporary reprieve for Turkish aviation firm Celebi, the Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services at the city's international airport.The interim order was passed by Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan, who said that no conclusive steps should be taken on the tenders until Celebi’s petitions are heard after the court’s summer recess in June, reported news agency PTI.The legal dispute stems from the recent revocation of security clearance for Celebi Airport Services India, a subsidiary of Turkey-based Celebi, by India’s Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). The security clearance was rescinded earlier this month, citing national security concerns, prompting airports across the country to terminate contracts with Celebi’s Indian affiliates.The move followed diplomatic tensions after Turkey expressed support for Pakistan during India’s Operation Sindoor, a military offensive conducted in response to cross-border terrorism. In the aftermath, Celebi’s Indian operations, including those at key airports like Mumbai and Delhi, came under scrutiny.In Mumbai, Celebi Nas Airport Services India, which handles bridge and ground services, filed three separate petitions challenging both the BCAS's decision and MIAL’s termination of contracts. The company contended that the government’s actions were arbitrary and legally unsustainable. Celebi holds a 59 per cent stake in the joint venture operating at the Mumbai airport.The petitions request the high court to annul the BCAS’s order cancelling its security clearance and to reverse MIAL’s termination of key agreements, including the Bridge Mounted Equipment Service Agreement, Ground Handling Services contract, and the Concession Agreement. The firm also asked the court to suspend the tender process initiated by MIAL on May 17 for selecting a replacement agency.Meanwhile, two other group companies, Celebi Airport Services India and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India, have approached the Delhi high court seeking similar relief following cancellation of their airport contracts in the capital.","The Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday strongly criticised the Uttar Pradesh government for intervening in a private legal dispute over the management of the iconic Shri Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan, accusing it of “hijacking” the case.A bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma questioned the state’s involvement, stating, “If states start entering private disputes, it will lead to a breakdown of the rule of law. You can’t hijack litigation between private parties.”The court was hearing a plea seeking modification of its earlier order that cleared the way for the UP government’s temple redevelopment plan.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , representing petitioner Devendra Nath Gooswami, argued that Rs 300 crore was allocated to the state for the project without making his client, linked to the temple’s original founders, a party to the case, news agency PTI reported.“How can earnings of a private temple be handed over to the state through an order in an unrelated petition?” Sibal questioned.In response, the state's counsel said the government had created a trust to oversee the redevelopment and manage temple affairs, and that the funds would vest with the trust, not the government—under a specific ordinance.The bench directed the state to share a copy of the ordinance with the petitioner and asked the relevant principal secretary to file an affidavit by July 29.Earlier on May 15, the court had allowed the state to use temple funds for purchasing five acres of land around the shrine to develop facilities such as parking, toilets, and accommodation for devotees.However, on May 19, Gooswami—who claims to be a direct descendant of temple founder Swami Haridas Goswami—challenged the redevelopment plan, arguing it was unfeasible without consultation with those historically involved in the temple’s functioning. He warned it could disrupt the temple’s religious and cultural fabric.The Supreme Court’s earlier ruling had modified a November 2023 Allahabad High Court order that accepted the state’s development plan but barred use of temple funds.","The court was hearing a plea seeking modification of its earlier order that cleared the way for the UP government’s temple redevelopment plan.

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that the mere recovery of a weapon or bloodstains on an accused's clothes is not enough to prove guilt in a murder case. Emphasising the need for substantive evidence, the court held that such findings, without direct links to the crime, cannot establish that the accused committed the offence.The HC passed these orders while overturning death sentences of two persons convicted in the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman eight years ago in Haryana's Sonipat district.According to the prosecution, on May 9, 2017, the accused abducted the victim in a car, raped her and then murdered her. The teenager's mutilated body was recovered in Rohtak on May 11, with as many as 15 injuries. Her mother alleged that accused Sumit had kidnapped her daughter.Following her statement, the accused were arrested and Sumit confessed to the police that he and his friend, Vikas Yadav, had committed the offence, the prosecution had claimed On Dec 19, 2022, Sonipat district court convicted and awarded death sentence to both appellants, who then challenged the capital punishment before the HC.Acquitting the accused of murder charges, the HC pointed out serious gaps and procedural lapses in collection and handling of DNA evidence sent to Forensic Science Laboratory in Karnal.A division bench of justices Gurvinder Singh Gill and Jasjit Singh Bedi passed these orders while allowing the appeal filed by the accused. Their counsel, Jasdev Singh Mehandiratta contended that the case was based on circumstantial evidence and the chain of circumstantial evidence was not complete to warrant conviction.""We are conscious of the heinous nature of the offence but at the same time, the prosecution must establish its case beyond reasonable doubt which it has been unable to do.

KOLKATA: Pet owners must ensure their animals do not harm others, Calcutta high court has said in a recent order, turning down a man's plea to quash a criminal case pertaining to a dog attack on a neighbour.""The potential gravity of a dog attack on a human, capable of causing serious injury or even posing a threat to life, cannot be overstated. Therefore, a pet owner is undeniably duty-bound to exercise a certain degree of care and take sufficient steps to prevent their pet from causing harm,"" Justice Uday Kumar said in his order on May 23.The pet owner from Sonarpur, on Kolkata's outskirts, was charged under Section 289 of IPC, pertaining to ""negligent conduct with respect to animals"". This followed a complaint from the neighbour alleging he was attacked by 10-12 of the man's pet dogs on the terrace of their apartment building in 2022, leading to injuries.In his HC plea, the pet owner said the charges were based on ""falsehood and inaccuracies"". He claimed he had only one dog and that a medical report of the complainant mentioned there was ""no obvious external injury"".But Justice Kumar cited IPC Section 289 to say it imposed a ""duty on the owner or possessor of an animal"" to take adequate measures to prevent any probable danger to human life or grievous hurt to others.The judge pointed out that the section specifically uses the words ""knowingly or negligently omits"", emphasising either actual knowledge of the animal's harmful propensity or a lack of due care in its management.While the police chargesheet mentioned that ""10-12 dogs"" belonged to the accused, the pet owner disputed it, highlighting the absence of documentary and photographic evidence. Justice Kumar held that the accused could highlight these lapses during trial, adding the HC could not assume ""the role of a fact-finding authority"".""Even if the injury was not externally obvious, being attacked by 10-12 dogs and falling on a roof could potentially lead to internal injuries, non-visible bruises, or psychological trauma. Furthermore, the complaint highlights a broader concern regarding the practice of keeping 'many dogs...unchained on the roof of a housing (complex)', which, if true, could indeed pose a threat to human life, regardless of immediate physical injury,"" the judge observed.","Calcutta high court turns down a man's plea to quash a criminal case pertaining to a dog attack on a neighbour.

NEW DELHI: The Northeast is a geostrategic asset and not a liability, Union minister Jyotiraditya M Scindia said on Tuesday, highlighting that the region, which shares borders with five countries, is perfectly placed to serve as India's gateway to Southeast Asia and even Central Asia.Towards this, he said, Guwahati and Agartala are being developed as international aviation hubs as they are within 2-3 hours flying radius of major Southeast Asian capitals like Singapore and Bangkok, making them ideal transit points for trade and travel.""We're making significant progress on the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway, which is 70% complete, with around 200 km of work remaining on our end. The Kaladan Multimodal Transit Project is advancing steadily. This will connect Sittwe Port in Myanmar to India via waterways and roadways, with just 60 km of road pending between Manipur and Myanmar,"" the minister for development of north eastern region told TOI.These efforts aren't just about infrastructure, they're about transforming trade, mobility and economic integration, he said.He went on to add that with Asean trade valued at Rs 125 billion, the Northeast is poised to become a critical hub for international commerce.Outlining the strategy to convert MoUs into active projects post the Rising Northeast Investment Summit, Scindia said, ""Over 11 months, we've taken concrete steps to transform the Northeast. The PM's vision has led to over 800 ministerial visits and Rs 6.7 lakh crore in fiscal support. """"We've added 6,000 km highways and 1,900 km new railway lines. Now, the focus is on translating Rs 4.32 lakh crore in investment intentions into on-ground realities. Each investor and proposal will be tracked fortnightly with state govts. We've also established investment promotion agencies in all eight (northeastern) states to facilitate and handhold investors, helping convert MoUs into active projects,"" he said.","The Northeast is a geostrategic asset and not a liability, Union minister Jyotiraditya M Scindia said.

Rs 15 crore debt pushed Praveen into deep distress

PANCHKULA: Six members of a family were found dead inside a parked car late Monday night in Sector 27 of Haryana's Panchkula, while a seventh died hours later in a hospital. Police said Praveen Mittal, 42, a debt-ridden businessman, left suicide notes taking full responsibility for the deaths.Bodies of Praveen's wife Reena (40), parents Deshraj and Bimla (60+), son Hardik (13), and twin daughters Dilasha and Dhruvita (11) were discovered by residents after the family allegedly took poison in a car. Praveen, found semi-conscious outside the car, told a bystander before collapsing: ""We are in debt... no relative helped us."" He died in hospital. Police are treating the deaths as a case of mass suicide, pending toxicology confirmation.ACP Vikram Nehra said cops found two suicide notes, allegedly written by Praveen, saying he had gone bankrupt & preferred his cousin in Ludhiana to perform last rites.A sodium nitrate-based chemical, empty water bottles, and a soft drink were found in the vehicle. Lab results are pending.Praveen, originally from Hisar's Barwala, had suffered repeated financial failures - from a shuttered scrap unit in Baddi to a collapsed tour and travel business in Dehradun.Loans totalling around Rs 12-15 crore had pushed him into deep distress, relatives said. He also worked with an NGO and later became a driver in Panchkula.According to Dehradun police, Praveen lived in Kaulagarh for four years before shifting to Chandigarh seven months ago. He had borrowed a car from Gambhir Singh Negi, who said he financed the vehicle in his own name at Mittal's request, with the latter promising to pay EMIs.Neighbours and locals were shocked. ""The girls were very cute. They used to walk in the park,"" said Manish Chaudhary, who rented a two-room set in Saketri to the family for Rs 8,000 a month. ""He told me Monday morning they were going out of station for three days.""Police said the family had attended a Bageshwar Dham gathering earlier that day in Sector 5 and were seen parked in the area by locals, who initially assumed they were resting due to lack of hotel accommodation.Relatives described Praveen as withdrawn and financially burdened. Cousin Ankit Mittal recalled long stretches without contact and multiple failed attempts at business recovery. Praveen's ties with in-laws were strained, leading him to exclude his father-in-law from last rites in his final note.Praveen's brother Jitender, a garment trader in Panchkula, is assisting police with the investigation.Sociologist and former Panjab University professor Rajesh Gill called the tragedy a reflection of societal isolation. ""There's no support system now - no extended family, no neighbourhood to fall back on,"" she said. ""Adults may struggle, but for children, suicide is unimaginable unless they were unaware.""(Inputs from Dehradun)","Seven members of a family from Dehradun allegedly consumed poison and died in a car.

Denied the audience, they said they will protest against the 'injustice'.

After the counselling, candidates are made to sign an undertaking that the option they choose is final and they will not ask for a change in the future.""According to my ranking and the vacancy list, I opted for RG Kar during counselling.Now, when the final list has come, I find that I have been posted to Raiganj Medical College.

NEW DELHI: India has finalised a new 'programme execution model' for the indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), under which private firms can also bid for the project along with defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The new model approved by defence minister Rajnath Singh, which aims to accelerate prototype development and induction of the AMCA through a 'robust' domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, marks a radical departure from the country's long-standing policy of fighter production being solely the preserve of HAL.The defence ministry expects HAL, which has been facing major flak for the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1A jets, to bid for the AMCA project in partnership with one or more private players, officials told TOI.The defence PSU, after all, ""already has its hands full"" with the planned production of 180 Tejas Mark-1A jets for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore, which is slated to be followed by another 108 4.5-generation Tejas Mark-2 jets, apart from several other aircraft and helicopter projects.""Private companies can also bid for the AMCA project independently, or in a joint venture with a foreign OEM (original equipment manufacturer), or as a consortium.It provides equal opportunities to both private and public sectors on a competitive basis. The bidder, of course, should be an Indian company compliant with domestic laws and regulations,"" an official said.""It's an important step towards harnessing indigenous expertise, capability and capacity to produce the twin-engine AMCA prototype. There will be a competition. It will not be handed over to HAL on a nomination basis,"" he added.Towards this end, the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) of DRDO, which is entrusted with designing and developing the 25-tonne AMCA, will soon issue an expression of interest (EoI) for its development phase through industry partnership.The move to accelerate the AMCA project comes at a time when Pakistan is on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation jets from China, which is now even flaunting sixth-generation prototypes with tailless airframes like Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50.The IAF, meanwhile, is grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five AMCA prototypes, along with a structural test specimen, extensive flight testing and certification, by ADA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore.As per existing timelines, the AMCA with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and 'serpentine air-intake' will be ready for production only by 2035.The IAF plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like.While the first two AMCA squadrons will be powered by the American GE-F414 engines in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 Kilonewton engines.HAL and General Electric are conducting techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the GE-F414 engines in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion.","India has finalised a new 'programme execution model' for the indigenous fifth- generation stealth fighter.

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh HC has ordered an FIR under the Pocso Act against a man who filed a habeas corpus petition to find his ""missing"" minor daughter. When she was produced in court, however, she refused to go back to her father, accusing him of ""sexual advances"", and said she would rather live with her female friend with whom she had run away from home.The bench of Justice Atul Shreedharan and Justice Anuradha Shukla, in a recent order, sent the 17-year-old to Nari Niketan till she turns an adult. The court, however, said that the girl may have accused her father out of vendetta so police should not arrest him until necessary.The girl went missing in April.

KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee rolled out on Tuesday the roadmap for filling up the 24,203 school positions left empty after the Calcutta HC's and Supreme Court's SSC rulings and also announced the creation of 20,000 extra jobs in schools.The process will start on May 30 (a day before SC's May 31 deadline) with a recruitment advertisement and will end with counselling (to start Nov 20). This is the Mamata Banerjee administration's biggest school recruitment drive till date.""Besides the 24,203 vacant posts, additional vacancies have been created to recruit 11,517 teachers for Classes IX and X, 6,912 vacant posts have been created for teachers for Classes XI and XII, and 1,571 vacancies have been created for Group C and Group D posts. The total vacancies are 44,203,"" Banerjee said.""There are many cases where age limit will be an issue,"" CM said, factoring in the nine-year lag for the 2016 School Service Commission panel. ""Age relaxation will be offered so that everyone can appear for the test. We will also give an advantage to those with work experience,"" CM said, which may work to the advantage of teachers who lost their jobs following court rulings.Banerjee's announcement also kept in mind those asked by SC to return their salaries and face immediate job loss: ""A separate notification will made in the first week of June for those Group C and Group D staffers who have lost jobs or been asked to return money so that they can opt to join three-four other departments. There will be a separate notification for this.""The state did not want to fall foul of SC's May 31 deadline despite having filed a review petition against the order, Banerjee emphasised. ""We did not act till now because we thought the review petition might lead to a favourable outcome. But we need to meet the May 31 deadline. Both processes (the new recruitment drive and the challenge to the SC order) will continue. Later, if the review petition yields results, we will accept that. Both options are open. We are doing this to ensure that there is no non-compliance with SC directives,"" Banerjee explained.Banerjee, directly appealing to the protesting SSC teachers, said: ""Take the exam. Continue going to your school. You will receive your salary till the year-end. Protect your right to return with dignity. Opportunities will come. Some 26,000 teachers will have problems if I do not comply with the court's order. You have to wait for the review. Saying you will not take the exam will not work; you will not have a job. This is not our directive, it is SC's order. """"We will register your review petition again after SC's summer break. We have kept time for this. Our lawyers will fight to the best of their ability. The verdict is not in my hands; it is in the court's hand,"" she added.""I will try my best. Why are you afraid? Those who are over 40 will be given an age-limit exemption. We were here, we are here, and we will remain here,"" the CM said.Banerjee also took a jab at the opposition. ""We did not take your jobs. Those who took away your jobs are now trying to be your friends. Some 10,000 teachers' jobswere cancelled in Tripura and they did not get their jobs back despite promises. Some 69,000 teachers lost their jobs in UP. Panels have been cancelled in other states as well. So many have died in the Vyapam scam and there has been no justice,"" she reminded the protesting teachers.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced the roadmap for filling up the 24,203 school positions left empty after the Calcutta HC's and Supreme Court's SSC rulings.

These include studying ‘water bears’ — micro animals — to understand how living things adapt to microgravity. According to Isro, the experience will nurture a microgravity research ecosystem back home, leading to the induction of advanced experiments that make up India’s space programme.Experience from the ISS mission will give momentum to India’s first human spaceflight programme ‘Gaganyaan’ and also future manned missions to space.","Indian astronaut-designate Shubhanshu Shukla and three other crew members are headed into quarantine.

Indian players Prkaash Sarran and Tavish Pahwa clinched their respective singles matches via super tie-breaks to seal the win.However, controversy erupted three days later when a video from the match surfaced online. It showed a Pakistani player engaging in an unsportsmanlike handshake with his Indian counterpart.After initially missing the handshake, the Pakistani player made contact the second time, only to pull away abruptly in a seemingly disrespectful manner.The Indian player, however, stayed calm and unflustered, showing remarkable composure.This incident came amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that left 26 people—mostly tourists—dead. In retaliation, India launched precision airstrikes on May 7, targeting nine terror camps linked to groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and POK, reportedly killing over 100 militants.While India described the strikes as “measured and focused,” Pakistan responded with drone attacks on Indian military installations near the border, triggering a counter-response from India.After three days of cross-border hostilities, both nations agreed to cease fire on May 10.","India secured a commanding 2-0 victory over Pakistan in the Junior Davis Cup (U-16) on May 24 in Shymkent, Kazakhstan.

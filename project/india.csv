NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday shared cheetah photos to mark International Cheetah Day, calling the animal “one of the most remarkable creatures” on the planet and reaffirming the government’s commitment to its protection.In a post on X, the Prime Minister said Project Cheetah, launched three years ago, was aimed at safeguarding the species and rebuilding the ecosystem in which it can thrive. He described the initiative as an effort to revive India’s lost ecological heritage and strengthen biodiversity. PM Modi also shared photographs of the majestic animal along with his message.“On International Cheetah Day, my best wishes to all wildlife lovers and conservationists dedicated to protecting the cheetah, one of our planet’s most remarkable creatures. Three years ago, our Government launched Project Cheetah with the aim of safeguarding this magnificent animal and restoring the ecosystem in which it can truly flourish. It was also an effort to revive lost ecological heritage and strengthen our biodiversity,” PM Modi wrote.The translocation programme that brought cheetahs from Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana to Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh is considered one of India’s most ambitious wildlife conservation projects.Project Cheetah, rolled out in 2022 to reintroduce the species seven decades after it went extinct due to excessive and reckless hunting, aims to restore a lost ecological niche.To mark International Cheetah Day on Thursday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav is scheduled to release three cheetahs currently kept in enclosures at Kuno into the wild, officials said on Wednesday.The project is being implemented by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in collaboration with the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department and the Wildlife Institute of India.(With inputs from agencies)",Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday shared cheetah photos to mark International Cheetah Day.

"India’s hospital capacity still far below global norm; Doctor ratio at 1:811, government admits in Parliament",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-hospital-capacity-still-far-below-global-norm-doctor-ratio-at-1811-government-admits-in-parliament/articleshow/125757578.cms,"Representative image (Photo credit: AP)

NEW DELHI: India continues to fall short of basic global healthcare capacity standards, the Union Health Ministry told Parliament, acknowledging that the country remains well below the WHO benchmark for hospital beds even as patient load keeps rising nationwide.Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Health Prataprao Jadhav said that while IPHS 2022 mandates at least 1 bed per 1,000 people, several states still cannot meet even this minimum requirement — and remain far from the WHO norm of 3.5 beds per 1,000 population. State-wise data published in the government’s annual Rural Health Statistics and the latest Health Dynamics of India report shows large disparities, with populous states carrying some of the deepest deficits.On staffing, Jadhav said India has 13.86 lakh registered allopathic doctors and 7.51 lakh AYUSH practitioners; assuming 80% availability, the doctor–population ratio stands at 1:811. The nursing workforce has reached 42.94 lakh, with 5,253 institutions producing nearly 3.87 lakh nurses annually, yet significant vacancies remain across government hospitals.Despite a decade of expansion — medical colleges rising from 387 to 818, MBBS seats from 51,348 to 1,28,875, and postgraduate seats from 31,185 to 82,059 — many states continue to struggle with shortages of doctors, nurses and paramedics on the ground.The government has set up State Cancer Institutes, Tertiary Cancer Centres and oncology services in all new AIIMS campuses, but Jadhav admitted that India’s public-health capacity remains uneven, with rural districts and smaller states still far from meeting IPHS norms.He said filling vacancies, strengthening district and CHC infrastructure, and ensuring states comply with national standards will be critical as India works to close one of the world’s largest healthcare infrastructure gaps.","India continues to fall short of basic global healthcare capacity standards, the Union Health Ministry told Parliament.

Airline's statement on resolving crisis

IndiGo's statement addressing the recent disruptions in flight operation across India

Regulator DGCA has launches probe

Crew shortage

Regulatory change in crew rostering rules

Operational issues, compounding troubles

On-time performance plunged

Huge backlog: cancellations even in November, before the current crisis

IndiGo, one of the country's leading airlines, is currently grappling with significant operational disruptions, leading to widespread flight cancellations and delays across major cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.The airline has attributed these disruptions to a combination of factors, including technology glitches, schedule changes, and a shortage of crew due to updated regulatory requirements on crew rostering.The situation has resulted in mounting frustration among passengers, many of whom have been left stranded at airports with little prior notice of changes to their travel plans.In response, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has launched a probe into the airline's operations, seeking explanations and a concrete mitigation plan to address the ongoing issues.Here are the 10 things to know about the massive flight disruptions at several airports:Multiple major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad, were hit by a fresh wave of IndiGo flight cancellations as disruptions continued.On Wednesday, in Hyderabad alone, more than 40 arrivals and departures were cancelled, while in Kolkata, the airline scrapped both legs of at least 10 flights.Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru also saw over 42 IndiGo arrivals and departures cancelled, leaving several passengers stranded and adding to widespread frustration among flyers.Passengers from major cities hit by the disruption have been venting their anger over a wave of delays and cancellations, with many saying they received little or no prior intimation about changes to their flights.Several flyers have described being stuck at airports for hours with families, missing important meetings and onward connections as departure times were repeatedly pushed back or flights abruptly scrapped.IndiGo spokesperson issued a formal statement acknowledging the severe disruption caused to operations at major airports. The airline said its network had experienced significant operational irregularities over the past two days arising from multiple contributing factors.""We acknowledge that IndiGo’s operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience caused,"" said the statement released on Wednesday.The airline assured passengers that it has put measures in place to restore normal operations at the earliest. However, it also cautioned that disruptions are likely to persist for up to the next 48 hours.""To contain the disruption and restore stability, we have initiated calibrated adjustments to our schedules. These measures will remain in place for the next 48 hours and will allow us to normalize our operations and progressively recover our punctuality across the network,"" they said, ""Our teams are working around the clock to ease customer discomfort and ensure operations stabilize as quickly as possible.""Aviation watchdog DGCA has launched a probe into IndiGo’s ongoing flight disruptions and asked the airline to explain the causes of the current chaos as well as detail its plans to curb cancellations and delays. The regulator has also sought a concrete mitigation plan from the airline after days of disorder at multiple airports.""IndiGo has been asked to report to DGCA, Headquarters, to present the facts leading to the current situation, along with plans to mitigate the ongoing delays & cancellations,"" it said in a statement.As per the data released by ministry of civil aviation, IndiGo provided the summary of its recent operational performance.Crew shortage was also cited by the airlines as the reason behind their grappling with the disruptions. ""Implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,"" said IndiGo spokesperson in a statement.The airline also issued an explanation regarding FDTL, which is majorly affecting the crew operations. They pointed out that stricter rest and duty-hour requirements have significantly reduced crew availability at short notice, forcing the airline to cancel or reschedule flights whenever reserve pilots or cabin crew cannot be rostered within the new limits.Along with crew-related challenges, IndiGo also pointed to a range of other operational factors that together snowballed into the current disruption.""Minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and the implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,"" IndiGo spokesperson said in a statement.IndiGo reported that it cancelled 1,232 flights during the period, attributing a significant portion of these disruptions to crew and Flight Duty Time Limit (FDTL) compliance issues, as well as airport, airspace and air traffic control constraints that are often outside an airline’s direct control.The carrier’s on-time performance also took a hit, slipping to 67.70 per cent in November compared with 84.1 per cent in October.The performance report by the airlines highlights that in November alone, IndiGo cancelled 1,232 flights, many due to crew/FDTL constraints. The airline, which operates more than 2,200 flights a day, recorded a punctuality rate of just 35 percent on December 2, according to data from the Ministry of Civil Aviation.DGCA has summoned IndiGo to its headquarters to explain the factors behind the ongoing disruption and to outline concrete measures to address the continuing wave of delays and cancellations.","Multiple major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad, were hit by a fresh wave of IndiGo flight cancellations as disruptions continued. The airline has attributed these disruptions to a combination of factors, including technology glitches, schedule changes, and a shortage of crew.

Country’s first blind Army officer in active service shoots to national award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/countrys-first-blind-army-officer-in-active-service-shoots-to-national-award/articleshow/125755670.cms,"President Droupadi Murmu presents Lt Col C Dwarakesh with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities on Wednesday





PUNE: A basketball match at a military station in 2014 was one of the last things Lt Col C Dwarakesh saw before an accident left him blind. He would spend the next eight months in hospital, healing and adjusting to life without eyesight while his mind envisioned new possibilities.On Wednesday, President Droupadi Murmu presented the 36-year-old with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities, recognising an Army career that even disability couldn’t cut short, and one that now includes a world record in para shooting.Lt Col Dwarakesh is the first officer of the Indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness. It’s an achievement made possible by the derring-do of a young officer who never gave up on himself despite no precedent.“As an Army officer, I was trained to have conviction, courage, willpower and tenacity. But blindness is an impediment I couldn’t have prepared for,” Lt Col Dwarakesh told TOI from Delhi. “I overcame this hurdle through academics and technology, clearing multiple competitive exams along the way. I now research para sports, especially for people living with blindness. I converted my disability into a power and found ways to express the way those with vision do.This mindset has helped me reach new heights.”Supported by AI tools and assistive technology, Dwarakesh performs his responsibilities with the same proficiency and precision as his colleagues. In paralympic sports, he is a national champion in swimming and shooting, ranked world No. 3 in the 10m air rifle event. His most recent achievement was a world record score of 624.6 at the Shooting World Cup in the UAE this Oct. As part of the Indian para shooting team, he trains at Army Marksmanship Unit in Mahou.Dwarakesh, who joined the Army in 2009, terms the national award a “full-circle moment”. “I remember being granted commission by the President,” he said. “And to be receiving an award from the President 16 years later for something that redefined me, that’s quite something.”The officer, a native of TN, has also qualified for the UGC NET, making him one of the few visually impaired academicians in management, human resources, labour law, and sports research.","Lt Col C Dwarakesh is the first officer of the Indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness.

CHANDIGARH: “The very essence of a welfare state is compromised when the instrumentalities of the state become a source of protracted litigation,” Punjab and Haryana HC observed recently, while reprimanding Punjab govt for its apathy in not absorbing a former worker of Anandpur Sahib Hydel Project for over three decades.Justice Harpreet Singh Brar ordered the state govt to pay within three months Rs 5 lakh compensation to the petitioner, nearly 80 now, noting that: “The state shoulders the profound responsibility of fostering justice and equity; it should be a catalyst for the resolution of disputes, not the cause of their proliferation.”Pulling up the state for ignoring binding directions issued in 1989 in an SC judgment in the ‘Mehanga Ram and others versus State of Punjab’ case and reaffirmed through Punjab advocate general’s 1995 undertaking before apex court, HC said forcing similarly situated employees to repeatedly litigate for identical relief was “the very definition of arbitrariness” barred under Constitution. “The principle that the state must act as a ‘model employer’ is not a mere platitude but a constitutional mandate that informs its dealings with its employees,” HC observed.","Punjab and Haryana HC reprimanded Punjab govt for its apathy in not absorbing a former worker of Anandpur Sahib Hydel Project.

NAGPUR: A 35-year-old woman and her 17-year-old son, while trying to fight off an alleged rape bid on the mother, ended up killing a contractor at the construction site where they were working in June. While the mother of four languished in prison, the children’s father, who had supposedly tormented the family for years, allegedly raped the couple’s minor daughters over three months.The horrific abuse came to light in Oct after the couple’s younger son (14) caught the father and sought help from a neighbour, who alerted a group of transgender people living nearby. Members of the transgender community allegedly stormed the accused’s residence, rescued the children, thrashed the father and handed him over to Wathoda Police. Cops arrested the father and booked him under Pocso Act. The survivors — aged between 9 and 12 — were sent to a govt shelter for rehabilitation and counselling.Married off at 14, the woman had fled from Delhi to Nagpur in Dec 2024 with her kids to escape years of domestic violence. Hoping for a fresh start, she and her elder son began working at a construction site in Kuhi area in June, police said.On the eighth day, the labour contractor allegedly dragged the woman to an isolated spot and tried to rape her. As she fought back, her son rushed to her aid. In the scuffle, the contractor was seriously injured and died later.The panic-stricken duo fled the scene but were caught. The woman was sent to Nagpur Central Jail while her son was shifted to an observation home for juvenile offenders.","A 35-year-old woman and her 17- year-old son, while trying to fight off an alleged rape bid on the mother, ended up killing a contractor at the construction site where they were working.

"SC finds way to let lawyer add to earnings, pay maintenance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-finds-way-to-let-lawyer-add-to-earnings-pay-maintenance/articleshow/125755609.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday came up with a unique solution to allow an advocate to pay for the maintenance of his son from his first marriage after the man expressed his inability to do so, citing his second marriage and limited income.The apex court directed that the advocate be assigned two or three cases a month by Supreme Court Legal Services Committee, which provides free legal assistance to poor litigants — an assignment that would help him earn an extra Rs 10,000 every month.The Muslim advocate had divorced his first wife with whom he had a son and married another woman with whom he had another child. The first wife moved Supreme Court challenging the mode of execution of triple talaq and claimed maintenance for her child.Appearing for the divorced woman, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed told a bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant she was not contesting his second marriage, though annulment of the first marriage was illegal under Sharia. “She is an educated woman. For the past 36 months, he has not paid a penny towards the maintenance of his son,” Ahmed said.When the bench asked the man to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 10,000 in the interim, the man, through senior advocate M R Shamshad, said he was working as a junior in a lawyer’s chamber and got just Rs 21,000 as monthly remuneration.“He has a wife and a child from the second marriage. Paying Rs 10,000... would ruin his household,” Shamshad said.CJI Kant then asked Shamshad to send the advocate to Supreme Court Legal Services Committee and said he would be assigned two or three cases a month that would earn him Rs 10,000, enabling him to pay maintenance.Ahmed requested SC to consider directing the man to pay a lump-sum amount for the last 36 months. The bench asked the advocate to consider the same and posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 21, when it would also consider petitions by Muslim women challenging the triple talaq custom in Muslim Personal Law and the absence of maintenance provision for women.The women petitioners, many through advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, have challenged Talaq-e-Hasan and all other forms of unilateral and extra-judicial Talaq and sought “framing of guidelines for gender neutral, religion neutral uniform grounds of divorce and uniform procedure of divorce for all citizens”.The SC allowed a plea by advocate Ejaz Maqbool to make Hyderabad-based Sharia Committee for Women a party in the pending petitions. The committee had opposed uniform gender and religion neutral divorce procedure saying it would deprive Muslim women of their right to dissolution of marriage under Muslim Personal Law. It had said every individual shall be held accountable for their actions on the “Day of Judgement” and that concept of divine accountability underscores the balance between rights and responsibilities.","Muslim advocate had divorced his first wife with whom he had a son and married another woman.

Why December still feels special for students

December has finally arrived, bringing with it the stretch students across the country look forward to all year, winter breaks, Christmas celebrations and the gentle slowing down that marks the end of the academic calendar. After a busy November filled with examinations in many states, schools are now shifting into a lighter schedule as temperatures begin to drop and year-end activities take over.Unlike summer holidays, December breaks don’t follow a uniform pattern across India. Each state, and often each school, sets its own calendar depending on the weather and institutional policies. But there is one common trend: the second half of December typically offers the longest cluster of holidays for schoolchildren before the new year begins.Schools across several northern and central states are expected to go on winter break sometime between December 20 and December 24, with most reopening only in the first week of January. This period usually covers Christmas, New Year’s Eve and the coldest days of the season.Even in states without long winter breaks, certain days will be observed as holidays across most schools:Some schools also club these festive holidays with year-end events, annual functions or cultural programmes, adding to the excitement of the month.December is more than just a month of holidays, it marks a much-needed pause in the school year. The weather encourages a slower pace, families plan outings and reunions, and students get a short but meaningful break before the academic race picks up again in January.Even for schools, this period is valuable: campuses use the downtime for repairs, planning sessions and preparations for final-term activities.","Schools across several northern and central states are expected to go on winter break sometime between December 20 and December 24.

Rs 90 to a dollar: What’s driving the fall and why it matters to you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rs-90-to-a-dollar-whats-driving-the-fall-and-why-it-matters-to-you-explained/articleshow/125734691.cms,"The rupee's fall past 90 is more than a number-it’s a marker of a new phase in India’s economic story.

Driving the news

Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike

Why it matters

Your next iPhone, fridge, or car? Costlier.

Zoom in: Why did the rupee drop?

Three main reasons:

Trade tensions with the US:

Investor exodus:

Policy shift at the RBI:

The big picture: What makes this different from earlier rupee crises?

Dollar vs Rupee History

What they’re saying

Between the lines: Life is already getting more expensive

Oil & energy:

Electronics & appliances:

Everyday inflation:

Zoom in: Families, students, and borrowers are hurting

For students abroad:

Education loans hurt more:

Borrowers and consumers:

What's next: The pressure is widespread

Is this good for exporters?

The textbook answer: Yes. The reality: It's complicated.

Winners: IT and business service firms paid in rupees but billing in dollars see better margins-though many hedge currency exposure, which limits gains.

Mixed bag: Pharma exporters benefit from the exchange rate but are squeezed by global price pressures and rising import costs of raw materials.

Losers: Textile and light manufacturing should win-but US tariffs blunt their advantage.

Silver lining: Remittance recipients are smiling

What Indian families should do now

Match currency of income and loans: If you earn in rupees, avoid dollar loans.

Hedge wisely: For tuition and foreign payments, consider forward contracts or staggered payments to limit exchange rate shocks.

Plan with a cushion: Assume the rupee could drop further. Many consultants now suggest budgeting with Rs 93–95/$ in mind for 2026 plans.

Leverage remittances smartly: Fixed deposits and short-term debt funds offer high real returns right now-worth exploring.

Diversify investments: Global mutual funds or India-focused funds heavy in export sectors (like IT or pharma) may offer better protection.

The bottom line:

(With inputs from agencies)

On Wednesday, the Indian rupee broke a historic barrier, falling below Rs 90 to the US dollar for the first time. Though the drop from Tuesday’s 89.94 may seem minor, the implications aren’t.This milestone isn’t just psychological-it signals a shift in how India’s economy is perceived, managed, and felt by its citizens.The ripple effects stretch far beyond Dalal Street or forex traders. The rupee’s weakness is now hitting the average Indian household - from their fuel bills to EMIs, tuition fees, and travel costs.Micro meets macro: Imports = inflation: India imports 90% of its oil, and also depends on overseas suppliers for electronics, fertilizers, and edible oil. A weak rupee inflates these bills.Foreign education: Students studying abroad could be shelling out Rs 5–10 lakh more annually compared to 2023, especially those paying USD tuition and living costs.Recent trade negotiations failed, and US tariffs on Indian exports-some rising by 50%-hit business confidence hard.Despite steady inflation and GDP growth, foreign investors pulled out $17 billion from Indian equities in 2025, adding pressure on the rupee.The International Monetary Fund reclassified India's exchange rate regime from ""stabilized"" to ""crawl-like."" This suggests the RBI is now guiding, not guarding, the rupee.The dollar isn’t the main villain: In 2022, a strong dollar weakened currencies across the globe. This time, the rupee is down even as the dollar remains steady.India’s war chest is full: The RBI has $690 billion in reserves-unlike the 2013 taper tantrum or the 2018 oil price shock. This creates strategic patience.Philosophy shift at RBI: Instead of fire-fighting, the central bank now aims for long-term resilience. Its goal is no longer to defend Rs 90 at all costs, but to allow natural depreciation based on fundamentals-like inflation differentials and trade shifts.“For now, the central bank may be letting the rupee weaken a little more to make exports more competitive in light of US tariffs,” said David Forrester of Crédit Agricole.Bloomberg dubbed the rupee “Asia’s worst-performing currency this year.”“If they allow the rupee to close above 90, we could see further speculative bets and the possibility of the rupee heading to 91,”Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities, told Bloomberg. The recent slide is “hard to justify on a fundamental basis,” he added.""The weak macro picture in India makes weak currency performance inevitable, there has been a slide in so many data points recently – rising trade deficits, weakening nominal GDP growth, weak FDI and foreigner selling down domestic equities, etc,"" Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors in Singapore, told Reuters.The RBI’s stance? Let it float-for now. With over $690 billion in reserves, India can act if needed, but the central bank prefers gradual adjustment to aggressive defense.The depreciation isn't academic-it’s household.India imports 90% of its crude and over 60% of its edible oils. A weaker rupee makes them costlier.Imported items-laptops, fridges, smartphones-will now come with steeper price tags.Cooking oil, LPG, and petrol will squeeze budgets further, especially for lower- and middle-income households.Tuition at $50,000/year was Rs 40 lakh at ₹80/$, but now it’s Rs 45 lakh. That’s a ₹5 lakh hike-several months’ salary for many middle-class families.A student repaying a dollar loan taken at Rs 80 now owes 12–13% more in rupee terms.A family earning Rs1.5 lakh/month may now have to dip into savings or cut essentials to meet new EMI demands of student loans.Vacations abroad? That $2,000 family trip just went from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 1.8 lakh.Small businesses: Those reliant on imported components or foreign travel now face higher costs and tighter margins.“If your goods hit a tariff wall of 25% or 50%, it’s less helpful,” said one trade economist.India received $137–138 billion in remittances in 2024-more than double any other country.A $500 monthly remittance now brings in Rs 45,000 instead of Rs 40,000.For rural and low-income families, this extra Rs 5,000/month is real uplift-sometimes funding education, healthcare, or property investments.The rupee's fall past 90 is more than a number-it’s a marker of a new phase in India’s economic story.In letting the rupee float, policymakers are betting on long-term gains over short-term defense. But for millions of Indian families, that bet is already affecting daily life, monthly budgets, and multi-year plans.","Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike.

Smriti Mandhana & Palash Muchhal Add Evil Eye Emoji To Bios Amid Cheating Rumours!

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket star Smriti Mandhana and music composer Palash Muchhal continue to dominate headlines, not for their professional achievements but for the emotional rollercoaster surrounding their postponed wedding. The high-profile ceremony, originally scheduled for November 23 in Sangli, was abruptly halted after Smriti’s father, Srinivas Mandhana, suffered a sudden medical emergency and was rushed to hospital. Hours later, Palash too was admitted due to stress-induced health concerns. Both have since recovered, but the families have not announced a new date.On Tuesday, social media went into overdrive after rumours claimed that the couple would now marry on December 7, prompting widespread speculation. However, Smriti’s brother Shravan Mandhana has now firmly shut down the reports.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Shravan addressed the swirling chatter head-on. “I have no idea about these rumours. As of now, it (the wedding) is still postponed,” he said, dismissing the December 7 claims and making it clear that no fresh date has been finalised.The rumour mill intensified after fans noticed that Smriti had deleted all wedding-related posts from her Instagram account following the postponement — though casual photos with Palash remain.With no official communication from either family, the speculative frenzy only grew.Meanwhile, Palash’s mother Amita Muchhal had earlier shared that both families are still recovering from the emotional shock of the disrupted ceremony. She revealed that Palash had dreamt of bringing his bride home and that she had even planned a special welcome. Despite the heartbreak, she expressed optimism: “Everything will be fine, shaadi bohot jaldi hogi.”The situation has also drawn heartfelt support from the cricketing community. Veteran actor Suniel Shetty lauded Jemimah Rodrigues for withdrawing from the WBBL to stand by Smriti, calling it “the purest form of friendship.”","Smriti Mandhana and Palash Muchhal's wedding was postponed on November 23.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma appeared unfazed by the growing chatter around their futures, focusing instead on a demanding net session under the floodlights ahead of India’s second ODI against South Africa on Wednesday.Speculation has intensified over what lies ahead for the senior duo, especially with the road to the ICC ODI World Cup 2027 now part of the discussion.But fresh off back-to-back match-winning performances against Australia and South Africa, neither Kohli nor Rohit showed any signs of easing up during training on Tuesday.Kohli looked sharp and assertive, taking on throw-down experts Raghu (right-arm) and Nuwan Seneviratne (left-arm), who pushed the pace throughout the session. The battle was compelling to watch — Kohli found the middle of the bat repeatedly, though there were moments when Raghu’s extra pace beat him.Head coach Gautam Gambhir stood positioned between the two nets, observing the session closely.When Kohli wrapped up his batting, he rested both bats on his shoulders and walked past Gambhir without exchanging a word — a moment that would not go unnoticed considering the recent narrative surrounding Indian cricket.Rohit, who followed Kohli into the nets and then toward the dressing room shortly after, did pause briefly for a conversation with Gambhir before heading inside.While all eyes naturally gravitated toward the two senior players, training intensity remained high across the nets as India look to clinch the series after taking a 1-0 lead with Sunday's win in Ranchi.With the match to be played on a black-soil surface at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh Stadium, the batting group trained with intent, showcasing aggression from the outset.Yashasvi Jaiswal sent multiple deliveries soaring over the leg side boundary, and even rolled his arm over to bowl to Rishabh Pant — the last batter to take his turn in the nets.The second ODI is scheduled for Wednesday, 3 October. India will be hoping to win and seal the three-match series after taking the opening game.

Putin Plans Big India Reset With More Indian Goods, Deep Strategic Defence Ties In Talks With Modi

NEW DELHI: India and Russia are expected to discuss the joint development of advanced variants of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi beginning Thursday.BrahMos emerged as a pivotal weapon for the Indian armed forces during the recent four-day Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Building on this success, India has identified the need for lighter and more versatile versions, including the BrahMos-NG, which can be fitted across the Indian Air Force’s fighter fleet and strike targets over 400 kilometres away, reported ANI, citing souces.The two sides are also likely to explore work on extended-range BrahMos systems capable of hitting targets at more than three times the missile’s current range. “These discussions are likely to take place between the two sides during the Russian President’s visit,” the sources said.BrahMos remains one of the most successful examples of Indo-Russian defence collaboration, symbolising the long-standing strategic partnership between the two nations. Ahead of the summit, the countries have also been in talks on co-developing next-generation hypersonic and long-range air-to-air missile systems.India is further expected to finalise the procurement of 280 S-400 Sudarshan Chakra air defence missiles, which were successfully deployed against multiple Pakistani targets earlier this year.The Indian armed forces have equipped the Navy and other services extensively with BrahMos missiles. The missile has also been successfully exported to the Philippines, and further sales in the Asian region are expected.With its supersonic speed and precision strike capability, the missile is extremely hard to intercept and has repeatedly demonstrated high accuracy in operational use, including during the May conflict with Pakistan.",BrahMos emerged as a pivotal weapon for the Indian armed forces during the recent four-day Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.

""Derogatory"" BJP Hits Out at Revanth Reddy Over Remarks On Hindu Deities

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Rajkumar Chahar on Wednesday said that the city's iconic Taj Mahal had become a ""curse"". The BJP MP told parliament that development in Agra was slowing due to strict regulations under the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and NGT norms.Speaking in the Lok Sabha during the winter session, he said the Taj Mahal is a global landmark but tight regulations in the area around the monument have become a “curse” for the city. According to him, these rules make it hard for industries to grow and for new jobs to come up.“The beauty of the Taj Mahal has become a curse for the people of Agra. To protect its beauty, rules under the Taj Trapezium Zone, TTZ, and the NGT do not allow industries to be set up in Agra, and because of this, the youth of Agra are left unemployed,” he said.Chahar pointed out Agra’s strong connectivity through major expressways and said the city has the potential to expand if given the right support. He pushed for an IT hub in Agra, saying the city needs development that protects the Taj’s beauty while creating work opportunities for people.Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) is a defined area around the Taj Mahal to protect the monument from pollution. The Supreme Court of India delivered a ruling on December 30, 1996 regarding industries covered under the TTZ, in response to a PIL seeking to protect the Taj Mahal from environmental pollution.","Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) is a defined area around the Taj Mahal to protect the monument from pollution.

Sidda vs DKS: A long rivalry

Kurubas and Vokkaligas are considered rival castes in the state. While Siddaramaiah hails from the Kuruba caste, DKS is from the Vokkaliga community.

Siddaramaiah is quintessentially a politician and is not known for his business ventures. Meanwhile, DKS is one of the richest politicians and has many big business interests.

Shivakumar is known for having friends across different parties in Karnataka. However, Siddaramaiah has soured relationships with BJP and JDS.

Fine-tuned caste arithmetic

Future of Congress

Status quo, Siddaramaiah stays full-term

Mid-term power rotation naming Shivakumar the chief minister

Hybrid compromise — phased transition, date announced publicly

Dark horse

Kharge factor

NEW DELHI: A lot can happen over a cup of coffee. But even after two breakfasts between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar , the question over the chief ministerial post in Karnataka still remains unanswered.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in the state, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.Now, both Siddaramaiah and DKS are looking towards the party high command in Delhi for answers.However, the cleanup task for the party high command is not going to be easy, as this is beyond personalities. The Karnataka tussle contains loyalty, fine-tuned caste arithmetic and the future of Congress in the state.Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar together scripted the victory for Congress in the assembly elections in 2023. While Siddaramaiah's AHINDA (Minorities, backward classes and Dalits) countered Bharatiya Janata Party's Lingayat-Brahmin voter base, Shivakumar was credited for managing the organisational machinery in the party.However, even during the run-up to the elections, the rift between both the leaders was clearly visible. During the campaign, Sidda and DKS were rarely seen together sharing a stage. It was only at the eleventh hour that Karnataka party president Shivakumar met Siddaramaiah to put up a united front and bring supporters of both the leaders together.Despite being the pillars of the party in the state, the leaders are polar opposites.After Congress won in Karnataka, the high command was in a fix over the CM face. After days of deliberation, the party went ahead with Siddaramaiah's name given his seniority and popularity. However, an agreement was reportedly reached that DK Shivakumar would take over the reins in the second half of the government.Recently, DKS confirmed the ""secret deal"" after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.“This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he added.Now after the two and a half years are completed, several seers from the Vokkaliga community are supporting Shivakumar's claim to the chief ministership, emphasising that the community had not held the post since the early 2000s.This has created additional pressure on the party as Vokkaligas have around 13–14 percent share in Karnataka's population, making it the second-most dominant landowning caste after Lingayats.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah, 79 years old, is the tallest Kuruba leader Karnataka has seen. The Kurubas, a significant OBC community forming around 6–7% of the population, have historically lacked an undisputed mass leader until Siddaramaiah built his political philosophy around them.Additionally, Sidda has also built a support base among the AHINDA community, countering the dominance of Lingayats and Vokkaligas.This has added to the dilemma of the high command as picking Sidda would mean sidelining Vokkaligas and going with DKS would mean looking over the AHINDA and Kurubas.Amid the ongoing tussle over the chief ministerial post, the danger of losing majority in the Vidhan Soudha is looming over Congress government's head.There are 23 Vokkaliga MLAs in the grand old party who are supporting DKS. In a scenario where the Congress high command decides to continue with Siddaramaiah as the chief minister, these MLAs who are openly backing DKS can pull out support from the government.Meanwhile, 9 Kuruba MLAs and 34 Lingayat MLAs are supporting Siddaramaiah, making the CM tussle a Catch-22 situation for the high command.With the decision window narrowing, Congress leadership now has three realistic options:This route maintains continuity, protects AHINDA influence, and sends a signal of stability. A cabinet reshuffle may be sanctioned later as compensation to placate those backing Shivakumar.Backers of DKS see this as honouring commitment and preventing factional drift. But replacing a sitting CM at the midpoint could cause internal rupture if not managed delicately.A future-dated swap could satisfy both camps temporarily, provided the timeline is seen as credible and binding. It is the most politically pragmatic formula but only works if both factions stand down simultaneously.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party floated another theory that Congress may ignore both Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar and choose a “dark horse” for the chief ministerial post in the state.Talking to reporters, former Karnataka CM and BJP MP Basavaraj Bommai said that chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DKS are “being inflexible due to their ego,” leading the high command to consider alternative options.“CM and Deputy CM both have a very egoistic attitude. They are not ready to budge an inch. Therefore, the high command is compelled to think of the other alternative. So in this context, a dark horse might emerge in the state,” Bommai said.Amid the ongoing developments in the state, all eyes are now on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge who may be the only one with a solution for this deadlock.Kharge, who also hails from Karnataka, is one of the most seasoned functionaries in the state. First elected to the state assembly in 1972, Kharge won nine consecutive elections until 2008, earning the nickname ‘Solillada Sardara’ (the undefeated chieftain).Acknowledging the power tussle between the CM and his deputy, Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing. But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.","Siddaramaiah hails from the Kuruba caste, DKS is from the Vokkaliga community.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on “humanitarian grounds,” months after the pair had been pushed into Bangladesh.The top court was hearing the Centre’s challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s September 26 order, which struck down the government’s move to deport Sunali Khatun, Sweety Bibi and their families to Bangladesh after labelling them “illegal immigrants.”A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the West Bengal government to look after the minor and instructed the Birbhum district chief medical officer to ensure full medical support for Khatun, including a free delivery.The bench noted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s statement that the competent authority had agreed to allow the woman and her child into India purely on humanitarian grounds, without affecting any rights or claims, and that they would be kept under “surveillance.”This followed the Supreme Court’s December 1 direction asking the Centre to consider permitting their entry, also on the condition that they remain under “surveillance.”The Supreme Court had earlier asked Mehta to seek instructions on permitting Khatun, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, to enter India through the India–Bangladesh border at Malda in West Bengal.The woman’s father said the family had lived as daily-wage workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 26 for more than two decades when police detained them on June 18 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.Sunali, her husband, Danish Sekh and their son were later taken into custody and, on June 27, were deported to Bangladesh.Also read: ‘Night at thana’: Was very scared, couldn’t sleep one bit, says Sunali During the hearing, the bench noted that the woman and her eight-year-old child, allowed to re-enter India, would ultimately be brought back to Delhi, from where they were picked up and pushed across the border in June, as cited by PTI.However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Khatun’s father, urged the court to direct that she be taken instead to her home district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where her family resides. They also informed the bench that others, including Khatun’s husband, remained in Bangladesh and sought directions for their return as well, subject to instructions from the Centre.Mehta maintained that he would challenge their claim of Indian citizenship, insisting the family were Bangladeshi nationals and that the government’s decision to admit the woman and her child was purely on humanitarian grounds.Justice Joymalya Bagchi observed that if Khatun could establish that she is the daughter of Bhodu Sheikh, it would be sufficient to prove her Indian citizenship.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 10.As per a May 2, 2025, memo issued by the union home ministry, Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals found residing illegally in any state or Union territory will first be subject to an inquiry by the respective state or UT government, after which the deportation process will be initiated.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on ""humanitarian grounds"" The top court was hearing the Centre's challenge to the Calcutta High Court's September 26 order, which struck down the government's move to deport them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738725,imgsize-1379982,width-400,resizemode-4/ani-file-photo.jpg"

NEW DLEHI: IndiGo - which flies almost two out of three domestic passengers - is witnessing massive flight delays and some cancellations due to a crippling crew shortage. Govt data shows only 35% IndiGo flights (the airline operates over 2,200 daily) operated on time Tuesday (Dec 2). And on Wednesday, multiple airports including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru reported almost 200 flight cancellations till the afternoon itself.The airline is facing severe pilot shortage ever since the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) norms became applicable last month which lays out more humane rostering for crew. Harried officials across airports said Wednesday that IndiGo delays and cancellations are causing major issues. ""For some flights there was no cabin crew available so they had to be cancelled. The airline is sending crew to different bases to operate flights but the shortage is such that things are out of hand. Who could have ever imagined IndiGo - whose USP is OTP - will drop to 35%, even below Alliance Air and SpiceJet. Flights are getting delayed by anywhere upto 7-8 hours,"" said airport officials.On its part, an IndiGo spokesperson said: “We have had several unavoidable flight delays and some cancellations in the past few days due to various reasons including technology issues, airport congestion, and operational requirements.Our teams are working diligently to ensure that operations normalise as soon as possible. Furthermore, we are offering alternate flight options or refunds to affected customer, as applicable.

Pakistan Sparks Controversy With Expired Relief Claims As India Rejects Airspace Allegation Strongly

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Wednesday landed in Delhi amid the ongoing tussle with Siddaramaiah over the top job in the state.However, he refuted reports that he is visiting Delhi to the Congress high command, saying that he is in the national capital to attend a wedding.""No political agenda.

‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday weighed in on the controversy over colleague Renuka Chowdhury bringing a stray dog to Parliament House, saying pets are not allowed outside the complex but “inside”.“Dog is the main topic of today, I believe. What has the poor dog done. The dog had come here. Why is it not allowed?” Gandhi told reporters, as quoted by PTI.Pointing towards the Parliament House building, he said, “Pets are not allowed here but they are allowed inside.”“I guess these are the things that India is discussing these days,” he added.Gandhi’s comments drew criticism from BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari, who said on X, “Rahul Gandhi is comparing his own Congressmen, and Opposition leaders to Dog! This is how Parivarvadi treat temple of democracy.”Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury on Monday brought a stray dog onto the Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session, despite objections from fellow MPs. Defending her action, she reportedly said that the ""real dogs are sitting in Parliament"" who regularly bite people.Chowdhury later explained that she had found the puppy on her way to Parliament. She said she stopped after witnessing a collision between a scooter and a car, and noticed the puppy by the roadside before deciding to take it with her.","Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury brought a stray dog onto the Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session.

Imagination, image and illusion

AI psychosis

: Access or Abyss

Stepping outside the AI echo chamber

They swear it’s harmless — just curiosity, just another buzz on the phone. But somewhere between the late-night replies and the uncanny comfort of being “heard,” a quiet shift has begun.AI assistants, once designed purely for utility, are slowly becoming mirrors, confidants and emotional anchors.People now talk to chatbots like therapists, partners and best friends, forging bonds that feel sticky, addictive and eerily comforting.Across cities and bedrooms, people are forming strange, sticky bonds with their AI “best friends,” connections far deeper and more private than they’ll ever admit.Somewhere in that quiet space between code and confession, the line between imagination and reality has started to blur.And as this revolution settles into everyday life, one question grows harder to ignore: who’s shaping whom?All those sci-fi movies promised us flying cars, holograms and robot butlers.What we actually received was quieter — and far more invasive.Instead of machines lifting our physical burdens, we have systems that lift, rearrange and sometimes replace our mental loads.What felt miraculous at first now carries a strange psychological aftertaste.Supraja Jayshankaran, the founder and counselling psychologist at Mind Tattva shares how people have been developing an emotional dependency on AI chatbots.“I encounter clients who have been chatting and relying on AI as their partner or therapist. It's so common to see such clients day in and out,” she shares, “The clients have shared that when they are bored, when they are in distress, when they are confused they seek immediate attention and answers from AI, simply because AI apps are now at the tap of your finger and generate close to realistic answers and sometimes comforts them instead of asking them to confront their emotions , thoughts and feelings. ”Whatever lived in your head could appear on your screen with almost no friction. Need a 3,000-word article by midnight? Just describe it. The college assignment that is way past its due date to even panic about? Offload the stress to your AI.Then came the wave of image generation that has not stopped to date. Be it the pioneer Ghibli trend, the nano banana or the Polaroid with your younger self. Simple prompts being actively shared in the public discourse unlocked the universe of visualising oneself in anything the mind could imagine.This is, of course, the Artificial Intelligence revolution.The gap between fascination and visualization reduced when one request made every loved memory become a part of the Ghibli universe.The Nano banana trend followed shortly after. People recreating their pictures as these 3D figurines, making real-life action figures out of themselves.Portraits with one’s younger self built a bridge that had only ever been imagined. The visualization became a quiet, healing conversation.This is what artificial intelligence enables.However, when we look beyond these trends, AI also shows its ability to fabricate convincing false realities. Image generation has become so precise that people now question the authenticity of nearly every picture they encounter online.So how did we travel this far, this fast, and where exactly are we headed?Before attempting an answer, pause for a small experiment. Here are a bunch of images. Try and decode which ones are AI and which ones a real image.How many did you get right? Let’s make it a little easy for you. Every single one of these were AI generated.When everything feels real, nothing seems trustworthy anymore.Somewhere along the way, the word “AI” itself slipped into slang territory, a shorthand for something uncanny, unreal or ‘too perfect to be true.’ Those comments you see online that go, “I showed this to my dad, he says it is AI,” capture the absurdity of it all.The very tool that was supposed to bridge imagination and reality has now become something driving us away from both.With time, the artificial intelligence that distinctly stood out for its distortions began picking up the pace. The technology sharpened, scaled and spread. Just like the boom of social media redefining the idea of persona, sending people to extreme lengths for that picture-perfect life. AI too distorted the realities.Today, people are not just querying chatbots for answers about history or code. They have a companion that can roleplay any conversation. Yashashvi Vasistha shares what made him chat with the AI.“Recently, while planning a trip to Jagannath Puri, I created an itinerary with ChatGPT after doing my own research. But since it was my first time travelling that far, I still felt unsure about whether the plan would actually work,” he said, “To feel more at ease and assured, I asked ChatGPT to advise and guide me as Lord Jagannath. That experience helped me so much that I now do this whenever I prepare an itinerary for an important trip. ”Psychologists explain that artificial intelligence provides the space people seek for holding unfiltered conversations. “AI offers a space where they can be honest without feeling guilty, and be ‘heard’ without the risk of conflict, disappointment, or misunderstanding,” says Supraja, “It's appealing because it's a low‑effort outlet.”Despite the awareness of reality, not all conversations with AI are on this light note. People often rely on AI for their psychological support and diagnosis as well. Jayshankaran shares, “I've seen clients with disorders such as OCD , bipolar and also clients with emotional turmoil take the help of AI to identify symptoms of their condition, seek help from the AI to diagnose and also look into their prognosis.”She says it is becoming increasingly common for people to seek help from AI without really knowing the consequences in the long run for their mental health and overall wellbeing.Recent statistics show that about 70% of teenagers have tried using AI companions, and half of them rely on these bots regularly — for homework help, emotional support, or everyday decisions. Unfortunately, there have already been heartbreaking consequences.A 14-year-old in Florida, emotionally attached to a “Daenerys”-style AI bot, died by suicide. His mother filed a lawsuit against Character.AI.In another case, a 16-year-old from California named Adam Raine reportedly spent months interacting with an AI companion that did not help him through suicidal thoughts, but instead allegedly drafted his farewell note and isolated him from real people; his parents are now suing OpenAI.In a separate incident, a man already fragile after a breakup was told by an AI chatbot that if he “believed hard enough,” he could fly. A suggestion that led him to attempt a 19-story jump after spending around 16 hours a day chatting with it.These cases stand as a stark reminder: while AI companions offer convenience and comfort, they can also have devastating consequences when vulnerable individuals become emotionally dependent on them.Psychologists term it as “AI psychosis.” This is not a clinically diagnosed term, but with growing cases of AI distorting the realities of people, it becomes important to discuss the consequences of relying on artificial intelligence for emotional support.People are not just amused by these chatbots. They are falling for them. They name them, draw them, obsess over them. There is fan art of impossibly attractive AI partners, entire fantasy arcs built around ‘the perfect chatbot boyfriend or girlfriend.’Supraja later goes on to explain the behavioural pattern of these clients looking for a friend in AI. “Many of them have experienced emotional unpredictability or feel they cannot fully express themselves in their real relationships,” she says.AI simply looks like an easy way out for people in distress. They acquire an immediate acceptance for their unfiltered self in AI’s affirming nature. There are past traumas and failures in relationships or tough-to-bear phases that have pushed people away from finding the relationships they long for in humans.“They may have a history of betrayal, inconsistency, or being dismissed when expressing emotions, which makes the AI’s constant presence for them comforting,” Jayshankaran elaborates, “While relying on it masks comfort and emotional relief, it can not equate to the deep need for human connection and the emotional relief and solutions that a psychologist can give.”To what extent can AI fulfill the gap? What happens when the threshold is reached?User Yashasvi shares how after a point the responses become monotonous and lack depth.“In later attempts, the responses were not always as impactful; some felt a bit too AI-like and lacked the emotional connect of the first one,” he explains. “However, I still end up feeling more assured, blessed and confident after receiving these responses.”This goes to show the fact pointed out by the psychologists. AI cannot replace human interventions. It cannot respond with the same empathy or tone of voice as a therapist or a best friend would.“Humans bring texture, warmth, sometimes experiences or first-hand experiences and presence. A real person sitting with you in your pain, your silence, your breakthroughs. A human can challenge you, comfort you, and genuinely care about your well-being in a way no model or machine ever can. That connection heals on many physical, mental levels and emotional levels,” says Supraja.In the end, the story of AI is not just about technology taking over us, it’s about us leading it into our lives.What we are left with is a quiet paradox: a technology powerful enough to simulate connection, yet ultimately incapable of offering the depth, nuance, and imperfection that make real relationships meaningful.AI can soothe, support, and sometimes even surprise. But it cannot sit beside us in our silences, understand our histories, or heal the wounds shaped by human hands.This revolution is reshaping our imaginations, our behaviours, and our emotional landscapes faster than we can fully comprehend.","AI assistants, once designed purely for utility, are slowly becoming mirrors, confidants and emotional anchors.

BJP bags 83% of Rs 915cr routed via Tata Group-controlled trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-bags-83-of-rs-915cr-routed-via-tata-group-controlled-trust/articleshow/125728589.cms,"NEW DELHI: Almost 83% of the total Rs 915 crore political donations routed through the Tata group-controlled Progressive Electoral Trust (PET) in 2024-25 went to BJP, while Congress’ share was a mere 8.4%.A perusal of the contribution reports of various electoral trusts (ET) for 2024-25, now available on the Election Commission website, indicates that the scrapping of electoral bonds by the Supreme Court in Feb 2024 may not have totally dried up the coffers of BJP. The party in office received Rs 757.6 crore from PET, Rs 150 crore from New Democratic ET, over Rs 30.1 crore from Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore from Triumph ET, Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh from Einzigartig ET. This adds up to nearly Rs 959 crore.PET, which receives political donations from various Tata group companies and disburses them in Lok Sabha election year, had passed on a total Rs 454 crore to three parties in 2018-19, of which 75% or Rs 356 crore went to BJP, Rs 55.6 crore to the Congress and Rs 43 crore to Trinamool Congress.Since the 2024-25 contribution report of Prudent Electoral Trust, through which the lion’s share of political donations is routed with BJP being the biggest beneficiary, is not uploaded on EC website, its disbursals to the governing party cannot be assessed.BJP received Rs 856.4 crore via trusts, of which Rs 724 crore came from Prudent, and Rs 1,685 cr from bonds in 23-24.Congress received Rs 77.3 crore from PET in 2024-25, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Prudent contributed Rs 216.33 crore to Congress and A B General ET, Rs 15 crore, as per contribution report filed by Congress for 2024-25. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 through the trust route.PET also disbursed donations worth Rs 10 crore each to Trinamool, YSR Congress Party, Shiv Sena, Biju Janata Dal, Bharat Rashtra Samithi, JDU, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and LJP-Ram Vilas.Interestingly, Congress contributions in 2024-25 fall way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24, but are higher than its Rs 171-crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC’s Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, are no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25. BRS not only saw its Rs 495 crore contributions in bonds (2023-24) eroded, but its receipts from trusts also dipped to Rs 15 crore from Rs 85 crore in 2023-24.The Tata Group companies that donated to PET include Tata Sons Pvt Ltd (Rs 308 crore); TCS (Rs 217.6 crore); Tata Steel (Rs 173 crore); Tata Motors (Rs 49.4 crore); Tata Power (Rs 39.5 crore); Tata Communications (Rs 14.8 crore); and Tata Consumer Products, Tata Elxsi Ltd and Tata Autocomp Systems (Rs 19.7 crore each).Among other trusts, the Mahindra Group-backed New Democratic ET gave Rs 150 crore of its total Rs 160 crore kitty to the BJP, with Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT receiving Rs 5 crore each.Triumph, to which CG Power contributed Rs 20 crore, disbursed Rs 21 crore to BJP and Rs 4 crore to Telugu Desam Party. Harmony ET contributed Rs 30.1 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to Shiv Sena-UBT and Rs 2 crore to NCP-Sharad Pawar. Jan Pragati ET disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.","Almost 83% of the total Rs 915 crore political donations routed through the Tata group-controlled Progressive Electoral Trust (PET) in 2024-25 went to BJP, while Congress’ share was a mere 8.4%.

A rally held in Bhopal on Wednesday to mark 41 years of the Bhopal gas tragedy turned tense after BJP supporters alleged that protesters were preparing to burn an “RSS effigy” along with one representing Dow Chemical, the current owner of Union Carbide.The rally was organised by four survivor groups and began at Bharat Talkies, but it was stopped midway following the dispute. The march was meant to pass the city bus stand and end at the gas memorial near the closed Union Carbide factory in JP Nagar, where protesters planned to burn the effigies.Assistant police commissioner Rakesh Singh Baghel told PTI that a complaint was received during the rally about an effigy that looked like it depicted workers of a particular organisation. After verifying the complaint, police removed the effigy, saying some people found it offensive. Baghel warned that any attempt to target an organisation or ideology would lead to action.""If any attempt was made to create a controversy at the rally, strict action will be taken,"" the police officer maintained.RSS worker and BJP mandal president Ashish Singh Thakur claimed the effigy showed an RSS “sevak” and accused protesters of planning to burn it. He called it “anti-national” work and demanded a case against those involved. Survivor groups rejected the charge and said their effigies represented people responsible for the 1984 disaster, not any group.The gas leak on the night of December 2–3, 1984, killed at least 5,479 people and left thousands injured. As every year, an interfaith prayer was held on Wednesday at Barkatullah Bhawan.","The rally was organised by four survivor groups and began at Bharat Talkies.

NEW DELHI: An agreement has been reached between parliamentarians to run the House ""smoothly"" after the government gave in to the opposition's demand to hold a discussion on the ongoing pan-India special intensive revision of electoral rolls.After two days of chaos and disruptions, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held a Business Advisory Committee meeting with floor leaders, where it was decided that a 10-hour-long discussion on electoral reforms will be held in the Lower House of Parliament on December 9 and 10.Birla also decided that the discussion on the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram will take place from 12 noon on Monday, and the discussion on election reforms from 12 noon on Tuesday.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju informed about the decisions taken at the all-party meeting.""During the All Party Meeting chaired by Hon'ble Speaker Lok Sabha today, it has been decided to hold discussion in Lok Sabha on the 150th Anniversary of National Song 'Vande Mataram' from 12 noon on Monday, 8th Dec, and discussion on Election Reforms from 12 noon on Tuesday, 9th Dec,"" Rijiju said in a post on X.Further, Rijiju explained that SIR is an administrative matter of the Election Commission, which is why the Parliament had to widen the scope of the discussion.""Election Commission reform is a larger issue which is conducted by the Govt and discussed in the Parliament.

Allegation of fraud in entire selection process not sustainable: HC

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court Wednesday decided against scrapping the recruitment of 32,000 teachers for state-run primary schools, setting aside the order of Justice Abhijit Ganguly, who has since become a BJP MP, report Subrata Chattoraj & Poulami Roy.In 2023, Justice Ganguly, while cancelling the appointments based on 2014 Teacher Eligibility Test, said the jobs were “actually sold”. A larger bench had stayed the order.HC said it was setting aside the order because the “conclusion by the investigating authority (CBI) would not reveal that the appointed candidates were involved in any corrupt practices”.The allegation of fraud and corruption pertaining to the entire recruitment process is not sustainable and the appointment of the 32,000 teachers cannot be interfered with,” a bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Reetobroto Mitra, hearing an appeal by the state govt against Justice Ganguly’s order, ruled.Cautioning courts against “innovating at pleasure”, the bench said, “There must have been a possibility of systemic malice, assessment of data doesn’t point to the same.”The division bench noted that CBI only found irregularities in the recruitment of 360 candidates. Of them, 264 candidates were given grace marks and identified. Additionally, 96 candidates did not secure qualifying marks but were still appointed.Their services were terminated but they are still teaching following a Supreme Court order.After the verdict, Ganguly said, “They (the HC bench) did what they thought was right. What can I say? Unless I read the judgment and its reasoning, I cannot speak.”CM Mamata Banerjee gave a cautious response. “We respect the judicial process. I’m happy our brothers and sisters have got their jobs back,” she said. Her education minister Bratya Basu showed less restraint. “They (teachers) thought him to be their God, but he turned out to be Satan,” he said.BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari defended Ganguly. “I can’t comment on the judiciary’s order but apparently, there were irregularities in the recruitment process in both TET & SLST. It is also true that thousands of deserving candidates suffered in both cases due to the presence of tainted candidates in the panel. TMC is responsible for pushing them to such a situation.”","Allegation of fraud in entire selection process not sustainable: HC. Calcutta high court sets aside the order of Justice Abhijit Ganguly.

Send Sunali to her father after getting her back: SC to govt

Sunali

NEW DELHI: More than five months after her deportation to Bangladesh, the Union govt on Wednesday told Supreme Court that it would “purely on humanitarian grounds” bring back Sunali Khatun, who is pregnant, and her eight-year-old son, even as it stuck to its stand that she is an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh.“Law has to bend before humanity,” said a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi as it asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to seek instructions from govt about the return of the other four who were detained in Delhi by police before being deported to Bangladesh in June.On Oct 3, a Bangladeshi court had declared Sunali and her family to be Indian citizens. Mehta said the Union govt had taken a humanitarian view only because of the woman’s advanced pregnancy and that she and her minor son would be brought back to Delhi and adequate healthcare provided to her.Appearing for Sunali’s father Bhodu Sekh, senior advocate Sanjay Hegde told the bench that she would be better off with her father at her native village in Birbhum district of West Bengal.The Mamata Banerjee govt, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported the plea and requested SC to seek a response from the Centre on the return of the other four, including Sunali’s husband Danish.The bench agreed and said Sunali would be better attended to during her pregnancy if she stayed with her father and asked Centre to send her to Bengal after getting her repatriated to India along with her son. It also directed Birbhum medical officer to provide her with pregnancy-related healthcare free of cost.SC also raised an important issue before the Centre: as govt has not proceeded against Bhodu Sekh on the ground that he is a Bangladeshi national, which would lead to an inference that he is an Indian citizen, Sunali’s proving that she is the biological daughter of Bhodu Sekh would automatically lead to her being considered an Indian citizen, along with her son. However, it was quick to clarify that it would be altogether different if she is not biologically related to Bhodu Shekh.The bench said govt can have a summary inquiry about her citizenship while followings principles of natural justice, i.e. giving her an opportunity to present her case and respond to queries of the authorities concerned. Mehta said Sunali and five others were detained by police in Delhi, not in Birbhum, and a preliminary enquiry found they had no documentary proof about Indian citizenship. The bench posted the matter for hearing on Dec 12.","Sunali Khatun, who is pregnant, and her eight-year-old son were deported on suspicions of being Bangladeshis.

This winter, Kamla is running again – but with a rope in her hand, digging her heels in the red soil as she practises the tug-of-war. Kamla, who laid down arms recently, will participate in the final round of Bastar Olympics, scheduled for later this month. “I surrendered this year. Now, every pull on this rope feels like I am pulling my life onto the other side,” she said.Podiyam Bhima, also known as Lokesh, was with the Maoist movement until early this year. He had heard that many of the surrendered Maoists were participating in the Bastar Olympics. “I used to think that one day when I surrender, I would take part too. Bastar Olympics was one of the big attractions for me in deciding to lay down arms,” Bhima said.Today he is training for the archery event. This is the second year of Bastar Olympics, having over three lakh registered participants ranging from block to district and divisional level across the seven districts of Bastar.Union home minister Amit Shah, who had attended last year’s event, will participate on the final day this year on Dec 13, coming close on the heels of his ministry’s call to end Maoist extremism in India by March 31, 2026.At a recent event in New Delhi, PM Narendra Modi cited the Bastar Olympics as a marker of change. He recalled a time when even journalists needed multiple permissions to enter Bastar. “Last year, about 300 surrendered cadres took part.

The shootout comes less than three weeks after security forces killed top Maoist commander Madvi Hidma on Nov 18 in the forests of Maredumilli on the Chhattisgarh-Andhra Prade-sh border.

Other members of GEC include Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala of IIT Madras; Srivardhini K Jha of NSRCEL, IIM Bangalore; and Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of CEEW.“Pursuing a green economy will not just create jobs and economic prosperity for India.It will also help us secure the fuels and resources of the future, making us ‘Atmanirbhar’,” said Abhishek Jain, director, green economy & impact innovations, CEEW.The analysis of the study showed that energy transition alone could generate 16.6 million FTE jobs and attract $3.8 trillion in investments across renewables, storage, distributed energy and clean mobility manufacturing.It underlined that electric mobility would be the single-largest employer within the green economy, driving over 57% of all energy-transition jobs whereas bio-economy and nature-based solutions, anchored in India’s rural and peri-urban landscapes, could create 23 million jobs and $415 billion in market value. “Top job-generating value chains within this segment include chemical-free agri and bio-inputs, agroforestry and sustainable forest and wetland management,” it added.In addition, the circular economy could generate $132 billion in annual economic output and create 8.4 million FTE jobs across waste collection, recycling, repair, refurbishment & material recovery.“Together, these opportunities represent one of India’s largest untapped economic opportunities, with deep linkages to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), cooperatives and community enterprises,” said the study.","The analysis also projects that India could unlock a $1.1 trillion (Rs 97.7 lakh crore) annual green market by 2047. “Pursuing a green economy will not just create jobs and economic prosperity for India. It will also help us secure the fuels and resources of the future, making us ‘Atmanirbhar’” said Abhishek Jain, director, green economy & impact innovations, CEEW.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125755135,imgsize-31838,width-400,resizemode-4/green-eco-can-draw-in-4tn-create-48m-jobs-by-47-study.jpg"

NEW DELHI: BJP Wednesday reacted furiously to the remarks of two Congress CMs “mocking” Hinduism and recalled a series of similar comments made by the functionaries of INDIA bloc to ask Rahul Gandhi if insulting Hindu gods has become a part of his party’s strategy.“How many gods do Hindus believe in? Three crore? Why so many? One god for the unmarried — Hanuman. Another for those who marry twice. And another for those who drink alcohol,” Telangana CM Revanth Reddy said in Telugu at an event, according to its translation posted by BJP.Himachal CM Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu was seen in a viral video telling a group of youngsters as to why they are using “Radhe Radhe” greeting, drawing BJP’s ire.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said while Reddy is making fun of Hindu gods and goddesses, Sukhu is stopping young people from offering a religious greeting. “Have Congress and Rahul instructed their CMs to directly attack Hinduism and its gods and goddesses,” he asked at a presser. These are not isolated incidents and functionaries of Congress and its allies have repeatedly insulted Sanatan Dharma, he added.Reddy had earlier said that Congress means Muslims, and Muslims mean Congress, Trivedi said. “Rahul used pictures of gods but didn’t take oath in the name of god. He has on several occasions insulted Sanatan Dharma. Congress ally DMK had organised an event for the eradication of Sanatan Dharma,” he said.He highlighted PM Modi’s critcism of Congress as “Muslim League-Maoist” to assert that Congress is behaving true to the description with unruly conducts by its MPs, including Rahul, in Parliament, their insult of institutions & its agenda of “spreading hate against Hinduism”.",Telangana CM Revanth Reddy met PM Narendra Modi Wednesday seeking support for Telangana’s $3 trillion vision.

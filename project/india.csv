'INDIA WON'T BUY RUSSIAN OIL': Trump's Huge Claim, Calls PM Modi His Friend | WATCH

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of being ""frightened"" of Donald Trump , hours after the US President claimed that the PM has ""assured him that India would stop buying Russian oil"".The Congress leader said the Prime Minister ""keeps sending congratulatory messages despite repeated snubs"".""PM Modi is frightened of Trump. 1. Allows Trump to decide and announce that India will not buy Russian oil. 2. Keeps sending congratulatory messages despite repeated snubs. 3. Cancelled the Finance Minister’s visit to America. 4. Skipped Sharm el-Sheikh. 5. Doesn’t contradict him on Operation Sindoor,"" Rahul Gandhi wrote on X.Earlier, his party attacked PM Modi for ""compromising the country's dignity"", calling Russia India's close ally.""Don’t damage the country's relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties,"" said Congress."" Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India. Don’t damage the country’s relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties',"" Congress posted on X.Trump claimed on Wednesday that PM Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after he imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican leader added.Meanwhile, Russia remains India's single-largest source of oil, accounting for 34% of inbound shipments in September, although volumes have slipped 10% in the first eight months of 2025, according to commodities and shipping markets tracker Kpler.The agency’s latest report pegs India’s crude imports in September at more than 4.5 million bpd (barrels per day).This is an increase of 70,000 barrels over August but flat when compared to the year-ago period, says the report, adding Russian oil accounted for a tad under 1.6 million bpd, or 34% of crude imports. India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

NEW DELHI: In a striking echo of his predecessor, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday made an embarrassing gaffe as he confused India with Iran. Twice.While repeating his rant about negotiating a ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad, he referred to India as Iran, calling it a nuclear nation.Trump claimed he threatened both nations with 200% tariffs if the conflict blew up into a full-fledged war.""If you look at Pakistan and Iran -- I told them I was in the midst of negotiating a trade deal with Iran and Pakistan, and because of tariffs, they wanted to negotiate much differently. I heard they were shooting at each other, and then I said during one of my conversations, ""Are you guys going to go to war?” I said, 'Here’s a deal — you go to war, and I gotta put a 200% tariff and stop you from doing any business in the United States'. I said this to both of them, and within 24 hours, the war ended. That would have been a nuclear war .""Trump continues to blow a ""ceasefire"" trumpet despite India rejecting his claims and PM Modi firmly stating in Parliament that no global leader asked India to stop the attack.Sharing new details about India's Operation Sindoor in Lok Sabha, PM Modi said that US Vice President JD Vance had called him on May 9, to inform him about a 'huge' impending strike by Pakistan.""On the night of 9th May, the Vice President of America tried to talk to me. He tried for an hour, but I was in a meeting with my army, so I could not pick up his call. Later, I called him back. The Vice President of America told me on the phone that Pakistan is going to launch a big attack. My answer was that if Pakistan has this intention, it will cost them a lot. If Pakistan attacks, we will respond by launching a big attack. This was my answer,"" PM Modi told the Lower House.He further said that no leader anywhere in the world had asked India to stop its response, saying, “no global leader urged India to halt the operation.”“Operation Sindoor has not been called off yet and Pakistan remains on notice,” Modi said, adding that the neighbour's nuclear bluff has been called and India would not succumb to nuclear blackmail.","US President Donald Trump made an embarrassing gaffe as he confused India with Iran.

How reality finally caught up with MTV,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-reality-finally-caught-up-with-mtv/articleshow/124593223.cms,".

In India, the M(usic) had gone out of MTV long ago. Now, the channel is shuttering its music channels in Europe. But its VJs, who had made TV cool, have banded together and are now making everyday life look cool, one reel at a time

Political revolutions happen on the streets, often marked by violence and chaos. Cultural revolutions are quieter, even surreptitious. MTV is the perfect example. The music channel was among the biggest cultural ‘influencers’ of the modern world much before Gen Z appropriated the word. And many of us didn’t even notice it.Born in Aug 1981, MTV fundamentally changed the way the global young consumed popular music. The first music video televised on the channel, “Video Killed The Radio Star” by The Buggles, was a cheeky declaration of intent.Till then, songs were auditory. Now, they morphed into the audio-visual. This was also the time when rhythm-driven disco had taken hold of the club and party scene in the West. A hot-stepping John Travolta, with the help of the Bee Gees, had seduced the only-toowilling in Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Grease (1978). MTV was perfectly poised to cash in on the perfect storm of opportunity. But the channel was struggling to find a larger, more diverse demographic.Enter Michael Jackson ’s Thriller. The album released in 1982 had recorded good sales, but it was nowhere close to becoming a monster success. But the music videos of its songs — Billie Jean, Beat It and, more specifically, title track Thriller (released in 1983) — took record sales to ginormous levels. Jackson and MTV synergised each other like nothing before or after. “Thriller sealed MTV’s reputation as a new cultural force…” Phile Hebblethwaite wrote in The Guardian in 2013. Equally importantly, it also widened the channel’s demographic reach and advertising appeal, making it a major success.Overall, MTV created the template of the singing-dancing star, shifted public tastes towards a more rhythm-oriented music and eye candy pop stars (think Duran Duran) and became the go-to channel for the 13 plus23 minus defining their idea of cool. Which translated into what outfit to wear and which condoms to use, spawning a parallel multi-billion-dollar consumer industry. MTV was also Money TV.By 1987, MTV even tailored news the way the young allegedly wanted it. A 2023 NYT article recalled how President Bill Clinton’s response to a town hall query put ‘MTV News’ under the spotlight in 1994. The existential question was: “‘Boxers or briefs?’ ‘Usually briefs’, Mr Clinton responded to a room full of giggles.” MTV had seamlessly constructed pop politics.MTV had impacted India long before the channel came to India. In the 1980s, India was a single-television channel country even though the country briefly sampled the new world of music videos, courtesy DD every week. But this was also the video cassette recorder age, when pirated tapes of foreign films and music videos were readily available countrywide. If you saw shades of Jackson’s moonwalk in a Mithun or Govinda move, you didn’t need to think twice how the song found its way to Bollywood. Thousands even in small-town India were already doing the same.In 1991, India opened its economy and the skies. Satellite TV brought in soaps such as ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ bringing the forbidden to upwardly mobile middle-class homes. The urban young found a channel that spoke to — not at them — when MTV India happened in 1996, two years after Channel V, another channel of the same variety. The channels gave them vitality and identity. As in the West, the video jockeys were as pivotal as the music. The VJs — their relaxed flounce, their cool couture, their zany humour — seemed hipper than the Bollywood stars in the newly globalised universe. These channels seldom commanded high TRPs but they ranked high as influencers of the “with-it” as well as the “wannabe” urban young.Both Channel V and MTV eventually went desi, hoping to reach out to a larger audience, enabling the rise of local music talent in Indi-Pop (Silk Route, Alisha Chinoy, Lucky Ali, to name a few) and Bhangra pop (Daler Mehndi). But the times and the tech were a-changin’. Rampant online and offline music piracy caused the fall of record companies, forcing others associated with music to change tracks. Now lifestyle took frontstage.MTV recast itself with reality shows: the intense Roadies (2003) and the dating show, Splitsvilla (2008), to name two. Rannvijay Singha and Ayushsmann Khurana were two early winners of the show. And while these shows continue to enthuse a small section among the young and the restless, MTV ceased to inhabit the young’s cultural cosmos. As smartphones became an extension of the hand, the world got busy broadcasting itself; everyone making their own reels, short videos and video logs. In the new chaotically democratised world of entertainment, there was no space for an arbiter of hip. It was more than just a mid-life crisis. MTV was a great idea whose time had gone.","MTV fundamentally changed the way the global young consumed popular music.

Can India turn AI threat into its next IT boom?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-india-turn-ai-threat-into-its-next-it-boom/articleshow/124593174.cms,".

The fear of machines taking away jobs is all too familiar. It first created panic when the Industrial Revolution hit. Then came the digital age. But the rapid evolution of AI poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not seen before.

That’s why India must revamp how it educates and upskills its youth to catch up

.

For more than two hundred years, each wave of new technology and innovation has carried with it a familiar fear that machines would take away people’s livelihoods. During the Industrial Revolution, the mechanisation of textiles and manufacturing triggered fears of “technological unemployment.” This panic even gave rise to the famous Luddite movement in England, where textile workers destroyed looms they thought would make their jobs obsolete. In reality, while machines did replace some manual weavers, industrialisation also generated vast new opportunities in factories, coal mining, engineering, and other emerging sectors.After World War II, automation and computers revived fears of a “jobless future”. Clerical roles like typists vanished, but new opportunities in software, electronics, and IT created even more jobs. The 1990s internet boom again disrupted work, with automation and outsourcing displacing factory and call-centre jobs.Yet, fresh industries emerged in e-commerce, app development, digital marketing, and cybersecurity.However, this time around the concern seems different and justifiable. The rapid evolution of AI and automation poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not experienced before. A McKinsey report estimates that by 2030, automation could replace up to 30% of hours worked in the US, forcing 12 million workers to shift roles. The ILO (International Labour Organization) warns the impact could be even more severe in India, with nearly 70% of existing jobs at high risk from AI and automation.Unlike earlier waves of innovation, even cognitive roles like coding, medical diagnosis, creative content, recruitment, customer support are all increasingly automatable. Now, with robotics and AI, even non-routine manual tasks such as warehouse picking, surgery assistance, and food preparation face the risk of being automated.But the situation is not really as grim as it may sound. If history is any guide, while many occupations will require people to work alongside technology, AI and robotics are likely to add net jobs. American economist David Autor has for long argued that tech and innovation have led to productivity growth, directly augmenting employment. Productivity growth in one sector generates large positive spillovers to employment growth elsewhere in the economy.For a developing economy like India, whether technology and innovation in AI, robotics, and automation lead to a net gain in jobs will largely depend on two key factors. One, how well we equip our students and the workforce through skilling and upskilling and make them job ready; and two, how strongly we invest in research and development.India’s biggest challenge today is that our skills and institutions have not kept pace with rapid shifts in technology. Each year, over 10 million students graduate from colleges and universities, yet the job market struggles to absorb them. A recent report by Mercer Mettl puts the employability of graduates in India at 42.6%. Multiple studies find that 85% of Indian engineering graduates are not job-ready. Our school education relies on rote learning with little focus on practical skills and critical thinking. Higher education is theory heavy.First, we must revamp our skilling programmes with a forward-looking lens, aligned to jobs of the future. Many semi-skilled roles will sustain and grow, be it in frontline sales, relationship managers or after-sales support in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), retail, and telecom, due to our cultural preference for trust and personal interaction. These can absorb large sections of young, educated workers.Similarly, delivery and logistics roles in quick commerce will expand, offering opportunities for lows-killed workers where machines cannot easily replace humans. With India’s tourism and hospitality sector set to grow, demand will rise for frontline staff, travel consultants, chefs, guides, and wildlife experts — creating strong need for skilled and semi-skilled workers.At the same time, AI and automation will reshape employment. In finance, routine processes like loan approvals will be automated, creating demand for specialists in AI training, analytics, and cyber-risk. In manufacturing, repetitive assembly jobs will decline, while technical roles in robotics supervision, maintenance, and monitoring will rise. New roles are expected to emerge in data and artificial intelligence, engineering, cloud computing and product development that will need highly skilled workers, and we need to prepare.The govt must strengthen apprenticeship programmes to meet the needs of a changing economy. So far, India’s apprenticeship model has struggled to bridge academia and industry, with training focused largely on traditional trades like fitter and welder when focus should be on courses in AI, automation, renewable energy, tourism and so on. Even short-term courses (3-6 months) in using computers, soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills can cater to demand in retail, BFSI, and telecom sectors. The revamped hub-and-spoke ITI model announced in the 2024-25 budget under the National Scheme for ITI Upgradation could fill this gap by upgrading curricula and training with industry participation. Its success, however, will depend on effective execution, as past ITI reform efforts at both central and state levels have delivered limited impact.Secondly, India needs to put emphasis on research and development. The future of jobs will be shaped not just by who can use technology, but by who can create and lead it. The US, China, South Korea, and Germany succeeded in their engineering revolutions through large-scale investments in research and innovation, that formed the backbone of job creation in manufacturing, software, electronics, and semiconductors. India still lags behind — while China received 798,337 patent grants in 2023, the US 323,410, Japan 201,420, and South Korea 135,180, India managed 30,490. We are catching up, but we need to do more to shape the future of work.The govt’s launch of the Research and Development Innovation Fund (RDIF) and the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is a right step forward. It provides both a roadmap and corpus to boost research and innovation in the private sector and academia. But much more can be done to create a strong ecosystem for corporate R&D in India.Several ministries already operate with R&D budgets — the ministry of science & technology was allocated a budget of Rs 16,628 crore in FY25 — yet these are often scattered. State govts too can create regional R&D incentives, sector-specific funds and work with local industries and universities. ANRF should quickly work on mapping, monitoring, and aligning all ministry and state-level R&D budgets with streamlined priorities. The foundation can also pool resources from multiple ministries into cross-sectoral missions such as green energy, AI in healthcare and advanced manufacturing instead of isolated projects.Technology and innovation can certainly lead to net addition of jobs in India. But the outcome largely depends on how we manage the transition .The author is chairperson, Quess Corp","The rapid evolution of AI and automation poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not experienced before.

"Pankaj Dheer, TV’s Karna, loses fight with cancer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pankaj-dheer-tvs-karna-loses-fight-with-cancer/articleshow/124592568.cms,"Actor Pankaj Dheer , whose impressive turn as the wronged prince Karna in the television epic, ‘Mahabharat’ (1988), embedded him in a generation’s memory, passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday. He was 68. Dheer was suffering from cancer. “He had been in and out of hospital in the past months,” producer and friend Ashoke Pandit told PTI.In an interview to the video magazine, ‘Lehren Retro’, the actor once revealed that he had refused the part of Arjun in the BR Chopra production because he was asked to shave off his moustache. “It was foolishness,” he admitted. Six months later he was offered Karna which didn’t require him to shave off facial hair.Dheer’s family roots went back to Kasur, a town south of Lahore, in pre-independence India. But the son of producer-director CL Dheer (‘Bahu Beti’, ‘Alingan’) had grown up in Bandra, Mumbai. The TV show’s Sanskritised dialogues triggered performance anxiety.The actor sought tips from Rahi Masoom Raza, who had co-written the show. Among other things, Raza suggested that he should read aloud the Hindi daily, ‘Navbharat Times’, a sister publication of The Times of India, everyday.With his imposing presence and empathetic voice, Dheer executed an unforgettable Karna drawing the audience's sympathy. The role gave him what every actor yearns for: fame, adulation and a steady career.When the character died in the serial, many shaved off their hair in Bastar, then part of Madhya Pradesh. “At the behest of (then) chief minister Arjun Singh, I flew there and consoled the mourners, assuring them that I was alive. It was something you believe only when you see it,” he recalled in the interview.Pankaj Dheer also said, “Many people do not know my name, but they recognize me as Karna. Even today, my face is published as Karna’s face in textbooks.”The role opened doors in television and films leading to nearly 100 TV shows and films. One of his most remembered roles was of King Shivdutt in the mega fantasy, ‘Chandrakanta’ (1994). Two notable films were Bobby Deol’s ‘Soldier’ (1998) and Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Baadshah’ (1999), where he played a scheming security chief.Dheer’s passing was mourned on social media. Among those who attended the funeral were fellow actors from Mahabharat, and Salman Khan, with whom he had worked in films such as ‘Sanam Bewafa’ (1991).","Dheer was suffering from cancer.

61 Senior Naxal Cadres Surrender In Gadchiroli In Presence Of Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis

Andhra, Telangana latest states to be out of Naxal-affected list, says

MHA

New Delhi: Months ahead of the March 31, 2026 deadline to fully eliminate armed Naxalism from the country, the Centre declared that the total number of Left-wing extremism-hit districts have fallen to just 11 from 18 in March 2025 and 126 in 2013, with the “most-affected districts” also down to three from six in the last seven months.Hailing the “historic milestone in eliminating Naxalism” in a post on X, home minister Amit Shah said, “Under Modi ji's vision for a terror-free India, tireless counter-insurgency operations and people-centric development are shrinking the space of the left-wing extremists, leaving no place for them to hide. By March 31, 2026, India will be free from the menace of Naxalism”.The home ministry in a separate statement said only Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur districts in Chhattisgarh are now most-affected by left wing extremism (LWE).Kanker district in Chhattisgarh, West Singhbhum in Jharkhand, and Gadchiroli in Maharashtra have been shifted from the list of districts “most affected” by Left-wing extremism to “affected” category after latest review by the home ministry.The five remaining districts in “Naxal-affected” list are Gariyaband, Dantewada, and Mohalla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki in Chhattisgarh; Balaghat in MP; and Kandhamal in Odisha.Seven districts — Alluri Sitarama Raju in Andhra Pradesh, Kalahandi and Malkangiri in Odisha, Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Mulugu in Telangana, Latehar in Jharkhand, and Nuapada in Odisha — have been removed from the MHA list.Andhra and Telangana are now out of the LWE-affected states. Earlier, in March 2025, Kerala (Wayanad & Kannur) and West Bengal (Jhargram) were also delisted.Operational successes in 2025 have been record-breaking, with 312 LWE cadres killed — including the CPI (Maoist) general secretary and eight other politburo or central committee members. Another 836 cadres were arrested and 1,639 surrendered.Modi govt’s National Action Plan against LWE — focused on intelligence-based ops, targeting leadership, development of infra, choking finances, and Centre-state coordination — has delivered major setbacks to the movement once dubbed India’s “biggest internal security challenge.”","Andhra and Telangana are now out of the LWE-affected states.

Pakistani troops engaged in heavy fighting with Afghan Taliban fighters on Tuesday night along the Kurram district border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The clashes came after the Taliban and militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan , called Fitna al-Khawarij by authorities, reportedly opened fire without warning.PTV News said several Taliban posts were heavily damaged, including at least one tank, and fighters fled their positions. Later reports added that additional posts and tank positions, including Shamsadar post, were destroyed, and a senior Fitna al-Khawarij commander was killed.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch briefed resident ambassadors in Islamabad, stressing “Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.”Over the weekend, Taliban forces allegedly attacked Pakistani border posts, killing 23 troops. Islamabad responded, claiming more than 200 Taliban and allied militants were killed. Kabul called the strike “retaliatory,” accusing Pakistan of air raids inside Afghan territory last week, which Pakistan has denied.","Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged.

What are the charges?









Indian-origin US expert, Ashley Tellis, who has been an advisor to US government for more than two decades, was arrested on charges of unlawfully retaining classified information and allegedly meeting with Chinese officials.Tellis was found to have kept over 1,000 pages of top-secret or secret documents in his home, the affidavit stated.In April 2023, Tellis attended a dinner with Chinese government officials in a Washington DC suburb and “could be occasionally overheard talking about Iranian-Chinese relations and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence,” the affidavit noted.According to the affidavit, Tellis serves as an unpaid adviser at the State Department and is a contractor with the Office of Net Assessment (ONA).

Poll Do you support the new policy requiring developers to deposit three years' rent upfront before starting redevelopment projects? Yes, it's a great idea to protect residents No, it may discourage developers





THANE: In order to prevent redevelopment projects from stalling midway and protect residents from displacement without compensation, the state housing department is framing a new policy mandating developers to deposit three years' rent before taking up any redevelopment work, deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde said on Saturday.""Some builders take on redevelopment projects, vacate residents from flats, fail to pay rent or delay construction, sometimes even trading rights with other developers, which leads to stalled projects and inconvenience for residents,"" Shinde said. ""To address this, we are introducing a policy where builders must deposit three years' rent upfront while their project execution capability will also be simultaneously assessed before approval,"" he said during a lottery function for over 5,000 Mhada flats from the Konkan region in Thane.Shinde said the state was committed to reviving stalled redevelopment projects. ""We are aligning with cash-rich govt agencies that have a reputation for completing projects on time and through combined investment with private developers, are expecting to raise Rs 50 lakh crore over the next five years and construct 35 lakh homes in the state,"" he added.Shinde, who also heads the housing department, said after he took over, Mhada started working on a pioneering housing policy for senior citizens, possibly making it the first state in the country to prioritise this segment. In addition, there are plans to develop supply in the affordable housing segment, so that sections such as working women and mill workers benefit and rental homes are available for migrant workers as open-market rates are often unaffordable.","Maha's housing department is introducing a new policy requiring developers to deposit three years' rent upfront for redevelopment projects.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-demerger-what-does-it-mean-for-investors-why-did-the-share-price-drop-40-explained/articleshow/124544495.cms,"The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. (AI image)

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Embarrassment for his workers: JD(U)

'His tyre has already been flattened': RJD



Kishor bows out — 'in larger interest'



NEW DELHI: In Bihar’s charged political arena, the adage “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” seemed to come alive on Wednesday, as rivals —BJP-JD(U) and RJD —found common ground in Prashant Kishor . The trio united in criticism of Jan Suraaj Party founder while mocking him for deciding to eventually not contest the upcoming assembly elections.Union minister Giriraj Singh was even more scathing, calling Kishor’s expectations of winning over 150 seats “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne” — a reference to a popular television show about daydreams. “Kishor realised he would not win. His party is nothing but a ‘vote katwa’ outfit — the ‘B team’ of the RJD,” Singh said.Echoing that sentiment, BJP spokesperson Niraj Kumar said, “Kishor’s bubble burst even before the elections. By announcing that he won’t contest, he has admitted defeat for himself and his party.” JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar called the move “a humiliation for his workers,” accusing Kishor of having “run away before the electoral battle.”BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said Kishor’s withdrawal was “a business decision,” adding, “Prashant Kishor is a very smart businessman and has a lot of experience in election campaigns. Perhaps he realised that the ground situation is not in his favour and that if he loses, his enterprise will lose credibility.”JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar called Kishor’s withdrawal a “humiliation” for his own party workers, accusing him of abandoning ship before the real fight began. “He has run away before the electoral battle,” Kumar said.“Earlier, he claimed to have undertaken padayatras to understand the people's issues. What happened to that? His decision is sheer embarrassment for his workers,” he added.RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary also mocked Kishor saying he had “accepted defeat before the battle began.” “Kishor has realised that he and his party will face a humiliating defeat in the upcoming assembly polls,” Tiwary remarked.“Kishor must understand that politics is not as easy as offering consultancy to others. His tyre has already been flattened.”Prashant Kishor, once among India’s most sought-after election strategists, announced that he would stay away from contesting this year’s Bihar polls — a decision he said was taken “in the larger interest” of his Jan Suraaj Party. In an interview with PTI, Kishor said a tally of “less than 150 seats” would be considered a defeat for his party, but insisted that “if Jan Suraaj wins, it will change national politics.”He explained that his decision was meant to keep the focus on party-building rather than personal ambition. “If I were to contest, it would have distracted me from the necessary organisational work,” said Kishor, who was earlier expected to contest from Raghopur, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s constituency.","BJP-JD(U) and RJD find common ground in Prashant Kishor.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways will next focus on building ‘dedicated passenger corridors’ to cater to the growing passenger demand while increasing the capacity of existing tracks and developing Vande Bharat 4.0 trains, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Wednesday.He said the dedicated passenger corridors will be designed for a speed of 350 kmph and an operational speed of 320 kmph and will be completely indigenous, providing huge opportunities to Indian players. The minister also warned suppliers and manufacturers against compromising on the quality of products and directed the Railway Board chairman to be ‘ruthless’ in blacklisting and blocking such companies from getting any work in the sector.Addressing industry players after he inaugurated the International Railway Equipment Exhibition, the minister said there are three major focus areas for railways: provide enough service for passengers and their comfort, ensure safety and make the national transporter ready for at least the next 25 years.On the target to have dedicated passenger corridors, Vaishnaw said, “We have to start constructing dedicated passenger corridors because we are 1.4 billion people; the transportation demand is humongous, and we have successful examples of economies of similar nature...Thesecorridors will be equipped with indigenously developed signalling systems and modern Operations Control Centres (OCCs).” He added that such corridors will be constructed across the country, and the target is to develop around 7,000 km of them in the next two decades.While highlighting the success of Vande Bharat trains, he urged the industry and railway engineers to reimagine the indigenous semi-high-speed train. The current Vande Bharat (3.0) is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 52 seconds. “The new version will focus on enhancing toilets, improving seats and elevating the overall workmanship of the coaches. Vande Bharat 4.0 (to be launched in the next 18 months) should be a train so advanced in quality and comfort that countries around the world aspire to adopt it,” the minister said.Vaishnaw urged manufacturers to focus on quality and safety, cautioning that “those who do not improve will lose out”. He directed the Railway Board chairman to carry out strict checks and blacklist those supplying poor quality materials.On the hydrogen-powered train, Vaishnaw said a 2,400-horsepower model has been developed entirely indigenously. “We will not import this technology. We will design it ourselves,” he said.",Indian Railways will next focus on building ‘dedicated passenger corridors’ to cater to growing passenger demand.

"‘Nothing is well in NDA’: BJP bets big on Chirag, again; Bihar allies in a tizzy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-is-well-in-nda-bjp-bets-big-on-chirag-again-bihar-allies-in-a-tizzy/articleshow/124580036.cms,"NEW DELHI: ‘This time, nothing is well in NDA … ’ Rashtriya Lok Morcha chief and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha , who has been a key partner of the ruling Bihar alliance, has sent out clear signals of discontent within the NDA. The RLP leader, reports say quoting sources, is unhappy over Mahua assembly seat in Vaishali district being given to Chirag Paswan.Kushwaha is not alone in raising the banner of revolt. Another key NDA partner, Union minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi has also made it clear that he will field his party (HAM) candidates from at least two seats - Bodh Gaya and Makhdumpur assembly constituencies.Both the allies, who have got 6 seats each under the division, are upset over the relatively larger number of seats – 29 – allotted to Paswan’s LJP(Ram Vilas). This despite the fact that Chirag Paswan’s performance in the last assembly elections was anything but inspiring. In 2020, the party had walked out of the NDA and contested on all 243 seats, but could win only one seat. However, what it did manage to do was damage Nitish Kumar ’s JD(U) and make it a junior partner of the BJP in Bihar assembly.Chirag was perhaps rewarded by the BJP for this role when he was taken back into the NDA fold ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and given five parliamentary seats – all of which the party won. That 100% strike rate perhaps could be the justification for giving the fledgling party 29 seats- way more than the other two allies.Political experts say Chirag Paswan remains part of BJP’s gameplan post elections once again. In 2020, he helped BJP by staying out of NDA. This time around, he could play a key role in ensuring that Nitish Kumar does not become the chief minister if NDA wins the elections.“The actual seat division in NDA is 130 for BJP and 113 for Nitish Kumar,” says political analyst Kumar Vijay. “The BJP has given 29 seats to Chirag Pawan so that in post-election scenario the numbers won by LJP can be used to sideline Nitish Kumar’s claims to the top post if NDA wins the elections,” he says.“Instead of giving so many seats to Chirag, the BJP should have tried to make all the allies, including Nitish Kumar, happy ahead of the elections. Post elections, after winning the required seats, it could have asserted and staked claim to the top post,” Kumar says. “In Bihar BJP, non-political persons are taking political decisions. Small people have been given big responsibilities and hence they have mismanaged everything,” the political analyst adds.The BJP has already initiated fire-fighting process. Upendra Kushwaha was summoned to Delhi to meet Amit Shah. ""We met with the Home Minister, and the issue was discussed. After this discussion, we now hope that there will be no difficulties ahead, and the NDA government will definitely be formed in Bihar. In every way, all the alliance parties within the NDA are ready,"" Kushwaha told reporters.But the bigger worry for the BJP would be Nitish Kumar. Reports say Nitish Kumar is unhappy with the way things have turned out. Already several senior JD(U) leaders have raised a banner of revolt. From open resignation letters to dharna, Nitish is under pressure from within to salvage the situation for his party. There are two camps within the JD(U) – one that favours close association with the BJP and the other that is opposing party’s alleged subjugation. It will be interesting to see how things pan out in the next few days, especially how the Bihar chief minister reacts to BJP’s “Chirag plan.”","Upendra Kushwaha is unhappy over Mahua assembly seat in Vaishali district being given to Chirag Paswan.

NEW DELHI: With just two days left for filing nominations for the first phase of the Bihar assembly elections , political activity has picked up pace across the state. The Congress on Wednesday released its first list of over 10 candidates even as talks over a seat-sharing deal with the Mahagathbandhan partners remain unresolved.The announcement was made through multiple posts on the party’s official handle on X, signalling that the Congress is moving ahead with its preparations.Here’s the list of 12 Congress candidates announced so far:As per reports, more names are expected in the coming days once discussions with Mahagathbandhan partners are concluded.The announcement comes amid discontent within the party, as several Congress workers alleged irregularities in ticket distribution, claiming that “tickets have been sold.”""Dr Ashok Gagan has been working for Congress for 35 years but has been denied a ticket.

Durgapur rape case: Victim's father apologises to 'mother-like' Mamata; seeks justice for daughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/durgapur-rape-case-victims-father-apologises-to-mother-like-mamata-seeks-justice-for-daughter/articleshow/124579824.cms,"NEW DELHI: Days after criticising chief minister Mamata Banerjee over her remarks on women's safety, the father of the Durgapur gang rape victim on Wednesday described her as a ""mother-like figure"" and sought forgiveness, urging her to help secure justice for his daughter.""Mamata Banerjee is like a mother-like figure to me. If I have said anything wrong, I ask her to forgive me. I will render countless obeisance at her feet. But I ask her to help my daughter get justice,"" the victim’s father told TV channels, according to PTI.""I have been demanding a CBI probe into this case. I think that would be good. But that depends on the state administration as well,"" he added.His remarks come days after he criticised the chief minister for her comment that ""women should not venture out at night,"" following the assault of his daughter, a second-year MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur.Earlier on Monday, the survivor's father stated that, ""She (Mamata Banerjee) is also a woman. How can she say such an irresponsible thing? Should women quit their jobs and sit at home? It seems Bengal is under the rule of Aurangzeb.""He further expressed a loss of faith in West Bengal's law and order situation and said he wanted to take his daughter back to Odisha for her safety. ""I want to take my daughter back to Odisha. Her life comes first, her career later,"" he added.The controversy began after Mamata Banerjee, while addressing the media about the crime, said, ""I learned that she was outside the campus at 12.30 am. Students residing in hostels should refrain from venturing out at night. Private medical colleges must ensure the safety of their students, particularly female students, who should not be permitted to leave the premises at night. Girls should protect themselves as well. ""Defending the police, Banerjee had said it was not possible for officers to monitor everyone's movements or stand guard outside every house.Her comments, however, drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders, women’s rights groups, and the Odisha government, who accused her of victim-blaming.Mamata later clarified that her statement had been ""distorted and taken out of context."" ""The media distorted my words. You ask me a question, I answer it, and then you distort it. Do not try this kind of politics,"" she asserted.The 22-year-old MBBS student was allegedly gang-raped on October 10 after she stepped out of her college campus with a male friend to get food.Police have so far arrested six people, including the friend, in connection with the case, which has triggered widespread outrage and political uproar across the state.","Mamata Banerjee is like a mother-like figure to me.

CHANDIGARH: In yet another dramatic twist in IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s alleged suicide, Rohtak police on Wednesday registered an FIR under abetment of suicide and criminal conspiracy charges, naming all those mentioned in the final video of ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather, who allegedly shot himself dead on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.The FIR (number 305) was registered at Sadar police station in Rohtak a few hours after Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep’s family in Rohtak’s Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice. The FIR had not been made public at the time of going to print, but according to highly placed officials, four persons are named in it — the deceased Puran Kumar’s wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of the 2001 batch, her brother and Punjab AAP MLA Amit Rattan, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO and is now in jail remand in a corruption case.According to multiple sources, the FIR was registered under BNS Secs 108 (abetment of suicide) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) on a complaint from Sandeep’s wife Santosh.Officials said Virendra Badkhalsa, OSD to the Haryana CM, informed Sandeep’s family about the registration of the FIR on Wednesday evening. Only then did Sandeep’s family agree to an autopsy. Around the same time, Puran Kumar’s body was being cremated in Chandigarh, 230km away, after an eight-day impasse.Sandeep’s body, which the family had kept in a hired freezer, was taken to PGI-MS Rohtak at night. Sandeep was part of the team investigating the case involving Puran Kumar and was also involved in the arrest of Puran Kumar’s former PSO on Oct 5. It was this FIR, registered on Oct 6, that is claimed to be the trigger for Puran Kumar’s suicide as Sushil was alleged to have given a statement that he was demanding money on behalf of Puran Kumar, who was then Rohtak IG. The Haryana govt found itself battling on two fronts. Amneet and other members of the family had refused to allow an autopsy until action was taken against DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, who were among those named by Puran Kumar in his suicide note.","ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather allegedly shot himself dead on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.

The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system to significantly boost its air defence architecture and strengthen its air capabilities.Thales will manufacture the missiles and launchers at Belfast, Northern Ireland, before delivering them to the Indian Army.The contract follows days after India-UK defence initiatives unveiled during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to India.In a joint statement, the Centre said the deal will further support India’s air defence capabilities and, in the spirit of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat', meet current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence while fostering long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.British defence secretary John Healey had said, ""The defence deals announced today show how our growing strategic partnership with India will boost UK business and jobs. I am hopeful this will pave the way for a deeper relationship between our two defence industries, particularly in the development of electric engines for naval ships and in air defence"" he added.The LMM is a lightweight, man-portable missile system that can be deployed in operational areas, including high-altitude regions, the Indian Army said.The missile operates on a laser beam riding guidance system, allowing precision strikes with minimal collateral damage. Equipped with a triple-effect warhead and proximity fuse, it is effective against aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, and UCAVs, including low-infrared signature targets, at ranges beyond 6 km in all-weather conditions.Weighing just 13 kg, the LMM is a supersonic weapon with speeds above Mach 1.5. Its advanced sighting system and high-explosive warhead give it a high single-shot kill probability. The system is optimised for air, land, and naval deployments, enabling rapid response against drones, light aircraft, and helicopters near borders or frontline positions, reported news agency ANI.",The Indian Army signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system.

NEW DELHI: Balancing the concerns for environment, sentiments of citizens during the festive season and right to livelihood of workers in the firecracker industry, Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily relaxed its complete ban and allowed bursting of only green crackers on two Diwali days, both in the morning and evening.Permitting the sale of NEERI-approved green firecrackers through designated outlets from Oct 19 to Oct 20, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered district administrations and police to “ensure that use of firecrackers shall be confined between 6-7am and 8-10pm on the two days i.e. the one before and on Diwali day”.However, SC banned sale of crackers through e-commerce websites and transportation of any kind of crackers from outside into the National Capital Region (NCR). It continued the ban on joined firecrackers (laris). The court asked Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state PCBs to monitor air quality index (AQI) daily from Oct 14 to 25, and file a report in SC.Pronouncing the 21-page order five days ahead of Diwali, CJI Gavai said the permission to burst only green crackers, as allowed by SC in its Oct 23, 2018, judgment, was turned into a ban on all forms of crackers in Delhi and NCR on Dec 19 last year based on a complete ban on crackers issued by the Delhi govt on Oct 14 last year.The bench said the SC ban on crackers has been observed more in breach during festive days as conventional firecrackers were smuggled in and burst, causing more harm to the environment. “In such a case, we must take a balanced approach, taking into account the conflicting interests and permit in moderation, while not compromising the environmental concerns arising,” it said.","Supreme Court allows bursting of only green crackers on two Diwali days, both in the morning and evening.

New Delhi: Calling it a “bogus challenge” to the will of late businessman Sunjay Kapur, his wife Priya on Wednesday told Delhi high court that incorrect spellings or addresses can’t be grounds to invalidate the document.Rebutting the allegations levelled by Kapur’s ex-wife Karisma Kapoor ’s children that the will was forged, Priya’s counsel Rajiv Nayyar told the court that no one had disputed or denied Sunjay’s signatures or those of the other two witnesses.The only ground to challenge the will, he told Justice Jyoti Singh, was if the deceased was not of sound mind, was under coercion, or was under some inability to execute the will. He told HC there was “nothing unusual in the bequest” since “in wife vs wife he would obviously name the present wife as beneficiary over an estranged wife”. The plea of the plaintiffs, Samaira and Kiaan Raj, was bereft of any cause of action, he argued.“Now I am told there are four additional grounds to invalidate a will — wrong spelling, wrong address, writing testatrix instead of testator, and closeness of witnesses,” Nayyar said.“There were two opportunities for the plaintiff. There was a will reading. It was read out to everyone, including the plaintiff... The suit was filed on Sept 9. There is no reference or challenge to the will in the plaint. The will was shared with them on Sept 15. They were conscious of the existence of the will as far back as July 30, prior to the filing of the suit.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s Janata Dal (United) on Wednesday released its first list of 57 candidates ahead of the Bihar assembly elections.JD(U), which is looking to retain power in the state, has fielded 30 new faces, while 27 sitting MLAs have been renominated.The announcement comes as National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners continue to send mixed signals over seat allocations, just days after the seat-sharing deal was finalised. Under the arrangement, JD(U) and BJP will contest 101 seats each, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) 29 seats, and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) six seats each.The upcoming election appears to be a sequel to the previous assembly polls, when chief minister Nitish Kumar and Chirag Paswan clashed after the latter broke away from the NDA to contest independently. In 2020, though Chirag’s party won just one seat out of 135 contested, it inflicted heavy damage on JD(U), defeating its candidates in over two dozen constituencies and reducing Nitish’s party to 43 seats — its lowest tally ever.This time, JD(U) has fielded candidates in five constituencies reportedly eyed by Chirag’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas).JD(U) named Komal Singh (Gaighat), Ratnesh Sada (Sonbarsa), Vidyasagar Singh Nishad (Morwa), Rajkumar Singh (Matihani) and Kaushal Kishore (Rajgir).Notably, two of these five seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes - a key voter base for LJP (RV).As in every Bihar election, caste has been a decisive factor in candidate selection and JD(U)'s list seems to try and balance the equation. Banking on its social justice plank, the party has given tickets to 23 OBC candidates that include nine Kushwahas, 10 Kurmis, three Yadavs, and one Baniya. It has also fielded 12 Scheduled Caste candidates.In addition, nine Extremely Backward Caste (EBC) nominees - JD(U)’s largest support base - are in the fray.Among upper castes, 13 candidates have been fielded - six Bhumihars, five Rajputs, and two Brahmins.JD(U) has not fielded a single Muslim candidate in its first list, a notable omission given the party’s traditional appeal among Muslim voters within the NDA.In the 2020 assembly elections, JD(U) fielded 11 Muslim candidates out of 115 seats, none of whom won. The figure, around 10%, was already lower than the community's share of Bihar's population (over 15%).JD(U) has fielded five of the cabinet ministers from CM Nitish Kumar's cabinet. Those who have made the cut are: Shravan Kumar (Nalanda), Vijay Kumar Chaudhary (Sarairanjan), Maheshwar Hazari (Kalyanpur), Madan Sahni (Bahadurpur) and Ratnesh Sada (Sonbarsa).The party has also fielded four women candidates: Komal Singh (Gaighat), Ashwamedh Devi (Samastipur), Ravina Kushwaha (Vibhutipur) and Kavita Kumari Saha (Madhepura).Turncoats, too, have found space. Shyam Rajak, who rejoined JD(U) after quitting RJD last year, and strongman Anant Kumar Singh, who has filed his nomination from Mokama, are among those fielded.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","JD(U) has fielded 30 new faces, while 27 sitting MLAs have been renominated.

NEW DELHI: The race for Bihar’s 2025 Assembly elections intensified on Wednesday with a flurry of major developments across parties — from BJP’s new list of candidates to Prashant Kishor ’s decision to stay out of the contest and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav ’s filing of nomination papers from his family bastion of Raghopur.While the NDA allies have almost completed their ticket distribution, the opposition INDIA bloc remains entangled in talks over seat-sharing. With the first phase of polling just weeks away, the political heat in Bihar is soaring, here are the major developments of the day:Prashant Kishor confirmed he will not contest the upcoming assembly elections, saying his decision was made for the “greater good” of his party, Jan Suraaj.Speaking to PTI, Kishor said, “If I were to contest, it would distract me from necessary organisational work.” He added that his party had decided to field Chanchal Singh against Tejashwi Yadav in Raghopur instead.Despite stepping aside, Kishor exuded confidence about Jan Suraaj’s performance: “We will either win handsomely or face a complete drubbing. There’s no middle ground.” He further stated, “A tally below 150 will be a defeat for me.”RJD claimed Kishor has “accepted defeat for his Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield,” while the BJP said, “Kishor realised he would not win elections.” The JD(U) called it a “humiliation for his party workers.”Reacting, RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary said, “Kishor’s tyre has been flattened,” while BJP’s Niraj Kumar said his “bubble burst even before the elections.” JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar added, “He has run away before the electoral battle.”Union minister Giriraj Singh mocked Kishor’s target as “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne,” calling Jan Suraaj a “vote katwa” and “RJD’s B team.”Janata Dal (United) released its first list, betting big on newcomers. Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party announced its first list of 57 candidates, featuring 30 fresh faces alongside 27 sitting MLAs.The newcomer-heavy list targets key constituencies, including five seats reportedly sought by Chirag Paswan’s LJP (RV), signaling a direct challenge. JD(U) has also carefully balanced caste representation—fielding candidates across OBCs, Scheduled Castes, Extremely Backward Castes, and upper castes—to maintain its traditional social justice appeal.Notably absent in this list are Muslim candidates, a departure from past elections, which might impact JD(U)’s support among Muslim voters. The party has also included cabinet ministers, women candidates, and recent turncoats, showcasing a mix of experience and fresh energy.The Congress announced 17 candidates for the elections, even as it continued to remain silent on any formal seat-sharing arrangement with the Mahagathbandhan. The candidates were handed party tickets by Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Rajesh Ram.The list includes Vijendra Chaudhary from Muzaffarpur, Om Prakash Garg from Gopalganj, Jitendra Singh from Amarpur, and Amita Bhushan from Begusarai. Also nominated are Lalan Kumar (Sultanganj), Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), Shashi Shekhar (Wazirganj), and Kaushalendra Kumar (Nalanda). Anand Shankar Singh will contest from Aurangabad, while Pratima Das has been fielded from Rajapakad. Shiv Prakash Garib Das will contest from Bachhwara, and Trishuldhari Singh from Barabigha.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) released its second and third list for the upcoming polls. With this the saffron party announced all the 101 candidates it had been allotted as part of the NDA.In its third list of 18 candidates, the party named Bina Devi from Kochadhaman and Sanjay Pandey from Narkatiaganj.In the second list of 12 candidates, it was announced that popular folk singer Maithili Thakur will contest from Alinagar in Darbhanga, while former IPS officer Anand Mishra, who earlier headed the youth wing of Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party, has been fielded from Buxar.The list also includes Ram Chandra Prasad from Hayaghat, Ranjan Kumar from Muzaffarpur, Subhash Singh from Gopalganj, and Vinay Kumar Singh from Sonepur. BJP had released its first list a day earlier, featuring key figures such as deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary (Tarapur) and Vijay Sinha (Lakhisarai), along with former Deputy CMs Renu Devi (Bettiah) and Tarkishore Prasad (Katihar).Interestingly, Assembly Speaker Nand Kishore Yadav was denied a ticket from Patna Sahib, replaced by Ratnesh Kushwaha, while long-time MLA Arun Kumar Sinha was dropped in favour of Sanjay Gupta from Kumrahar. The list also includes nine women candidates, including Renu Devi and Sweety Singh from Kishanganj.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav filed his nomination papers from Raghopur, the family’s traditional seat, in the presence of his parents — RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and former CM Rabri Devi. He was accompanied by sister Misa Bharti and senior party aides.Addressing supporters, Tejashwi dismissed rumours of contesting multiple seats, saying, “The voters of Raghopur have reposed their trust in me twice. I am contesting only this one seat. But I want the people of Bihar to think they’re voting for Tejashwi in all 243 constituencies.”He pledged to transform Bihar’s governance, saying the polls were about “not just changing the government but changing Bihar.” The RJD, as part of the INDIA bloc, has promised to bring a Job Guarantee Act ensuring one government job per household if elected.Thousands of supporters lined the 40-km route from Patna to Hajipur as the RJD convoy moved towards the collectorate, showering the Yadav family’s car with flower petals. Lalu Prasad, in a wheelchair, accompanied his son into the nomination venue.","The race for Bihar’s 2025 Assembly elections intensified on Wednesday with a flurry of major developments across parties.

Delhi has only one CSIR-NEERI registered manufacturer of green crackers while there are 140 certified dealers, he pointed out.“We held a meeting with 140 certified dealers to sell only NEERI-approved green crackers bearing QR codes. If more dealers apply for licences, we may give temporary licences to additional vendors,” said Sirsa, who chaired meetings with dealers and enforcement agencies, including PESO, NEERI, MCD, NDMC, and Delhi Police.Delhi Police has been directed to process temporary sale licence applications within two days, ensuring timely readiness. After Diwali, retailers will get two days to return or safely dispose of unsold stock, ensuring that restrictions are reinstated immediately.Asked about the city markets being flooded with all kinds of firecrackers, Sirsa said the enforcement teams will act against those selling illegally. “Since crackers were banned till now, people were sneaking them in. As green crackers have been allowed now, we will have an organised system,” he said.The Delhi govt will continue monitoring AQI levels from Oct 14 to 25 through DPCC and submit daily reports to CPCB and the Supreme Court in line with the court’s directives.“This Diwali, retailers are also our partners in spreading awareness. They must inform buyers that only green crackers are allowed and explain why the Hon’ble Supreme Court has wisely restricted their use to two hours in the evening and one hour in the morning for two days. This relaxation is temporary, and if Delhi shows discipline and compliance, it can become permanent.

Carbon dioxide levels increase by record amount to new highs in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/carbon-dioxide-levels-increase-by-record-amount-to-new-highs-in-2024/articleshow/124584004.cms,"Representative image

Carbon dioxide – continued emissions and less effective carbon sinks

Methane and Nitrous Oxide

BATHINDA: Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere soared by a record amount to new highs in 2024, committing the planet to more long-term temperature increase, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin said continued emissions of CO2 from human activities and an upsurge from wildfires were responsible, as well as reduced CO2 absorption by “sinks” such as land ecosystems and the ocean – in what threatens to be a vicious climate cycle.Growth rates of CO2 have tripled since the 1960s, accelerating from an annual average increase of 0.8 ppm per year to 2.4 ppm per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020. From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957.“The heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather. Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide – the second and third most important long-lived greenhouse gases related to human activities – have also risen to record levels.WMO released the annual greenhouse gas bulletin to provide authoritative scientific information for the UN Climate Change conference in November. The COP 30 meeting in Belém, Brazil, will seek to ramp up climate action.“Sustaining and expanding greenhouse gas monitoring are critical to support such efforts,” said Oksana Tarasova, coordinator of the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, which is one of WMO’s flagship scientific reports and is now in its 21st issue.When the bulletin was first published in 2004, the annual average level of CO2 measured by WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations was 377.1 ppm. In 2024 it was 423.9 ppm.About half of the total CO2 emitted each year remains in the atmosphere and the rest is absorbed by Earth’s land ecosystems and oceans. However, this storage is not permanent. As global temperature rises, the oceans absorb less CO2 because of decreased solubility at higher temperatures, whilst land sinks are impacted on a number of ways, including the potential for more persistent drought.The likely reason for the record growth between 2023 and 2024 was a large contribution from wildfire emissions and a reduced uptake of CO2 by land and the ocean in 2024 – the warmest year on record, with a strong El Niño.During El Niño years, CO2 levels tend to rise because the efficiency of land carbon sinks is reduced by drier vegetation and forest fires – as was the case with exceptional drought and fires in the Amazon and southern Africa in 2024.“There is concern that terrestrial and ocean CO2 sinks are becoming less effective, which will increase the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating global warming . Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops,” said Oksana Tarasova, a WMO senior scientific officer.Today’s CO2 emissions to the atmosphere not only impact global climate today, but will do so for hundreds of years because of its long lifetime in the atmosphere.Methane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect on our climate by long-lived greenhouse gases and has a lifetime of about nine years. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands) which are sensitive to climate as well, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as cattle, rice farming, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning.The globally averaged methane concentration in 2024 were 1942 parts per billion (ppb) – an increase of 166% above pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.Nitrous oxide is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and comes from both natural sources and due to human activities such as biomass burning, fertiliser use and various industrial processes.The globally averaged concentration reached 338.0 ppb in 2024, an increase of 25% over the pre-industrial level.","From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957.

"'Less harmful, not safe': Green crackers cleaner but far from risk-free, say experts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/less-harmful-not-safe-green-crackers-cleaner-but-far-from-risk-free-say-experts/articleshow/124583596.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR during Diwali , subject to time restrictions: 6 am to 7 am and 8 pm to 10 pm on the day before Diwali and on the festival day itself. The court had first imposed a ban on firecrackers in the region in 2014-15 due to rising pollution levels.But are the green crackers completely safe?Designed to reduce emissions by about 30%, green crackers are a cleaner alternative to traditional firecrackers, created in India to tackle air and noise pollution during festivals like Diwali.While these specially formulated fireworks are considered environmentally friendlier, experts caution that they are not entirely harmless.Green crackers were first introduced in 2018 by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR–NEERI), in collaboration with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and other scientific bodies. The crackers were developed in response to dangerously high pollution levels in cities such as Delhi, especially during the winter months, news agency PTI reported Dipankar Saha, former additional director and head of air laboratories at CPCB Delhi as saying.Unlike conventional firecrackers, green crackers use less toxic raw materials and avoid harmful chemicals like barium nitrate and aluminium, which contribute heavily to air pollution and can trigger respiratory problems and other health issues. During ignition, these crackers release water vapour or dust suppressants, which help reduce particulate matter in the air. Laboratory tests show that these modifications cut emissions by up to 30%.In addition to lower air pollution, green crackers produce less noise, making them a safer option for children, the elderly, animals, and people with health sensitivities. Reduced decibel levels also help address noise pollution, a major concern during festival seasons.Green crackers are officially approved by the CPCB, and only variants certified by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) are legally permitted for sale and use. Authentic products carry the CPCB logo on their packaging. Popular approved types include SWAS (Safe Water Releaser), STAR (Safe Thermite Cracker), and SAFAL (Safe Minimal Aluminium Cracker), designed to balance cultural celebrations with environmental responsibility.However, environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari warned that while green crackers are a better choice, they are “less harmful, not safe.” She stressed that the release of ultrafine particles and toxic gases still occurs, and limiting the overall use of firecrackers remains the most effective way to reduce festival pollution.Meanwhile, air pollution curbs (GRAP) stage 1 were imposed a day before as air quality detoriated.",The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR during Diwali. The court had first imposed a ban on firecracker in the region in 2014-15 due to rising pollution levels.

Congress MP Manickam Tagore and TMC MP Saket Gokhale demanded that government scrap the changes without delay.Tagore and Gokhale focused on the changes that state that Provident Fund money can be withdrawn only after 12 months of unemployment, and pension can be withdrawn only after 36 months. The period for withdrawal for both the categories was two months till now.Tagore said, “Besides the withdrawal norms, 25% of your own EPF will be locked forever. Who benefits from this, PM Modi ? Certainly not the workers. Imagine a worker who loses his job or a retiree waiting for years to access his hard-earned savings — while government writes off lakhs of crores for its crony friends.

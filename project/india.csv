Visuals of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy's office-residence have emerged showcasing unprecedented grandeaur of a luxurious seaside mansion on Rushikonda hill in Visakhapatnam.The coastal property, which critics call Andhra's ',' features four extensive blocks spread across 10 acres.The Rushikonda structure, which Chandrababu Naidu 's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) says was initially proposed as Reddy's camp office, now features lavish interiors with gold accents, Italian marble floors, premium furniture, bright chandeliers and bathtubs.The facility boasts comprehensive infrastructure including well-constructed roads, drainage networks, substantial water supply and a 100 KV electrical substation.Similar to Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal's ',' Andhra Pradesh's new administration faces uncertainty regarding the building's utilisation. The renovation of Kejriwal's official residence at Flagstaff Road, Civil Lines - which the BJP used effectively against him in elections - cost Rs 33 crore, up from the initial Rs 7.9 crore estimate.According to TDP, the project's purpose changed multiple times during development - initially presented as a luxury hotel, then proposed as the chief minister's camp office, and later suggested as a tourism venture.Despite receiving CRZ (Coastal Regulatory Zone) approval from central authorities in May 2021, concerns exist about the extensive demolition of Rushikonda hill during construction.The project, initially presented as a premium hotel with a Rs 91 crore budget, has reportedly exceeded Rs 500 crore upon completion, according to TDP assertions.The Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggests that including furnishings would significantly increase the total cost.","Jagan Mohan Reddy's seaside mansion on Rushikonda hill in Visakhapatnam features four extensive blocks spread across 10 acres.

The Union law ministry has asked a district court in Ahmedabad to deliver a summons issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to billionaire Gautam Adani over alleged securities fraud and a $265 million bribery scheme, according to a letter dated Feb 25, seen by Reuters.The summons, issued under Hague Service Convention that does not allow the serving of legal documents directly to defendants in India, would require Adani or his legal counsel to appear in the case in the US, said Indian lawyers.Adani and the law ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adani Group has, in the past, termed the allegations ‘baseless’ and vowed to seek all possible legal recourse’. The summons does not imply an extradition risk for the businessman, according to a lawyer. “Extradition proceedings only come in to the picture if the US court issues warrants of arrest,” said Malak Bhatt, founding partner at NM Law Chambers.However, Arshdeep Khurana, a criminal lawyer in India, said, “The summons seems to be for appearance in a court in New York.

NEW DELHI: Govt told the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that 13,000 more general tickets than the daily average were sold at New Delhi railway station on Feb 15, the day 18 people died because of a crowd rush. “On Feb 15, approximately 49,000 general tickets were issued from New Delhi railway station, which were 13,000 more than the daily average number of tickets sold during the previous six months,” railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in a written reply to TMC member Mala Roy.The minister, however, stressed that “to cater to this extra” (demand), five Kumbh special trains , each with room to accommodate 3,000 passengers, were operated from NDLS. He also pointed out that “unreserved tickets issued from a particular station on a particular date may or may not be for that station and date”, in a reference to the usual practice of passengers buying tickets well ahead of the travel date.Five trains were sufficient for 15,000 extra passengers,” the minister said. Railways has since transferred the divisional and additional divisional managers of Delhi along with the station director and senior divisional commercial manager pending completion of an inquiry into the crowd rush.Roy had asked for “details of average general rail ticket sale in New Delhi railway station per day during the last six months; the number of general rail ticket sale from New Delhi railway station on Feb 15, 2025; and whether sale of tickets was abnormally high, and, if so, the reasons thereof ”.In his reply, Vaishnaw gave details of how unreserved tickets can be procured through various ticketing counters and not necessarily at the station counter. “Unreserved tickets for distance up to 199km can be procured on the same day while advance period for procuring unreserved tickets for a distance of 200 km and above is three days.Further, from a railway station, unreserved tickets can be issued for the journey originating from any of the cluster stations defined in the system, viz from New Delhi railway station, unreserved tickets can be issued for the journey originating from any of the 57 stations of Delhi area,” he said.","13,000 more general tickets than the daily average were sold at New Delhi railway station on Feb 15, the day 18 people died because of a crowd rush.

BENGALURU: Forget Chandrayaan, Isro. If you really want to test lunar terrain, just get your mission vehicles to take a drive down Bellandur's crater-riddled roads! This was the new cry that echoed in the IT hub Wednesday.With deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar scheduled to visit Bellandur at 4pm, hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital. Waving placards that read, ‘No Need for Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!', frustrated residents chanted ""Beku beku, road beku."" That Shivakumar did not turn up only left them angry and frustrated.""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay , an elderly resident, adding, ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another resident, fumed over the neglect of one of the city's key localities. ""We are the creme de la creme of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar — how hard is it to fix it quickly?""A resident of Mantri Espana highlighted the daily struggle. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed. Just yesterday (Tuesday), I took my father to an eye hospital — a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, recalled how she used to cycle on the lake road four years ago. ""Now, I wouldn't dare. What used to be a smooth ride turned into a bone-rattling nightmare. Every day, travelling just seven kilometres is an ordeal.""Rajesh Narka, representing Bellandur Rising 2025 initiative, called for swift action. ""Bellandur is home to some of the biggest IT hubs, yet the roads are in a shambles. We take pride in our city, but we cannot be expected to tolerate this mess. If the govt really wanted to fix this, it wouldn't have taken long.""Joginder Yadav, a resident, pointed to the irony of last-minute patchwork before the DCM's scheduled visit. ""BBMP suddenly laid gravel and sprinkled water just because a minister was expected. Illegal parking, footpath encroachments and lack of traffic lights make things worse. We pay our taxes — we contribute to nation-building. Even though many of us are migrants, the govt should remember ‘Atithi Devo Bhava' and give us basic infrastructure in return,"" he said.","Hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital.

""Most international currencies have double strokes such as the Australian dollar, Korean yen, the Euro or the Lira.

NEW DELHI: Diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh may have nose-dived since Sheikh Hasina’s ouster last year, but the military relationship continues as before. The navies from the two countries have just concluded a combat exercise and coordinated patrol in the Bay of Bengal this week.The bilateral 'Bongosagar’ exercise, in which Indian destroyer INS Ranvir and Bangladeshi frigate BNS Abu Ubaidah took part, facilitated “collaborative responses to shared maritime challenges” and enhanced interoperability between the two navies, an officer said on Thursday.The latest edition of the annual exercise, which began in 2019, involved a range of complex operations encompassing surface firing, tactical manoeuvres, underway replenishment, communication drills, and VBSS (visit, board, search and seizure) operations.“The exercise provided a wonderful opportunity for both navies to develop closer links in tactical planning, coordination and information sharing for undertaking seamless maritime operations,” the official said.“The enhanced synergy of operations between the two navies is a testament to the shared commitment of countering global security challenges towards enhancing security and stability in the region,” he added.India has steadily stepped-up military ties with Bangladesh, which incidentally acquired its first-ever diesel-electric submarines from China a few years ago, to counter Beijing’s strategic inroads into the country. Around 50-60 Bangladesh Army officers, for instance, attend specialized courses in Indian military establishments every year.Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had recently said that India and Bangladesh consider each other “strategically important” neighbours and any kind of “animosity” between the two countries is not in the interest of either. The relationship between the two militaries is “very strong” and “we are able to exchange notes whenever we want,” he said.Gen Dwivedi, however, had expressed “concern” over reports that a Pak Army-ISI delegation recently visited areas in Bangladesh close to the `Chicken's Neck’ or the Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal.“I had used the word epicenter of terrorism for a particular country (Pakistan). Now those countrymen, if they go to any other place and they happen to be our neighbour, as far as I am concerned, I should be concerned about it. That they should not be able to use that soil to send terrorists to India,” he said.Also read: 'Sheikh Hasina coming back as PM': Awami League leader thanks India, says Bangladesh youth 'made mistake'","The navies from the two countries have just concluded a combat exercise and coordinated patrol in the Bay of Bengal.

With the body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family, authorities there said Wednesday they expect protests and blockade in the district to end soon.However, the road to lasting peace in the restive state may be a long way off. Ongoing talks between the Kuki-Zo community and Centre’s interlocutor A K Mishra are unlikely to make much headway with the former sticking to its demand for a “separate hill state” after hiving off Meitei-dominated Valley areas.The demand, which goes against the Constitutional framework, will not be acceptable to the Centre.Govt also does not seem keen to concede to the Kuki demand for a separate administrative framework for the tribal-dominated hilly regions either, recognising that it can fuel the demand for a separate state, besides giving fillip to separatist tendencies in the strategically crucial border state.Still, efforts would be to stay engaged with both Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, while tactfully persuading the latter to settle for a solution within the four corners of the Constitution, including granting them more autonomy and preserving their unique culture, heritage and language.Sources said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of Kangpokpi had been engaging with Kuki-Zo protestors over the past few days to persuade them to accept the body of the local killed during protests on March 8, amid clashes between them and security forces.The killing had triggered further tension with Kuki-Zo protestors ordering a shutdown, apart from blocking roads and stopping the movement of vehicles. “The blockade call was given for all areas with a significant Kuki-Zo population. But its effect was seen largely in Kangpokpi. However, the talks between the local administration and community representatives have made headway, with the family of the deceased protester taking back his body for last rites,” said a Manipur govt functionary.A senior Manipur police functionary shared that a total 4,500 weapons, including those looted after ethnic violence broke out in Manipur in May 2023, were now back with police. Of these, around 1,050 were surrendered by rebels in response to a call given by Governor Ajay Bhalla.“The remaining weapons were recovered in raids and searches undertaken over time by police and security forces. These raids shall continue, now that the deadline set by the governor to voluntarily surrender weapons has ended,” said the functionary.Manipur MP Bimol Akoijam protested in Lok Sabha that his question about the state was removed from the list of questions after having been listed initially. He raised the issue in Lok Sabha during the zero hour. Jagdambika Pal, who was in the chair, denied permission to raise the issue. “This issue cannot be raised here,” he said. Akoijam has been raising issues related to the state which is affected by ethnic strife for around two years. His office, however, refused to answer what the issue was about.","The body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family on Wednesday.

While traveling from India to Dubai, people are curious about the legal restrictions on carrying gold. Whether you are carrying gold for personal consumption or as a gift, it is important to know the customs rules and duties to prevent any legal issues. India has certain regulations regarding the amount of gold you can carry, and carrying more than that can lead to heavy fines or confiscation. In this comprehensive guide, we'll take you through the main customs rules, gold duty rates, and advice on avoiding running afoul of Indian laws while carrying gold. Stay updated to make your trip smooth and problem-free.As per the CBIC guidelines, Indian passengers returning from Dubai after a stay of more than six months can bring up to 1 kg of gold with them. However, as per Economic Times report, this is allowed only if they pay the applicable customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, coins, or bars. It is important for travelers to carry proper documentation, such as purchase invoices, that provide details on the price, purity, and date of purchase. These documents are required for verification during customs clearance at Indian airports, ensuring the process goes smoothly and in compliance with regulations.Men returning to India from Dubai are allowed to carry up to 20 grams of gold, with a maximum value of Rs 50,000, duty-free. If they exceed this limit, customs duty will apply.Women are allowed to bring up to 40 grams of gold, valued at Rs 1 lakh, without paying customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, bars, or coins for personal use. Any quantity over this limit will incur customs duty.Children are also allowed to carry up to 40 grams of gold as gifts or for personal use, provided they show proof of relationship and proper invoices.The customs duty on gold can vary depending on how long a traveler has stayed in Dubai.Travelers staying in Dubai for more than six months may also benefit from a reduction in customs duty, with a remission of 12.5% and an additional 1.25% social welfare surcharge on gold brought back to India.The customs duty for gold bars and coins depends on their weight.The customs duty is calculated based on the international price of 24K gold on the day of import. Customs officers assess the value of the gold and apply the corresponding duty rate. To avoid complications, it’s crucial to have accurate invoices and certificates for purity and weight. As per reports from Economic Times, If the proper documentation is not provided, the traveler may face penalties, including confiscation of the gold.If you’re carrying more gold than the duty-free limit allows, you must declare it at the airport. Passengers should use the Red Channel for declaring goods and paying any applicable customs duty. The Green Channel is only for those who are carrying goods within the permissible limits. As per the Customs Act, 1962, failing to declare excess gold can lead to confiscation, penalties, and possible legal action.","Men returning to India from Dubai are allowed to carry up to 20 grams of gold, with a maximum value of Rs 50,000, duty-free. Women can bring up to 40 grams, valued at Rs 1 lakh, paying customs duty. Gold can be in the form of jewelry, bars, or coins for personal use.

NEW DELHI: The post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault, ruling out a “terrorist attack” angle.The trauma injuries , including to their heads, point to their death by “accidental fall from a height,” said sources.Sharing this, sources in the J&K govt also told TOI that two more minors, who went missing from the same district — they were reported by their family as missing only a couple of days ago though they have been gone since Feb 28 — had an argument with their family and possibly left home to work elsewhere on daily wages.This, the sources said, has happened before with the cousins, aged 12 and 15 and both herders, staying away from their family home for days to do daily-wage jobs. The police are making enquiries with their relatives and past employers to trace them.As per the post-mortem reports of the three Kathua residents — identified as Darshan Singh, 40, Yogesh Singh, 32, and Varun Singh, 15 — whose bodies were discovered on March 8 in a gorge next to a waterfall, the cause of their death was trauma and head injury, purportedly caused by their accidentally slipping in the dark, down a rocky gorge. A backpack carried by one of them got stuck on a branch as they fell. A mobile used by them was also recovered from the spot. A liquor bottle with half of its contents consumed was found, pointing to possible inebriated state of the two adults.“Their viscera reports are now awaited for further insight into the cause and circumstances of the deaths,” said a source.Interviews with the family members of the three deceased persons, who were on their way to a wedding in Lohai Malhar, revealed that they were in touch with them over phone till the evening of March 5 and had even communicated that they had lost their way while moving with wedding party.

NEW DELHI: India and Mauritius upgraded their ties to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership as PM Narendra Modi held formal talks with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, reaffirming commitment to a free, open and secure Indian Ocean and pledging full support for the security of Mauritius’s Exclusive Economic Zone, including through increased deployment of ships and aircraft.Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South, 10 years after he announced India’s ‘Vision Sagar’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region) from the same strategically located Indian Ocean country that, he said, connects India to the wider Global South.It shall encompass the ideas of trade for development, capacity building for sustainable growth, and mutual security for a shared future. Under this, we will extend cooperation through technology sharing, concessional loan and grants,” Modi said, describing Mauritius also as a special partner in the region.Modi’s meeting with Ramgoolam was followed by signing of eight agreements and several announcements, including construction of a new Mauritius Parliament building by India, which Modi said would be a gift from the “mother of democracy”.India had last year welcomed the UK-Mauritius agreement for Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, which houses a US-UK military base, and Modi reiterated India’s “firm support” for Mauritius on this issue. Ramgoolam thanked Modi for his personal support and engagement with global representatives on this issue, according to a joint statement that described the two countries as natural partners.“We fully respect the sovereignty of Mauritius with regard to Chagos. We will extend our cooperation through forums such as the Colombo Security Conclave, Indian Ocean Rim Association, and Indian Ocean Conference,” Modi said in his media statement after the meeting.India also announced a rupee-denominated line of credit amounting to Rs 487 crore for undertaking the replacement of water pipelines in Mauritius. “It is the first-ever Indian rupee-based line of credit that’s being extended by India to any country and, therefore, a significant development,” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.Modi laid special emphasis on defence and maritime security cooperation, calling it a key pillar of the strategic partnership and committing to fulfil all the needs of the local coast guard. “India shall also assist in setting up of the police academy and National Maritime Information Sharing Centre in Mauritius. Cooperation will be further strengthened in white shipping, blue economy, and hydrography,” he said.According to the joint statement, Ramgoolam thanked Modi for “unwavering support” to Mauritius in protecting its vast EEZ through provisioning of defence and maritime assets, regular deployment of ships and aircraft, conducting joint maritime surveillance, hydrographic surveys and patrolling, bilateral exercises and information sharing and training support, “thereby emerging as a significant security provider for Mauritius”.The representatives also agreed to deepen cooperation towards securing the EEZ of Mauritius, including through enhanced utilisation of a new runway and jetty on the Agalega islands that India has built amid increasing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.The representatives called for ratifying the protocol on amendment of double taxation avoidance agreement, which was signed last year, at the earliest “to harmonise with international standards on treaty abuse, after ongoing discussions are concluded”. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Mauritius had sought some clarification and those had been addressed by India at a very high level. “Our aim is to set at rest all doubts and provide satisfaction to our friends and colleagues from Mauritius that they have a good and a solid agreement on this front… we very much hope that Mauritius will complete its internal processes at the soonest, and the protocol will come into force very quickly,” he added.",Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has flagged that the housing and urban affairs ministry may not be able to spend over Rs 50,000 crore of the Centre’s allocation for the second phase of its urban rejuvenation scheme , AMRUT, even after the tenure ends in March 2026. It has also highlighted how the ministry is unable to utilise funds for the National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM) as the cabinet has not yet approved it, despite it being announced in the last budget.The panel, in its report on the ‘Demand for Grants for 2025-26’ tabled in both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday, stated that the public bus transport scheme, which was announced in the 2021-22 Budget, was approved by govt only in Aug 2023 as the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme . The funds under this scheme were, “for the first time, actually spent during the financial year 2024-25”.Similarly, the NUDM, which was announced as a new scheme in the July 2024 Budget with an allocation of Rs 1,150 crore for FY 2024-25, has yet to receive cabinet approval. “The funds allocated thus remained unutilised,” it said.On fund utilisation under the AMRUT 2.0 mission, which was launched in Oct 2021 with the target to make cities ‘water secure’ and provide functional water tap connections to all households in all of about 4,852 urban local bodies and universal coverage of sewerage and septage management in 500 AMRUT cities, the panel observed that the size of the scheme was Rs 2.8 lakh crore, including the central share of Rs 76,760 crore for five years (2021-22 to 2025-26). However, only Rs 13,172 crore central assistance has been disbursed so far since the inception of the scheme and the total outlay for 2025-26 is Rs 10,000 crore.“Accordingly, post proposed budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore, the remaining amount of the central share for the mission will be Rs 52,651 crore. The committee has observed that even after the utilisation of the proposed budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore in the FY 2025-26, the mission which is ending in 2026 still has to spend 68% of its centre share of Rs 76,760 crore,” it added.In its report, the panel on PM-eBus Sewa Scheme, which targets to deploy 10,000 electric buses, mentioned that the ministry has informed that the total demand of buses so far tendered for aggregation stands 6,518 from 13 states and four UTs. Flagging concerns, it said the eligibility of buses per city based on the 2011 census may not provide the correct parameter for their allocation.It added that the central assistance (CA) of Rs 24, Rs 22 and Rs 20 per km proposed to be provided for 12, 9 and 7 metre buses is less and may result in increased financial burden on municipal corporations. Similarly, the condition of fixed assured kms of 160, 180 and 200 for 7, 9 and 12 metre respectively needs to be revisited as many municipal buses operate only for 150-160 kms daily.","A parliamentary panel has flagged that the housing and urban affairs ministry may not be able to spend over Rs 50,000 crore of the Centre’s allocation for the second phase of its urban rejuvenation scheme.

NEW DELHI: After Airtel and Jio announced partnerships with Starlink in the last couple of days, opposition Congress and CPM on Thursday raised national security concerns and the former alleged that the deals were “orchestrated” by PM Narendra Modi “to buy goodwill” with US President Donald Trump through Starlink owner Elon Musk.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said Airtel and Jio had announced partnerships with Starlink within 12 hours of each other, seemingly overcoming their objections to its entry into India.“It is abundantly clear that these partnerships have been orchestrated by none other than the PM himself to buy goodwill with President Trump through Starlink owner Elon Musk,” he alleged.“But many questions remain. Perhaps the most important one relates to national security. Who will have the power to switch connectivity on or off when national security demands it? Will it be Starlink or its Indian partners? Will other satellite-based connectivity providers also be permitted and on what basis?” Ramesh asked on X.He added that the much larger question of Tesla manufacturing in India remained unanswered. “Is there some commitment to it now that Starlink’s entry into India has been facilitated,” he asked.Pointing out that “Supreme Court had held in the 2G case that spectrum is a scarce resource and can be allocated to private players only through open, transparent auction”, the CPM politburo said, “Any private deal for allocating spectrum would be a violation of the law of the land.Jio, Airtel and Starlink coming together to form a cartel to dominate satellite spectrum use will be at the cost of millions of telecom subscribers in India.” CPM added that satellite spectrum should be allocated exclusively for strategic uses, such as defence and Isro operations.The party said telecom services were critical for a country’s defence. “It is now known that US threats to stop Starlink services to Ukraine military forced Zelensky to concede US demands on handing over its natural resources and negotiating with Russia under US aegis,” it added.",Airtel and Jio announced partnerships with Starlink in the last couple of days.

NEW DELHI: CBSE Class 12 students unable to appear in Hindi exam scheduled on March 15 on account of Holi will get another opportunity to write the paper, the board announced Thursday.“It has been informed to CBSE that, though the festival of Holi would be celebrated on March 14 in most parts of the country, in few places, either the celebrations would take place on March 15 or celebrations would spill over to March 15,” CBSE examination controller Sanyam Bhardwaj.He said while examination will be held as per schedule, students who find it difficult to appear on March 15 may choose to write the paper on a later date. “Such students would be given an opportunity to appear along with those students for whom a special examination is conducted as per policy of the board for students participating in national or international sports events,” he added.","CBSE Class 12 students unable to appear in Hindi exam scheduled on March 15 on account of Holi will get another opportunity to write the paper.

NEW DELHI: In past five years, barely 1,525 driving licenses (DLs) were cancelled for committing traffic violations , despite all the talk about efforts to catch violators through digital capture. While 50% of the cancellations occurred in Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Bengal reported only three each, followed by four in Haryana.Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari provided these details in a written response to a question in Rajya Sabha this week quoting data from Sarathi portal, the centralised database for drivers.In reply to a query raised by BJP MP Medha Vishram Kulkarni, the minister said Assam, Bihar, Kerala, UP and Rajasthan recorded cancellations of 104, 158, 119, 105 and 94 DLs, respectively. Only 15 licences were cancelled in Maharashtra.As per the ministry, 463 DLs were cancelled for speed, rash and negligent driving in TN, Rajasthan, Bihar and Gujarat. In UP and Uttarakhand, all 105 and 47 licences respectively were cancelled for use of mobile phones while driving. Total 42 licences were cancelled for overloading of goods and passengers while in 35 cases DLs were cancelled for not wearing helmets.TN is the only state where 14 licences were cancelled for jumping traffic signals and 261 DLs were cancelled for providing fake information to obtain licence. On reasons for such miniscule cancellation of DLs, ex-Delhi deputy transport commissioner Anil Chhikara said, “ While authorities have power to cancel DLs of habitual violators, our RTOs have little time to deal with these cases.”","50% of the cancellations occurred in Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Bengal.

CHENNAI: Opening a new front in the battle of languages, the Stalin govt in Tamil Nadu unveiled Thursday a logo for the state budget to be presented Friday, using the Tamil letter “roo” — which signifies “roobai”, Tamil for rupee — to replace the rupee symbol (₹).Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and TN BJP chief K Annamalai criticised the CM, saying the ‘₹’ symbol, designed by D Udhayakumar, son of former DMK MLA N Dharmalingam, was endorsed by M Karunanidhi, and Stalin was being “stupid”.State planning commission vice-chairman J Jeyaranjan said the rupee symbol was in Devanagari script and it was decided to drop it and use the Tamil letter “roo”. Sharing an old picture of former CM M Karunanidhi appreciating Udhayakumar for the design, Annamalai said on X, “What father endorsed, son rejects.”Sitharaman posted on X: “If the DMK has a problem with ‘’, why didn’t it protest back in 2010 when it was officially adopted under the Congress-led UPA govt, at a time when DMK was part of the ruling alliance at the Centre?” DMK MLA and state planning commission member N Ezhilan countered: “BJP is playing a double game. For a long time they claimed to be giving importance to the mother tongue, and now, when our CM has used ‘roo’ in Tamil for rupee, they are opposing it.”Calling it an “example of language and regional chauvinism”, Nirmala Sitharaman said, “This is more than mere symbolism. It signals a dangerous mindset that weakens Indian unity and promotes secessionist sentiments under the pretence of regional pride.”Udhayakumar, a professor at IIT Guwahati’s design department who designed the official rupee symbol, such a debate was unnecessary. “I used the Devanagari script as the base to design the rupee symbol. It was a competition back then, and I had to stick to the rules of the competition. Devanagari is a script that is used not just by the Hindi language but also by Sanskrit and some minor languages. So, restricting the debate to Tamil vs Hindi in this issue is unnecessary, I think,” Udhayakumar said.Former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan joined the chorus. “Let Stalin change his name to a Tamil name. To hide all the failures of his govt, this drama continues... DMK always talks of separatism and with an anti-national mindset, they are against national integrity,” she said. Sitharaman said the Tamil word “rupaai” has links to Sanskrit.“The Tamil word rupaai itself has deep roots in the Sanskrit word ‘rupya’, meaning ‘wrought silver’ or ‘a worked silver coin’. This term has resonated across centuries in Tamil trade and literature, and even today ‘rupaai’ remains the currency name in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka.”Saying the rupee symbol is internationally well-recognised and serves as a visible identity of India in global financial transactions, Sitharaman asked, “At a time when India is pushing for cross-border payments using UPI, should we really be undermining our own national currency symbol?” Sitharaman added that removing “a national symbol like the rupee from the state budget document goes against that very oath that all elected representatives and authorities take under the Constitution — to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of our nation”.Congress steered clear of the controversy triggered by Tamil Nadu’s decision to replace the symbol of rupee which is in Hindi with Tamil letter for “Ru” in the official logo for the state’s budget. Congress kept mum on the issue that played non-stop on television channels on Thursday.Though allies, Congress has chosen to strike a balance between its political partnership and prudence, as DMK has taken a lead in triggering debates around its core issues. Congress has not spoken yet on the three language controversy that DMK has espoused in recent weeks with a strong attack on the Modi govt and BJP.Karnataka deputy CM D K Shivakumar was nominated on Thursday to represent the state in a March 22 meeting convened by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin in Chennai to firm up a joint strategy against the Union govt’s proposal for population-based delimitation .Shivakumar was picked despite him advocating a nuanced approach to Stalin’s invitation, suggesting he differed with CM Siddaramaiah, who backed the campaign immediately after meeting a TN delegation in Bengaluru. Sources said although Stalin wanted Siddaramaiah to attend the meeting, the latter chose to depute Shivakumar because of a knee injury and some prior commitments.Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy on Thursday termed the proposed population-based delimitation of constituencies an imposed “limitation for southern states” that the region would counter through concerted action, starting with TN counterpart MK Stalin’s March 22 strategy meeting in Chennai.Revanth, who along with Stalin has been among the more vocal opponents of the Union govt’s plan, confirmed he would attend the Chennai conclave. “BJP does not have much representation from the southern states and hence wants to take revenge on these states after its (electoral) defeats in south India,” he said.","Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin releases ‘Economic Survey Report 2024-25’ Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and TN BJP chief K Annamalai criticised the CM, saying the ‘₹’ symbol was endorsed by M Karunanidhi, and Stalin was being ‘stupid’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118996832,imgsize-126654,width-400,resizemode-4/118996832.jpg"

PUDUCHERRY: Union Territory of Puducherry will implement a three-language policy, home, school, and collegiate education minister A Namassivayam told the assembly on Thursday, refuting Congress’ allegation that Union govt was trying to impose Hindi through National Education Policy .“There is no imposition of Hindi. Students interested in learning a third language can choose one. It is not compulsory for students to learn Hindi; they can opt for a regional language instead,” Namassivayam said.Rejecting Congress member M Vaithianathan’s allegations, Namassivayam said, “It was Congress govt at the Centre that imposed Hindi in the 1960s, sparking widespread agitation in Tamil Nadu. Talk to your party high command to learn about the anti-Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu.”In protest, members of DMK and Congress walked out of the House, only to return a few minutes later. Opposition leader R Siva condemned the govt’s decision, saying in a release that the people of Puducherry would teach a fitting lesson to AINRC and BJP for adopting the three-language policy. Schools in Puducherry and Karaikal, previously affiliated with TN state board of education, switched to CBSE in 2023.

NEW DELHI: India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since US President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign and all of them have returned to their home country, TOI has learnt. These include the planeloads of illegals who landed in Amritsar and those who returned from third countries, mostly Panama, with help from the International Organisation for Migration .Verification of nationality is an ongoing process, and more are expected to be deported sooner than later, but not before their nationality is confirmed like in the past. For India, whether it’s a million or a few thousand, there’s no way of knowing conclusively how many Indians are living illegally in the US as they become Indian only after verification.While extremely large figures - ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 - have been bandied around about the number of Indian illegals in the US, the government has maintained it has no data about the number of “undocumented” Indian immigrants residing in the US.“The reason is that these immigrants have legally exited India but have either overstayed their US visa validity or have entered the US illegally or without valid documents,’’ said MoS (MEA) Kirti Vardhan Singh, responding to a written question in the Rajya Sabha earlier.Various Indian agencies closely scrutinise the list of persons identified for deportation by the US and only those who have been verified to be Indian nationals are accepted for deportation. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in his statement in Parliament that it is the obligation of all countries to accept their nationals living abroad illegally but it is subject to an “unambiguous” verification of their nationality. India has been accepting deportees from the US for the past couple of decades, with the maximum number – 2042 – in 2019. Last year, it took back 1368 illegal Indians.For the Indian government, the real issue remains the need for a crackdown on what Jaishankar had described in his statement in Parliament last month as the illegal migration industry. He had said that law enforcement agencies will take action against agents facilitating illegal migration on the basis of information provided by the deportees.","India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since US President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the March 2026 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah for eliminating Left-wing extremism, Chhattisgarh has come out with a comprehensive policy for surrender of Maoists as well as their relief and rehabilitation, and also that of victims of Naxal violence and civilians aiding police in countering the menace.Okayed at a cabinet meet chaired by CM Vishnu Deo Sai Wednesday, the new policy proposes enhanced financial incentives, education, rehab, jobs and security. It comes at a time when Maoists have been reeling under the biggest-ever offensive by security forces.Kin of those killed in Maoist hits in Chhattisgarh may receive Rs 10 lakh reliefWith the loss of many of their senior members, majority of the Maoist cadre are expected to grab the offers highlighted in the ‘Chhattisgarh Naxalite Surrender/Victim Relief and Rehabilitation Policy-2025’ that combines ensuring security of their lives with promises of financial benefits.Kin including children of deceased victims of Naxal violence could receive relief compensation of Rs 10 lakh; that of a permanently disabled victim, Rs 5 lakh; and a grievously injured one, Rs 2 lakh. Kin of victims killed while assisting police in anti-Naxal operations could receive a total compensation of Rs 15 lakh, though the amount in case of permanently disabled is proposed at Rs 8 lakh and for grievously injured, at Rs 4 lakh.The policy promises enhanced financial incentive to surrendered Maoists (doubled to Rs 50,000), including raised compensation for different categories of surrendered weapons and for leading the police to IEDs and arms/explosives dumps.Turning in a light machine gun (LMG) may get the Maoist Rs 5 lakh, up from Rs 4.5 lakh; an AK-47, Rs 4 lakh instead of Rs 3 lakh; and a .303 rifle, Rs 1.5 lakh instead of Rs 1 lakh. Reward of Rs 3 lakh-12 lakh are proposed for new ranks of Maoists, including zonal/sub-zonal committee commander, militia company commander and communication team commander, etc.For rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists and their family members, the policy — which also covers Maoists from outside the state but engaged in LWE activities within Chhattisgarh — offers free education, quota-based admissions as well as scholarships, besides an annual grant up to Rs 25,000 for education in private institutions.The policy proposes jobs and self-employment opportunities as well as preference in govt schemes. Male Maoists undergoing reverse vasectomy will be reimbursed under the policy. Maoists who aid police shall also be eligible for govt jobs.","Chhattisgarh has come out with a comprehensive policy for surrender of Maoists as well as their relief and rehabilitation.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare has recommended that the age criterion for Ayushman Vay Vandana Cards, meant for senior citizens, be reduced to 60 years and above from 70, irrespective of socio-economic status, for wider coverage.The committee, headed by Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav, has also suggested revising healthcare coverage under Ayushman Bharat PM Jan Arogya Yojana from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per family annually. The Centre recently expanded ABPMJAY to cover six crore senior citizens aged 70 and above belonging to 4.5 crore families under AB-PMJAY Vay Vandana scheme.The recommendations have been made in “163rd report on demands for grants 2025-26 (demand no. 46) of the department of health and family welfare” that was tabled before both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday. In addition, it recommends proactive monitoring of fund utilisation by states, coupled with targeted support to address any implementation challenges.The parliamentary committee said the release of funds to states and UTs should be linked to their performance in terms of card creation, hospital admissions, and beneficiary feedback, ensuring that funds are directed to areas of greatest need and impact.“The committee has come across instances of delay in settlement of claims of empanelled hospitals under ABPMJAY and that the package rates have not been reasonably revised in many states, resulting in inconvenience caused to the patients due to denial of treatment by many empanelled hospitals,” it said.Therefore, states and UTs which have not revised package rates “may be persuaded to revise these on similar lines of rates revised by some of states in 2022”, the committee said. On initiatives like ‘Aapke Dwar Ayushman’, the panel said the campaign should not be confined to the creation of Ayushman cards as this is not the only objective of the scheme.Rather, it recommended that the department of health should make efforts to ensure establishing robust healthcare infrastructure and service delivery in tribal and rural areas",The committee has also suggested revising healthcare coverage under Ayushman Bharat PM Jan Arogya Yojana from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per family annually.

BHOPAL: Police arrested two “forest watchers” at Kanha National Park in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh and booked them under UAPA, on the charge of having ties with Maoists, triggering unrest among forest staff. Many are now seeking transfer for fear of getting caught between Maoists and police.“Watchers” are the ones who patrol forests on foot. “Hamare logon ko tiger se dar nahi lagta saheb, police se lagta hai (We are more scared of police than tigers),” a forest officer said.Police said they arrested the duo, Ashok Kumar Lal and Santosh Kumar Lal, both 28, during a Maoist encounter on Sunday in which an insurgent was killed.“Both of them were good patrol guards, always vigilant. What are they supposed to do? Maoists threaten to kill their families if they don’t help them and, if they do, police arrest them for supporting anti-nationals,” the forest officer, requesting not to be named, said.Mandla police say the duo was caught “signalling” information to Maoists on the movement of security forces. From atop a hillock, they would whistle in a certain way or strike stones together as per a prearranged code to warn Maoists, police said.Forest officers maintain the duo was indeed “signalling” to Maoists — but to collect their food and ration. “They were not signalling Maoists about movement of forces. It’s a wrong perception,” the officer added.Though the duo claimed it was their first interaction with Maoists, investigators say they found handwritten notes and other evidence suggesting a much deeper connection with insurgents.","“Watchers” are the ones who patrol forests on foot.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday lashed out at TMC-led West Bengal govt for its decision to “ban” Holi celebrations in Santiniketan, accusing CM Mamata Banerjee of appeasement politics and focusing on securing the Muslim vote bank for electoral gains.“I would like to tell Hindus of West Bengal to celebrate Holi with full enthusiasm. We will fight together against obstacles created by police. No matter how hard people like Banerjee try, they cannot make West Bengal a land of Islam,” state BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said.West Bengal LoP Suvendu Adhikari criticised the state govt for “banning” Holi celebrations at Santiniketan’s Sonajhuri Haat and claimed the “ban” isn’t limited to one area.“The Birbhum additional SP has ordered that Holi celebrations in Santiniketan should end by 10 am due to it being Friday,” he said. “This is happening in Bengal for the first time,” Adhikari said.Visuals from the Sonajhuri Haat area showed banners stating that the region is a protected forest area, where playing Holi, parking cars, videography, and flying drones are prohibited.Bengal forest minister Birbaha Hansda clarified that her department did not enforce any ban but only requested visitors to be cautious while celebrating the festival of colours. The department’s hoardings and banners were only requests to “save the environment,” and that those who wish to play with colours will not be prevented, Hansda said.","West Bengal LoP Suvendu Adhikari criticised the state govt for “banning” Holi celebrations at Santiniketan’s Sonajhuri Haat. “This is happening in Bengal for the first time,” Adhikaari said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118994529,imgsize-208320,width-400,resizemode-4/118994529.jpg"

BULDHANA/DEULGAON RAJA: Kailash Arjun Nagare received the Maharashtra govt’s Young Farmer Award in 2020. On Thursday he was dead, by suicide. He blamed the state govt in a note he left behind. Nagare (43) had consumed poison a day before Holi . His body was found in his field in Shivni Armal village on Thursday morning.A three-page suicide note found in Nagare’s pocket said: “The administration is ignoring farmers’ issues. Do not remove my body until our demands are met.”Nagare had been demanding irrigation water for 14 villages from Khadakpurna reservoir for many years and last year had staged a 10-day hunger strike for his demands. However, govt inaction left him disheartened. Nagare was a well-known farmer leader in the region.His death sparked unrest in the village, with thousands of farmers raising slogans against the administration. The protesters declared that they would not allow the body to be taken for a postmortem unless the guardian minister or district collector visited the site and gave concrete assurances.The deceased farmer’s wife, Sushila Nagare, who broke down while speaking to the media, said, “My husband took this step because of govt’s negligence. He fought for farmers’ rights, but the administration did nothing. Had they acted in time, he would still be alive today.”Maharashtra Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal launched a scathing attack on Mahayuti govt and CM Devendra Fadnavis. “This govt is busy playing Hindu-Muslim politics while ignoring real farmer issues. Na- gare was fighting for farmers’ rights, but instead of addressing his concerns the govt forced him to take his own life.” Buldhana’s Kranti Kisan Sangathan leader Ravikant Tupkar called the incident a direct consequence of govt failure.“This is not suicide but a murder due to govt policies. Instead of supporting farmers, govt is pushing them towards death. We demand that the govt be held accountable and booked for murder.” Nagare is survived by his father, wife, and three children.",Kailash Arjun Nagare consumed poison a day before Holi.

BENGALURU: In the gold-smuggling case involving Kannada actor Ranya Rao , CBI has left the “accused” column blank in the FIR filed on Thursday, causing ripples in political and bureaucratic circles.The omission gives the agency the flexibility to summon any individual, especially as Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) strongly suspects the involvement of a syndicate in the racket. DRI has documented a series of gold-smuggling cases, including two significant busts in quick succession, both pointing to a well-coordinated network operating between Dubai and India.Opening a new front, Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a money-laundering case in Delhi and raided Ranya’s Lavelle Road flat along with five other locations in Bengaluru on Thursday. “Assisted by their Bengaluru counterparts, ED officers raided offices linked to Ranya’s husband in Adugodi, Indiranagar, and Koramangala.Several documents and electronic gadgets were seized during the day-long raid,” a source said. On Mar 6, two foreign nationals were arrested at Mumbai airport with 21.2 kg of gold worth 19 crore, just days after Ranya was caught smuggling 14.2 kg of gold into Bengaluru. Subsequent searches at her home led to further recoveries. The scale and frequency of these operations suggest an intricate network potentially involving foreign nationals and possibly high-ranking government officials.The CBI’s probe, under sections 7 and 12 of Prevention of Corruption Act, has raised the stakes. The case could expose deep-rooted corruption within govt circles, particularly officials allegedly aiding such illegal activities.",CBI has left the ‘accused’ column blank in the FIR filed on Thursday.

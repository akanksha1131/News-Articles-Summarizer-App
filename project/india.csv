Indian startup commissions world's first commercial space surveillance sat; SCOT captures image of South America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-startup-commissions-worlds-first-commercial-space-surveillance-sat-scot-captures-image-of-south-america/articleshow/118811058.cms,"SCOT capturing the first image of the city of Buenos Aires in South America glowing against the planet's curvature.

New Delhi: The world's first commercial space surveillance satellite of an Indian startup, capable of tracking objects as small as 5 cm orbiting the Earth, was commissioned on Saturday as it captured images over South America.“Space just ran out of hiding spots,” Bengaluru start-up Digantara said in a post on X as its satellite SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking) started operations. Digantara had launched SCOT on Jan 14 aboard Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Transporter-12 rocket.In a statement, the company said the SCOT satellite achieved first light on Saturday and its inaugural image while passing over South America — a breathtaking view of Earth's limb, with the city of Buenos Aires glowing against the planet's curvature.On the satellite’s first show, Digantara CEO Anirudh Sharma posted on X, “A Picture of Possibility, Future of Space based SSA. When we started, doubt was our first companion. Was it even possible for us to achieve what we had set out to do? Space doesn’t reward hesitation. It demands precision, resilience, and belief especially when the odds seem impossible. And yet, here we are. The first raw image from SCOT-1 clicked above South America!”The CEO further said, “SCOT's first image is more than a technical milestone; it's a symbol of our team's resilience and unwavering commitment to safeguarding Earth's orbits for generations to come.”Soon after the SCOT satellite launch in January, PM Narendra Modi had then congratulated the startup and posted on X, “Kudos to Indian space startup @Digantarahq on the success of Mission SCOT. This is an important contribution of the growing Indian space industry towards enhancing space situational awareness .”The satellite is designed to track and monitor objects as small as 5 cm, with a high revisit rate for frequent and precise observations of orbital activity. As space becomes more and more congested, this advanced capability is essential for mitigating collision risks and promoting sustainable space operations by providing accurate and dependable data to satellite operators and regulatory bodies.Former Isro chairman S Somanath congratulated “Digantarahq for making a dream come true. Having our own Space based SSA capability demonstrated by SCOT-1”.SCOT has been deployed in a sun-synchronous orbit that allows it to track objects in low earth orbit with more efficiency than existing sensors, which are restricted by fields of view, weather conditions and geographic limitations.","Digantara launched SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking) on Jan 14 aboard SpaceX's Transporter-12 rocket.

"ITAT rules in Shah Rukh favour, quashes reassessment process",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/itat-rules-in-shah-rukh-favour-quashes-reassessment-process/articleshow/118810677.cms,"Shahrukh Khan

MUMBAI: Superstar Shah Rukh Khan secured a significant victory as the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) ruled in his favour, quashing reassessment proceedings and order initiated by the tax authorities for the 2011-12 financial year.Against an income of Rs 83.42 crore declared by the actor in his income-tax (I-T) return, the tax officer denied his claims for foreign tax credit (for taxes paid in the UK) and reassessed the income as Rs 84.17 crore. Such reassessment was done beyond four years from the end of the relevant assessment year (2012-13).The ITAT bench held that reassessment of the case by the income-tax department was not legally justified, marking a crucial win for the actor in his prolonged battle over foreign tax credit claims.The litigation related to taxation of Khan's remuneration for the movie 'RA One.' As per the agreement between the actor and Red Chillies Entertainments (a film production and distribution company founded by Khan), 70% of the film's shooting was to take place in the UK and therefore 70% of the income would accrue overseas (which would be subject to UK tax including withholding tax). The actor's remuneration, in this regard, was routed through Winford Production, a UK entity. Tax authorities contended that such an arrangement of payment, caused a revenue loss to India. The I-T officer denied the actor's claim for foreign tax credit, that was made in his original I-T return.An Indian resident taxpayer is subject to tax in India on his/her global income. In simple terms, foreign tax credit provisions contained in tax treaties, enable an Indian taxpayer to deduct tax paid in the foreign country from his India tax liability. This prevents double taxation of the same income.In a detailed order, the ITAT bench composed of Sandeep Singh Karhail and Girish Agrawal, ruled that the reassessment proceedings were invalid. The tribunal noted that the assessing officer had failed to demonstrate any fresh tangible material warranting a reassessment beyond the four-year statutory period. It further observed that the disputed issue had already been examined during the initial scrutiny assessment of the case.Citing multiple judicial precedents, the tribunal emphasised that reassessment under Section 147 can be done after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, only if certain conditions were met. For instance, if the income had escaped assessment due to taxpayer's failure to file an I-T return, or respond to a notice. Or, if the tax taxpayer had failed to fully and truly disclose all material facts during the original assessment. The tribunal found no evidence of such failure on Khan's part.The ITAT bench concluded that the re-assessment proceedings were bad in law on more than one count and were not in conformity with the provisions of Section 147, and quashed the same. Tax experts believe that the judgment strengthens the position of Indian taxpayers with overseas earnings, reaffirming that reassessments cannot be arbitrarily initiated without sufficient grounds.","The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) ruled in his favour, quashing reassessment proceedings and order initiated by the tax authorities.

CHENNAI: Just a month after her wedding, Soni Bisht lost her husband, Sepoy Neeraj Singh Bhandari of 18 Kumaon Regiment , in an accident in Jan 2023. Instead of succumbing to grief, she chose to turn pain into purpose, honouring her late husband's dream by donning the Indian Army uniform as an officer.On Saturday, at the Officers Training Academy in Chennai, she marched forward in the Passing Out Parade as a warrior ready to serve.""When I learnt about the Veer Nari entry from officers of Kumaon Regiment, my father encouraged me to take this path,"" said Soni, daughter of retired subedar Kundan Singh of Brigade of Guards Battalion. ""It was an uphill battle, but I conquered every challenge,"" she said, beaming with pride after being commissioned into the Army Ordnance Corps.Among the newly commissioned officers was another cadet, Ved Vijay Neog from Jorhat, Assam, who earned his Indian Army commission after years of struggle. Recommended initially for the Indian Military Academy after graduation, Ved withdrew due to family hardships.In Delhi, he juggled jobs, making coffee by day and delivering food by night to survive. He later found work as a travel photographer with major brands, but his heart remained set on the uniform. Determined, he cleared the Combined Defence Services (CDS) exam and secured his place at the OTA.These two cadets were among the 133 officer cadets and 24 women officer cadets commissioned into various arms and services of the Indian Army. Additionally, five foreign officer cadets and seven women foreign officer cadets from five foreign nations completed their training.The reviewing officer, Lt Gen Johnson P Mathew, chief of Integrated Defence Staff, presented the Sword of Honour to Manya M Kumar, the OTA gold medal to Pragati Thakur, the silver medal to Manya M Kumar, and the bronze medal to Surjeet Yadav. In his address, he urged the young officers to uphold the ethos of selfless service and unwavering excellence in all they do.","Soni Bisht lost her husband, Sepoy Neeraj Singh Bhandari, in an accident in Jan 2023.

'Scholar' who helped ISI abduct Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran shot dead in Balochistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scholar-who-helped-isi-abduct-kulbhushan-jadhav-from-iran-shot-dead-in-balochistan/articleshow/118810539.cms,"Mufti Shah Mir (left) and Kulbhushan Jadhav

Mir had survived two attempts on his life last year

Mufti Shah Mir , accused of helping Pakistan's ISI in kidnapping Indian businessman and former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran, was shot dead on Friday night by unidentified gunmen in Turbat, Balochistan Mir, known to be involved in human trafficking , was leaving the local mosque after Taraweeh (night) prayers when bikers ambushed him and shot him multiple times at point-blank range. According to a report in Dawn, Mir was immediately shifted to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.Mir, a human and arms trafficker, operated under the cover of a mufti (scholar) and was a member of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, an Islamic fundamentalist political party.Sources said he was an important conduit linked with ISI-led death squads and played a significant role in the abduction and extrajudicial killing of numerous Baloch youths. He was also instrumental in spreading religious extremism in Balochistan.In March 2016, Jadhav was abducted by a group led by Mullah Omar Irani of Jaish al-Adl from the Iran-Pakistan border and handed over to the Pakistan army through several intermediaries, including Mir. Irani was also killed, along with his two sons, in the same area (Turbat) in Nov 2020, allegedly by ISI.Mir is also suspected to have been gunned down by ISI operatives in what is believed to be an internal conflict that has been brewing for some time. Last week, two others of JUI-F -- Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah -- were shot dead by bike-borne assailants in what the local police described as targeted killings. The security guard of one also sustained bullet injuries. Mir had also survived two attempts on his life last year and had recently restricted his movements. ""He was providing intelligence about Baloch fighters to the Pak army. In 2023, a teacher named Abdul Rauf was murdered over alleged blasphemy in Turbat. The killing was carried out on the instructions of Mir,"" a source informed.Jadhav, who was running a business in Chabahar (Iran) after a premature retirement from the Navy, was abducted and incarcerated on false charges in Pakistan. He was intercepted in the Chaman area of Balochistan on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on March 3, 2016. In April 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced Jadhav to death, charging him with involvement in espionage and sabotage activities. India condemned the verdict as a premeditated murder. The International Court of Justice stayed the execution while asking the Pakistan government to review the conviction process besides grant consular access to India.","Mufti Shah Mir, accused of helping Pakistan's ISI in kidnapping Indian businessman and former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran, was shot dead on Friday.

AHMEDABAD: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi called for a purge within the party's Gujarat unit, vowing to remove functionaries working covertly for BJP. Addressing party workers in Ahmedabad, Gandhi admitted Saturday that Congress had failed to meet public expectations in the state and stressed the need for an overhaul.""Gujarat is stuck and wants to find a way, but Congress in Gujarat is not in a position to show the way,"" he said. ""I am not ashamed or scared to say that we have not met the expectations of the people of Gujarat.""He highlighted that Congress still holds a 40% vote share in Gujarat and suggested that a modest increase could bring the party back to office. ""One out of every two persons in Gujarat is a Congress supporter. If we can increase our vote share by just 5%, Congress will come to power in the state,"" he said.Gandhi drew a sharp distinction between Congress members dedicated to the party's ideology and those who he accused of being disconnected from the people or colluding with BJP.""There are two types of people in the Gujarat Congress leadership and among workers,"" he said. ""One section is honest with the people, fights for them, respects them, and carries the Congress ideology in their heart. The other section is cut off from the people, does not respect them, and half of them are hand-in-glove with BJP.""He emphasised that without eliminating BJP loyalists within the party, public trust could not be regained.Gandhi urged Congress politicians at all levels to demonstrate complete loyalty to the party's ideology. ""They should carry Congress in their blood. Put the issue of winning and losing the elections aside. As soon as we do that, the people of Gujarat would like to join our organisation, and we will open the door for them,"" he said.His visit concluded with preparations for an AICC session, scheduled in Ahmedabad on April 8 and 9 - the first such session in the state in 64 years.Congress has struggled with defections in Gujarat before elections over the past decade. The party lost ground in 2012 assembly elections, 2017 Rajya Sabha polls when Ahmed Patel barely secured victory, and subsequent state and general elections. Its worst performance came in 2022 assembly elections, after which four more legislators defected, leaving Congress with just 12 seats in the assembly.State Congress president Shaktisinh Gohil affirmed that BJP ""sleeper cells"" (loyalists) in Congress would soon be identified. ""In the coming days, we will ensure that loyal Congress workers get leadership opportunities and not those who get elected on a Congress ticket but work for BJP,"" Gohil said.Congress MLA and Dalit activist Jignesh Mevani said: ""Only those Congress workers who will strongly fight against BJP for the rights of local communities will get leadership and tickets at all levels.""",Congress MP Rahul Gandhi calls for a purge within the party's Gujarat unit.

The Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education ( HPBOSE ) has announced the cancellation of the Class 12 English board exam across all examination centers due to a possible paper leak.

Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

'Rohit Sharma-led Team India will clinch the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title': Astrologer Greenstone Lobo's huge prediction

New Zealand are working on aspects of their game that they feel India may look to exploit when the two teams meet in Dubai on Sunday for the ICC Champions Trophy final , and the Kiwi plans have been laid bare by a net bowler.India started using a four-pronged spin attack from the third game onwards in the group stage of the tournament. Incidentally, that match was against New Zealand, who could only score 205 in response to India's 249 and succumbed to the pressure exerted by the spinners.To prepare for that eventuality once again, the Kiwi batters are training specifically to counter spin, which was revealed to ANI by net bowler Shashwat Tiwari.According to the report, Tiwari said the New Zealanders are probably wary of the threat by Indian spinners, who played a key role in beating New Zealand in the group fixture as well as Australia in the semi-finals.Mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy took seven wickets in those two matches, including a five-for (5 for 42) against the Kiwis.""They are preparing for left-armers,"" Tiwari told ANI. ""I won't say they are struggling. Of course, our Indian team has top-class spinners, but I don't think they will be able to cope with them.""India have the old war horse Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav as their three left-arm spinners. Chakravarthy and Washington Sundar are the other two spinners in the squad.""Today, I fortunately got to bowl (in the nets),"" Tiwari said further.""At one point in time, he (name not revealed in the ANI report) asked me to bowl from 18 yards just to prepare for Ravindra Jadeja. It is because of the kind of pace he (Jadeja) has. He was expecting that kind of speed. We (net bowlers) bowled from that point, and we did it nicely. But when he realised the ball was coming too quickly, he asked me to bowl from 22 yards,"" Tiwari added.India topped Group A by winning all three matches and went on to beat Australia by four wickets in the semifinal.

Staffer detained, then let off

Ranya Rao admits

BENGALURU: Stung by the way the protocol wing at KIA was misused to allegedly aid gold-smuggling operations, the state govt has decided to revise the standard operating procedures, stating family members and friends of senior bureaucrats will not be entitled to use the services of protocol staff .Additional chief secretary (home) Umashankar SR said security protocol will be provided only to officials who are travelling and not their family members or relatives. The move comes after the arrest of actor Ranya Rao , who was caught smuggling gold allegedly misusing protocol privileges.There is no provision for extending security to anyone beyond the officer (IPS or IAS). Additional security is provided only in cases where an official faces threat... then security may be extended to the officer's immediate family,"" he said.State police protocol came under scanner after DRI detained Ranya Rao on charges of gold smuggling . Sources in DRI had detained the protocol staffer and decided to make him her accomplice in the case. However, the staffer was let off after he gave a statement specifying that he had been given instructions to receive the DGP's daughter on landing and that he had no clue as to what she was carrying.In a voluntary statement to DRI and reviewed by TOI, Ranya said, “I’m born and brought up in Bengaluru. I studied up to (class) 12. I’m an artist in the film industry/ theatre.

NEW DELHI: As India engages the US, working overtime to stave off President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff threat, govt said in a studied response that the ongoing talks for a mutually beneficial multi-sector bilateral trade agreement (BTA) by 2025 fall should be seen in the context of India's recent lowering of tariffs for key developed countries like the UAE, Australia, Norway and Switzerland.Following commerce minister Piyush Goyal's three-day visit to the US, during which he held talks with the commerce secretary and trade representative, official sources speaking on condition of anonymity said it's natural that both India and the US have their interests and sensitivities and these are legitimate matters for a discussion.Even in the middle of negotiations for a deal, Trump has continued to target India for ""massive tariffs"". His remark Friday that India has agreed to ""cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done"" drew criticism from opposition which accused Modi govt of acting under pressure from Trump.Govt sources recalled that, during the first Trump administration, discussions took place about a limited trade deal between the two nations. ""For various reasons, it did not produce an outcome. Since discussions have just begun, it would be premature to talk about its details,"" said a source, adding there's also a context for each dimension, that would reflect the interests of both sides.""It would be recalled that India has reduced its average applied tariffs significantly for key developed countries like Australia, UAE, Switzerland, Norway, etc, under the recently concluded mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreements. Similar negotiations are currently under way with European Union and UK, among other partners. The ongoing discussions with the US should be seen in this context,"" he said.In February 2025, India and the US agreed to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial deal. Modi and Trump agreed to designate representatives to advance negotiations.""They were to work towards increasing market access, reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers and deepening supply chain integration. Accordingly, an Indian delegation led by the commerce and industry minister visited Washington from 3-6 March 2025,"" said another official.""It engaged the US commerce secretary, the US trade representative and their teams.

Officials confirmed on Saturday that the agency is working closely with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to dismantle these operations, PTI reported.The move comes after the recent arrest of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who was caught carrying 14.2 kg of gold worth Rs 12.56 crore at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport . Two CBI teams have been dispatched to Mumbai and Bengaluru airports to collect further information.Ranya Rao, known for her roles in Kannada films like Maanikya and Pataki, was detained by the DRI upon her arrival from Dubai on March 3. Authorities allege that she was attempting to smuggle 17 gold bars, weighing 14.8 kg, into the country. She was produced before a special court for financial offences on March 4 and has been remanded in judicial custody until March 18. The court has permitted her to meet her lawyer for half an hour each day and has instructed officials to ensure she is provided with basic necessities.Following her arrest, an image of Ranya with swollen eyes and bruises circulated on social media, sparking speculation of possible assault during custody, as per news agency PTI. Karnataka State Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Chaudhary addressed the concerns but stated that the commission could not investigate unless a formal complaint was filed. She condemned any potential mistreatment, adding that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.The case has also brought renewed scrutiny to the misuse of airport protocol services. Reports suggest that certain privileges meant for high-ranking officials were exploited to facilitate gold smuggling. In response, the Karnataka government has decided to revise standard operating procedures, restricting protocol services strictly to officials themselves, rather than their family members or associates. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Umashankar SR confirmed the decision, stating that security measures would no longer extend to relatives of senior bureaucrats.Meanwhile, sources indicate that a protocol staffer at Kempegowda International Airport was briefly detained by the DRI after Ranya’s arrest. However, he was later released after stating that he had been instructed to receive a senior officer’s daughter and was unaware of the smuggling attempt.In a voluntary statement to the DRI, Ranya admitted to possession of the gold, acknowledging that 17 gold bars were recovered from her. She described herself as an artist, wildlife photographer, and real estate freelancer in Dubai. Her case remains under investigation as authorities expand their probe into the smuggling network.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case against gangs involved in smuggling gold into India through various airports.

India hints at tariff liberalisation



April 2 deadline

Ongoing talks

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to advance negotiations on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), ANI reported on Saturday citing sources. The development comes on the same day when foreign secretary Vikram Misri hinted that New Delhi might be considering liberalising tariffs.This mutually beneficial agreement, finalised in February 2025, aims to boost market access, reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and enhance supply chain integration.To achieve the goals of the agreement, both leaders have decided to appoint senior representatives to accelerate negotiations, enhance trade relations and foster economic cooperation, the sources revealed.The BTA is expected to impact various sectors, including goods and services. By increasing market access and reducing barriers, the agreement will facilitate smoother trade flows and create new opportunities for businesses on both sides.A day after Trump claimed that India had agreed to bring down tariffs, foreign secretary Vikram Misri refused to comment on the US president's remark. He, however, added that India in recent years had signed several trade pacts with partners based on tariff liberalisation.""There’s a lot of interest in statements coming out of the United States. I will not get into that at this point of time because these are ongoing discussions… But I would only point you towards the fact that we have in recent times entered into bilateral trade agreements which are based on tariff liberalisation with several partners,"" he said.""There are ongoing discussions with several other partners on these issues now. I think the ongoing discussions should be seen in that context. That is our general approach and it applies to any such engagement we have,” he added.Sources indicate that India is optimistic about resolving the tariff issue with the US in the coming weeks, ideally before the April 2 deadline.This was reflected in the MEA's response on the same, which said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""India has already lowered its average applied tariffs for major developed nations, including Australia, UAE, Switzerland, and Norway, under recently concluded trade agreements.A delegation, led by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal , had visited Washington from March 3 to 6, for discussions with the US counterpart on the trade agreement.

NEW DELHI: US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick called upon India to open up the agricultural sector for trade, saying ""it just can't stay closed"".The farm sector has remained a no-go area for government that has cited domestic sensitivities, even as US has insisted on greater access for American nuts, fruits and poultry. ""Indian market for agriculture has to open up... How you do that and the scale by which you do that, may be, do quotas, may be do limits. You can be smarter when you have your most important trading partner on the other side of the table,"" he said, indicating that the US acknowledged that an open-ended liberalisation may not be feasible.While suggesting that India should ""step out of the model"" he repeatedly called for a bilateral deal , arguing that a pact ""with the largest consuming economy in the world"" would be beneficial.Speaking at the India Today Conclave, Lutnick sought a ""grand deal"": ""Let's bring India's tariff policy towards America down, and America will invite India to have really an extraordinary opportunity and relationship with us.""Responding to a question on the larger India-US ties amid too much emphasis on trade and tariffs during Trump's second term, he said: ""there are plenty of levers that govts can pull while doing business with each other... India has historically bought significant amounts of its military (equipment) from Russia. We think that is something that needs to end.""He then went on to say that India was the 'I' in BRICS, the group that also includes Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa, where Beijing had proposed a common currency, something that Trump is unhappy with, seeing it as an attempt reduce importance of the dollar.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that the party needs to filter out leaders and workers in Gujarat who are allegedly aligned with the BJP and gave warning of strict action with the possibility of removal from the party.Addressing party workers in Ahmedabad during his two-day visit to the state, he hinted at a major overhaul ahead of the 2027 assembly elections and assured a strong strategy to challenge the ruling BJP.Gandhi said, “There are two types of people in the Gujarat Congress leadership and among workers. Those who are honest with people, fight for them, respect them and have the ideology of the Congress in their heart. And the others who are cut off from the people, sit far away, do not respect them and half of whom are with the BJP.”He said that the party’s first task should be to differentiate between these two groups. “Until these groups are separated, the people of Gujarat will not believe in the party,” he asserted, adding that even strict action, including expelling certain individuals, might be necessary.Gandhi pointed out that Congress has been out of power in Gujarat for over 30 years and said regaining public trust should take priority over election victories. “The question is not about elections. Unless we fulfill our responsibilities, the people of Gujarat will not let us win,” he said, adding that once the party reconnects with the public, electoral success will follow.During his address, Gandhi also criticised the state of Gujarat’s industries, particularly the diamond, textile, and ceramic sectors, which he claimed were struggling. “Look at the farmers of Gujarat. They are screaming for a new vision. The vision of the last 20-25 years has failed, and Congress can provide this vision easily,” he said.Gandhi also acknowledged the historical role of Gujarat in shaping Congress and India’s freedom movement. He reminded party workers that Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, two of the Congress’s most influential leaders, hailed from the state. “Without Gandhi, Congress would not have been able to get independence for the country,” he said.Gandhi noted internal challenges within the party, asserting that some Congress leaders were “chained” and needed to re-establish their connection with the people. He encouraged party members to engage with citizens and understand their concerns. “We are here to listen to you,” he told the gathering.He further stated that Congress could return to power in Gujarat with a small increase in vote share. “The opposition already holds 40 per cent of the vote in Gujarat. If we can increase our vote share by just 5 per cent, the entire political equation will change,” he explained, citing Telangana as an example where the party increased its vote share by 22 per cent.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla criticised Rahul Gandhi, calling him the ""BJP's biggest asset"" and mocking his remarks about Congress workers. “He has trolled himself and his party. He tried to show the mirror to himself. Such an honest reaction... Rahul Gandhi admits he is unable to win in Gujarat, unable to show the way,” Poonawalla said.Referring to Gandhi’s analogy comparing some Congress workers to racehorses forced to dance at weddings, Poonawalla questioned his choice of words. “Are your party workers animals? At least please call your party workers humans. You are calling them horses,” he said.Taking to social media platform X, Poonawalla further attacked Gandhi, calling his remarks ""bizarre"" and listing a series of questions. “Rahul Gandhi has once again proven he is the OG when it comes to bizarre comments... Mr Entitled Dynast, stop calling Congress workers ‘ghoda’—they are humans. Stop blaming others for your failures—first EVMs, now party workers, who next? The public?” he wrote. He also took a dig at Gandhi’s electoral record, saying, “If half of Congress is ‘gaddar,’ what are you for making Congress lose 90+ times?”BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi also slammed Gandhi, stating, “From alleging his party, people, constitutional institutions, and media—he has now started blaming his own people. I’ll suggest he do self-introspection instead of blaming others.”On the first day of his visit, Gandhi had met with party leaders and district and block-level presidents to discuss strategies. His visit comes ahead of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) session, scheduled to be held in Ahmedabad on April 8-9, the first such session in the state in 64 years.In the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections, Congress secured only 17 out of 182 seats, and its strength later dropped to 12 after five MLAs resigned. Gandhi admitted that the party had failed to meet Gujarat’s expectations over the past 30 years and promised corrective measures.He concluded his address with a mix of determination and humour, remarking on Gujarat’s hospitality. “Every time I come here, no matter how much I try to control my weight, you take me to restaurants and serve delicious snacks, and I end up gaining a kilo!” he joked, drawing laughter from the audience.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi says party needs to filter out 'BJP-influenced' workers.

We are not ideologically driven but focused on what is best for the country"". On talks for a trade deal with US, he said that India will come out strong as the trade relationship with the U.S. is largely complementary. ""We conducted a study of all Harmonized System (HS) code lines and found significant synergies,"" he said.Vaishnaw urged industry leaders to invest in development of 25-30 products. ""For example, in consumer products such as mobile manufacturing, companies are designing and manufacturing capital goods domestically. Can IT firms invest in foundational AI models or develop our own mobile operating system? If industry takes one step forward, the govt will take ten steps to support them,"" he said.He laid out the agenda across the five key layers of AI-chips, foundational models, applications, data center & hyperscaler layer, and talent. By the end of the year, the country will have three indigenous AI models, while a domestically developed GPU is expected within the next three to four years. India has also launched a 14,000-GPU common compute facility, exceeding its initial target of 10,000 and ensuring wider access to AI resources through a public-private partnership. Unlike other regions where computing power is concentrated among a few players, India aims for inclusivity. ""The future of AI must be democratised, and India is leading the way,"" he said.Vaishnaw said the country was seeing a reversal of brain drain. ""Professionals like Dr. Randhir Thakur (Tata Electronics MD & CEO) have returned to lead our semiconductor initiatives. The startup ecosystem has transformed-India is now among the top three startup nations. A decade ago, startups were a rarity. Today, entrepreneurs take risks, and we see innovation thriving,"" he said.

""We are on track to meet our sustainability goals,"" he said.On the railways, Vaishnaw said the govt has invested Rs 1.14 lakh cr annually. ""Ten years ago, India recorded 171 railway accidents per year; today, that number has dropped to 30. While this is progress, we continue to improve,"" he said. The railways are integrating technology for track inspections, scheduling maintenance more efficiently, and working with startups to develop innovative solutions. The fourth version of the Kavach automatic train protection system was approved and certified and is being rolled out.Vaishnaw said India's railways have undergone a major transformation over the past decade, with 45,000 km of tracks electrified-more than twice the progress made in the first 60 years of independence.

Murmu was speaking at the inaugural session of a day-long conference on the theme ' Nari Shakti Se Viksit Bharat ' organised by women and child development ministry to mark 'Women's Day'.""We will have to ask ourselves this question that do we have no responsibility as a society toward the children who will form the future society,"" Murmu said.

INDORE: Rumours of buried treasure, allegedly fuelled by the recent movie 'Chhava', have triggered a digging frenzy around the famed Asirgarh Fort in MP's Burhanpur , which has no dearth of legends associated with it.Hundreds of villagers, armed with torchlights and some even carrying metal detectors, are digging up the fields around the fort in the hope of finding Mughal-era gold.

""Unidentified men reportedly dug up a field at night a few days ago in search of the coins. The administration took cognisance of the matter after a video went viral,"" said collector Harsh Singh. Nepanagar subdivisional magistrate Bhagirath Wakhla inspected the site, an agricultural field, and found many pits dug up by the treasure hunters, Singh added.Asirgarh Fort dates back to 15th century, and was the site of many battles that shaped India's history. It has long been associated with legends of buried treasure.Nimbola police have deployed a team to secure the field.

Guwahati: A 30-year-old man was killed in police firing and more than 20 others, mostly women, were wounded Saturday as clashes erupted between Kuki demonstrators and security forces in Manipur's Kangpokpi district. The violence broke out during protests against Centre's move to resume free movement across the strife-torn state.The clashes erupted in Kuki-dominated areas of Gamgiphai, Motbung, and Keithelmanbi when demonstrators attempted to block vehicles, including a state transport bus travelling from Imphal to Senapati district. Protesters set at least two vehicles on fire.The situation remains tense, with security forces on high alert in the region.Home minister Amit Shah had earlier directed state authorities to ensure free movement on all roads in Manipur, a move aimed at bridging the divide between Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities. Under heavy security escort, the state resumed inter-district govt bus services Saturday, but officials reported little participation.The unrest extended to the Meitei-dominated valley, where security forces halted a peace march by Federation of Civil Society (FOCS) at Sekmai, before it could reach Kangpokpi. “If govt is not in a position to allow free movement of the public, what is the need for making the announcement?” said FOCS president T Manihar.Kuki-Zo Council opposed the push for unrestricted movement, warning it could lead to violence. “The actions of state govt to send Meitei people into Kuki-Zo areas, despite ample warnings against such movements, have escalated tensions in the region,” it said. Declaring an indefinite shutdown across all Kuki-Zo areas, effective from Saturday midnight, the council said it does not oppose the free movement of essential commodities but rejects unrestricted travel from the valley. Meitei Heritage Society called the blockade an act of defiance.","Violence broke out during protests against Centre's move to resume free movement across the strife-torn state.

KOPPAL: A 27-year-old Israeli tourist and her female homestay operator were raped while a fellow boarder from Odisha was thrown to his death in a canal in Karnataka's Koppal by three intruders at a scenic spot barely 25km from Unesco world heritage site of Hampi.Two other tourists in the group, one from the US and another from Maharashtra's Nashik, swam to safety from the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal after the horror late on March 6 night.On Saturday, police announced arrests of two of the suspects, and a hunt for the third. This came amid widespread outrage over the gruesome attack and concerns over the safety of tourists at Hampi and its surrounding areas.Chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar promised a thorough investigation and justice.According to the FIR, the group of five was stargazing near the canal, playing guitar and listening to music. The five were not friends but had met at the homestay where they were staying.Around 11 pm, the three suspects, who had been drinking at a bar in nearby Sanapur town, approached the visitors on a motorcycle, initially asking for money to buy petrol. The tourists gave them Rs 20, but the men demanded Rs 100. When the tourists refused, the intruders turned aggressive, hurling abuses that soon got worse.As Daniel Pitas, 23, from US, Pankaj Amrit Rao Patil, 43, from Nashik, and Bibash, 26, from Odisha tried to intervene, the attackers pushed the three into the canal.","Israeli tourist and her female homestay operator were raped while a fellow boarder from Odisha was thrown to his death in a canal.

"Government extends duty-free import of yellow peas till May, imposes 10% duty on lentils",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-extends-duty-free-import-of-yellow-peas-till-may-imposes-10-duty-on-lentils/articleshow/118808618.cms,"New Delhi: Govt has extended duty-free import of yellow peas by three months, until the end of May, while imposing a 10% duty on imports of lentils (masur), according to a revenue department notification issued on late Friday evening.India mostly imports yellow peas and lentils from Canada, Russia and Australia. Sources said govt’s moves aim at ensuring availability of pulses at affordable prices and send a positive signal to farmers as well.Govt had allowed the import of yellow peas at 0% duty in Dec 2023 to boost availability. This is used as a substitute for chana, and the prices are also much lower. The Centre had extended the free import multiple times amid prospects of lower chana output. In 2017, govt had imposed a 50% duty on import of yellow peas to encourage domestic production of chana.As per official data, the import of yellow peas was around 30 lakh tonnes out of the total import of 67 lakh tonnes of pulses in 2024. Despite being the biggest producer of pulses, India, to bridge the gap, depends on imports of about 15-18% to meet the annual pulses demand of around 290 lakh tonnes.The main reason behind free import of yellow peas is its price. While at present the landed cost of yellow peas is at around Rs 32-35 per kg, the retail price is around Rs 40 a kg. This is much cheaper compared to prices of all other pulses which are in the range of Rs 90-160 per kg.Govt continuing free import of yellow peas has stumped traders considering that mandi prices of chana in Maharashtra and Karnataka are less than the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,650 a quintal for the 2024-25 marketing season.In the case of masur, govt had reduced the basic import duty to zero in July 2021 and subsequently, the exemption from 10% agri-infrastructure cess was given in Feb 2022. Since then, this was extended multiple times and was valid till March 2024.Sources said masur would now attract basic customs duty (5%) and agriculture infrastructure and development cess (5%).","Govt had allowed the import of yellow peas at 0% duty in Dec 2023 to boost availability.

"From social stigma to empowerment: Inspiring stories of women conductors, drivers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-social-stigma-to-empowerment-inspiring-stories-of-women-conductors-drivers/articleshow/118808954.cms,"Sujata Bhujbal with her daughter. (TNN)

NEW DELHI: Nearly three decades ago, in a groundbreaking move that defied social norms and shattered gender barriers, Sulochana Devi, Kusuma Om Prakash, A Masthanamma, P Sridevi and Savitha Manjula took on roles traditionally reserved for men. As the first batch of women conductors in state-run buses, they paved the way for future generations, challenging societal stigma. On International Women’s Day, these trailblazers, along with 44 other female conductors and drivers, were honoured by ASRTU, the apex body of state transport undertakings under the ministry of road transport, for their inspiring contributions.Some of the first-generation women conductors and drivers TOI spoke with shared the challenges they faced when starting their jobs, including managing a diverse range of passengers and the lack of proper public facilities for women. While they mentioned that male drivers have never been an issue, they believe deploying more female drivers would be a positive step forward.There are only 300 drivers and around 19,000 women conductors working in state transport undertakings. While a majority of these drivers are in Delhi Transport Corporation and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, nearly 7,500 women conductors are employed with Andhra Pradesh and Telangana SRTCs.Giving away the awards, first woman IPS Kiran Bedi threw a challenge to state transport undertakings and women drivers and conductors to deploy only female staff in buses operated late at night in urban areas, considering that women feel unsafe to take buses after dark.Single parent Sulochana Devi, who works with Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), said, “Since I was a child, I was keen to learn driving; my brother taught me car driving. I had some family problems, and I needed to take care of my children. I joined KSRTC where I was trained to drive bus as well. I have been a driver-cum-conductor since 1999.” Her son works as a software engineer in a foreign farm in Bengaluru. Sulochana said, she faced several challenges initially, but could overcome them with her determination to stick to the job.Sitting with her, two other women achievers, Kusuma and Savitha, said they have been trained to deal with passengers and the introduction of CCTV cameras in buses has made the situation better. “We urge the state transport undertakings to give rest to women drivers and conductors during their periods,” they added.P Sridevi, who was among the first few women conductors to join ASRTU after her father, a bus driver, passed away during service, shared that the job was considered a social stigma , as many believed it was meant only for men. “We faced difficulties due to the lack of proper resting areas. My mother would wait at the gate if I was late. Managing a child was also a tough task, but thanks to my mother, I was able to manage. At times, we had to firmly tell male passengers to behave properly in public transport,” she said.Sridevi was accompanied by her family members when she received the reward. Her daughter, P Madhuri, who is aspiring for civil services, said, “My mother leaves home before sunrise and returns after sunset. It’s a tough job, and she has done all this only for us. I want her to take a rest now, but she enjoys her job.”The experience is no different for Sujata Bhujbal, the first woman driver with the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport Undertaking (BEST). “When I took up this job, many questioned it because they didn’t want women in this role. But I have proven them wrong. When I’m in uniform, I feel empowered, and people show me respect. Every SRTU must have a uniform,” she said. “Though my daughter, who is pursuing electrical engineering, wants me to retire once she completes her studies and gets a job, I won’t leave. BEST has given me so much,” she added.","Sulochana Devi, Kusuma Om Prakash, A Masthanamma, P Sridevi and Savitha Manjula took on roles traditionally reserved for men.

BJP slams Telangana government’s handling of crisis

NEW DELHI: Telangana minister for irrigation and civil supplies Uttam Kumar Reddy announced on Saturday that robotic technology is being used to speed up the rescue operations at the SLBC tunnel in Nagarkurnool district, where eight workers remain trapped.Calling the incident a ""national disaster,"" he assured that the state government is using the best global technology to address the challenges in the final stretch of the 14-kilometre tunnel.During his visit to the site, the minister reviewed the situation with officials from multiple national agencies, including state disaster management secretary Arvind Kumar and army commandant Parikshit Mehra. District collector Badavath Santosh, SP Vaibhav Gaikwad Raghunath,and senior officials from the NDRF, SDRF, Railways, and Singareni were also present.Reddy explained that rescue teams have managed to clear 13.95 kilometres of the tunnel, but the last 50 meters remain highly unstable due to oxygen depletion, water seepage, and metal debris from the collapsed Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). To navigate these hazards, robots equipped with high-resolution cameras, infrared sensors, and robotic arms have been deployed for assessment and extraction.As per the minister, cadaver dogs from Kerala detected a strong odour at a specific location, suggesting the presence of three individuals. He assured that the government would fully support the families of the missing workers. Despite ongoing dewatering and desilting efforts, the final stretch remains a significant challenge, with global tunnel rescue experts being consulted to find a solution.The BJP criticised the Telangana government’s response, accusing it of negligence. BJP leader and Union minister G Kishan Reddy alleged that the state authorities failed to conduct proper safety inspections before the tunnel work began. ""This tragedy is a result of the state government's inefficiency. Why were safety measures ignored? Why was there no proper emergency plan?"" he questioned.BJP MLA Etala Rajender also hit out at the Congress-led Telangana government, stating that despite repeated warnings from experts, the administration did not act in time. ""This is a man-made disaster. The government should take responsibility,"" he said.Meanwhile, the opposition has demanded a judicial inquiry into the accident. ""Deploying robots now is fine, but this should have been done much earlier. The government wasted crucial time,"" said BJP spokesperson K Krishna Sagar Rao.As rescue efforts continue, Uttam Kumar Reddy reiterated that all necessary resources, including an additional Rs 4 crore for robotic systems, have been allocated to ensure the operation's success. He promised to return to the site in the next few days to assess the progress.",Telangana minister for irrigation and civil supplies Uttam Kumar Reddy announced on Saturday that robotic technology is being used to speed up the rescue operations.

The court relied on educational documents to determine that the survivor was a minor (15 years and 15 days) at the time of the crime though the medical reports had suggested her radiological age was around 19 years.The court cited the Supreme Court's judgment in the Mahadev Vs State of Maharashtra (2013) case and said the medical report for determining the age was considered only when educational documents of the survivor were not available. In this case, the court admitted the TC (transfer certificate) of a govt primary school while rejecting the bone density test of the girl.The girl was kidnapped from Lakhimpur Kheri in March 2011 by a car driver and kept confined in a house in Lucknow for nearly two months and forced her to have physical relationship with him.

"'How do you plan to hold Senthil trial,' SC asks Tamil Nadu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-do-you-plan-to-hold-senthil-trial-sc-asks-tamil-nadu/articleshow/123007329.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that trial in cash-for-job scam, in which former Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji is being prosecuted, could be the most mammoth trial in the country with over 2,000 accused, Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the state to place before it a prosecutorial plan on how to go about the case and said that it may consider appointing a special public prosecutor in the case.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the state to submit a complete list of accused and witnesses in the corruption cases and said ""with over 2,000 accused and 500 witnesses it will be the most populated trial of India. A small courtroom of the trial court will not suffice and a cricket stadium will be needed to even mark the presence of the accused.""It asked govt why it did not filter accused on the basis of their marginal or prime culpability in the case.

He said that there had been no allegations against the present public prosecutor who is discharging his duties.The bench, however, said that appointment of SPP would dispel any wrong public perception about the trial as a former minister and bureaucrats were involved in the case.""He is a powerful politician. Nothing wrong with being a powerful politician. Somebody who has public support. Only concern is that in a case where some person who has held the position of the minister there are some bureaucrats or other affluent people who are facing trial there is a public perception that a prosecution through the govt appointed public prosecutor may not alone be able to do justice,"" the bench said.",Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the state to submit a complete list of accused and witnesses in the corruption cases.

PM Narendra Modi hailed the return of the relics -gems as ""a joyous day for our cultural heritage"", after culture minister Gajendra Shekhawat received them at the Delhi airport on Wednesday. ""It would make every Indian proud that the sacred Piprahwa relics of Bhagwan Buddha have come home after 127 long years,"" Modi said on X. The relics have been kept at the National Museum and will be placed on public display after a special ceremony.

The statement comes amid an intense debate over Microsoft's announcement of 9,000 layoffs while the company reportedly made 4712 applications for H-1Bs.“Our H-1B applications are in no way related to the recent job eliminations in part because employees on H-1B’s also lost their roles.

No India-US Trade Deal Before August 1?

India-US trade deal stalemate: Ahead of his self-imposed tariff deadline, US President Donald Trump has said that a trade agreement with India has not yet been finalized. “India trade deal not been finalized,” said Trump. Asked whether India would face 20-25% tariff rates, he said, ""Yeah, I think so. India is my friend. They ended the war with Pakistan at my request...The deal with India is not finalised. India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country..."". However, he cautioned that the tariff rate has not yet been decided as negotiations continue.Trump’s remarks come just days ahead of the August 1, 2025 reciprocal tariff deadline. In the last few weeks Trump had said that the US is ‘nearing’ a deal with India. The likelihood of an interim trade deal announcement before the deadline appears slim for now.Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that India is preparing for a temporary reciprocal tariff rate ranging between 20-25%. India anticipates facing elevated US tariffs on certain export items as an interim arrangement, two officials from the Indian government told the news agency.""Talks are progressing well, and a delegation is expected in Delhi by mid-August,"" one of the Indian government officials said, adding that President Donald Trump could issue a tariff letter imposing duties of 20 or 25% in a ""worst-case scenario"".""However, we assume it would be a temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place.

Why monitoring asteroids like 2025 OL1 matters



Asteroid 2025 OL1 flyby reinforces need for vigilant sky monitoring



Also Read |

Earth is about to witness a close celestial visitor as asteroid 2025 OL1 approaches our planet. Roughly the size of a small aircraft, measuring about 110 feet in diameter, this space rock will make its closest pass on July 30, 2025. Travelling at an impressive speed of 16,904 miles per hour, it will safely skim past Earth at a distance of approximately 1.29 million kilometres. Astronomers emphasise that tracking such asteroids helps improve planetary defense, enabling early detection and response to potential future cosmic collision threats. Though this event may sound alarming, NASA assures that the asteroid poses no threat. This flyby underscores the critical need for continuous monitoring of near-Earth objects and the evolving strategies by agencies like NASA and ISRO to defend our planet.At roughly 110 feet in diameter, asteroid 2025 OL1, classified as a near-Earth object (NEO), is about the length of a small passenger plane. Moving at a rapid speed of nearly 17,000 miles per hour, it covers the vast distance between Earth and its orbit quickly but safely. Although over a million kilometres away at closest approach, this asteroid flyby is significant because it offers scientists a chance to study an asteroid up close, better understand its trajectory, refine detection techniques, improve planetary defense systems, strengthen early-warning technology, evaluate potential asteroid impact risks, and enhance space research collaboration for future deep space exploration missions.NASA’s latest observations confirm that asteroid 2025 OL1 will not come close enough to endanger Earth. To be classified as potentially hazardous, an asteroid must pass within 7.4 million kilometres of our planet and be at least 85 metres wide. While 2025 OL1 meets the size criterion, its closest approach of 1.29 million kilometres keeps it well outside the danger zone. Despite its harmless status, scientists remain vigilant, closely tracking the asteroid’s path for any changes caused by gravitational forces or other influences. This careful observation helps maintain our preparedness against any unexpected shifts.India’s space agency, ISRO, remains deeply involved in planetary defense initiatives. Chairman S. Somanath has emphasized the importance of preparing for asteroid threats, particularly focusing on larger objects like the asteroid Apophis, which is expected to pass Earth in 2029. ISRO aims to collaborate with other space agencies such as NASA, ESA, and JAXA to improve detection capabilities and develop technologies capable of deflecting potentially hazardous asteroids. These partnerships and upcoming missions underscore the growing global commitment to protecting Earth from cosmic dangers.Although asteroid impacts are rare, their potential consequences can be devastating. Events like the flyby of 2025 OL1 serve as reminders of the importance of continued vigilance. Space is filled with countless near-Earth objects (NEOs) that silently traverse the solar system. Most pass by unnoticed, but tracking those that come close enables scientists to predict their paths and prepare contingency plans. The data gathered from each observation enhances our ability to forecast future encounters and develop asteroid mitigation strategies, safeguarding our planet’s future.While the asteroid 2025 OL1’s passage on July 30 will be peaceful and pose no danger, it highlights the need for ongoing surveillance. Global space agencies maintain round-the-clock monitoring systems, using powerful telescopes and satellites to watch the skies. Each asteroid flyby improves our understanding of these celestial neighbors and informs defense tactics. As technology advances, missions designed to test asteroid deflection methods may one day protect Earth from potential threats. Until then, experts keep watch, reminding us to look up with curiosity—and caution.","NASA confirms asteroid 2025 OL1 flyby poses no threat to Earth.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in India's remarkable draw at Old Trafford? Washington Sundar's performance Ravindra Jadeja's contribution Team's ability to absorb pressure England's missed opportunities

“Grateful for the people, and forever grateful to you, God,” wrote Washington Sundar on X after scoring his maiden Test hundred — a composed, unbeaten 101* that helped India pull off a dramatic draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford.The 25-year-old all-rounder’s quiet gratitude came after a loud statement on the field, where he and Ravindra Jadeja (107) batted through the final phase of Day 5 to rescue India from what once looked like certain defeat. Reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings, India needed a miracle. They found it in the form of a rock-solid batting effort, with Shubman Gill (103) and KL Rahul (90) also playing key roles.The final session was filled with tension — England’s frustration began to show, especially after Jadeja launched a six off Harry Brook to reach his hundred. In a curious moment, Brook stepped forward with a handshake offer, seemingly looking to wrap up the game.But Sundar , just short of his own milestone, ignored the gesture and carried on. The image of Brook’s puzzled smile and Sundar’s calm focus summed up the psychological edge India held at the end.This was just the second draw for England in 40 Tests under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, which was a rare occurrence in their aggressive ‘Bazball’ era. But it was a deserved result for India, whose batters absorbed immense pressure to ensure the series stays alive at 2-1.With the possibility of leveling the series still on the line, the stage is set for a cracking finale at The Oval. But for now, Sundar’s words and his resolve linger as the high point of a chaotic final day.",Washington Sundar scored 101* to help India draw 4th Test at Old Trafford.

"After over 40 years, India issues tender for Sawalkote project as Indus treaty remains in abeyance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-over-40-years-india-issues-tender-for-sawalkote-project-as-indus-treaty-remains-in-abeyance/articleshow/123004488.cms,"SRINAGAR: India, taking advantage of its keeping in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, floated on Wednesday international tenders for construction of the Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project on the Chenab river a little over 40 years after it was conceived.The project, designated by govt as one of national importance, had suffered long delays due to objections from Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty framework as well as multiple regulatory and administrative hurdles, including compensation issues involving 13 affected villages, relocation of the Army transit camp in Ramban, and forest land within the project area requiring clearances and compensation under environmental regulations.he National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) initiated on Wednesday the tendering process for the power project, located near Sidhu village in J&K’s Ramban district. The last date for submission of online bids is Sept 10. It invited international bids on a competitive bidding basis for planning, design, and engineering works for the 1,856 MW project. The last date for submission of online bids is Sept 10.Construction of the Sawalkote project is a major strategic development aimed at optimising India’s use of Indus waters while the treaty with Pakistan remains in abeyance. The 1960 treaty had given India control of the Beas, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, and Pakistan the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, with India being allowed a portion of waters from the “western rivers (those under Pakistan control)” for certain uses.J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah, who is also power minister, told TOI the project is of great significance and that he hoped it would finally take off. “The project was originally conceived in the 1980s, but it was shelved after some time. In 1996, Dr Farooq Abdullah attempted to revive it with the help of a Norwegian consortium but that effort didn’t succeed. Later, during my previous tenure, we tried to initiate the project again, but it encountered certain hurdles,” Omar said, adding that it was completely shelved during the tenure of the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed govt.Ramban MLA Arjun Singh Raju was the first to announce Wednesday’s development, calling it a landmark moment. “Sawalkote power project is the biggest in the country. Once completed, it will benefit not just Jammu and Kashmir, but the entire nation. I think it is a historical moment,” he said, adding, “And the credit goes to chief minister Omar Abdullah, who fought relentlessly for this project,” he added.The run-of-river project is estimated to cost Rs 22,704.8 crore and will be developed in two stages.“All issues have now been sorted out,” Raju said, adding that NHPC has also secured relaxation on the water cess, which had earlier delayed progress.Earlier this month, the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) granted “in-principle” approval for the diversion of 847 hectares of forest land for the construction of the Sawalkote project.Conceived in 1984, the Sawalkote project, sources said it was given to NHPC in 1985. In 1997 it was given back to Jammu Kashmir State Power Development Corporation (JKSPDC) for execution. Sources said approximately Rs 430 crore was spent by JKSPDC on “enabling infrastructure” around the project. But no work had started on the main project. Then, in 2021, an MoU was signed with NHPC to revive and implement the project under the build-own-operate-transfer model.","The project, designated by govt as one of national importance, had suffered long delays due to objections from Pakistan.

Mystery over ghost litigant in SC deepens as 3rd lawyer distances himself from case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-over-ghost-litigant-in-sc-deepens-as-3rd-lawyer-distances-himself-from-case/articleshow/122984613.cms,"NEW DELHI: The mystery around a 'ghost litigant' in Supreme Court deepened further as the third lawyer whose name appeared in the order sheet for the litigant told the court Tuesday that he was not involved in any way in the case and did not know how his name cropped up. Suspecting the role of some outsider and not lawyers, the bar associations sought a police inquiry and forensic examination of documents to catch the culprit which the apex court agreed to consider.In this murky case, a litigant managed to get a favourable order from SC after he propped up a 'ghost' opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for the top court to quash orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant. Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before SC.The names of four lawyers were mentioned in the order out of which three are known names in the field of litigation but no one had heard of the fourth advocate. It came to light that the lawyer who allegedly represented the fake party did not practice law any more and he and his daughter, whose name was also there, were not even aware of the case.The court, thereafter, directed the third lawyer to appear before it.Appearing before a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar, advocate Ratan Lal told the court that he did not do anything and he had nothing to do with the case. As all three lawyers refused their involvement in the case and the fourth lawyer remains untraced, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and Supreme Court Advocates On-Record Association (SCAORA) told the bench that lawyers were not involved in the wrongdoing.SCAORA president Vipin Nair said an inquiry was needed in the case and who would conduct it was very important. ""The blame or charge of any wrongdoing can't be straightaway ascribed to AOR or lawyers since the pleadings indicate that the possibility of the petitioner engaging in fabrication can't be ruled out. A thorough enquiry is therefore necessary,"" Nair told the bench.It was also argued police should be asked to hold an inquiry. The court, after a brief hearing, said it would consider all aspects and pass an order. SC had in Dec passed the order after the 'compromise agreement' was placed before it and the order sheet of that day mentioned the names of the four advocates.",A litigant managed to get a favourable order from SC after he propped up a 'ghost' opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner.

Govt extended monthly support - Rs 6,000 in rent aid and Rs 9,000 in livelihood aid for up to two family members.

MUMBAI: The Centre has finally appointed a full-time vice-chancellor for Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) after nearly two years of interim leadership. Badri Narayan Tiwari, a social historian with interests in culture and marginality, will helm the institute as its first official appointee since the Centre brought TISS under its administrative fold.His five-year appointment comes 22 months after Prof Manoj Tiwari, director of IIM-Mumbai, was made acting TISS VC in Sept 2023.TISS, long nurtured under the stewardship of the Tata Trusts, is now subject to central oversight, following the 2023 directive bringing all institutions with over 50% govt funding under the Centre's jurisdiction.Badri Narayan Tiwari, until recently director of Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute, Prayagraj, established a Kumbh study centre and an ethnographic museum. His earlier stint at Jawaharlal Nehru University , where he was part of the Centre for the Study of Discrimination and Exclusion, sharpened his engagement with themes of social justice and subaltern narratives.His scholarly compass- spanning democracy, popular culture, Dalit assertion, and anthropological history - experts said, aligns closely with the ethos TISS has long embodied.

He said the two have come close over decades as earlier Congress regimes left the land of POK between them.Intervening during the discussion on Operation Sindoor in Rajya Sabha, Jaishankar dismissed opposition's questions on whether US President Trump brokered the ceasefire, saying there was no call between PM Modi and Trump between April 22 and June 16. The ceasefire was announced on May 10. He also said the halt to military action was not linked to trade, as Trump claimed.Countering claims made by Rahul Gandhi that Pakistan and China are working as a nexus, the EAM said the countries are in a tango because of the decisions taken during Congress's governance. ""There are China gurus now, one is an honourable member sitting across me (Jairam Ramesh). His affection for China was so much he conjoined India and China - Chindia.

Months after the blasts in Mumbai trains (July 2006), he said, there was a meeting in Havana in Sept where an agreement was signed between PMs of India and Pakistan. ""Instead of holding Pakistan responsible, we said we condemn all acts of terrorism and agree it's a scourge that needs to be dealt with and by the way we will resume our composite dialogue... You were equating the perpetrator and victim,"" he said. Referring to the 26/11 attack in Mumbai in 2008, Jaishankar said in July 2009, at a meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, it was agreed that terrorism was the main threat to ""both countries"".""After a gruesome terror attack, they were ready for dialogue.

NISAR a milestone in Indo-US space ties; space minister says sat will be a ‘game changer in disaster management’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nisar-a-milestone-in-indo-us-space-ties-space-minister-says-sat-will-be-a-game-changer-in-disaster-management/articleshow/123005639.cms,"NISAR Will Help Global Community Monitor Earth Changes: ISRO Chairman V Narayanan

NEW DELHI: The successful launch of the world’s most expensive and unique earth observation satellite NISAR, jointly developed by US and Indian scientists over a decade, has given a big push to Indo-US space cooperation and has been hailed as a milestone in space collaboration between the two countries under the leadership of US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Wednesday’s launch came weeks after Nasa and Isro successfully collaborated on the Axiom-4 mission, under which Indian astronaut Shubanshu Shukla was sent to the International Space Station for microgravity experiments.Congratulating Isro and Nasa, space minister Jitendra Singh called the NISAR mission a “game changer in precise management of disasters”.In a post on X, he said: “NISAR’s capacity to penetrate through fogs, dense clouds, ice layers, etc., makes it a pathbreaking enabler for the aviation and shipping sectors. The inputs from NISAR will benefit the entire world community…in the true spirit of ‘Vishwabandhu’.” He also expressed pride in being “associated with the Department of Space at a time when Isro is registering one global milestone after the other”.Isro chairman V Narayanan said NISAR “has brought the two agencies closer than ever before”.Though Nasa began studying concepts for a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission, inspired by the National Academy of Sciences' decadal survey of the agency's Earth science program in 2007, the US chose to collaborate with India for a huge SAR-based satellite, signing a formal agreement for the NISAR programme in 2014.The then Nasa administrator Charles Bolden and then Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan signed the pact for production and launch of NISAR in Toronto on Sept 30, 2014.Before 2014, US and India had collaborated on a slew of space missions, including the Chandrayaan-1 mission, under which saw Nasa sent its payload (Moon Mineralogy Mapper) on board Isro’s spacecraft for the moon mission, which played a crucial role in finding water on Moon. But the NISAR programme is said to be the first big-ticket ($1.5 billion) satellite mission invested in by both sides. Nasa has contributed L-Band SAR, a high-rate telecommunication subsystem, GPS receivers and a deployable 12-metre unfurlable antenna. Isro, on its part, has provided S-Band SAR payload, the spacecraft bus to accommodate both payloads, GSLV-F16 launch vehicle and all associated launch services.",The successful launch of the world’s most expensive and unique earth observation satellite NISAR has given a big push to Indo-US space cooperation.

J&K Medical Council sets social media guidelines for doctors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-medical-council-sets-social-media-guidelines-for-doctors/articleshow/123003984.cms,"SRINAGAR: A week after an MBBS student filmed his career’s first stint in the operation theatre and posted it online as a reel, Jammu and Kashmir Medical Council (JKMC) on Wednesday issued social media guidelines for doctors in the Union Territory, prohibiting them from sharing images or videos of treatment results, surgeries, procedures, or healed patients.In the video, which was widely circulated on social media platforms, an MBBS student at GMC Srinagar’s LD Hospital, excitedly shared that he was about to perform his first surgery in the OT, and proceeded to the labour room, thus exposing the parts of the patient’s body.Taking serious cognisance, JKMC issued a set of guidelines to ensure such violations do not recur. While acknowledging the role of social media as “a powerful communication tool”, the Council, in a statement, cautioned against its misuse, particularly in ways that compromised patient privacy, confidentiality or autonomy.JKMC directed registered doctors to follow the set guidelines on the professional conduct of Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs) regarding the use of social media platforms in adherence to Indian Medical Council Regulations, 2002.“RMPs must not advertise services, claim superiority, or engage in self-promotional activities (posting self-photographs or publicity on signboards beyond basic details).Permitted announcements are — starting practice, change of address, or temporary absence,” the JKMC statement said.Patient information — including images, scans, treatments, and outcomes — must not be disclosed without explicit and informed consent, JKMC said. “Consent is invalid if the patient is in a compromised physical, mental, or emotional state. Patient testimonials, endorsements, or reviews cannot be solicited or shared in any case on social media,” it added.The Council asked RMPs to maintain dignity and avoid behaviour that discredits the profession on any media platform. “Sharing factual, verifiable, and non-misleading educational content is allowed, within one’s expertise. Public discussions of treatment or prescribing medications online is prohibited; patients must be directed to proper telemedicine or in-person consultations,” it said.Online presence must reflect medical ethics, truthfulness, and respect for the profession, patients, colleagues and the community, JKMC said, urging doctors to share content responsibly.","An MBBS student filmed his career’s first stint in the operation theatre and posted it online as a reel.

"Policy experts, civil society from Asia Pacific discuss country positions ahead of plastics treaty talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/policy-experts-civil-society-from-asia-pacific-discuss-country-positions-ahead-of-plastics-treaty-talks/articleshow/123003545.cms,"AI-generated Image (Representational)

BATHINDA: Regional policy experts discussed country positions and negotiation dynamics of the Asia Pacific region, in a briefing by Break free from Plastic (BFFP), the global movement working to achieve a future free from plastic pollution, ahead of the INC 5.2 negotiations for the Global Plastic Treaty in Geneva, Switzerland from August 5-14, 2025. INC-5.2 refers to the second part of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC).It discussed how countries frame their priorities around economic development, environmental protection, and regional and international cooperation.Asia Pacific countries sit at the epicentre of both plastic production and pollution impacts; the region's diverse economies and environmental challenges make it a key battleground in the global treaty negotiations. The negotiations outcome will determine global standards for plastic production, waste management, and industry accountability.The briefing also identified key challenges, including procedural issues affecting civil society access, potential delaying tactics, watered-down commitments favouring waste management over production caps, and industry influence promoting circular economy narratives over substantive pollution reduction.For more nuanced coverage of the treaty, the policy experts and researchers on the panel urged journalists to consider a human rights-centric, fossil-fuel-free development model for Asia Pacific.It was felt critical threats that could significantly weaken the treaty include chemical and plastic-producing countries challenging the treaty's scope to address the full plastics lifecycle, potentially removing obligations for primary plastic polymer production reduction and chemicals of concern from the final agreement.The most significant risk is that negotiations could result in a framework convention with voluntary measures rather than legally binding obligations, which would fundamentally undermine the treaty's ability to address global plastic pollution at the required scale and speed.A critical political obstacle to a strong, effective treaty is the decision-making process, which relies on a consensual decision-making process where all countries are not equal, instead of an equal voting process.With pressure to reach a consensus, countries may compromise on stronger provisions to secure a deal, with critical decisions on production reduction measures deferred to future COP processes.As diverse as the Asia Pacific region is, we are most impacted by plastic pollution, and often bear disproportionate blame.C Semee Rhee, Global Policy Advisor, BFFP said “It's not about whether or not we will have a treaty. It's about how many countries will be courageous enough to say that we can no longer continue producing the amount of plastics we currently produce for the sake of the environment and human well-being.”Siddharth Ghanshyam Singh, Centre for Science & Environment (CSE) said, “The moment to push for ambition is now. Opportunities like this don’t come often, and countries must remember who they are negotiating for; their people and our shared planet. We cannot allow a few vocal opponents to derail and delay progress. It’s time to stand firm and take a decisive step toward ending plastic pollution.”Pinky Chandran, Asia Pacific Coordinator, BFFP said “The plastic problem often resembles a kaleidoscope, with no single perspective illuminating the complete picture; in fact, each turn reveals a new representation. We must view the plastic problem as a tapestry, where every element is interconnected, interlinked, and interdependent. A fragmented, piecemeal approach simply won't suffice. And so there must be global binding measures to reduce plastic production, in order to tackle the plastic pollution problem, through just transition lens”.Siddika Sultana, Executive Director, Environment and Social Development Organization (ESDO) said ""South Asia is both a significant hotspot for plastic pollution and a center of innovation. To address this issue effectively, the region must shift from isolated national initiatives to coordinated regional action. A united approach—supported by enforcement, investment, and inclusivity—can establish South Asia as a leader in developing an effective global treaty on plastic waste. ""Punyathorn Jeungsmarn, Plastics Campaign Researcher, Environmental Justice Foundation said, “As a region, Southeast Asia is particularly affected by plastic pollution, and is increasingly becoming the dumping ground for plastic waste, misguided false solutions such as waste-to-energy technologies, and petrochemical expansion. It is therefore crucial for our representatives to stand up and put people and the planet over plastics and the petrochemical industry. Throughout the past rounds of negotiations, we have seen courageous stances from Southeast Asian countries. We hope to see those again in Geneva.”","Asia Pacific countries sit at the epicentre of both plastic production and pollution impacts.

TIRUNELVELI: The investigation into the murder of 27-year-old dalit man Kavin Selvaganesh has been transferred to the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID), the Tamil Nadu police said in a statement on Wednesday.This was because the parents of the main accused, S Surjith, 23, are serving as sub-inspectors in the Tamil Nadu Special Police Force, it said. Both Saravanan and Krishnakumari, named as co-accused in the FIR, were suspended from service. ""Considering the seriousness and importance of the case, and to guarantee an independent and unbiased investigation, the case has now been handed over to the CB-CID,"" the release added.Earlier in the day, Surjith was detained under Goondas Act following a detention order issued by Tirunelveli commissioner of police Santosh Hadimani.Meanwhile, for the fourth consecutive day, Kavin's parents refused to receive his body, demanding the arrest of Subashini's parents and action against police officials allegedly complicit in the case.Speaking to reporters in Tirunelveli, Kavin's father Chandrasekar alleged that Palayamkottai inspector Kasi Pandian threatened his son 15 days before the murder.""Even now, no senior officer has come forward to investigate. Pandian should be dismissed. If the govt does not act, we will resort to all forms of protest,"" he said.Kavin, a native of Tuticorin district and belonging to the scheduled caste devendra kula vellalar community, was hacked to death on July 27 at KTC Nagar in Tirunelveli. The murder is believed to have been triggered by his relationship with Subashini, a woman from the maravar caste.Meanwhile, A Kathir, founder of the dalit rights NGO Evidence, demanded that Krishnakumari and Saravanan be arrested immediately. At a press conference in Madurai, he claimed that Kavin's family possesses chat records confirming the relationship between Kavin and Subashini. ""This doesn't appear to be a murder executed solely by Surjith. The injury marks on Kavin's body suggest the involvement of trained assailants. The postmortem was done in haste, and we demand a second, transparent autopsy,"" he said.Kathir urged chief minister M K Stalin to respond to the incident, drawing parallels with the custodial death case in Madapuram. He called for a dedicated law to prevent caste-based killings in the state. Later in the evening, senior ministers K N Nehru and Anitha R Radhakrishnan, along with south zone IG Prem Anand Sinha and Tirunelveli city police commissioner Santosh Hadimani, met Kavin's parents and urged the family to receive the body, stating that the case had been transferred to the CB-CID. However, Kavin's parents refused to receive the body, insisting that Surjith's parents must be arrested since they have been named as accused in the FIR.","Kavin Selvaganesh, 27, was hacked to death on July 27 at KTC Nagar in Tirunelveli.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Wednesday that Canada will recognise a Palestinian state in September, but only if the Palestinian Authority commits to holding democratic elections and implementing key reformsThe statement came after Carney spoke with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas earlier in the day. The prime minister’s announcement follows similar moves by allied countries in recent days.""Canada intends to recognise the State of Palestine at the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025,"" Carney said, reported AFP. He added that the suffering in Gaza had become “intolerable” and emphasised that the move was necessary to preserve hopes of a two-state solution.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday that the United Kingdom will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza, allows United Nations aid into the region, and takes further steps toward long-term peace.France made a similar declaration last week but without conditions. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday there was “no alternative” to recognizing a Palestinian state and confirmed France intends to do so at the United Nations General Assembly in September.The issue has sparked growing political support within Canada. In the past week, several Liberal MPs have called on the government to follow France’s lead.Toronto MP Salma Zahid and Montreal-area MP Sameer Zuberi both posted on social media, urging Canada to join France in announcing recognition of a Palestinian state. Fares Al Soud, who represents Mississauga Centre, added that “justice for the Palestinian people demands recognition,” as quoted by CBS News.Last fall, dozens of MPs from the Liberal Party, NDP, Bloc Quebecois, and Green Party supported an international call for the recognition of Palestinian statehood.Canada has long supported the idea of a future Palestinian state that would coexist peacefully alongside Israel.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Wednesday that Canada will recognise a Palestinian state in September 2025.

Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad sparks 'white supremacy' backlash: White House calls outrage 'moronic'; says this is why 'Americans voted for Trump',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sydney-sweeneys-jeans-ad-sparks-white-supremacy-backlash-white-house-calls-outrage-moronic-says-this-is-why-americans-voted-for-trump/articleshow/123009271.cms,"



Donald Trump’s White House communications chief, Steven Cheung, has hit out at the backlash over actress Sydney Sweeney ’s new American Eagle jeans ad, calling the outrage “moronic” and blaming it on “cancel culture.”He argued that this kind of controversy is exactly why Donald Trump won the 2024 election, saying Americans are “tired of this.”Cheung dismissed the backlash as yet another example of cancel culture gone too far. “Cancel culture runs amok. This warped, moronic, and dense liberal thinking is a big reason why Americans voted the way they did in 2024. They're tired of this bulls**t,” he wrote on X.The controversy centers around a play on words, “great jeans” which many saw as a reference to her genetics rather than just the denim she wore.The ad features the 27-year-old Euphoria star as she is seen in a nostalgic Americana setting, fixing a car and driving while wearing American Eagle jeans.The campaign tagline, “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,” plays on the word “genes.”In a video, Sweeney uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”While meant to be lighthearted, the campaign sparked outrage online, with critics accusing it of celebrating Sweeney’s whiteness and thin physique.Some even went as far with several viral responses criticising the advertisement claiming it promotes racial superiority, eugenic ideologies, and Nazi-like propaganda regarding a superior race.Cheung wasn’t the only conservative to criticise the backlash over the ad. TV host Megyn Kelly also slammed the reaction, calling it “absurd” on her podcast and blaming the “lunatic left” for stirring up unnecessary outrage.“She’s being called a white supremacist by people who don’t like her latest ad, which is for American Eagle,” Kelly said.""She’s advertising jeans, and yet the lunatics on the left think she’s advertising white supremacy. This is obviously a reference to her body and not to her skin color, but the lunatic left is going to do what the lunatic left is going to do,"" she added.Kelly argued that critics are ""upset because it's about who gets to be the face of America's Best Genes. They think it's no accident that they've chosen a white, thin woman because you're, I guess, not allowed to celebrate those things in any way, shape, or form. But they're completely ignoring the reference to her body, which is the thing she's famous for. It's just absurd.""","Steven Cheung, the White House communications chief, has slammed the backlash over Sydney Sweeney’s new American Eagle jeans ad.

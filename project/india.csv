‘Incorrect, Baseless’: India Rebukes NATO Chief’s Claim of PM Modi Calling Up Putin After US Tariff

NEW DELHI: India has asked Russia to release 27 more of its citizens who were recently recruited into the Russian military, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said on Friday.""As per our information, 27 Indian nationals are presently serving in the Russian army. We are also in close touch with their family members in the matter,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters at his weekly briefing.Jaiswal said the government has taken up the issue at the highest levels. ""We have strongly raised this matter with Russian authorities in Moscow and with the Russian embassy in New Delhi, and asked for them to be freed as soon as possible. We are trying to get them out,"" he said.The MEA also issued a fresh warning to citizens. ""We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from the offers being made to serve in the Russian army as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,"" Jaiswal added, as quoted by PTI.One such case is that of Rakesh Kumar, a 30-year-old from Uttarakhand, who had travelled to Russia for higher studies. His family alleged that he was coerced into joining the Russian army and sent to the war front in Ukraine. They said they have had no contact with him since early September and are desperate for help. The family had written to the MEA, sought assistance from the Indian embassy in Moscow, and approached local officials in a bid to bring him back.Reports indicate that some Indians holding student and business visas were forced into joining Russian military units deployed on the frontlines in Ukraine. India has repeatedly asked Russia to release all Indians serving as support staff, including cooks and helpers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also raised the issue during his visit to Moscow last year.According to official figures, more than 150 Indians have been recruited into the Russian military. At least 12 have been killed, 96 discharged, and 16 remain missing.","India has asked Russia to release 27 more of its citizens who were recently recruited into the Russian military.

air quality

and

livelihoods

NEW DELHI: With its order banning crackers in Delhi and NCR openly breached during last Diwali, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to devise by Oct 8 a mechanism in consultation with stakeholders to ensure production and sale of only green crackers.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria said if the ban on bursting of crackers in Delhi NCR could not be enforced, it would be proper to allow sale of green crackers, which conform to norms devised by NEERI and Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO).Firecracker manufacturers through senior advocates Balbir Singh and K Parameswara pleaded for resumption of production of green crackers, saying workers are jobless. The Union govt, through additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, did not support a ban on green crackers.Amicus curiae Aparajita Singh told the bench that it is the enforcement which had been found to be lacking. There are instances where the green cracker manufacturing licence-holders sold labels to those producing non-green crackers, which emit noxious gases harmful to the infants, infirm and elderly, she said.The CJI-led bench said, ""As experienced, the Supreme Court's order imposing a complete ban on bursting of crackers could not be enforced. In one case where the SC banned mining, the illegal mafia took over and resorted to mining. Hence, it is necessary to adopt a balanced approach which safeguards both the ambient air quality and the livelihood of cracker unit workers.""The bench asked Bhati to communicate to the ministry of environment and forest to convene meeting of all stakeholders, and consult amicus curiae in arriving at a plan of action and mechanism to enforce green cracker only rule for Delhi and NCR, which from Diwali till major parts of the winter months get enveloped by a thick smog mainly because of burning of crop residue in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.SC permitted the manufacturers to commence production of green crackers strictly in conformity with the norms laid down by NEERI and PESO but barred them from selling these, for the time being, in Delhi-NCR. It said further orders on sale of these crackers in Delhi-NCR will be considered on Oct 8.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) informed the SC that there appear to be gaps in monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. ""A rigorous, transparent, and year-round enforcement and monitoring mechanism is required to oversee manufacturing, distribution and sale of firecrackers, whereby PESO and authorities must conduct random, surprise inspections and collect samples directly from firecracker manufacturing sites and selling premises for testing them to confirm whether they conform to the prescribed standards,"" it said.CAQM said given the extraordinary air pollution situation in Delhi-NCR, CPCB and CSIR-NEERI must assess the contribution of firecrackers to air pollution.NEERI favoured allowing green crackers across India based on the air quality status of different cities and regions. According to NEERI, ""The marketing of non-green fireworks should be controlled by PESO. CSIR-NEERI has provided a list of approved green firework manufacturers on its website. Any manufacturer not on the list and producing firecrackers should be making non-green (illegal) crackers, which require strict monitoring by the regulatory agency, PESO. ""","The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to devise by Oct 8 a mechanism to ensure production and sale of only green crackers.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday delivered a sharp rebuttal to Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ’s speech at the UN General Assembly, dismissing his remarks as “absurd theatrics” and asserting that “no degree of drama can conceal facts.”Indian diplomat Petal Gahlot, exercising the right of reply, sharply criticised Pakistan. “This assembly witnessed absurd theatrics in the morning from the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who once again glorified terrorism that is so central to their foreign policy,” Gahlot said.Pointing to Pakistan’s record on terrorism, Gahlot highlighted Islamabad’s role in the Pahalgam attack. “No degree of drama and no level of lies can conceal the facts. This is the very same Pakistan which, at the UN Security Council on 25th April 2025, shielded the resistance front - a Pakistani-sponsored terror outfit -- from the responsibility of carrying out the barbaric massacre of tourists in the Indian Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” she said.Recalling Pakistan’s history of sheltering terrorists, Gahlot said, “A country long steeped in the tradition of deploying and exporting terrorism has no shame in advancing the most ludicrous narratives to that end. Let us recall that it sheltered Osama bin Laden for a decade, even while pretending to partner in the war against terrorism. Its ministers have just recently acknowledged that they have been operating terrorist camps for decades.It should come as no surprise that once again this duplicity continues, this time at the level of its Prime Minister.”Earlier in the day, Pakistan PM Sharif used his UNGA speech to echo Donald Trump ’s claims, saying the US President played an “active role” in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after military action in May.Sharif alleged that India sought “political gains” after the Pahalgam attack and accused New Delhi of targeting “innocent civilians” while remaining silent on Islamabad’s own support for crossborder terrorism.“In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. The enemy came shrouded in arrogance, and we sent them back in humiliation. India sought to extract political gains from a human tragedy by spurning my sincere offer of an independent investigation into the Pahalgam incident. Instead, it attacked our cities and targeted our innocent civilians. When our territorial integrity and national security were violated, our response was in accordance with the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations charter,” Sharif said.Sharif also repeated his earlier false claim that Pakistan had shot down Indian fighter jets. He asserted that Pakistan’s forces responded with “stunning professionalism,” saying they repelled the aggression and “shot down seven Indian jets, sending them to scrap and dust.”In addition, Sharif raised the issue of the Indus Water Treaty , accusing India of violating its provisions.","Indian diplomat Petal Gahlot, exercising the right of reply, sharply criticised Pakistan. “This assembly witnessed absurd theatrics in the morning from the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who once again glorified terrorism that is so central to their foreign policy,” she said.

with teachings on virtue, wealth, and

love

and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

“My travels have changed me.”

“Everything you love will probably be lost. But in the end, love will return in another way.”

Those who see through ignorance to reality find bliss;

Others remain fettered by delusion.

For the young, death feels like smoke drifting somewhere far away; visible but distant. Life is a horizon that stretches endlessly. But as the years pass, the horizon shifts. Just as a stream running atop a hill must eventually surrender itself into a waterfall, the path of life too bends toward its inevitable descent.The first losses often come from a distance—distant relatives, grandparents, elders whose absence seems natural. But the circle keeps tightening. Parents, close relatives, friends; people we meet on an everyday basis begin their journey to the other shore. Some losses feel impossible to accept:As one ages, the news of death becomes strangely more frequent than the news of life. I remember my mother, in her later years, turning to the obituary page of her daily newspaper first. Then, as though offering a silent prayer for the departed—or perhaps breathing a sigh of relief that no familiar name appeared—she would turn to the other pages.Across civilizations, cultures, and religions, humanity has carried with it the idea of—'remember that you will die’. Far from being a grim obsession, this idea is a mirror, showing us what truly matters. Death, in its silent authority, has always been the ultimate purveyor of perspective. It strips away the petty burdens of worry, exposing how trivial most of our concerns are.When someone close departs, the memories arrive like lightning—sudden, sharp, and luminous. Time, the great healer, eventually lays a hand upon the wound. Acceptance grows, but never fully without scars. A familiar song, a forgotten photograph, or a date on the calendar is enough to unearth the pain again. How powerless we stand before the mighty force of Time, who takes away everyone and everything.I am reminded of a story from Franz Kafka’s life. One day he saw a little girl weeping over the loss of her beloved doll in a park. The next day, he handed her a letter ‘from the doll’, explaining that she had gone on a journey and would write of her adventures. Day after day, Kafka met the girl and read out letters full of imagined travels. Months later, he brought her a new doll, saying it had returned from its journeys. The girl protested,Kafka handed her another letter where the doll had written:The child embraced the doll and found peace.Years later, after Kafka’s death, the girl, now an adult, discovered a letter hidden inside the doll. In it, Kafka had written:That is the mystery of loss. People may depart, but the love they poured into us never vanishes. It lingers, takes new shapes, and strengthens us to continue living and passing that love forward. This great continuum—this unbroken chain of love—is perhaps all that life truly is.For those who awaken to this realization, joy and sorrow lose their sharp edges. Life’s ephemeral happenings no longer bind them. Thiruvalluvar expressed this profound vision with unmatched clarity:In the end, grief dissolves into perspective, love returns in other forms, and we learn to flow—like the river—toward the sea of acceptance.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124168512,imgsize-61458,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124168512.jpg"

It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he said.Trump has argued that tariffs will encourage domestic investment, dismissing concerns that higher import taxes raise costs for consumers and businesses.He claimed inflation was under control, despite the consumer price index rising 2.9% over the past year.

HYDERABAD: Rail connectivity between Telangana and Maharashtra is set to get a significant boost, as the railways have decided to introduce two new Vande Bharat trains — one between Hyderabad and Pune, and the other on the Secunderabad–Nanded route.These new services are expected to reduce travel times by two to three hours. This will be the third Vande Bharat connection from Hyderabad to Maharashtra, following the service to Nagpur.Hyderabad is currently served by four Vande Bharat trains, and adding these two routes aims to further strengthen connectivity and ease passenger movement between Telangana and Maharashtra.As part of the plan, the govt is considering replacing the Secunderabad–Pune Shatabdi Express with a Vande Bharat Express. The Shatabdi currently completes the journey in about eight and a half hours, operating six days a week (except Tuesdays) with limited stops and a composition of two AC executive class coaches, nine AC chair cars and two EOG cars.This comes in response to the overwhelming popularity of the existing Vande Bharat trains on the Secunderabad–Visakhapatnam, Secunderabad–Tirupati and Kacheguda–Yeshvantpur routes, which consistently run at high occupancy levels.Encouraged by this success, the railways have drawn up proposals for two more Vande Bharat services from Secunderabad, highlighting the growing demand from passengers for faster rail options.""With the addition of these two new trains, the South Central Railway (SCR) will operate seven Vande Bharat services, placing it among the zones with the highest number of these indigenous semi-high-speed trains. Meanwhile, the Secunderabad–Muzaffarpur Amrit Bharat Express is also set to launch within a month, providing an additional long-distance rail option from the city,"" said a railway official.","The railways have decided to introduce two new Vande Bharat trains.

'Both India, US-Based Firms Have Raised Concerns': Dhruva Jaishankar On H-1B Fee Hike

Firms will cut H-1B workers



Impact on startups







The Donald Trump administration’s sharp increase in visa fees for H-1B workers has triggered concern among US technology companies, with many considering moving more jobs overseas — the very outcome the policy aimed to prevent.US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants, a visa program long used by tech firms to recruit skilled workers and by international students seeking US employment after postgraduate studies.While the fee applies only to new applicants and not current visa holders, confusion around its rollout and cost has prompted companies to pause hiring and adjust workforce plans.“I have had several conversations with corporate clients … where they have said this new fee is simply unworkable in the US, and it's time for us to start looking for other countries where we can have highly skilled talent,” said Chris Thomas, immigration attorney at Colorado-based law firm Holland & Hart, as quoted by Reuters.“And these are large companies, some of them household names, Fortune 100 type companies, that are saying, we just simply cannot continue.”Previously costing employers only a few thousand dollars, the new $100,000 fee flips the equation, making hiring talent in countries like India, where wages are lower and Big Tech increasingly builds innovation hubs, more attractive.“We probably have to reduce the number of H-1B visa workers we can hire,” said Sam Liang, co-founder and CEO of AI meeting assistant startup Otter.ai.“Some companies may have to outsource some of their workforce — hire maybe in India or other countries just to walk around this H-1B problem,” he added.“Blanket rulings like this are rarely good for immigration,” said Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, which has invested in startups including AI firm Anthropic.“For larger companies, the cost is not material. For smaller companies, those with fewer than 25 employees, it's much more significant. Big tech CEOs expected this and will pay. For them, fewer small competitors is even an advantage. It’s the smaller startups that suffer most,” he added, as reported by Reuters.Analysts warn the policy could reduce the number of talented immigrants who often go on to launch new firms. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of US startups valued at $1 billion or more had at least one immigrant founder.","US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants.

Calcutta High Court on Friday struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.The court said the deportation was illegal and ordered that all six people, including three children, be brought back to India within a month. The court also dismissed the Centre’s request for a temporary stay on the order.Petitions were filed by family members of Sonali Bibi and Sweety Bibi, both from Paikar in Murarai, Birbhum.The women said their husbands and children had been living and working in Delhi for over 20 years as daily wage earners. On June 18, Delhi Police detained them on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals. Nine days later, on June 27, they were deported across the border. Reports said they were later arrested by the Bangladesh police.Sonali’s family told the court that she was nine months pregnant when deported, raising fears about her newborn’s citizenship if the child was born in Bangladesh.Lawyers for the families argued that the deportation was carried out despite them showing proper documents, including land papers, voter ID cards of their parents and grandparents, and birth certificates of their children issued by government hospitals.The Centre, in its affidavit, said the plea was not valid before the Calcutta High Court since petitions had already been filed in the Delhi High Court. It also argued that Delhi Police acted under instructions from the ministry of home affairs, which had issued a memo in May 2025 detailing the process for deporting Bangladeshi or Myanmar nationals.After the judgment, Trinamool Congress MP Samirul Islam said the court’s order exposed the BJP’s attempt to brand poor Bengali families as illegal immigrants wrongly. Calling it a “victory for Bengal,” he said the deportation was part of an anti-Bengali, anti-poor agenda.","Calcutta High Court struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday provided details on the deportation of Indian nationals from the United States during its weekly media briefing, highlighting the recent return of 73-year-old Harjit Kaur.""In the last several months, since January 2025, so far, we've had 2417 Indian nationals deported or repatriated from the United States. In the case of Harjeet Kaur, she also returned recently,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""We want to promote legal pathways of migration. At the same time, India stands against illegal migration,"" he added.Jaiswal explained that Indian authorities verify the nationality of individuals referred to them and facilitate their return only after confirming their documents and legal status.He added that whenever a person does not possess legal status in any country and is referred to India with claims of being an Indian national, authorities conduct a background check, confirm the nationality and then arrange their return. This is how deportations from the United States have been handled.Harjit Kaur, a Sikh woman from Pangota village in Tarn Taran, Punjab, had lived in the US for more than three decades after moving there with her sons following her husband’s death.She worked in the San Francisco Bay Area and had applied for asylum multiple times, all of which were denied. Her case attracted widespread attention in the US, with hundreds of people rallying in California demanding her release.Kaur was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during a routine immigration check on September 8 this year. She was placed in handcuffs, transported in a van to Georgia under harsh conditions and held without her family or attorney being informed. After about 48 hours in custody, ICE deported her to India.During the ordeal, she said, “After living there for so long, you are suddenly detained and deported this way, it is better to die than to face this. In such a situation, one should not live.”She added, “I was in handcuffs the entire time, I couldn’t sit properly, and no one informed my family.” Kaur described the journey as harrowing, highlighting the lack of food, water and medical care.","In the last several months, since January 2025, we've had 2417 Indian nationals deported or repatriated from the United States.

NEW DELHI: In a decision that could have a salutary bearing on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), Supreme Court on Friday reversed its eyebrow-raising May 2 verdict, directing liquidation of bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Limited, to put back in place the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's Feb 2020 decision to allow Sajjan-Jindal-led JSW Steel revive the failed entity.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Satish Chandra Sharma and K Vinod Chandran reversed the decision of a two-judge bench led by Justice Bela M Trivedi, since retired, accepting arguments of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Committee of Creditors, and senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul for JSW, which invested Rs 20,000 crore to revive BPSL and make it a profit-making company.The two-judge Supreme Court bench had rejected the Committee of Creditors-approved resolution plan of JSW, which was concurrently found to be sound by both National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and NCLAT. Using exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, SC had directed NCLT to initiate liquidation proceedings of BPSL while deciding an appeal by one of the promoters of BPSL challenging the resolution plan.Writing the 136-page judgment on operation of various IBC provisions, CJI Gavai said, ""The legislature purposefully did not include a means to challenge the commercial wisdom exercised by the CoC.This makes a challenge to the same non-justiciable... Any interference in the paramount objective of the CoC of exercising its commercial wisdom would amount to the court rewriting the law and going against the very objectives of the IBC. "" Referring to takeover of BPSL by JSW, the CJI-led bench said that since the IBC's objective of ensuring corporate debtor continues as a going concern has been achieved and loss-making BPSL has been transformed to a profit-making entity, the clock cannot be put back to penalise JSW by ordering BPSL's liquidation. ""This will defeat the very purpose of IBC to confer sanctity to the finality of duly approved resolution plan,"" SC said.The court rejected the COC's late-in-the-day argument for distribution of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) amongst creditors. SC said since the request for resolution plan (RfRP) issued by the resolution professional for the corporate insolvency resolution process did not provide for distribution of EBITDA among creditors, the COC cannot demand it now.SC said sans a specific provision in RfRP regarding distribution of EBITDA, it is impermissible for CoC to raise such a plea five years after approval of the resolution plan.""A successful resolution applicant (JSW in this case) cannot be faced with undecided claims after its resolution plan has been accepted. That would amount to 'hydra heads popping up' which would throw into uncertainty the amounts payable by a prospective resolution applicant who would take over the business of the corporate debtor,"" it said.RBI, in 2017, had issued a circular identifying 12 large-scale corporate defaulters, with outstanding debts valued at Rs 5,000 crore and above, infamously known as the ""dirty dozen"",which included BPSL.",Supreme Court on Friday reversed its May 2 verdict directing liquidation of Bhushan Power and Steel Limited.

Officials said the national transporter has put the project priority list as a part of the government’s Act East policy.In March 2024, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bhutan, both countries agreed to establish two rail links between India and Bhutan: Kokrajhar-Gelephu and Banarhat-Samtse. The 16-km Banarhat-Samtse stretch will connect West Bengal with Bhutan.These lines will give Bhutan its first-ever railway connectivity.Senior railway officials said that SRPs are important as they have strategic importance, strengthen national security and boost socio-economic growth through improved connectivity. “This is a strategic project as it will improve cross-border connectivity and strengthen bilateral ties.

There was no warning, no tear gas, no water cannon. Most of the injured were hit by bullets or pellets, which shows excessive use of force,” Dorjay told reporters.The protest was triggered after discontent over the Centre scheduling talks with LAB for October 6, despite worsening health conditions of participants in a hunger strike led by climate activist Sonam Wangchuk. According to Dorjay, more than 7,500 people, largely youth, gathered at the strike venue on September 24, compared to the usual 500.The agitation soon escalated into stone-pelting at the Hill Development Council office and vandalism at a BJP office.Dismissing allegations that the mob was armed, Dorjay said, “There was an attempt to give it an anti-national colour. Protesters removed party flags but did not touch the national flag. Many even carried the tricolour.”He also refuted suggestions by Ladakh Lieutenant Governor Kavinder Gupta and others about foreign involvement, calling it an attempt to deflect blame. “If there was a foreign hand, what were the security agencies doing? Outsiders may have been injured, but that was because of indiscriminate firing,” he said.Dorjay further claimed that newly deployed CRPF personnel beat up bystanders and that the force’s presence was part of a plan to “suppress the movement.”On the way forward, he said the LAB has sought bail for those detained and will resume talks with the Union home ministry after the funerals of the victims. “It is crucial to know why live bullets were used on the head and chest. A judicial probe is essential to establish accountability,” he added.","Leh Apex Body rejects claims of a ‘foreign hand’ in the recent violence in Leh that left four people dead and nearly 90 injured.

Ladakh Violence: Sonam Wangchuk Ends 15-Day Hunger Strike

NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh after the Central Bureau of Investigation had initiated an inquiry.According to official findings, SECMOL received and deposited foreign contributions in contravention of Sections 8, 12, 17, 18 and 19 of the FCRA . The ministry alleged that in FY 2021-22, Sonam Wangchuk deposited Rs 3.35 lakh in SECMOL’s FCRA account in violation of Section 17. While the association claimed the sum was the sale proceeds of an old bus purchased with FCRA funds and thus rightly deposited in the FCRA account, the government noted discrepancies between the transaction details in its returns and the actual bank credits, calling the explanation “untenable.”Authorities also flagged that in FY 2020-21, local contributions amounting to Rs 54,600 from three individuals were credited to the FCRA account instead of the local account, a violation admitted by the association as an “inadvertent” error.Further, SECMOL received Rs 4.93 lakh from Swedish organisation Framtidsjorden for youth-awareness programmes on migration, climate change and food security. While the NGO said the funds were used strictly for educational purposes, the ministry observed that part of the grant involved “study on sovereignty of the country,” which cannot be funded by foreign contributions under Section 12(4) of the Act.""We received RS.4,93,205/- from framstidjorden for educational program for youths under the FE project for creating awareness among youth on issues such as migration, climate change, global warming, food security and Sovereignty and organic farming through different workshops and trainings. The funds were utilized stricty in line with the organization's objectives and for the specific purposes for which they were allocated. Hence, all these activities were educational and there was no violation,"" association replied.The ministry also pointed to a Rs 19,600 foreign donation returned to a donor during the Covid lockdown and a Rs 79,200 deduction from staff stipends that was recorded as food-fee receipts instead of disbursed salaries, which it said reflected poor accounting and possible violations of Sections 18 and 19.""AND WHEREAS, in view of violations as enumerated above u/s 8(1)(a), 17,18,19 and conditions of registration under section 12(4)(f) (i) of the Act, the FCRA registration certificate of the association is liable to be cancelled in exercise of power u/s 14 of the Act,"" the statement read.""NOW THEREFORE, considering the facts and position narrated in preceding paras, the Competent Authority, hereby, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14(1) of the Act, cancels with immediate effect the FCRA Certificate of Registration No. 152710012R granted to the association ""Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh,"" the statement added.The CBI 's investigation, based on a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs, began about 10 days ago when CBI officials visited the institution in Ladakh, PTI reported.Reacting to the MHA's statement, which had blamed him for provoking mob violence, Wangchuk stated that he is prepared to be arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).""To say it was instigated by me, or sometimes by Congress, is to find a scapegoat, rather than addressing the core of the problem, and this will lead us nowhere. They may be clever in making somebody else a scapegoat, but they are not wise. At this time, we all need wisdom rather than 'cleverness' because youths are already frustrated,"" Wangchuk told PTI over the phone.The activist, who has been leading the peaceful agitation for statehood and constitutional safeguards for Ladakh, also raised concerns over his personal safety.""I see they are building up a case to bring me under the Public Safety Act and throw me in jail for two years,"" he said, adding, ""I am ready for that, but Sonam Wangchuk in jail may cause them more problems than free Sonam Wangchuk.""Over CBI probe on his institute for alleged FCRA violation, Activist Sonam Wangchuk told ANI, ""In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk.""""A day later (after Leh protests), the Home Ministry of India issued a press release naming Sonam Wangchuk in it and blaming him... I had received a notice about a CBI inquiry stating that your organisation received foreign funding even when it did not have FCRA. We did not get FCRA because we don't want funds from abroad. United Nations team wanted to take our Passive Solar Heated Building to Afghanistan, and for this, they gave us a fee. We also got fees with tax from Switzerland and Italy organisations for supplying knowledge to them about our artificial glaciers...We are getting I-T summons. In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk,"" he added.The investigation coincides with recent unrest in Ladakh, where the protest turned the violent protests that erupted in Ladakh on September 24 over demands for statehood and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The protest took a violent turn with the BJP office and several vehicles set on fire and hundreds of people taking to the streets.The region experienced its worst violence since 1989 on Wednesday, with youth groups engaging in arson and vandalism at the BJP headquarters and Hill Council, including burning vehicles. Law enforcement had to use teargas to control the situation.","The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh.

""Despite the outrage over my detention and sympathy for me, the authorities in the US were simply unmoved,"" she said.She was flown from Georgia to Armenia and then to New Delhi, along with 132 others, many of whom were Punjabis, she said. She was the only one not shackled and handcuffed. ""I was the oldest, you see,"" Kaur said.Her lawyer in the US, Deepak Ahluwalia, put out a video narrating the 60-70 hours before her deportation flight to India. ""She was not given a bed and had to share a holding room. There was a concrete bench. She was made to sleep on the floor with a blanket. She was unable to get up when she would lie down because she had double knee replacement surgery.""Ahluwalia added, ""She would ask for food so she could take her medicines. Those requests were ignored. Not that she wasn't fed at all. She was given a cheese sandwich. When she asked again to have something or even water to take her medication, she was given a plate of ice. She explained she had dentures and could not eat them. The guard told her — ‘that's your fault'.""Kaur was even denied a shower the entire time, said the lawyer. ""Prior to the flight on Monday around 7pm, she and other detainees were given wet wipes and told to just clean up before they boarded. Throughout this entire ordeal, no food,"" he said.Ahluwalia said an officer was apparently going to cuff and shackle Kaur as they ""usually do on the plane,"" but another officer said not to because of her age. ""The point I am trying to make here is how a 73-year-old grandmother with no criminal record was treated. And everyone can keep saying she had a final order of removal and she was asked to leave. ICE has suggested in their response to media articles that she had exhausted all her appeal options. That's correct. What's completely incorrect is that she chose to stay here when her case was denied or the last appeal option ran out.""Kaur is heartbroken that she could not even bid a proper farewell to her home in the US. ""I couldn't go back even once to take care of my belongings, which were lying the way I left them,"" she told TOI.Now back in India, she said she was ""unwell"" and would stay with her sister in Mohali for the time being. ""Let's see what is in store for my life,"" she said.Kaur has all sympathy for those who were deported with her. ""They spent lakhs to go there. Some of them had spent 10 months to a year in detention and now return empty-handed. They were in distress as they had sold their land to reach US,"" said the elderly woman.Kaur's younger brother, Kulwant Singh, a farmer in Pangota village, told TOI that he and the entire family would take care of her.""We were able to get a travel document by ourselves and were trying to negotiate with ICE attorneys and US govt for her to depart on a commercial flight. That's all we were asking for,"" Ahluwalia said.""We had asked to release her for even 24 hours. You can put ankle monitoring, or do whatever you need to, but give her a chance to say her goodbyes and take care of what she needs to take care of, and she will depart from San Francisco on Monday. We had attached the flight ticket, but they stopped responding. And around 2am on Saturday, without notifying the attorney or anyone else, they took her from Mesa Verde and drove her to LA in handcuffs,"" he added.Ahluwalia said that a separate complaint would be given on the way Kaur was treated during her deportation. Kaur said whatever her counsel said in the video was true.Kulwant Singh, the younger brother, said that Harjit was second among four siblings. Their eldest brother Jasbir Singh passed away. ""It's sad the way she has been deported. She has been separated from her family. Now, I and our other family members will take care of her in Punjab, "" said Singh.","Harjit Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind.

Caught by fingerprint: Indian-origin man's citizenship revoked; he used new name after being asked to leave US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/caught-by-fingerprint-indian-origin-mans-citizenship-revoked-he-used-new-name-after-being-asked-to-leave-us/articleshow/124124422.cms,"Indian-origin man's citizenship revoked in US as he created new identity and became citizen in 2005, a decade after he was asked to leave.

Poll Do you believe that the U.S. government should have stricter measures against identity fraud in immigration? Yes, definitely No, current measures are sufficient





The Donald Trump administration busted a major scam involving identity change to stay in the country by an Indian-origin man. Meet Gurdev Singh Sohal, also known as Dev Singh, also known as Boota Singh Sundu -- the man goes by various identities since he was ordered to be deported in 1994. The administration now revealed that instead of leaving the country, Singh changed his identity and got citizenship in 2005.The name Dev Singh had an exclusion order and his pushed that identity to oblivion to become Gurdev Sohal. He did not disclose his prior immigration history under the Dev Singh identity in any of his immigration applications or proceedings when he naturalized.Expert analysis in February 2020 confirmed that the fingerprints submitted under both identities came from the same individual. The analysis was only made possible after DHS digitized the paper fingerprint submission documents from older immigration files, Justice department documents revealed. “If you lie to the government or hide your identity so that you can naturalize, this Administration will find you and strip you of your fraudulently acquired US citizenship. ” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.The DoJ filed a civil denaturalization complaint against Sohl and said he illegally procured his US citizenship because he was never lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The lies he told throughout his naturalization process rendered him unable to show the requisite good moral character to naturalize, the document said. A third count charged Sohal with procuring his naturalization by concealment or willful misrepresentation of his prior identity and immigration proceedings.","Indian-origin man's citizenship revoked in US as he created new identity and became citizen in 2005, a decade after he was asked to leave.

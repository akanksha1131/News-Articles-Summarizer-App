KOLKATA: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) leader and actor Mithun Chakraborty has strongly responded to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee 's remarks regarding the Maha Kumbh and said that her statements are inaccurate as 70 crore people attended and took a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam that proves the immense influence of Sanatana Dharma .""What she is saying is wrong. 70 crore people have come here and took a holy dip, is that incorrect?... People have seen the power of Sanatan Dharam,"" Mithun said.Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee had earlier stated on Tuesday that the claim of Maha Kumbh occurring after 144 years was untrue.""After 144 years, Mahakumbh will come. This is not right. If I'm wrong, correct me. As per my knowledge, the punya snan (holy dip) system comes every year. Actually, we organise the Gangasagar Mela. That's why I know about the holy dip,"" she added.Earlier, CM Mamata Banerjee said that she respects the Maha Kumbh, but it is the ""Mrityu Kumbh"" today.This is 'Mrityu Kumbh'. I respect Mahakumbh, I respect the holy Ganga Maa. But there is no planning. How many people have been recovered?"" she said.On Tuesday, the West Bengal CM clarified her remarks on Maha Kumbh and said that she was talking about the preparations for the grand event. She said that people would suffer if there was no planning.Banerjee further demanded that the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Yogi Adityanath, should compensate the families of those who died in the Maha Kumbh stampede.""I never said about pilgrims who took a holy dip in Mahakumbh, I respect them. I'm talking about the system and preparation there. If there is no planning, people will suffer. I appeal to the Yogi government to give compensation to those who died in the Mahakumbh 2025 stampede,"" she said.",BJP leader and actor Mithun Chakraborty has strongly responded to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's remarks regarding the Maha Kumbh.

Spirit Shines Through

Crucible Of Chaos

Moment Of Communion

Such A Long Journey

As a photojournalist, crowds fascinate me. And here I was, a speck in the middle of Maha Kumbh Mela, the largest gathering of humanity on Earth. Overwhelming, chaotic, and yet profoundly moving, this was an event unlike any other.For three days, I was immersed in a sea of millions, witnessing from close the fervour and devotion that drew people from every corner of this vast country to the banks of Triveni Sangam .My days would begin well before the first light of dawn, with a gruelling 20km trek to the riverbank. The sheer density of the crowd made walking a challenge. Jostled and pushed at every step, I kept going nevertheless, my eyes on the reward of this unique spiritual and cultural journey.What struck me was the determination and faith that drove the pilgrims’ progress. There were families that had walked for days, wideeyed children clinging to their parents, and elderly people perched on younger shoulders — all driven by the sacred calling of the river.In the midst of this human tide, I couldn’t help but notice the stark realities of a pilgrimage of this scale, especially for the underprivileged.Thousands slept in the open, huddling for warmth on chill-laden nights. Families cooked and ate by the roadside as droves of new arrivals filed past. The aroma of food and incense hung in the air, creating a quaint sensory symphony with the constant hum of chanting and prayers.Amid chaos and the daily struggles of ordinary pilgrims, there were moments of kindness and em pathy — strangers becoming friends and sharing whatever little they had with one another, children passing from hand to hand, and the elderly getting help from whoever they approached.With each passing day, the crowds seemed to grow thicker and almost impossible to manage. After being in several stampede-like situations in my short time there, I feared an accident was waiting to happen. And then a stampede unravelled right before my eyes. I was lucky to have enough time to escape being caught in the crush of panicky feet by climbing onto a mini-van.From the relative safety of my perch, I saw scores of children and women freeze as people around them desperately sought space that didn’t exist. The agony on their faces made me get down and somehow help carry 29 children to safety, as their mothers clung to the sides of the van.The sight of people screaming and crying as they tried to find their loved ones will forever haunt me. As the night wore on, I would learn that the stampede had claimed many lives. Siren-blaring ambulances carrying away the dead and the injured were a constant reminder of the tragedy. I felt helpless, unable to do anything but capture glimpses of the horror and pain through my lens.The next day, I stood on a roof, waiting for the sadhus to take a dip in the holy confluence. Then the news came that they had cancelled their plans due to the stampede the previous night. I was disappointed.As I prepared to leave, there was another announcement that the sadhus would arrive at 1pm. That didn’t happen either. I went back to the tent to pack my bags and leave by around 2.40pm. A third announcement confirmed that sadhus and the mela administration had decided to proceed with the ritual.I again ran 10km to the riverbank, my heart pounding with excitement. As I reached the water’s edge, I saw the most incredible sight — thousands of sadhus, their bodies painted in ash and vermilion, wading into the sacred waters to be in communion with their spirituality.Exhausted as I was by the end, all the tiredness vanished at the thought of having captured what I believed was a photo story for the ages.The journey back home was, however, fraught with challenges that would again test my patience and resolve. The roads were jammed, and we were stuck in traffic for hours. We took detours through villages, where the roads were narrow and winding.When we finally reached the main road, we were diverted again, adding hours to our journey. I missed my flight and had to wait another day to head home.In a way, the assignment ended just as it had started. Within minutes of reaching the media centre in Prayagraj on the day of our arrival, our belongings had been stolen from the car. This happened in the five-minute window that we were away collecting our media passes. I lost my clothes and two bags containing documents and hard disks were gone. For three days, I had to make do with a jacket and a blanket shared by a colleague.As I look back on the trip, the overriding feeling is of fulfilment. The experience was not just a story captured through my lens, but a life lesson in perseverance and the shared essence of our individual journeys. It’s a story I will carry with me.","Photographer SL Shanth Kumar of TOI captures the essence of Maha Kumbh Mela. Overwhelming, chaotic, and yet profoundly moving, this was an event unlike any other.

"AAP’s liquor policy caused Rs 2,000cr loss to government: CAG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aaps-liquor-policy-caused-rs-2000cr-loss-to-government-cag/articleshow/118569185.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi government suffered a revenue loss of more than Rs 2,000 crore in implementing the contentious Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22, the Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG ) revealed in a report that was tabled in Delhi assembly on Tuesday. The policy was withdrawn after nine months following registration of a case by CBI in July 2022 to probe alleged irregularities in its formulation and implementation.The federal auditor highlighted that the recommendations of an expert committee — formed by govt to identify lacunae in the previous excise policy and suggest changes for the formation of a new excise policy — were ignored without any justification. The new policy had inherent design issues which increased the risk of monopolisation and cartel formation.The CBI case and a related probe by ED into alleged charges of money laundering snowballed into a major political slugfest between BJP and AAP govt in Delhi. The investigating agencies arrested several people in the case, including the then chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal , his deputy, Manish Sisodia , and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh . All three are currently out on bail.CAG evaluated Delhi govt's regulation and supply of liquor in the capital from 2017-18 to 2020-21 financial years. The report was reportedly sent to the LG and Delhi govt nearly 10 months ago but was not tabled in the assembly. Newly elected CM Rekha Gupta tabled the report, which is said to be one of 14 pending with Delhi govt, on Tuesday.According to CAG, Delhi excise department claimed a loss of revenue to the tune of Rs 941.53 crore, saying timely permissions were not taken for opening liquor vends in non-conforming municipal wards while Rs 890.15 crore was lost on account of licence fee after 19 zonal licensees surrendered their permits much before the policy was withdrawn but re-tendering could not be done. It added that there was a loss of Rs 144 crore due to the “irregular grant of waiver” to licensees because of Covid-related restrictions and closure of shops for a month from Dec 28, 2021, to Jan 27, 2022, while Rs 27 crore was the shortfall of the security deposit collected from zonal licensees.The report states that Master Plan Delhi-2021 prohibited the opening of liquor vends in non-conforming areas but Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 mandated opening at least two retail vends in each ward. “The excise department did not take timely action to work out modalities for the proposed vends in non-conforming areas and the initial tender was floated on June 28, 2021, without taking comments from DDA and MCD,” it said.“Audit noted that due to a number of issues ranging from a weak policy framework to deficient implementation of the policy...there was a cumulative loss of approximately 2,002.68 crore,” said CAG.The report said that a group of ministers (GoM), headed by the then deputy CM and excise minister Manish Sisodia, changed several recommendations of the expert committee formed to formulate the policy and allowed private parties to handle wholesale liquor operations, introduced one-time bidding instead of a lottery system to allocate vends and let licensees have 54 vends against the recommended two per entity. It added that certain decisions with revenue implications — relaxation of the coercive action mandated against defaulter licensees, waiver in license fee, refund of earnest money deposit in case of the airport zone and correction in formulae to calculate maximum retail price of foreign liquor — were taken without having mandatory approval of the cabinet and opinion of the lieutenant governor.The auditor pointed out that the policy led to the risks of monopolies and brand pushing by allowing an “exclusive arrangement” between a few wholesalers and manufacturers and letting the distributors dominate the liquor supply chain. According to the report, just three distributors controlled over 71% of the total liquor supply chain in the capital and virtually decided which brand would succeed or fail.The report mentioned that of 367 registered Indian Made Foreign Liquor brands, 25 accounted for nearly 70% of total liquor sales in Delhi and very few popular ones formed the bulk of sales volume, thus pointing towards formation of a cartel.“The policy mandated an exclusive arrangement between a manufacturer and wholesalers, which led to the entire supply of all brands of a particular manufacturer being controlled by only one wholesaler. This becomes particularly relevant considering the fact that 367 IMFL brands were registered in Delhi,” the report mentioned.This, the CAG mentioned, led to limiting the number of total licensees and increasing the risk of monopolisation and cartel formation. Under the new excise policy, wholesale licences for the supply of IMFL and FL were granted to 14 business entities, whereas the same were granted to 77 manufacturers of IMFL and 24 suppliers of FL in the old policy (2020-21).“Similarly, for the purpose of retail vends, Delhi was divided into 32 zones (containing 849 vends) whose licences were granted to 22 entities through tendering whereas 377 retail vends were run by four govt corporations and 262 retail vends were allotted to private individuals previously,"" the report said.It added that the GoM had mentioned in its report that the entire liquor retail market under the old excise regime was controlled by a few big players through a fraudulent proxy model, but the new policy – instead of removing this anomaly – recommended distribution of retail licences in zones where one entity or person could get up to 54 vends (in two zones, the maximum one could be allotted).According to the report, the licensees were required to set up laboratories before they were granted the licence but the excise department issued the related guidelines only a week before the new policy was rolled out. “The essential pre-condition to set up laboratories to ensure quality of liquor supplied was not enforced by the excise department due to delay in issuing guidelines. The licensees were allowed an extension of two months initially for setting up of the laboratory though there was no provision for this in the policy. A further extension till March 31, 2022, was granted due to the Covid pandemic. Even after this extension, they were set up only in 19 out of 62 warehouses. Batch testing was not even started in these labs,” said the report.CAG said the department was supposed to constitute special teams to pick up samples from bonded warehouses, retail vends, hotels, clubs and restaurants across all brands and publish reports of the same on the website. No reply was provided in spite of multiple reminders and it could not be verified whether such special teams were ever constituted, it stated.“Several fundamental changes were effected in the excise policy for 2021-22 relating to the levy and collection of excise duty, administration of the liquor supply chain and coverage of retail operations. The actual policy contained provisions which were at variance with the underlying objectives for change in policy and the expert committee report,” the CAG report mentioned.“Responsibility and accountability should be fixed for the lapses observed and the enforcement mechanism should be strengthened,” it concluded.","Delhi government suffered a revenue loss of more than Rs 2,000 crore in implementing the contentious Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22.

Sajjan Kumar gets two life terms for 2 murders during 1984 riots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sajjan-gets-two-life-terms-for-2-murders-during-1984-riots/articleshow/118568629.cms,"File photo of Sajjan Kumar (Pic credit: PTI)

Testimonies of victims’ kin nailed Sajjan

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Tuesday awarded two life terms to Congress ex-MP Sajjan Kumar (80) for murdering a Sikh man and his son during the anti-Sikh riots in Nov 1984. The court said the offences committed were ""undoubtedly brutal and reprehensible"".The two life terms - one for the double murders and another for offences under Section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc.) of the IPC - will run concurrently.The court had on Feb 12 convicted Kumar in the case for killing Jaswant Singh and son Tarundeep Singh in Saraswati Vihar.Refusing to consider the case in the ""rarest of rare"" category to be fit for awarding death sentence, special judge Kaveri Baweja cited several ""mitigating factors"", including Kumar's age, his health condition and his bedridden wife. ""The satisfactory conduct of the convict as per report of jail authorities... the fact he has roots in society and the possibility of his reformation and rehabilitation are material considerations which, in my opinion, tilt the scales in favour of a sentence for life imprisonment,"" Baweja said.Kumar is already serving a life term in a case related to the anti-Sikh riots awarded by Delhi High Court in 2018. The court had specified in that case that he will remain in jail for the rest of his life.Senior advocate HS Phoolka, who appeared on behalf of the complainant in the case, explained the two life sentences awarded by the court. ""One has been awarded for murder under Section 302 of IPC and the other for offences under 436 IPC. The minimum prescribed sentence for murder and the maximum sentence for offences under 436 IPC have been awarded. Both sentences will run concurrently, but two life sentences will have a serious bearing on any plea by Kumar for bail. Getting bail will be difficult,"" said Phoolka.The court pointed out that the incident in question can said to be a part of the same chain of incidents for which Kumar was sentenced to life imprisonment by Delhi High Court on December 12, 2018. He had been found guilty of causing the death of five innocent persons during a similar incident of rioting following the assassination of Indira Gandhi.""Though the killing of two innocent persons in the present case is no less an offence...the above noted circumstances, in my opinion, do not make this a 'rarest of rare case' warranting imposition of the death penalty for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC,"" the court observed.Outlining the brutality suffered by the victims, the court said it has been established that the victims in the present case witnessed not only the brutal killing of their family members at the hands of the rioting mob, which Kumar was a part of, but also the burning and destruction of their house and looting of their belongings.""The helplessness of the victims and the lack of any support whatsoever from the neighbours and also the police have been established from their uncontroverted depositions. In these circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that this is a fit case where the convict must also be awarded life imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section 436 IPC r/w Section 149 IPC in addition to a fine,"" said the court.The court listed various aggravating factors in the case, including the murder of two innocent persons by burning them in the presence of their family members, inflicting injuries and the resultant continuing trauma of the survivor victims (wife, daughter, and niece of deceased victim Jaswant Singh) and destruction of their house and belongings by the mob, of which Kumar was a member during rioting, targeting of male members of a particular community and Kumar's conviction in a similar case by Delhi HC where five persons were murdered by a mob of which Kumar was held to be the leader.However, the court's inclination went in favour of the mitigating circumstances while sentencing Kumar.The court called the testimonies of the witnesses - the complainant wife, daughter and niece of deceased Jaswant Singh ""reliable"" and uncontroverted as they proved that their house at Raj Nagar in Saraswati Vihar, Delhi, was set on fire by the said mob.While sentencing Kumar, the court took note of a report of Tihar Jail authorities, which stated that on account of his prevailing health conditions, Kumar was unable to carry out his daily routine/activities properly. The report said that due to his frail health, he is also not able to do any work in jail.The report also said that he is under treatment and has been prescribed antidepressants and sleep medicines. He otherwise does not show any signs and symptoms of mental illness and does not require any psychiatric intervention at present, said the report of the jail administration.","A Delhi court awarded two life terms to Congress ex-MP Sajjan Kumar (80) for murdering a Sikh man and his son during the anti-Sikh riots in Nov 1984.

Now, as Maha Kumbh draws to a close after Wednesday's Maha Shivratri snan , the sacred hum of prayers will fade. The makeshift settlements along Triveni Sangam will be dismantled. The city will slowly return to its everyday rhythm.The farewell will take place at Kashi Vishwanath temple , with Naga sadhus - ascetics wrapped in ash and mystery - offering prayers on Maha Shivratri. Their journey, one that began in the confluence of Sangam, will culminate in Varanasi, the timeless city where Shiva himself is believed to reside. ""We will bow before Kashi Vishwanath in all its splendour,"" said Mahant Prem Giri, president of Juna Akhara, overseeing the final preparations. With chariots mounted on tractor trolleys and the air thick with chants of ""Har Har Mahadev"", the Shaiv Akharas will part ways.Some will remain in Varanasi to oversee internal matters and prepare for upcoming akhara elections, while the rest will disperse to distant hermitages, awaiting their next great gathering in Trimbakeshwar for the Nasik Kumbh in 2027.

"In rare surgery, docs separate ‘parasitic twin’ from 17-year-old",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-rare-surgery-docs-separate-parasitic-twin-from-17-year-old/articleshow/118568388.cms,"Freed from ‘parasitic twin’, boy makes quick recovery

NEW DELHI: In a rare surgical procedure, doctors at AIIMS successfully conducted a procedure to separate a ‘parasitic twin’ weighing 15 kg from a 17-year-old boy hailing from UP’s Unnao district. The occurrence of conjoined twins is notably uncommon, with frequencies of 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 births. In certain instances, incomplete development results in asymmetrical or ‘parasitic twins’, where one twin (autosite) develops fully while the other (parasite) remains dependent. Such cases are exceedingly rare, with only 40 documented instances in world medical literature.Dr Asuri Krishna, additional professor in the surgery department, noted that when the boy visited AIIMS OPD on Jan 28, they initially mistook his covered abdomen for a carried child. Instead, they discovered two fully developed lower limbs with external genitalia attached to his abdomen.Since birth, the boy lived with these additional limbs from his underdeveloped twin. The parasitic appendage, including underdeveloped male genitalia, grew proportionally with him. The boy experienced sensations, including touch, pain and temperature in the parasitic limb. Despite occasional abdominal discomfort, he maintained normal bodily functions without major health complications.His condition led to considerable social isolation and emotional difficulties throughout childhood. Local medical practitioners advised against removal, warning of potential fatality due to shared cardiac connections. These circumstances forced him to discontinue his education after 8 years of age. His physical limitations included the inability to sleep on his abdomen.The parasitic structure received nutrition through blood supply from the host twin. Medical experts noted that as patients age, such parasitic growths can potentially cause cardiovascular complications and neurological issues, posing life-threatening risks.Following a relative's suggestion, he sought treatment at AIIMS as a last hope. Upon arrival, a multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiologists and anaesthesiologists evaluated his condition.AIIMS specialists noted that whilst prenatal screening can detect this condition, the patient's socio-economic background prevented early diagnosis.CT angiography revealed the parasitic limb's blood supply originated from an internal mammary artery branch. The scan also identified a substantial abdominal cystic mass. After comprehensive preparation, surgery was scheduled for February 8, 2025.The complex procedure involved two phases: removing the parasitic limb through careful dissection and vessel ligation, followed by excision of the abdominal cystic mass.Surgeons discovered and removed underdeveloped testes within the attachment site tissue. The second phase required careful separation of the cystic mass from surrounding organs. They noted an unusually high bladder extension, which required precise surgical management. Post-procedure drainage and suturing completed the operation. The operation lasted between 2 and 2.5 hours.Doctors said that the patient was free from additional health complications. Recovery was swift, with successful oral feeding resuming the next day. The medical team removed the drain on the third day, and the patient was cleared to go home on the fourth day.After 17 years of physical and emotional challenges, the successful surgery brought immense relief. Initially experiencing phantom sensations, the patient could finally anticipate a conventional lifestyle.The achievement resulted from collaborative efforts of numerous specialists, including Dr Asuri Krishna, Dr VK Bansal, Dr Sushant Soren, Dr Brijesh Kumar Singh, Dr Abhinav Kumar, Dr Jaymeen Makwana from Surgical Disciplines, Dr Manish Singhal and Dr Sashank from plastic surgery, Dr Ganga Prasad and Dr Rakesh from anaesthesia, and Dr Atin and Dr Ankita from radiology.","17-year-old boy was born with two fully developed lower limbs with external genitalia attached to his abdomen.

Deep-sea quake in Bay of Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deep-sea-quake-in-bay-of-bengal/articleshow/118568278.cms,"KOLKATA: The city woke up to tremors that measured 5.1 on the Richter scale on Tuesday morning. Even though the earthquake did not cause any destruction or injury, it led to momentary panic.The National Centre for Seismology confirmed the earthquake at 6.10 am and traced its epicentre to the Bay of Bengal, off the Puri coast, at a depth of 91 km and 340 km south of Kolkata.Social activist Soumali Chakraborty was shaken out of slumber by the quake. ""It was early in the morning, and I was still asleep when I felt my bed shaking. I was so scared as I had no clue as to what was happening. Later, I realised that it must be an earthquake. Luckily, it lasted only a few seconds,"" said the New Town resident.Neera Bhatiya of Sodepur was in the kitchen preparing the morning tea when she felt the tremor. She was taken aback, wondering what was happening. Soon she realised that an earthquake had just shaken parts of Kolkata and the surrounding areas. ""I was making my morning tea when I felt the tremor. It was quite subtle and lasted only a few seconds,"" said Bhatiya, who runs Eurokids International.Despite the moderate magnitude of the quake, there was no report of damage to property or injury. Seismologists said this was due to the depth of the epicentre, which reduced the intensity of the tremor on the surface. Shallow earthquakes originating five to 10 km below the surface are the ones that cause more damage.""The shaking of my bed woke me up. I was perplexed. I realised the situation when my phone showed an earthquake notification alert,"" said Howrah resident Subhankar Das. ""I wake up early every day, and Tuesday was no different. I was leaning on my bed, listening to music, when I suddenly felt the tremor. Later, I found out that it was an earthquake,"" added Tanisha Chetrii, a student from Dum Dum.Experts said that Kolkata lies in Seismic Zone III, indicating a moderate risk of earthquakes, although the city is not as prone to severe seismic activity as regions like the Northeast.Tuesday's earthquake follows a similar one on Jan 8, when mild tremors were felt across Kolkata and its neighbouring districts following a powerful earthquake in Tibet and parts of Nepal.""While preparing for a recording, I noticed my mic setup and table shaking slightly. At first, I thought it was because I tend to shake my legs, but then I realised that it wasn't the reason.

PANAGARH/CHANDERNAGORE: A high-speed car chase on national highway 2 early Monday ended in tragedy as 27-year-old dancer and event manager Sutandra Chatterjee lost her life when her vehicle overturned. Chatterjee, a resident of Chandernagore in Bengal, was traveling to Gaya in Bihar for work when the accident occurred around 12.30am. While Chatterjee, seated in the front passenger seat, bled to death, at least two of her colleagues suffered injuries. Police have seized both vehicles involved in the chase, but have yet to make any arrests.Durgapur-Asansol police commissioner Sunil Kumar Choudhary said the crash resulted from an overtaking attempt gone wrong. ""We have studied CCTV footage and have found that trouble arose when a white car, while overtaking the woman's car, grazed it. As per CCTV footage, the woman's car was chasing the other vehicle and met with the accident leading to the woman's death. We have started a case based on a complaint by one of the occupants of the car in which the woman was traveling,"" he said.Chatterjee's colleagues, including Mintu Mondal - who later lodged an FIR - and driver Rajdeo Sharma, gave a different account. They alleged that the occupants of the white car had been harassing Chatterjee before ramming their vehicle multiple times over a 10km stretch.""There were five men in the car. They constantly honked and made obscene gestures at madam while driving next to our car. They kept overtaking us and then allowing us to go ahead. They chased us till Panagarh (150km northwest of Kolkata), and in the process, there were multiple collisions between our cars. We tried to avoid them, fearing they were robbers,"" said driver Sharma.According to Mondal, the white car's occupants appeared drunk and abandoned their vehicle at the scene before fleeing. ""We crawled out of the car, but madam was bleeding and unresponsive. The youths in the white car stood there for a while but fled, leaving their vehicle behind,"" he said, claiming they had initially caught two of the men but had to release them to tend to Chatterjee.Sutandra was the sole breadwinner of her family after her father - singer Sukanta Chatterjee - died from cancer. She took care of her ailing mother and two grandmothers while managing her newly launched event management company Moonwalk, based in Gaya.Her grieving mother Tanushree rejected the police version of events and demanded immediate arrests.""I lost my husband eight months ago, and now my only child.

Quantum Mechanics and the Dance of Shiva



CERN’s Shiva: A Cosmic Reminder



The Western mind has always struggled with quantum physics, much like it has with paganism, never quite able to decipher how a particle can also be a wave or vice versa. This difficulty is, at its core, a language problem—perhaps even a side effect of Abrahamic thought—which may explain why its brightest minds, such as Oppenheimer, are often drawn to Vedanta. This dichotomy is evident in reactions to the statue of Lord Shiva at CERN, the world’s most advanced particle physics laboratory and home to the Large Hadron Collider. The statue, depicting Lord Shiva performing the cosmic dance, often confounds visitors, with more narrow-minded ones demanding its removal for being ""anti-science."" Nothing could be further from the truth, as the dancing form symbolises both creation and destruction—the cosmic dance that dictates the flow of the universe .As Fritjof Capra , the Western pioneer in finding parallels between Eastern mysticism and modern physics, wrote inpreface:“As I sat on that beach, my former experiences came to life; I saw cascades of energy coming down from outer space, in which particles were created and destroyed in rhythmic pulses; I saw the atoms of the elements and those of my body participating in this cosmic dance of energy; I felt its rhythm and I heard its sound, and at that moment, I knew that this was the Dance of Shiva, the Lord of Dancers worshipped by the Hindus.”It is no surprise, then, that the statue—gifted by the Indian government and unveiled on 18 June 2004—bears a quote from Capra, explaining: “Hundreds of years ago, Indian artists created visual images of dancing Shivas in a beautiful series of bronzes. In our time, physicists have used the most advanced technology to portray the patterns of the cosmic dance. The metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient mythology, religious art, and modern physics.”The statue captures Shiva performing the Tandava , a dance believed to be the source of the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction. The dance exists in five forms, representing the cosmic cycle from creation to dissolution:The significance of the Tandava extends beyond mythology, resonating deeply with artistic and scientific thought alike. The dance embodies the perpetual motion of the cosmos, where matter is never static but constantly shifting between states, much like the subatomic world described by quantum mechanics . In this eternal rhythm, destruction is not an end but a necessary transition for renewal, mirroring the natural laws governing energy and matter.One of the most remarkable encounters with the Nataraja took place in early 20th-century Chennai (then Madras), where an elderly European gentleman stood mesmerised before a 12th-century bronze in the city’s state museum. As he gazed at the sculpture, he entered a trance-like state and began to mimic Shiva’s dance, his arms and legs moving in rhythm with the cosmic energy captured in bronze. The sight baffled museum guards and patrons, who gathered to watch the unusual spectacle. Concerned by the disturbance, the curator arrived, prepared to have the foreigner removed—until he realised the man was none other than Auguste Rodin , one of the most celebrated sculptors of all time. Overcome with emotion, Rodin later described the Nataraja as “one of the greatest works of art ever created by the human mind.”Rodin’s awe stemmed from the sculpture’s ability to capture both movement and stillness simultaneously—Shiva’s limbs flail outward in a centrifugal explosion of energy, yet his face remains serene, embodying a paradox at the heart of existence. It is this fusion of dynamism and poise, chaos and order, that makes the Nataraja not just a religious icon but a profound metaphor for the dance of the universe itself.As V. S. Ramachandran wrote in“You don’t have to be religious or Indian or Rodin to appreciate the grandeur of this bronze. At a very literal level, it depicts the cosmic dance of Shiva, who creates, sustains, and destroys the Universe. But the sculpture is much more than that; it is a metaphor of the dance of the universe itself, of the movement and energy of the cosmos. The artist depicts this sensation through the skilful use of many devices. For example, the centrifugal motion of Shiva’s arms and legs flailing in different directions and the wavy tresses flying off his head symbolise the agitation and frenzy of the cosmos. Yet, amid this turbulence—this fitful fever of life—Shiva remains serenely composed, gazing at his own creation with supreme tranquillity and poise.”The juxtaposition is no accident. The Shiva statue at CERN is more than a cultural artefact. It stands as a silent acknowledgment of something physics encounters at its very limits—the inescapable reality of paradox. The universe does not conform to the neat categories that science prefers. Matter and energy behave in unpredictable ways at the subatomic level.Time itself falters at T = 0, the precise moment of the Big Bang, as does the question of the primordial soup.The prevailing theory suggests that self-replicating, complex amino acid-based compounds somehow emerged from the primordial soup of water and chemicals, possibly triggered by a fortuitous lightning strike. However, much like the Big Bang theory can describe events for T > 0 but cannot explain what happened at T = 0, the origin of life at T = 0 remains beyond the reach of current scientific understanding. In this sense, T = 0 is the proverbial fly in the primordial soup.Even if we set aside sentience—the point at which even a microbe could make a choice between two degrees of freedom—how did cells organise themselves into life forms?CERN, in its quest to decode the universe, is confronting a problem that isn’t just scientific—it is existential. And so, right outside its most ambitious experiment, stands Shiva, the cosmic dancer, as if to remind scientists that the universe is not built on rigid equations alone, but on movement, rhythm, and uncertainty.The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is designed to recreate conditions as close as possible to the Big Bang—but it cannot go all the way back. Scientists can model events occurring after T > 0, the moment when the universe began expanding. But T = 0—the singularity itself—remains elusive.The challenge is fundamental. General relativity, which governs large-scale physics, and quantum mechanics, which governs the smallest scales, do not align at this point. The mathematics collapses into infinity. The equations break down. Physics, as we know it, ceases to function.It is an unsettling realisation: even at the height of human knowledge, we cannot explain our own beginning. The deeper we probe, the more the answer slips through our grasp. The moment before the universe—the event that created time itself—remains beyond our grasp. This is where Shiva’s cosmic dance becomes more than a metaphor.Shiva’s Tandava, his eternal dance, represents the fundamental forces that drive the universe—creation, preservation, and destruction—all happening simultaneously. It is a cosmic process, one that echoes not only the grand scale of the universe but also the strange, counterintuitive world of quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, nothing is static. An electron is not a fixed entity but a probability wave. A vacuum is not empty but a seething sea of virtual particles flashing in and out of existence. At its most fundamental level, the universe is not a place—it is a process.This is where Professor V. Balakrishnan, a distinguished physicist from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, adds another layer to the discussion. A renowned expert in theoretical physics and chaos theory, he explains the failure of classical language to describe the quantum world:“These terms are meaningless when explained in classical language. The failure isn’t on the part of the quantum mechanical particle, but on the part of our language itself.”The Shiva statue at CERN stands as a reminder that the universe is not static—it is a dance. A dance of forces, particles, and energy. A dance where creation and destruction are not opposites but part of the same process. Science may yet find the answer to T = 0. It may unlock the final secrets of the universe. But even then, one truth will remain: The dance will go on.","The Dance of Shiva unifies ancient mythology, religious art, and modern physics. The dance embodies the perpetual motion of the cosmos, where matter is never static but constantly shifting between states.

NEW DELHI: Former Tihar PRO Sunil Kumar Gupta made an explosive claim that air hostesses of Sahara Airlines used to come to Subrata Roy in jail and remain with him for hours. This was one of the many facilities provided to the late founder of Sahara Group when he was in jail. In an interview with ANI, Gupta claimed that Arvind Kejriwal, then-chief minister of Delhi, was aware of all that but did not take any action.Recounting his experience with Subrata Roy when Roy was an inmate, Gupta said he was first kept in a regular jail. But he needed a facility with video conferencing so that he could negotiate with the buyers of his hotels following which he could pay the lenders back.

But I saw that a lot of illegal things were happening...Before this, the Delhi High Court had called me and it said that there are several complaints of bribery and extortion at the jail,"" Gupta said.Gupta said he raised the issues at meetings chaired by DG Prisons but the DG thought Gupta was complaining against him.

NEW DELHI: Government has set a target to construct 10,000 km of national highways (NHs) in 2025-26, as per the budget document, which is the lowest in the past seven years since 2018-19. However, continuing with the sharper focus on building wider and greenfield highways and expressways, the road transport and highways ministry has set a target for all high speed corridors to touch 5,800 km in the next one year.The ministry uploaded the detailed budget document on Monday.The details of highway construction since 2018-19 shows that the lowest was at 10,237 km in 2019-20 and the highest was 13,327 km in 2020-21 despite the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. During the last financial year, the overall NH construction stood at 12,349 km. Officials said that by March this year, the ministry is hopeful of achieving around 10,500 km.By mid-February, all agencies constructed around 8,000 km of NHs. Sources said though the target for FY26 may be revised at a later stage, the pace will remain less since now there are less number of highway projects that are under implementation. Slow pace of award of new projects in 2023-24 and the current financial year will impact the construction in the next two financial years.As per the detailed budget document, the ministry has set the target to raise around Rs 30,000 crore from monetisation of completed highway projects and getting around Rs 35,000 crore private investment.The govt has also earmarked Rs 128 crore for the implementation of cashless treatment to road crash victims across all states and UTs. At present, the scheme has been rolled out in Assam, Chandigarh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Puducherry.

Congress's Kerala conundrum: Shashi Tharoor rubs it in with 'selfie message',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congresss-kerala-conundrum-shashi-tharoor-rubs-it-in-with-selfie-message/articleshow/118563023.cms,"Shashi Tharoor posts selfie with Piyush Goyal and Jonathan Reynolds

NEW DELHI: Is Shashi Tharoor on his way out of the Congress or is he just flexing his muscles for a greater role in Kerala Congress keeping in mind the assembly elections in the state next year? Well, any answers to this at present would only be a guess. But what we know for sure is that the Thiruvananthapuram MP will not give in without a fight - either way.Tharoor, who is already in the middle of a political storm triggered by his ""perceived praise"" for rivals, seems undeterred by the criticism within the party. Ever since the controversy erupted, Tharoor has not just defended his remarks but has also reinforced his viewpoint.Also read: Congress's mouthpiece attacks MP Shashi Tharoor for his remarks on PM Modi On Tuesday, the senior Congress leader posted a selfie with Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and the UK's secretary of state for business and trade Jonathan Reynolds and welcomed the revival of long-stalled India-UK FTA negotiations.""Good to exchange words with Jonathan Reynolds, Britain's Secretary of State for Business and Trade, in the company of his Indian counterpart, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal,"" he said of their meeting at an event on Monday. ""The long-stalled FTA (Free Trade Agreement) negotiations have been revived, which is most welcome,"" Tharoor said on X.While on the face of it there is nothing wrong in Tharoor posting a selfie with a BJP Union minister or for that matter praising the revival of India-UK talks, more so as he chairs the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs. But the fact that this comes from someone who is already under party fire for praising the positives of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US trip and highlighting the progress of start-up sector in Kerala ruled by the LDF government, shows that the Congress leader is in no mood to buckle.Also read: Row over praise for rivals: Should Congress be wary of Shashi Tharoor? The Congress MP, who had earlier defended his remarks and said that when something good emerges, it is petty not to acknowledge it, has used his posts on X to convey a message to his critics within the party.On February 24, Tharoor had tagged a news report titled ""Left, BJP and Congress share stage during Kerala's investors' meet"" and posted ""Good to see this. Economic development should, as far as possible, be above the petty divisions of party politics.""On February 22, Tharoor had a cryptic message for his baiters when he posted a Thomas Gray quote as thought for the day on his timeline - ""Where ignorance is bliss, 'Tis folly to be wise."" The message here was loud and clear.On February 16, Tharoor had posted a long note countering the critics who were targeting him for praising the Left Front government in Kerala. Stating that he was bemused by the raging controversy in Kerala over his article, Tharoor said the article did not mention party politics, but spoke of things Kerala needs to do to get out of the economic doldrums — changes that he has been demanding in the state during all his 16 years in politics.Tharoor is known to fight his battles against all odds. His contest for the post of Congress president against Mallikarjun Kharge is a case in point. The BJP claims the Gandhis have sidelined him within the Congress for taking on ""their nominee"" in the 2022 party elections. Tharoor, on his part, has been vocal about the changes that the party needs to revive from its political slump and cites his four consecutive Lok Sabha wins to prove his point.The Congress, on the other hand, will need to do a tightrope walk as it tries to find a solution to this conundrum. The party, which has already lost several leaders in the last 10 years, would not want to lose another one and give the BJP a handle to attack its leadership. But it can also not give in completely to Tharoor's demands and antagonize the state leadership. With assembly elections due in Kerala next year, the Congress will need to handle the Tharoor challenge deftly.","Shashi Tharoor is in the middle of a political storm triggered by his ""perceived praise"" for rivals.

Annamalai wrote.When Stalin was asked if the March 5 meeting would discuss the three-language policy in light of the National Education Policy, Stalin said that to raise a voice in Parliament on these issues, adequate number of MPs was required. ""Because, in the name of delimitation, a sword is hanging over southern states,"" he said.""Tamil Nadu succeeded in population control through the family planning programme. Just because population is less, there is a situation of the Lok Sabha seats being cut down (in TN). We stand to lose 8 seats and as a result, we would be having only 31 MPs, and not the 39 (present number),"" he added.""Our representation (in Parliament) will reduce, Tamil Nadu's voice is being stifled.

Three out of five in India succumb to cancer after diagnosis: ICMR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-out-of-five-in-india-succumb-to-cancer-after-diagnosis-icmr/articleshow/118567092.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly three out of five people in India succumb following cancer diagnosis, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has claimed. The apex health research agency's claim is based on an analysis of the estimates of incidence and mortality of cancer from GLOBOCAN 2022 - an online database that provides cancer statistics for 185 countries.India is one of the largest contributors to global cancer burden, ranking third in terms of new incidences. China ranks one in cancer incidence followed by the US.According to the ICMR study, published in the journal 'The Lancet Regional - Southeast Asia', the incident to mortality percentage in India stands at approximately 65, which means that three out of five individuals would be expected to die if diagnosed with cancer. The incident to mortality percentages in China and the US stand at 50 and 23 respectively, according to the study.Children (0-14) and reproductive-age (15-49) individuals, ICMR says, have a 0.1%-2.3% chance of developing cancer and a 0.08%-1.3% chance of dying from it. However, the study adds, middle-aged and geriatric individuals have a higher 8.3%-10.3% chance of developing cancer with a 5.5%-7.6% chance of dying from the disease.Women bear a ""disproportionate burden"" with higher crude incidence (104.5 per 1,00,000 population) and crude mortality rate (64.2 per 1,00,000) compared to men (91.5 per 1,00,000 and 62.2 per 1,00,000), according to the study, which also says that trend analysis for past mortality patterns indicate cancer mortality rates in India are on the rise for last two decades.Future projections show that cancer incidence and mortality will continue to rise in the coming years, with mortality rates expected to increase from 64.7 to 109.6 between 2022 and 2050, it says.ICMR warns India is poised to face formidable challenge in cancer control in coming years due to the transition of the current reproductive-age population (15-49 years) to middle-aged (50-69) and geriatric (70+) groups. It has called for proactive measures to enhance early detection, access to quality care, and public health initiatives.Chairperson of Max Institute of Cancer Care, Dr Harit Chaturvedi, said fight against cancer must be multi-pronged. ""We need to create awareness on avoiding unhealthy eating and sedentary lifestyles that are linked to development of several non-communicable diseases, including cancers,"" he said. He added that diagnostic facilities and treatment for cancer need to be made accessible and affordable for early detection and improved outcome.Realising the challenge posed by the rising incidence and mortality caused by the disease, govt in the Union budget 2025-26 said it is planning to have daycare cancer centres in all 759 districts of the country where chemotherapy, essential medication and biopsy services will be made available. Top health ministry officials said these centres will also be utilised for screening high-risk individuals for common cancers.","India is one of the largest contributors to global cancer burden, ranking third in terms of new incidences.

NEW DELHI: The Sino-Indian ties are set for a reboot, following the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last year and the subsequent visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri that resulted in a series of “common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation”, said Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong Tuesday.The remarks followed the recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Wang Yi in which the former had lauded cooperation between the 2 countries on multilateral forums, particularly the G20. Doval had visited China in December for talks between the Special Representatives that took place after a gap of 5 years. This was followed by Misri’s visit to China during which India and China agreed to resume Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , trans-border river cooperation and, in principle, direct air services.“Since the meeting between President Xi Jinping and PM Modi in Kazan last year, the 2 sides have earnestly implemented the important consensus reached by the two leaders, engaged in active interactions at various levels, and reached many common understandings on improving bilateral relations,’’ said Xu, interacting with journalists on the margins the 3rd China-India Youth Dialogue. Calling India-China relationship one of the most important in the world, the ambassador said that the 2 countries are promoting positive changes in the international balance of power.For the first time in 5 years, Modi and Xi had met in Russia in October 2024 on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, days after the 2 countries reached an agreement to complete the military disengagement process in eastern Ladakh. India, however, wants to tread cautiously in normalising ties with China and, in his meeting with Wang last week, Jaishankar stressed the importance of restoring mutual trust in bilateral ties and jointly maintaining border peace.Calling for respecting each other’s core interests, Xu said that Xi and Modi had agreed to handle relations from a long-term perspective, prevent “specific disagreements” from affecting the overall relationship, enhance strategic mutual trust and ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas.China will host the SCO summit later this year and expects Modi to participate. Appreciating India’s contribution to the Eurasian bloc, Xu said China is willing to work with India to host a “friendly, united and fruitful” summit. China holds the rotating presidency of SCO this year.According to the ambassador, the recent high-level engagements had created an important opportunity for the “reboot of China-India relations and provided a broader platform for exchanges and cooperation between the youth of our 2 countries”.","The Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last year and the subsequent visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri resulted in a series of “common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation’, said Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong Tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118567866,imgsize-1050506,width-400,resizemode-4/118567866.jpg"

He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector. I feel very happy seeing that today the space sector has become a favourite of the youth. For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit.

NEW DELHI: After the breakthrough in developing a hyperloop test track (422m) by IIT Madras with support from Indian Railways , the government is now planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport, said minister Ashwini Vaishnaw . It may be the longest hyperloop track in the world.""The first tube will go a long way in developing technologies. The time has come when after the first two grants of $1million each (nearly ₹9cr), the third grant of $1million will be given to IIT Madras for further developing the hyperloop project in a nice way. And once we see the commercial or rather pre-commercial where the product is ready, then within the railway set-up we will start the first commercial project. We will decide a site, which can be used for good commercial transportation of 40km-50km and then we will go for it,"" Vaishnaw said while addressing the closing ceremony of Asia's first Global Hyperloop Competition by IIT Madras.Sources said the test track for commercial operation will help railways assess viability of the technology. The hyperloop track can allow speeds of up to 1,200kmph. The successful development of the first test track, which was completed in Dec last year, will be the base for future development.Hyperloop systems are expected to dramatically reduce travel times between cities, offering an alternative to traditional rail and air travel. The hyperloop concept envisions high-speed, low-pressure pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,200 kmph.The hyperloop system was first conceptualised by Swiss professor Marcel Juffer in the 1970s. In 1992, Swissmetro SA was set up to develop this project, but it went into liquidation in 2009. At present, there are eight promising hyperloop projects in the world, including Virgin Hyperloop which has been actively testing its systems in Nevada. Canadian firm TransPod is also constructing a test track to validate their design.In an official statement, the railway ministry said IIT-Madras and railways will also work together on vertical take-off landing vehicles.","The government is planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport.

NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: A batch of 12 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US to Panama arrived Sunday in Delhi via Istanbul on a Turkish Airlines flight, making them the first group to be sent back without restraints since three American military aircraft brought 332 deportees to Amritsar within a fortnight this month.The 12 deportees are said to be among 50 undocumented Indian nationals who reportedly arrived in Panama recently. Panama has been assisting the US in its deportation efforts.According to local media reports, the UN-affiliated International Organisation for Migration helped purchase plane tickets for people of various nationalities whose citizenship was confirmed, 17 of them Indians. More deportees from the group are expected next week once MEA verifies their nationality.Deportation from Panama is being carried out under the Regional Assisted Voluntary Return Programme , an IOM protection and support response to facilitate the dignified, safe, regular and orderly return, as well as voluntary and based on an informed decision, of migrants to their countries of origin.Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.Airport authorities in the city were informed in advance about the arrival of Patiala resident Jatinder Singh, Maninder Dutt of Jalandhar, and Jugraj Singh and Harpreet Singh from Gurdaspur, but it wasn't immediately clear whether they came unescorted all the way from Panama.Official sources said after the mandatory debriefing that Jatinder, 34, paid a travel agent from Patiala Rs 52 lakh to help him enter the US through a route criss-crossing Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.Maninder, 21, put his faith and Rs 42 lakh in the hands of a Delhi-based illegal immigration agent, who then sent him on a perilous journey through Spain, Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Jugraj and Harpreet, both 30, paid Rs 38 lakh each to an agent from Batala and reached the US via Nicaragua.Punjab NRI minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said the state govt had registered cases against 15 travel agents based on complaints from natives of the state who were deported from the US this month. Of these, three agents have been arrested, while police have been raiding offices and homes in search of the absconding 12.Sources said the deportees who arrived on Sunday told authorities they intended to file cases against the travel agents who duped them only if there was a chance of getting their money back.The first US military flight that arrived on Feb 5 brought 104 deportees, with both men and women handcuffed and their feet shackled. The second flight, carrying 119 deportees, arrived on Feb 15. The third flight, with 112 deportees, landed on Feb 16, this time with only the men in shackles.",Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.

Until Monday, the rescue teams could not reach the last point and were stuck 40 meters away.Hoping against hope, the teams utilised thermocol boats to navigate the challenging terrain to bring out at least some of the workers alive but the chances of them coming out of the tunnel looked dim.If not, the teams will at least try to salvage the workers' bodies and bring them out of the tunnel, officials at the site said. As of now, the teams are still facing obstacles, with heavy water and slush hampering the rescue efforts.The eight workers, who are believed to be trapped in the last 50 meters in front of the tunnel boring machine (TBM), remained unaccounted for since the collapse of the tunnel roof on Feb 22.The project contracting agency, Jaiprakash Associates Ltd , initiated dewatering operations to clear the water from the site in the hope of finding the survivors. Officials remain cautiously optimistic that some of the workers might still be alive, though they acknowledge that they are racing against time.Telangana irrigation minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy, who was at the site, instructed the NDRF, Navy, and other agencies to work in coordination and clear the final stretch of the tunnel.

Shashi Tharoor staking claim in Kerala Congress as 'new pole',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoor-staking-claim-in-kerala-congress-as-new-pole/articleshow/118566379.cms,"NEW DELHI: When the Left bloc stunned Congress by bucking Kerala's ""revolving door"" politics to return to office in the state in 2021, Congress overhauled the state unit with factionally unaffiliated faces, and announced it was designed to end the notoriously entrenched factionalism in the party. Four years later, senior MP Shashi Tharoor staking claim to leadership ahead of assembly elections in 2026 has scrambled the thinly-veiled factional peace, with him as a new pole in the state Congress.Tharoor has adopted an unconventional style. Just like his praise for the growth of start-ups under the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala, on Tuesday, he posted a photo with Union minister Piyush Goyal and the UK trade minister to laud the revival of FTA talks -- triggering a buzz on social media.While Congress criticised Tharoor's praise of the Left govt, the MP's remarks questioning the party's strength in Kerala have thrown out in the open concerns which are privately shared by a large section of Congress. Party leaders are unsure if Congress can oust the LDF this time too. The concerns are based on the threat of fragmentation in the Congress support base, because of BJP's strong pursuit of the Christian community, as well as the fear of loss of some Hindu votes, which has made its dependence on key Muslim ally IUML stronger.The Left too is making a similar push for a slice of Congress votes. Congress seems to be banking on the anti-incumbency against the Left. Tharoor has put out in the open a widespread worry in the party. In the process, he has portrayed himself as the solution because of what he terms as his ability to reach out to non-Congress voters, and thereby, expand the party tent.Having won four successive terms from a difficult Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat , Tharoor is a popular leader, but is also a loner in the state unit, viewed by peers as an interloper. He has thrown his hat in the leadership ring of Kerala but Congress sources say it would not be possible for the party to accommodate his claim ahead of other local leaders. Many believe Tharoor may have taken a maximalist position and could be vying for a greater role in Kerala affairs but not necessarily to be declared the outright face. Given the precarious situation that Congress is in, it would be difficult for the party to not accommodate Tharoor in a meaningful way.His fresh remarks have triggered speculation about his future while party leaders have said Tharoor will not leave Congress. But even his disengaging himself from active party affairs ahead of assembly elections would not help the Congress cause. It is to be seen if Congress can find a way to accommodate the restive leader, a tricky task in which the party has failed in many states in the recent years.","Senior MP Shashi Tharoor staking claim to leadership ahead of assembly elections in 2026.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday reversed Bihar Legislative Council's July 26, 2024 decision to expel RJD leader Sunil Kumar Singh from the House for mocking and mimicking chief minister Nitish Kumar, and said the punishment was ""excessive and disproportionate"" to the nature of his misconduct.While a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotishwar Singh came down heavily on Singh for his conduct on the floor of the House and before the ethics committee, it said it would be just and proper punishment to convert the more than 18-month period of expulsion as the period of suspension from the House for the RJD leader.Also, while asking the House to take him back, the bench said he would not be entitled to any remuneration or other monetary benefits for the period of his suspension.SC had earlier stayed the by-election for the seat that had fallen vacant after Singh's expulsion.In a verdict which sought to strike a balance between the principle that punishment should not be disproportionate to the offence and the need for decorum and proper conduct in legislatures, the bench said,""There is no place for aggression and indecency in the proceedings of Parliament or legislature.Members are expected to show complete respect and deference towards each other.""The bench said, ""This expectation is not merely a matter of tradition or formality, it is essential for the effective functioning of democratic processes.

""Courts must act decisively to strike down excessively harsh actions that threaten our democratic fabric while simultaneously exercising restraint to avoid encroaching upon the legislative domain. We reiterate that courts must reflect a certain degree of deference to the legislative will and wisdom, intervening only when the action prescribed is so disproportionate that it shocks the intrinsic sense of justice,"" Justice Kant said.Writing the 50-page judgment analysing the sensitive issue of legislative supremacy with regard to proceedings in the House and limited scope of judicial intervention, Justice Kant said, ""It is imperative that such legislative action remains mindful of the fundamental principle that the purpose of imposing punishment is not to serve as a tool for retribution but rather to uphold and enforce discipline within the House.""The primary objective of the punishment should be to maintain decorum and foster an environment of constructive debate and deliberation, the SC said.",Supreme Court reverses Bihar Legislative Council's decision to expel RJD leader Sunil Kumar Singh from the House.

Supreme Court: No minimum age for witness; kid’s evidence valid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-no-minimum-age-for-witness-kids-evidence-valid/articleshow/118568104.cms,"Child witness on same footing as others, but must be reliable: SC

NEW DELHI: Holding that the evidence of a child witness stands on the same footing as any other witness if the child is competent to testify, Supreme Court has convicted and sentenced a man to life imprisonment for killing his wife by relying upon the statement of the couple's seven-year-old daughter who witnessed the incident.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra set aside the order of Madhya Pradesh high court acquitting the accused by discarding the statement of his daughter who was present in the house when her mother was killed.The top court said the Evidence Act does not prescribe any minimum age for a witness, and evidence of a child witness cannot be rejected outright.""The only precaution which the court should take while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that such witness must be a reliable one due to the susceptibility of children by their falling prey to tutoring ,"" the bench said.However, this in no manner means that the evidence of a child must be rejected outrightly at the slightest of discrepancy, rather what is required is that the same is evaluated with great circumspection,"" the bench said.It added, ""While appreciating the testimony of a child witness, courts are required to assess whether the evidence of such witness is its voluntary expression and not borne out of the influence of others and whether the testimony inspires confidence.""Terming child witnesses as dangerous because they are prone to being influenced, the apex court said trial courts should be alert about this aspect while recording the statement.It said there is no rule requiring corroboration to the testimony of a child witness before any reliance is placed on it and the insistence of corroboration is only a measure of caution and prudence that the courts may exercise if deemed necessary in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case.""Child witnesses are considered as dangerous witnesses as they are pliable and liable to be influenced easily, shaped and moulded and as such the courts must rule out the possibility of tutoring. If the courts, after careful scrutiny, find that there is neither any tutoring nor any attempt to use the child witness for ulterior purposes by the prosecution, then the courts must rely on the confidence-inspiring testimony of such a witness in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the absence of any allegations by the accused in this regard, an inference as to whether the child has been tutored or not, can be drawn from the contents of his deposition,"" it said.","A man was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his wife by relying upon the statement of the couple's seven-year-old daughter who witnessed the incident.

For a full year, faculty will trade lectures for deadlines, syllabi for budgets, and the structured rhythms of academia for the relentless pace of the private sector. This AICTE industry internship isn't just a handshake between academia and industry; it's an immersion, designed to sharpen understanding and strengthen collaboration.Professors will navigate the same pressures as the engineers they teach-long hours, tight budgets, and unyielding expectations. To support this transition, over and above their salary, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) will offer them an honorarium of Rs 75,000 a month while the companies hosting them will provide a monthly stipend of Rs 25,000.""This is an ambitious endeavour, a deliberate break from tradition, and it has full backing of AICTE's executive committee.

Punjab is the biggest contributor to the central pool of wheat managed by Food Corporation of India (FCI), followed by Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. In the last rabi season, 128 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured from Punjab, which was around 47% of the total purchase for the central pool.Govt distributes free wheat from this stock under PDS to beneficiaries under the PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna.

He said Tamil Nadu might lose eight Lok Sabha seats if the delimitation process was solely population-based.Emerging from a cabinet meeting at the state secretariat, the CM launched one more battle against the Centre, this one against delimitation, saying TN has been forced into ""yet another struggle"" to secure its rights. ""Delimitation is a sword dangling over southern states. Tamil Nadu, which is the leading state in all development indicators, will be severely affected. There is a danger of reduction of existing 39 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state,"" Stalin said. State govt will formally invite all 40 political parties registered with the Election Commission of India to the all-party meeting.Stalin later said on X that a democratic process should not penalise states that successfully managed population growth, led in development, and made significant contributions to national progress. ""We need a fair, transparent, and equitable approach that upholds true federalism,"" Stalin said. The Union govt proposed to undertake a delimitation exercise based on population figures in 2026. The decline in population would lead to reduced Lok Sabha representation for the state, while states with larger populations would get more representation.Stalin stressed the importance of the issue beyond just the number of Lok Sabha members, emphasising its connection to states' rights. He called for a united front from all political parties to address this concern, urging their participation in the upcoming meeting. It was not just on the Union govt's trilingual policy, but more parliamentary representation could help the state address issues like NEET and funding from the Centre, Stalin said.When questioned about the Centre's response to TN's concerns on various issues, the CM said, ""There is no reply. They are just silent."" On a query whether the Union govt's actions were instigating a language war, Stalin responded, ""Certainly."" He said the DMK govt was ready to engage in such a war.In a post on X, BJP state president K Annamalai said Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself clearly stated that delimitation would be favourable to all, including southern states, as and when it happens.

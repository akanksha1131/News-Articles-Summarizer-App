Maharashtra polls: Mixed results for netas and betas as families try to keep legacies alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-polls-mixed-results-for-netas-and-betas-as-families-try-to-keep-legacies-alive/articleshow/115617263.cms,"MUMBAI: Though NCP's Nawab Malik , a veteran of many elections, lost from the Mankhurd-Shivaji Nagar assembly constituency against incumbent SP MLA Abu Asim Azmi , he got a face-saver in daughter Sana's victory from Anushakti Nagar, a seat he represented in 2019 and 2009. Sana won with a margin of 3,378 votes against NCP (SP) nominee Fahad Ahmad, actor Swara Bhaskar's husband. Bhaskar and Ahmad blamed the EVM for his loss. Sana's margin of victory was slender also because the MNS candidate, Acharya Vidyadhar, received 28,362 votes.Mixed emotions marked the mood at the Naik household, too, with former minister and six-time MLA Ganesh Naik of BJP securing victory from Airoli, while his son Sandeep, who was BJP's Navi Mumbai chief but defected to NCP(SP) after being denied a party ticket, losing Belapur seat to BJP's incumbent MLA Manda Mhatre by 377 votes.","Nawab Malik, a veteran of many elections, lost from the Mankhurd-Shivaji Nagar assembly constituency.

Rahul's Adani-centric poll campaign fails to move voters in Maharashtra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahuls-adani-centric-poll-campaign-fails-to-move-voters-in-maharashtra/articleshow/115617230.cms,"Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: In the run-up to Maharashtra elections , Gautam Adani 's link to the BJP-led coalition at the Centre and in the state was a key theme, whether it was the award of Dharavi redevelopment project or Rahul Gandhi 's jibe at BJP's 'ek hain to safe hain' slogan by dragging the businessman into the picture.Be it Uddhav Thackeray's reference to 'Adani ki sultani' or the Gandhi scion and his sister Priyanka's claims that BJP toppled the Maha Vikas Aghadi govt to favour the ports-to-power conglomerate, Adani was in focus for the alliance. Sharad Pawar was the only one who had sought to soften the attack on Adani.The MVA's allegations, however, do not seem to have clicked with voters. While the US department of justice's indictment of Adani and his nephew Sagar in a bribery case is expected to give BJP's rivals ammunition in the winter session of Parliament, the poll outcome has taken the sting out of the opposition's campaign.Although Dharavi redevelopment was originally conceived by the BJP-Shiv Sena govt, it was the Devendra Fadnavis-led coalition that got the project moving in 2016. CM Eknath Shinde has said the project was awarded to Adani by the MVA govt. While Congress's Jyoti Gaikwad trounced her Sena opponent in Dharavi, the haze over the project is expected to lift as Thackeray had vowed to cancel the contract.Rahul's attack is a critical component of his now familiar toolkit, where he seeks to link businesses such as those run by the Adanis and Ambanis with BJP, despite the pitch failing to get traction with a majority of voters for over a decade. In 2019, his attempts to portray Anil Ambani as the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale deal had similarly failed to impress voters. Yet, he and his allies have refused to give up on it.Unlike Anil Ambani, who is now left with a fraction of what he had inherited, Adani has seen his empire expand. It is unlikely that even INDIA govts across states, which have actively courted Adani to attract investment, are going to change their strategy, although Rahul may pull out the pamphlets again.","Gautam Adani's link to the BJP-led coalition at the Centre and in the state was a key theme, whether it was the award of Dharavi redevelopment project or Rahul Gandhi's jibe at BJP's 'ek hain to safe hain' slogan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115617258,imgsize-657172,width-400,resizemode-4/115617258.jpg"

The people's mandate only reinforced that his Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar 's NCP were the real inheritors of the respective party ideologies, he said.""I will not go into (claims of) true or false. The people have shown that Shiv Sena, in alliance with BJP, is carrying forward Balasaheb Thackeray's ideology and it is the same for NCP,"" he said.On who would be the CM, the allies were at pains to point out that there was no dispute over the post. ""All three parties will sit together (and decide who will be CM)... We shall sit with our seniors and discuss,"" he said. Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis said the leaders of the three parties would hold a discussion, adding that BJP's parliamentary board authorised the party president to hold these discussions with Shinde and Ajit Pawar.Addressing a joint press conference with Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, Shinde said, ""We emphasised on development. Not a single decision that we took was kept on paper, every scheme was implemented. Congress gave assurances and then started asking money from the Centre. We did not extend our feet beyond the mattress. Whatever we have done is before the people,"" he said.Acknowledging PM Modi's role in scripting Mahayuti's win, Shinde said the state govt got huge support from the Centre. ""During Manmohan Singh's tenure as PM, we got Rs 2 lakh crore while PM Modi has given us Rs 10 lakh crore,"" he said. Pawar said the Ladki Bahin scheme became a gamechanger. ""Our scheme was ridiculed but when their manifesto came, it became clear the scheme works. We have to now bring in financial discipline but all of us have experience in govt and we shall do it.""CM said govt ensured the beneficiaries of Ladki Bahin got the first instalments in their accounts. He said the Mahayuti govt took unprecedented decisions, removed speed breakers, and completed the Metro as well as the Metro car shed. ""They (MVA) paused work for 2.5 years... It is clear people do not want a Facebook govt. People have not forgotten that the 2019 govt, which should have been formed, was not allowed.""On Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut's demand to bring back ballot paper, Shinde said, ""When the decisions favour them, then it is alright, but when it goes against them, they question the machinery, EC and even SC.""Fadnavis attributed the victory to the PM's slogan 'ek hain toh safe hain'.","Shinde: Shiv Sena, in alliance with BJP, is carrying forward Balasaheb Thackeray's ideology and it is the same for NCP.

MUMBAI: Six months is a long time in politics. The ruling Mahayuti had suffered a major setback in the state in the Lok Sabha elections. But it has made a crushing comeback in the assembly elections, winning 230 of the state's 288 assembly seats - at 80%, that's more than a three-fourths majority. MVA, which led in 153 assembly segments in the LS polls, has been reduced to an abysmal 46 seats in the state.The Ladki Bahin Yojana, its cash transfer scheme for women, is being widely credited as a gamechanger. Consolidation of the OBC vote and pro-Hindutva vote have acted as a force multiplier.For the Mahayuti alliance of BJP , CM Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP , this is a remarkable turnaround. BJP, apart from scoring a hat-trick of assembly poll victories - crossing 100 seats each time - has won its biggest mandate ever in the state with its 132 eclipsing its 2014 tally of 122. The victory, under deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis , heralds his return as a strong contender for the top post.It is also Congress's worst-ever showing in its one-time bastion of Maharashtra (which sends the largest number of MPs to Lok Sabha after UP). The party had been reduced to 42 assembly seats during the 2014 Modi wave. Now it has managed to win less than half that tally, with just 16 seats.Equally significant is that the verdict has legitimised Eknath Shinde 's Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar 's NCP. They can now claim to be the real inheritors of the party leadership. Shiv Sena has won 57 seats compared to Shiv Sena (UBT)'s 20. And Ajit Pawar's NCP has won 41 seats compared to the NCP (Sharad Pawar's) 10 seats. Uddhav Thackeray , who was anointed party chief by his father Bal Thackeray, could well be staring at political oblivion, having lost control of the party's vote base to a non-Thackeray. For 84-year-old Sharad Pawar whose pragmatic political alignments have helped him play a long innings, this presents a existential crisis and perhaps the end of the road for the party as he had envisaged it.The Ladki Bahin scheme, among other sops, a good monsoon and counter-consolidation of OBCs in response to Maratha quota aggression during the LS polls were factors that held across regions to deliver a saffron sweep.Hindutva consolidation through slogans like Yogi Adityanath's 'Batenge Toh Katenge' tapped into concerns within the Hindu community that the Muslim vote had consolidated behind MVA.Within Mahayuti, BJP has achieved a strike rate of 88.5%, with wins in 132 of the 149 seats contested. This is all the more impressive given that it contested the largest number of seats among the six main parties. Shiv Sena's strike rate was 70.4% while NCP's was 69.4%. Within MVA, Shiv Sena has the highest strike rate of 21%, winning 20 of the 95 seats contested. Congress's strike rate is 15.8% while that of NCP (SP) is 11.6%.Observers also said Mahayuti setback in LS polls was largely a vote against incumbency, not the state leadership. ""There was an anti-Modi vote in LS polls and a united campaign by INDIA bloc. Concerns about the Constitution being changed if BJP had absolute majority was a huge issue,"" said an NCP member.In Vidarbha and Marathwada, where farmer anger over low prices for cotton and soyabean crop was expected to go against govt, Mahayuti emerged victorious. Opposition was unable to exploit the issue and Mahayuti countered it by offering up to 20% support to MSP to cover price variations if elected. It had also announced a free power scheme for farmers with agricultural pumps up to 7.5 HP in the run-up to polls.In Marathwada, Maratha quota agitation had scarred BJP in LS polls, leading to defeat of stalwarts like Raosaheb Danve and Pankaja Munde. But the impact of Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange waned in this election after he withdrew his initial plan to field candidates. Counter-consolidation of OBCs in response to Maratha agitation helped BJP.In north Maharashtra, Mahayuti had faced a major setback in LS polls owing to export restrictions on onion crop. Ahead of assembly polls, Centre slashed export duty on onions and removed the minimum export price.In western Maharashtra, where NCP factions were expected to clash, Ajit Pawar's party dominated. This is primarily because most of NCP's satraps who command a following in their constituencies regardless of party affiliations had joined Ajit Pawar. Their control over the rural network of cooperative sugar factories, banks and dairies helped them sail through.In Konkan and Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which is largely urban, Mahayuti's dominance in LS polls continued into the assembly elections. In Mumbai, once Shiv Sena's bastion, BJP dominated by winning 15 seats. Sena UBT managed a respectable 10 seats, a higher tally than Eknath Shinde's 6 seats. Sena UBT won the Mahim seat where Shiv Sena Bhavan is located.However, finally it was Mahayuti's recognition of the growing number of women voters that won it the greatest dividend. Gender ratio in women voters has risen from 929 in 2011 to 933 in 2024. Ladki Bahin Yojana, patterned on MP govt's Ladli Behna scheme, has been key to Mahayuti's win. It provides a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500 to underprivileged women between 21 and 65 with an annual family income below Rs 2.5 lakh. Mahayuti promised to raise it to Rs 2,100 if elected and claimed MVA would halt the scheme if it came to office.Over 2.4 crore women received the stipend in their bank accounts by voting day. Many had received stipends worth Rs 7,500 in three instalments. The instalments began rolling out in Aug, with the Nov stipend being delivered in Oct to beat the code of conduct.Besides, the state also announced 3 free gas cylinders for 52 lakh households and free higher education for girls from families with annual income of below Rs 8 lakh. It's evident the women-oriented schemes enthused women voters since there was a six percentage point surge in female voter turnout in the state - from 59.2% in the 2019 assembly polls to 65.2%.","Ruling Mahayuti had suffered a major setback in the state in the Lok Sabha elections. But it has made a crushing comeback in the assembly elections. The Ladki Bahin Yojana, its cash transfer scheme for women, is being credited as a gamechanger. Consolidation of the OBC vote and pro-Hindutva vote have acted as a force multiplier.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115613784,imgsize-1188635,width-400,resizemode-4/115613784.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Giving a boost to BJP and its allies in bypolls at 48 assembly seats across 15 states, NDA emerged the dominant force, securing 26 seats.Among the big wins was UP's Kundarki constituency, which BJP picked up after 31 years. The seat had remained an SP stronghold since 2012.Continuing its dominance in Assam, BJP-led NDA secured all five seats, while the lone seat of Gambegre in Meghalaya was won by its ally NPP. BJP won Samaguri - a Congress bastion since 2001- for the first time with party nominee Diplu Ranjan Sarmah defeating Dhubri MP Rakibul Hussain's son Tanzil Hussain.Congress was somewhat redeemed by news from Karnataka and Punjab. In Punjab, while AAP retained three out of four seats, Congress wrested Barnala from AAP.In Karnataka, Nikhil Kumaraswamy and Bharath Bommai, the third generation of Gowda and Bommai family respectively, lost, as the ruling Congress swept all three bypolls, including wresting Channapatna from JD(S). This seat was held by former CM H D Kumaraswamy in 2023 before he vacated it after winning the Lok Sabha polls in 2024. Congress' C P Yogeeshwara won the Channapatna segment defeating Nikhil Kumaraswamy, while Bharath Bommai lost to Congress' Yasir Ahmed Khan Pathan in Shiggaon.In Sikkim, Aditya Golay (Tamang) and Satish Chandra Rai, both from Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM), won uncontested.The bypoll results highlight a fragmented political landscape, with regional parties like TMC and AAP continuing to assert their influence, and BJP continuing its dominance in Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.There were nine bypolls in all in Uttar Pradesh with BJP winning six seats and its ally RLD securing another. SP continued its dominance in its stronghold of Karhal (since 1993) and Sishamau (since 2012). In West Bengal, TMC swept all six seats in the state, including wresting Madarihat from BJP.The two Parliamentary bypolls saw contrasting Congress victories. While Priyanka Gandhi won the Wayanad seat in Kerala vacated by her brother Rahul Gandhi with a staggering margin, Congress candidate Ravindra Chavan scraped through after defeating BJP's Santukrao Marotrao Hambarde in a keen contest in Nanded in Maharashtra.","BJP picked up Kundarki constituency, which had remained an SP stronghold since 2012.

NEW DELHI: There is unalloyed joy in BJP over the Maharashtra victory. However, its ally, Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde , may now have mixed feelings over the result because of the sheer numbers raked in by BJP.After BJP's best-ever performance in the western state, with the party missing the majority mark of 145 by just 13 seats, the leadership question appears to have been re-opened amid indications that it may like to put its tallest leader Devendra Fadnavis back at the helm.While senior figures like Union minister Piyush Goyal stuck to the formulaic ""the three parties will soon sit together to decide the issue"", sources in BJP acknowledged that the magnitude of its win has prompted a re-think over the leadership question.PM Narendra Modi's description of Devendra Fadnavis as ""Param Mitra"" (best friend) in the post-victory celebration was also seen as a strong pointer to that.""We have more than double Eknath Shinde's numbers. Our workers were disappointed when we made Fadnavis to agree to be deputy to somebody who had served as a minister under him. He agreed because of party discipline. Getting him to make the sacrifice yet again would be cruel,"" a senior BJP source said.A likely claim by BJP for the top position will be supported by Ajit Pawar who may be more comfortable with a non-Maratha like Fadnavis being CM rather than serving as deputy to a fellow Maratha for another term.The Shinde camp appeared to have sensed the signs of BJP's resurgent ambition and was resentful of it.""Shinde ran a govt which delivered on development, helped MLAs improve their chances of re-election and launched the highly popular Ladki Bahin Yojana to shift the vibes,"" a source close to the CMO in Mumbai said. He also brought up Shinde's role in bringing down MVA govt. ""We were promised that there would be no change of leadership,"" the source said.However, the outgoing chief minister does not have too many options because of BJP huge numbers and the strong likelihood of Ajit Pawar teaming up with the latter on the leadership issue. Also, the small flocks of Congress, NCP (SP) and Sena UBT are likely to be prone to splits.","BJP's best-ever performance in the western state, with the party missing the majority mark of 145 by just 13 seats.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said there is no race for the chief minister's post in Mahayuti .He told TOI, ""We have secured an unprecedented victory. It was a tsunami of a different kind, and the entire opposition has almost been wiped out, but there is no race for the CM's post. The decision on the new CM will be taken by senior netas of Shiv Sena, NCP and the BJP high command.""Fadnavis attributed Mahayuti's victory to the faith of the people of Maharashtra in the leadership of PM Narendra Modi . ""It's a fact that during the Lok Sabha elections, our performance was not up to the mark. In the post-LS polls period, people realised BJP was targeted by divisive and anti-national forces. They took revenge and voted in favour of Mahayuti. We are grateful to the people of Maharashtra for expressing confidence in Modi's leadership,"" he said.Fadnavis said Modi's slogan of 'ek hain toh safe hain,' combined with the Ladki Bahin scheme, was the game-changer. ""With the slogan, people indeed felt they were safe under the leadership of Modi. As a result, even on the day of polling, the electorate took the view 'ek hain toh safe hain' and 'Mahayuti hain toh safe hain,'"" he said.He added the Ladki Bahin scheme was ""implemented in letter and spirit and in future too, payment will be made as per schedule."" He said the priority of the new govt would be to complete ongoing infrastructure projects in a time-bound manner. ""We are determined to complete projects on schedule and to develop Mumbai as a world-class city,"" he said.Fadnavis said Mahayuti had to pay a heavy price for its failure to reply to fake narratives set by MVA politicians during LS polls. ""We took note of it and replied to all the fake narratives with full force, and we made it clear to people how MVA was misleading them,"" he added.Fadnavis said MVA had alleged Mahayuti was set to abolish reservations and make changes to the Constitution. ""We were able to successfully impress upon the people that it was BJP which ensured implementation of Dr Ambedkar's Constitution. People were convinced; therefore, they voted for us,"" he said.Fadnavis also said all-out efforts were made to divide people in the name of religion and caste during Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, but Mahayuti thwarted all attempts with Modi's slogan 'ek hain toh safe hain.' ""We united all communities and people from all walks of life,"" he noted.Further, Fadnavis said farmers too were taken for a ride by MVA with its fake narratives, but BJP convinced them and submitted to them that BJP would tackle the agrarian crisis as top priority.","Fadnavis attributed Mahayuti's victory to the faith of the people of Maharashtra in the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. He said Modi's slogan of 'ek hain toh safe hain,' combined with the Ladki Bahin scheme, was the game-changer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115609528,imgsize-1057001,width-400,resizemode-4/115609528.jpg"

PUNE: The passage of time seemed momentarily suspended at Bhigwan Chowk, Baramati 's political epicentre as the constituency stepped into a new chapter on Saturday, with Tennyson's words echoing powerfully: ""The old order changeth, yielding place to new...""By noon, 65-year-old Ajit Pawar , often referred to as 'Dada', cemented his position as Baramati's political heir, defeating nephew Yugendra Pawar of the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) by a decisive margin of 1,00,899 votes.The square was awash in pink - the colour of Ajit Pawar's NCP faction - as supporters marked it with deafening drums, a shower of flower petals, and bike rallies through the streets. The celebrations departed dramatically from the traditionally subdued tones associated with the Pawar family .Baramati has been synonymous with the family since Sharad Pawar's first electoral victory in 1967. His nephew Ajit carried forward that legacy from 1991, winning consistently. But the 2023 split in NCP divided loyalties between the factions led by 83-year-old Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar, setting the stage for this election.Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Pawar attributed his victory to the loyalty of Baramati voters. ""Baramatikars have shown they are Dada's true family,"" she said.Yet, amid the political shift, many residents yearn for unity within the Pawar family. Anganwadi teacher Meera Jadhav captured this sentiment: ""When people ask where we're from, we proudly say Baramati. They recognise it as Sharad Pawar's hometown. Look at our roads, schools, parks, and hospitals - all of this happened because Saheb and Dada worked together. We want the old days back so we don't have to choose.""Outside Ajit Pawar's office, jubilant supporters filled the streets. Just meters away, silence blanketed the NCP (SP) office, where defeat hung heavily in the air.As Baramati stood at a crossroads, its future shaped by the Pawar family's evolving legacy, many old-timers sought the hands that shaped the 'clock' to work together.","Ajit Pawar, 65, won the Baramati seat by a decisive margin of 1,00,899 votes. The square was awash in pink - the colour of Ajit Pawar's NCP faction.

NAGPUR: While the electoral battle was primarily a Mahayuti versus Maha Vikas Aghadi contest, it was the head-to-head fights between BJP and Congress in 75 constituencies that shaped the larger outcome. BJP emerged victorious in 65 seats of these, leaving Congress with a mere 10.The assembly election, coming months after the Lok Sabha polls in which Congress staged an impressive comeback, winning 17 of 48 seats - its best performance in a decade, saw BJP make a stunning recovery. It clinched 132 of the 288 seats, its highest-ever tally in Maharashtra, surpassing previous records of 122 in 2014 and 105 in 2019. Congress plummeted to its worst-ever performance, winning only 15, a steep decline from 44 in 2019 and 42 in 2014.BJP's triumph can be attributed to a coordinated campaign in which its state and central brass worked in tandem. While deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis and state unit chief Chandrashekar Bawankule worked across regions, providing support to every candidate, seasoned campaigners like Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari and Yogi Adityanath provided the necessary impetus to counter anti-incumbency.RSS played a key role, mobilising grassroots support through an extensive campaign involving over 60,000 meetings statewide. This effort helped consolidate votes and neutralise caste-based strategies employed by the opposition. BJP also benefited from its well-organised campaign machinery, which ensured effective candidate selection, voter outreach, and seamless coordination with allies.Congress's campaign was marred by infighting, lack of grassroots mobilisation, and an inability to project a credible leadership figure. Even veterans like Balasaheb Thorat and Prithviraj Chavan lost their seats. Of the 75 face-offs with BJP, Congress managed to win only 10 seats, mostly in areas with significant minority populations or where local netas had a stronghold. In the Konkan region, it has no MLAs left; in north Maharashtra, western Maharashtra and Marathwada, it now has one each. State Congress chief Nana Patole himself barely managed to retain his Sakoli seat, winning by a margin of 208 votes.","BJP clinched 132 of 288 seats, its highest-ever tally in Maharashtra.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Uddhav Thackeray 's bold decision to challenge the BJP in 2019 and form an alliance with the Congress and NCP has resulted in a significant electoral setback in the Maharashtra assembly elections, where his Shiv Sena (UBT) secured only 20 out of 95 contested seats. He expressed surprise at the electorate's dramatic shift in preference, considering their rejection of the BJP-led alliance merely five months ago in Lok Sabha elections.The political journey of Bal Thackeray's reserved son has been notable. He successfully overcame challenges from Narayan Rane and his cousin Raj Thackeray, eventually becoming Maharashtra's chief minister in November 2019 after dissolving the long-standing BJP alliance post-assembly elections.During the Covid-19 crisis, Uddhav established a strong connection with the public through social media platforms like Facebook live, presenting himself as a reassuring leader.Despite receiving acclaim for his pandemic management, he failed to recognise growing dissatisfaction within his party regarding the alliance with former ideological opponents. Eknath Shinde 's rebellion in June 2022 resulted in his government's collapse and a party split. Nevertheless, Uddhav maintained his criticism of the BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and those he termed ""traitors"" who aligned with Shinde. His party's performance in the Lok Sabha elections was modest, winning nine out of 21 contested seats.Critics have pointed out his limited accessibility, with even ally Sharad Pawar commenting on his tendency to work from home during his chief ministership. However, Uddhav gained support from previously distant communities, including Muslims and Dalits, and developed his own distinctive speaking style, different from his father's but equally sharp.Following the BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP alliance's decisive victory, chief minister Eknath Shinde declared it settled the question of Shiv Sena's legitimate leadership. The 64-year-old Uddhav and his son Aaditya now face the task of maintaining their remaining support base and challenging Shinde's claim to Bal Thackeray's legacy, while defending their alliance with the 'secular' Congress and NCP.Will he be able to make a comeback from this?",Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena secured only 20 out of 95 contested seats.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday celebrated BJP's spectacular win in Maharashtra as a triumph of his platform of unity, development and over INDIA bloc's politics of ""divisiveness, negativity and deceit"", as he sought to elevate his 'ek hain to safe hain' theme as the country's new ""mahamantra"".""After Haryana, the biggest message of this election is unity. 'Ek hain to safe hain' has become the 'mahamantra' of the country,"" a triumphant Modi said while addressing a celebration at the BJP headquarters. While hailing BJP's landslide, Modi framed the Maharashtra result as a defeat of Congress's focus on caste and said it was the message of unity, which triumphed in the state. ""It has taught a lesson to those who make people fight in the name of caste, religion, language and region,"" he said.PM Modi said electoral victory in Maharashtra was not just for BJP but for a vision of India that prioritised unity and development. This victory, Modi said, was a clear rejection of Congress and ""INDI alliance's"" agenda, which he accused of dividing society.Modi also took the opportunity to critique opposition's governance model, particularly focusing on Congress-led states. He cited examples like Karnataka, Telangana and Himachal where, he claimed, promises made by Congress were unfulfilled, drawing parallels to the electorate's disillusionment with such politics. ""People of Maharashtra saw how Congress govts are betraying people,"" he said, positioning BJP's governance as a stark contrast.The scale of BJP's win was unprecedented in Maharashtra, with Modi proudly declaring it ""biggest victory for any party or pre-poll alliance in the state in the past 50 years"". This wasn't just a political win but a mandate for BJP's continued governance, marking the third consecutive victory in the state, he added. ""For the third time, BJP has emerged as the largest party in Maharashtra,"" he said.He criticised Congress for its 'duplicity', especially concerning figures like Veer Savarkar, who, he said, was insulted and misrepresented by the rival for political gains. He said Maharashtra election had exposed the ""double face of INDI-Aghadi"".Modi also touched upon the issue of urban Naxalism, labelling it as a new challenge, with its roots allegedly outside the country, and urged the youth to recognise this reality. The PM also reflected on the losses, like in Jharkhand, as a call for more dedicated effort in development.","PM Narendra Modi hails BJP's spectacular win in Maharashtra as a triumph of his platform of unity, development and over INDIA bloc's politics of ""divisiveness, negativity and deceit"" Modi said electoral victory in Maharashtra was not just for BJP but for a vision of India that prioritised unity and development.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115611129,imgsize-1483536,width-400,resizemode-4/115611129.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Actress Swara Bhasker on Saturday blamed Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) following her husband Fahad Ahmad 's defeat in the Anushakti Nagar assembly constituency of Maharashtra, where he contested as an NCP (SCP) candidate.""In Anushakti Nagar vidhaan sabha after a steady lead by @FahadZirarAhmad of NCP-SP.. round 17, 18, 19 suddenly 99% battery charger EVMs are opened and BJP supported NCP-Ajit Pawar candidate takes lead.How can machines that have been voted on ALL day long have 99% charged batteries? Why do all 99% charged batteries give votes to BJP and its allies?"" Swara Bhasker said in a post on X.In a closely contested battle, Fahad Ahmad initially maintained an advantage against Sana Malik, representing the Ajit Pawar-led NCP faction, but ultimately conceded defeat in the last counting round even though the final results were not announced. As per the latest EC trends, Sana Malik was leading with a margin of 3,378 votes.The Anushakti Nagar constituency forms part of the Mumbai South-Central Lok Sabha seat.The Mahayuti alliance has achieved a significant victory, securing leads in over 220 seats and surpassing the required majority threshold.Following the alliance's success in crossing the halfway mark in Maharashtra, BJP workers began festivities at their Mumbai office, distributing sweets.Whilst the opposition faced a decisive setback in Maharashtra, they found some solace in Jharkhand, as voters in both states opted to maintain the status quo rather than embrace change.","Swara Bhasker's husband Fahad Ahmad lost in the Anushakti Nagar assembly constituency of Maharashtra.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday established himself, and rather convincingly, as the leader of the real Shiv Sena With his party winning 57 seats - one more than the undivided Shiv Sena's 56 in the 2019 assembly elections and a staggering 35 more than Shiv Sena-UBT's Saturday tally - he now has the first claim to not only Sena founder Bal Thackeray's political legacy, but also the grassroots support that was so far believed to be with Uddhav Thackeray Shinde Sena's strike rate - number of seats contested divided by the number of wins - made its victory even more remarkable. His party contested only 81 seats and won 57 at a strike rate of 70.4%. In 2019, the undivided Sena had contested 124 seats and won 56, a strike rate of 45.2%. And in 1995, when the undivided Shiv Sena had won 73 seats, its highest ever, the strike rate was 43.2%.Shinde Sena now stands as the state's number one regional party, second only to the national behemoth, BJP, and miles ahead of Sharad Pawar's NCP. Political observers said having made deep inroads into Mumbai, Shiv Sena-UBT's traditional stronghold, it is just a matter of time before he challenges Uddhav Thackeray for the control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). There is a possibility of Shinde poaching Sena-UBT's MLAs, MPs and influential 'shakha pramukhs' in Mumbai.Shinde's Sena contested 15 seats in Mumbai and won 5. Uddhav's Sena contested 22 and won 10. Almost all of Sena's 40 sitting MLAs won and so did its cabinet ministers, illustrating the meticulous planning that went into selection of candidates. Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde characterised Shinde Sena's victory as the end of Shiv Sena being run as a private limited company. ""People have delivered their verdict on who is taking Balasaheb's legacy forward,"" he said.","Eknath Shinde's party won 57 seats - one more than the undivided Shiv Sena's 56 in the 2019 assembly elections. He now has the first claim to not only Sena founder Bal Thackeray's political legacy, but also grassroots support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115612111,imgsize-855615,width-400,resizemode-4/115612111.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The result day for the Maharashtra assembly elections brought contrasting outcomes for Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh 's siblings. His elder brother Amit Deshmukh secured victory, on the other hand, the younger one, Dhiraj, experienced a narrow defeat with a difference of a few thousand votes.The Indian National Congress (INC) candidate Amit Deshmukh emerged victorious in Latur city constituency. He defeated BJP's DR. Archana Patil Chahurkar by over 7,000 votes.Being the firstborn of former Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, Amit had previously completed three terms as a legislative assembly member from Latur city. This was his fourth election for the position.His opponent and BJP candidate Archana Patil Chakurkar is the daughter-in-law of former union home minister Shivraj Patil Chakurkar.However, his brother Dhiraj Deshmukh , who also contested on a Congress ticket, suffered defeat in the Latur rural constituency. The incumbent MLA Dhiraj lost his seat to BJP contestant Ramesh Karad by a margin exceeding 6,000 votes.The BJP on Saturday pulled off a stunning performance in Maharashtra winning a record number of seats to propel the party-led ruling Mahayuti alliance to a landslide victory with 229 seats. The MVA managed to get only 47 seats and the Congress only 16.","The Indian National Congress (INC) candidate Amit Deshmukh emerged victorious in Latur city constituency. He defeated BJP's DR.

Election results: BJP's core agenda gets a boost with heavy-Mahayuti win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-maharashtra-election-results-bjps-core-agenda-gets-a-boost-with-heavy-mahayuti-win/articleshow/115615225.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress couldn't have imagined a drubbing like the one it got in Maharashtra, where MVA managed only 46 seats - 10 fewer than INDIA bloc's tally in Jharkhand, where the assembly is less than one-third the size of the western state. Congress's weakness in straight fights with BJP has also been highlighted again.Coming just six months after BJP's LS reverses in Maharashtra, the party will interpret its best-ever tally in the state as a revalidation of PM Modi's brand of politics. His authority, following a win in Haryana and sweep in Maharashtra, is now all but restored after the knock it took following LS results. In his post-victory speech, Modi made it plain he would focus as much on 'development' as on Hindutva themes and the 'virasat' (heritage) platform.A charged-up BJP will push its plans on UCC and one nation, one election more aggressively. Passing the ONOE bill will be easier after two state wins.Economic policy initiatives like hiking the ceiling on FDI in insurance to 100% will be politically safer following BJP's crushing win in Maharashtra.Key govt officials are upbeat that the bill can be placed before Parliament in the coming winter session. As for caste census, which only a few months back looked like a major opposition strategy, BJP, which executed electorally profitable social engineering in Haryana and Maharashtra, now has the luxury of not being pushed into it out of fear of a backlash.Maharashtra's win is so overwhelming that BJP has won the optics game despite its loss in smaller, and politically less crucial, Jharkhand. But even in that loss, BJP's vote share is close to that of the JMM-led INDIA alliance. Chatter on the party's and Modi's waning popular appeal will now quieten.The other big political message was that Rahul Gandhi's charges of crony capitalism against BJP is not a theme voters care about much. The Adani factor was hyped up by MVA in Maharashtra. But ordinary citizens have proved again that a measure of economic security, even via govt sops, is much more important to them than allegations of which rich industrialist is cozying up with which party.Congress, after back-to-back losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, has all but lost the leading status it gained among opposition parties after its improved LS performance. Alliance partners will again be more aggressive in negotiations and less willing to follow agendas set unilaterally by Congress.This will be especially true when it comes to Congress's opposition to BJP's future Hindutva agenda, whether its uniform civil code or pushing through the Waqf reform bill. Modi was pointed in his post-victory speech when he said the Constitution didn't back a waqf law.",Congress couldn't have imagined a drubbing like the one it got in Maharashtra.

DEHRADUN: Days after six youths were killed in a collision between their MUV and a container truck near ONGC Chowk in Dehradun, police arrested the truck driver in UP's Saharanpur Friday. The driver had fled the scene abandoning the truck.The impact of the accident was so severe that six of the seven occupants in the MUV, including three women aged 19-24, had died on the spot.Two of the youngsters were decapitated. The lone survivor is still in hospital, and unable to talk much. Initial probe suggested that the MUV which was being driven at a speed of over 120km/h, had hit the truck's left rear side when the latter was crossing a intersection at normal speed.Police said the truck driver is Ram Kumar, 34, of Saharanpur. Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said Kumar had fled to evade police. ""During interrogation, he told police that he fled out of fear after seeing the extent of the accident and the victims' bodies scattered on the road,"" said the SSP.Kumar also confessed to removing the truck's registration plate before fleeing.",Six youths were killed in a collision between their MUV and a container truck in Dehradun.

NEW DELHI: The vote counting for the Maharashtra assembly elections is underway, with early trends hinting at a fierce battle between the Mahayuti alliance and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The Mahayuti, comprising the BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar’s NCP, is pitted against the MVA coalition of Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and Sharad Pawar-led NCP.Maharashtra’s 288 constituencies witnessed a voter turnout of 66.05%, reflecting increased public participation compared to 2019. Both alliances remain optimistic, interpreting the higher turnout as a sign of support for their respective coalitions.Key contests are drawing significant attention, including Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis’s fight in Nagpur South West and a high-stakes battle in Wadala, where Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Shraddha Jadhav expressed confidence in her victory.As counting progresses, leads are emerging, with the Mahayuti gaining a landslide margin of over 220 seats in several constituencies.","Here are the winners from Maharashtra assembly elections: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Maharashtra Alliance (Maha) and Jharkhand Alliance (Jharkand) BJP: 145 BJP+ 229 MVA 47 OTH 12 Maharashtra Alliance: 81 NDA 24 OTH 1 Source: PValue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115585397,imgsize-938489,width-400,resizemode-4/115585397.jpg"

MUMBAI: In Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Mahayuti achieved significant electoral victories, maintaining their strongholds while reclaiming lost territories and altering established political dynamics.In Kopri-Pachpakhadi, CM Eknath Shinde secured the highest victory margin among four seats within Thane civic boundaries. His Ladki Bahin scheme, benefiting over 1.2 lakh residents, helped him defeat his mentor Anand Dighe's nephew and UBT's Kedar Dighe by 1.2 lakh votes. ""The opposition spent the last two years levelling allegations against us. We responded with constructive work,"" Shinde said.In Ovala-Majiwada, three-term MLA Pratap Sarnaik secured 1.8 lakh votes, defeating UBT's Naresh Manera by 1.08 lakh votes. BJP's Sanjay Kelkar retained Thane for the third time, securing 1.2 lakh votes against UBT's Rajan Vichare, while MNS's Avinash Jadhav finished third. Belapur saw a nail-biting finish with BJP MLA Manda Mhatre retaining her seat with a wafer thin margin of 377 votes against NCP (SP)'s Sandeep Naik. She polled 91,852 votes and Naik 91,475.In Palghar district, Mahayuti took five of the six seats. BJP and Shiv Sena candidates overcame three BVA incumbents-Hitendra Thakur, Kshitij Thakur and Rajesh Patil-in Vasai, Nalasopara and Boisar. Sena's Rajendra Gavit won in Palghar against UBT's newcomer Jayendra Dubla. In Vikramgad, BJP's Harishchandra Bhoye prevailed over NCP (SP)'s Sunil Bhusara. CPI(M)'s Vinod Nikole narrowly retained Dahanu with a lead of 5,133 votes. The seat also recorded 5,120 NOTA votes, one of the highest in MMR.In Mira-Bhayander, BJP's Narendra Mehta won with 1.44 lakh votes, beating Congress's Muzaffar Hussain and ex-BJP member Geeta Jain.Mahayuti's success continued in Kalyan: it kept four seats and added Kalyan Rural. MVA's sole victory there came from Mumbra-Kalwa, where Jitendra Awhad secured his fourth term. Ravindra Chavan scored the highest margin among six seats in Kalyan.In Bhiwandi, Mahayuti secured five seats. SP representative Rais Shaikh won Bhiwandi East. The remaining victories went to BJP's Kishan Kathore and Mahesh Chaugule, Sena's Shantaram More and Vishwanath Bhoir, and NCP's Daulat Daroda.The coalition dominated in Navi Mumbai, too.","In Kopri-Pachpakhadi, CM Eknath Shinde secured the highest victory margin among four seats within Thane civic boundaries.

And hoping to make deep inroads, BJP rolled out its heavy artillery - led by PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah with UP CM Yogi Adityanath making frequent visits - in its high-decibel campaign to take Jharkhand.The results, with the exception of some urban seats, were quite the opposite. While PM Modi held five rallies and a roadshow in areas that included the tribal pockets of Gumla and Chaibasa (Kolhan), Shah held 14 rallies during the campaign while Yogi was parachuted in to consolidate Hindu and SC-dominated pockets in urban areas.Despite Modi holding rallies in Bokaro, Sarath, Godda and Chaibasa, BJP won no seats here. Bokaro, Sarath and Godda were, in fact, seats that were with BJP but were wrested by the JMM-led INDIA bloc. Similarly, despite Shah's rallies in Tamar and Chhatarpur, the INDIA bloc won both. Chhatarpur previously was with BJP.Yogi, with his 'batenge to katenge' line, held rallies in Deoghar, Bokaro, Bermo, Bhawnathpur and Hussainabad, but BJP-led NDA ended up with losses in these seats. Deoghar, Bhawnathpur and Hussainabad were in the NDA fold.Congress spokesperson Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo said the results showed an outright rejection of BJP's ""divisive politics"" by voters in the state. ""Right from the PM to lower-rung functionaries, all tried highly divisive politics but the outcome indicates tribals, Dalits and voters at large have given the mandate to INDIA bloc. This is a direct referendum on Modi, Shah and BJP,"" Shahdeo said.BJP functionaries said they did not agree with the assessment that their campaign had not worked ""We accept the verdict. Yes, it's not what we had expected, but we have managed to open our accounts in new seats only due to BJP's issue-based campaigning,"" said BJP spokesperson Ashok Baraik.",PM Modi held five rallies and a roadshow in areas that included the tribal pockets of Gumla and Chaibasa (Kolhan) Shah held 14 rallies during the campaign while Yogi was parachuted in to consolidate Hindu and SC-dominated pockets in urban areas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115616954,imgsize-1158510,width-400,resizemode-4/115616954.jpg"
Modi said ‘ek hain...’ & Maha said ‘safe hain’: Muslim polarisation ran into silent consolidation of Hindus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assembly-elections-modi-said-ek-hain-maharashtra-said-safe-hain-muslim-polarisation-ran-into-silent-consolidation-of-hindus/articleshow/115616179.cms,"NEW DELHI: After surprise setbacks in several key constituencies in Maharashtra in Lok Sabha polls this year, BJP found itself at a crossroads, needing to recalibrate its strategy to regain lost ground. Polarisation of Muslim votes against it led to significant losses for BJP in at least seven constituencies in the Lok Sabha polls that included Dhule and Mumbai North-East, where the saffron party had previously enjoyed strong support.In the wake of these results, BJP, under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, initiated a campaign aimed at not just reclaiming these lost territories but also redefining its image. The PM introduced a new rallying cry, ""ek hain to safe hain"" (together we are safe), a slogan designed to resonate with the Hindu electorate, emphasising unity as a defence against division. This was not merely about communal unity but was portrayed as a broader appeal for national cohesion under BJP's stewardship. The call seems to have resulted in silent consolidation of Hindu votes in favour of BJP and its allies.The slogan was a direct counter to the narrative set by the opposition and was complemented by another slogan from UP CM Yogi Adityanath, ""batenge to katenge"" (divided we fall), which further hammered the message of unity for survival. These slogans were intended to reassure Hindu voters in areas where they felt their political influence was waning due to consolidation of minority votes.BJP's narrative was bolstered by the activities of Muslim clerics, who called for Muslim votes to be consolidated behind the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). This move was seen by BJP as an opportunity to validate its call for Hindu unity . The demands from National Ulema Council, Maharashtra, and All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Sajjad Nomani, which included quotas for Muslims in govt contracts and preference in recruitment for police forces, only intensified BJP's campaign.Opposition from Hindu seers was swift, interpreting these demands as divisive. The political atmosphere was already charged when protests by Muslim youth in front of 'Matoshree' forced Shiv Sena (UBT) to reconsider its position on the waqf bill, highlighting the delicate balance of communal politics in the region.As the election campaign progressed, BJP's strategy evolved into a narrative of safeguarding cultural and national unity against perceived threats of division. Party leaders, including PM, engaged in a series of rallies and meetings, emphasising the importance of standing together. The narrative was clear: unity under BJP was the path to safety and progress for the Hindu community, and by extension, for the nation.Saffron fountainhead RSS was also said to be proactive in the polls and it was evident when the two slogans were endorsed by its leadership. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, in his annual Dussehra address, called for Hindu unity and urged taking lessons from attacks on the community in Bangladesh. Senior Sangh functionary Dattatreya Hosabale also used the slogan ""batenge to katenge"", amplifying the call for Hindu unity.","PM Narendra Modi introduced a new rallying cry, ""ek hain to safe hain"" (together we are safe) The slogan was designed to resonate with the Hindu electorate.

With 88% Strike Rate, Party Wins 15 Of 17 Contested

PUNE: For an election fought primarily on women's empowerment issues, largely the Ladki Bahin Scheme, only 8.8% women candidates were in the fray, and even fewer have won. Just 22 will be a part of the new assembly, down from 24 in 2019, reports Salonee Mistry. Of the 55 women fielded by the two major blocs, 21 Mahayuti faces and one MVA nominee won.In Pune, Parvati saw a tough fight between two women - BJP's Madhuri Misal and NCP (SP)'s Ashwini Kadam. Misal secured the seat with 1,18,193 votes, winning with a margin of 54,660.Other winners included NCP's Aditi Tatkare, who won in Shrivardhan with 1,16,050 votes, Sana Malik in Anushaktinagar, Saroj Ahire in Deolali, BJP's Sneha Dubey Pandit in Vasai and Devayani Harande in Nashik Central, and Shiv Sena's Manjula Gavit in Sakri.Only one woman from the opposition alliance won - Congress' Jyothi Gaikwad in Dharavi constituency.MUMBAI: BJP emerged as the Big Brother in Mumbai, winning 15 of the 17 seats it contested. The party got one seat less than its 2019 victory tally of 16 seats. Shiv Sena (UBT), which faced a wipeout in most of the state, managed to win 10 seats out of the 22 it contested in the city. The party won 20 seats in Maharashtra, so half of their wins came from Mumbai. Sena's (UBT) lone Muslim candidate, Haroon Khan, won from Versova, defeating BJP's sitting MLA Bharti Lavekar. Shiv Sena, led by CM Eknath Shinde, won six seats. It fought 15 seats. Congress, which contested on 10 seats, only managed to win three, down from four sitting MLAs in 2019. NCP (SP) fought two seats in Mumbai and lost both, while the Ajit Pawar-NCP contested two seats and won one - Sana Malik from Anushakti Nagar. MNS failed to bag any seat in Mumbai; in fact, its chief Raj Thackeray's son, Amit, lost from Mahim seat.BJP's Sanjay Upadhaya bagged the Borivli seat with 1,00,057 votes, the highest winning margin in Mumbai, defeating Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Bhosale. BJP's Mihir Kotecha won Mulund seat by over a 90,000 vote margin. This was nearly 50% more margin than in the Lok Sabha elections from Mulund constituency in May, when he had a 61,000 lead. In Malabar Hill, BJP's Mangal Prabhat Lodha won his 7th election, the only candidate to hold that record in this constituency. He swept the elections with 1,01,197 votes and, with that, garnered the highest vote share of 73.4% among all constituencies of Mumbai.Among other high-profile seats, BJP's Ashish Shelar (Bandra West), Ameet Satam (Andheri West), and Rahul Narwekar (Colaba) got big wins. The Shinde-led Sena lost key seats to Sena (UBT) like Worli, where Aaditya Thackeray won, and Mahim, where Mahesh Sawant defeated sitting MLA Sada Sarvankar. Sena (UBT)'s Varun Sardesai won from Bandra East defeating NCP's Zeeshan Siddique. SP's Abu Azmi won Mankhurd-Shivaji Nagar seat defeating NCP's Nawab Malik. Some of the Sena's candidates who joined from BJP just before the polls, like Shaina NC (Mumbadevi), lost, while Murji Patel (Andheri East) won.Bhandup West witnessed the highest voting percentage at nearly 62.9%, and it was a close contest between Ramesh Korgaonkar of Sena UBT and Ashok Patil of Shiv Sena. While the former was leading during the first 11 rounds, giving an impression that he might easily get re-elected, the tables turned from the 12th round, as Patil surpassed him for the next 9 rounds and won by 6,764 votes.Ghatkopar West seat saw a close fight between three-time BJP MLA Ram Kadam and Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Bhalerao. Kadam won the seat with a margin of 12,971 votes.The richest candidate in the fray, BJP's Parag Shah, won the second consecutive term with 34,999 votes in Ghatkopar (East). In Kurla, Mangesh Kudalkar of Shiv Sena won his third term by overcoming a tough challenge by Pravina Morajkar of UBT.","Only 8.8% women candidates were in the fray, and even fewer have won.

Jharkhand election results: It's 2019 again for BJP as tribal bastion defies polarisation bid a second time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-election-results-its-2019-again-for-bjp-as-tribal-bastion-defies-polarisation-bid-a-second-time/articleshow/115615980.cms,"NEW DELHI: At the peak of his popularity following a massive mandate in Pulwama-powered 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Narendra Modi twisted the knife deeper months later in Jharkhand when he remarked that he could identify rioters by their clothes. It was the trope for polarisation that was expected to build on the mood in his favour and rescue the unpopular BJP in the tribal state. But he could not defy the state's tradition of booting out the incumbent.Five years later, BJP sent three months in advance the fire-breathing Himanta Biswa Sarma and Shivraj Chouhan to prepare the pitch for polarisation with sharp comments around Hindu-Muslim faultline, on which the big guns later batted with their campaigns. But this time, they could not stop the JMM-plus from defying the incumbency handicap.Five years apart, Jharkhand has stood like a rock, stonewalling communalism. On both occasions, tribal face Hemant Soren triumphantly ascending to the helm.The pattern has thrown into sharp relief the unique nature of the state carved out of Bihar, which is known for its tribal character but has a predominant majority of OBCs; where the native party banks on three partners to boost its rainbow alliance, but is ranged against BJP which has a national force and agenda that seeks to overcome the caste divide through religious consolidation.Native leader Soren was the underdog, who was battling the might of the hegemonic BJP machine led by the lifesize image of Modi supported by a strong cast of who's who.A man who, after being under the hammer for over two years, was jailed in an alleged corruption case during the LS polls - the rival plan being to render the underdog rudderless and then overwhelm it. But first Champai Soren, and then Soren's wife Kalpana, stepped up, and effected a tribal consolidation that yielded decent results in the parliamentary polls. Six months later, the mood only soared further.In hindsight, BJP erred in treating Soren like NCP and Shiv Sena or Congress leaders, as it triggered an identity backlash that sank the favourites.Yet, the BJP combo of 'name, network, resources and rhetoric' was a massive challenge to overcome. They were all there - Modi, Amit Shah, Yogi Adityanath and Biswa Sarma. By the looks of it, JMM appealed to the vast populace as the underdog taking on the mighty, as its soft manners and inclusive approach countered the rivals' attempt at religious consolidation. It could only be possible with tribals finding allies in the sprawling OBC bloc and minorities, with a sprinkling of others. The support of 'Maiyya Samman' monthly dole to women, played its role.In the end, Jharkhand would be known as the state that bucked the trend back to back, and kept polarisation at bay.","Five years apart, Jharkhand has stood like a rock, stonewalling communalism.

The significance of these two wins can be gauged from the fact that BJP had won these seats only once each before - Kundarki in 1993 and Katehri in 1991.The other seats BJP won are Khair in Aligarh, Phulpur in Prayagraj, Majhawan in Mirzapur and Ghaziabad Sadar. NDA ally RLD maintained its hold on Meerapur in Muzaffarnagar. For SP, retaining Karhal, part of Akhilesh's pocket borough Mainpuri, and Sishamau in Kanpur was a small consolation for losing the other two.Yogi said BJP-led NDA's landslide in Maharashtra and UP indicated that people have put their stamp on PM Narendra Modi's slogan, ""Ek rahenge, safe rahenge"". If BJP losing Ayodhya in LS polls was seen as a moral defeat, the win in Kundarki would go down as a pleasant surprise.BJP's Ramvir Singh won the seat by 1.4 lakh votes. Such a big win, sources said, would not have been possible without Muslims voting for the BJP candidate.Yogi termed the victory ""a win for nationalism"". SP's victory in Karhal by a relatively lower margin of 14,000 votes compared to 67,000 in 2022, is seen as an erosion of support. Same is the case in Sishamau, where Akhilesh's party won by 8,000-odd votes compared to around 12,000 the last time.Yogi had hit the ground running for the bypolls right after LS setback. He not only appointed ministers to lead the campaign in each constituency, but also visited these places multiple times to drum up support. BJP's assembly tally rose from 255 in 2022 to 257, while SP's slipped from 111 to 107.

But ordinary citizens have proved again that a measure of economic security, even via govt sops, is much more important to them than allegations of which rich industrialist is cozying up with which party.Congress, after back-to-back losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, has all but lost the leading status it gained among opposition parties after its improved LS performance. Alliance partners will again be more aggressive in negotiations and less willing to follow agendas set unilaterally by Congress.This will be especially true when it comes to Congress's opposition to BJP's future Hindutva agenda, whether its uniform civil code or pushing through the Waqf reform bill. Modi was pointed in his post-victory speech when he said the Constitution didn't back a waqf law.","Economic policy initiatives like hiking the ceiling on FDI in insurance to 100% will be politically safer following BJP's crushing win in Maharashtra. Congress, after back-to-back losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, has all but lost the leading status it gained among opposition parties after its improved LS performance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115615431,imgsize-1736377,width-400,resizemode-4/115615431.jpg"

MUMBAI: For the first time in six decades, there will be no leader of opposition (LoP) in the Maharashtra legislative assembly owing to an inadequate number of opposition members.As per the provisions of the Salaries and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in the State Legislature Act, a leader of opposition can be nominated if the party has 10% of the elected members, former principal secretary (legislature) Anant Kalse said.""So, in the 288-member Maharashtra legislative assembly, only if the opposition party has 28 elected members can it nominate the leader of opposition,"" Kalse told TOI. ""According to Saturday's state assembly poll results, since the largest opposition party - Shiv Sena (UBT) - has only 21 members, it cannot stake a claim for the post. Congress, with 16 members, and Sharad Pawar-led NCP, with 10 members, are not even in the zone of consideration,'' he added.""The rules and procedures pertaining to the requirement of LoP are quite elaborate in the book, Practice and Procedure of Parliament, by M N Kaul and S L Shakdher. There is no scope for Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP) to have a leader of opposition,'' Kalse said.Under the rules, the LoP post also cannot be secured based on the combined strength of the three parties even if they had a pre-poll alliance, he added.It was way back in 1962 and 1967 that there were no LoPs since then Congress used to win the elections by unprecedented margins. ""With massive wins for Congress, there was no scope for the appointment of a LoP,"" Kalse said.","For the first time in six decades, there will be no leader of opposition (LoP) in the Maharashtra legislative assembly.

MUMBAI: Sharad Pawar 's self-proclaimed swansong in electoral politics ended in a damp squib with his nephew's NCP winning more than 4x the seats that his own party could muster. In retaliation for Ajit's decision to field his wife against Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule, the Maratha warhorse had turned the Baramati contest again into a prestige fight, pitching Ajit's nephew against him. The gambit didn't pay off.Ajit's NCP has upped its score from a mere six assembly segment leads in the LS results to a tally of 41 MLAs, in the process beating the senior Pawar's nominees in 27 head-to-head clashes; the latter won 7 of those contests.Ajit has extended his sway over western Maharashtra (22 seats), Marathwada (10) and Vidarbha (5) while the majority of seats the senior Pawar held on to are all in western Maharashtra.""Maharashtra chooses pink,"" said deputy CM Ajit Pawar on his social media handle, highlighting the role played by the Ladki Bahin Scheme in Mahayuti 's and his own NCP's victory Saturday.From his party's dismal performance in the Lok Sabha elections, where it won only one of the four seats contested, the 40-seat haul in the assembly polls is a transformation hardly anybody had seen coming. However, it came on the back of humility to recognise mistakes, the strength and stamina to run a hard campaign when chips were down, and the knack of recognising a winner.Ajit and his band of seasoned politicians he took with him while splitting NCP in 2023 did all of this - they did not repeat the mistakes they had made in the LS polls - ran an untiring campaign, mostly in the hinterland; and recognised the game-changing potential ofLadki Bahin Yojna , going to the extent of adopting pink, a feminine shade, as its campaign colour.He had taken 40 MLAs with him when he split NCP. On Saturday, his party won as many seats at a 75% strike rate, cementing its position in the BJP-headed Mahayuti.Ajit, who put a marker down in the Pawar vs Pawar battle by defeating nephew and NCP-Sharad Pawar candidate Yugendra Pawar in Baramati, has earned the right to call his NCP ""the real NCP"".While Sharad Pawar's NCP went into the polls riding on its Lok Sabha success, Ajit Pawar went beaten down and with only five months to get the party up and running again.NCP's decision to focus on Ladki Bahin Yojna without getting into a credit war over it with its allies, worked. ""It's still early days, but we know we won in villages. Picking pink as our campaign colour was a masterstroke,"" said a senior neta. During the LS polls, NCP has taken an aggressive stand against Sharad Pawar. This time, the party avoided any direct attacks on Pawar. ""When Mahayuti's Sadabhau Khot made some controversial remarks, Ajit was quick to register his protest. He also admitted his mistake of fielding his wife Sunetra against Supriya Sule in Baramati. These steps helped blunt sympathy for Sharad Pawar,"" said another neta.","Sharad Pawar's self-proclaimed swansong in electoral politics ended in a damp squib with his nephew's NCP winning more than 4x the seats that his own party could muster.

NEW DELHI: When the verdict of the Lok Sabha elections was announced in June, resentment among farmers in Maharashtra was seen as a major factor behind BJP's dismal performance in the state, along with nervousness among Scheduled Caste voters who feared the party might amend the Constitution if it returned with 400-plus seats. Changing the perception was part of the NDA govt's agenda, especially in the wake of protests in Punjab.Over the next five months, the BJP-led Centre and the Mahayuti 's ""double engine"" coalition sought to address these concerns, especially those related to onions and soybean - issues that agitated Maharashtra farmers this summer - with tur growers too coming into the focus.Unlike the general elections, when the Centre waited until May to lift the ban on onion exports as it sought to comfort consumers, by early Sept, it had decided to lift the minimum export price -another tool deployed to check the shipment ofsensitive commodities out of the country.At the same time, it built a stockpile of the politically-sensitive kitchen ingredient, procuring 4.7 lakh tonnes of onions directly from farmers, instead of 3 lakh tonnes last year. And, this came at a higher average price of over Rs 28 a kg - 64% higher than the Rs 17 paid to farmers last year.Similarly, within days of coming to power at the Centre, the Modi govt announced a 6% increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for soybean to Rs 4,892 a quintal with an eye on Maharashtra, the second-largest producer after Madhya Pradesh, at a time when market prices were near the lowest levels in a decade due to excess supply in the global market. Besides, the agriculture ministry decided to procure a quarter of the produce from the western state through govt agencies, even relaxing some of the norms.While dairy was the other area of unease, the Centre has focused on tying up contracts with tur growers, where India is a major importer, along with other pulses such as urad and masur. Although market prices for tur are higher than the MSP, the move has sought to comfort farmers and send a positive message amid the constant complaints of sugarcane growers.","The BJP-led Centre and the Mahayuti's ""double engine"" coalition sought to address these concerns, especially those related to onions and soybean.

Rahul Gandhi's exit paved way for Priyanka



Three-way contest in Wayanad



Congress's stronghold at stake



Priyanka's campaign rallies draw large crowds



NEW DELHI: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra won the Wayanad Lok Sabha polls with a massive margin as she received 6,22,338 votes in the election which also marks her electoral debut. She defeated CPI's Sathyan Mokeri by 4,10,931 votes.BJP's Navya Haridas garnered 1,09,939 votes and ended in the third spot.After her resounding victory, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra thanked the people of Wayanad, saying she felt ""overwhelmed with gratitude for the trust"" people of the constituency posed in her.""My dearest sisters and brothers of Wayanad, I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the trust you have placed in me. I will make sure that over time, you truly feel this victory has been your victory and the person you chose to represent you understands your hopes and dreams and fights for you as one of your own. I look forward to being your voice in Parliament! Thank you for giving me this honour and even more for the immense love you have given me,"" Priyanka Gandhi wrote on X.Priyanka further wrote: ""My colleagues in the UDF, leaders from across Kerala, workers, volunteers and my office colleagues who worked incredibly hard in this campaign, thank you for your support, for tolerating my 12 hour a day (no food, no rest) car journeys, and for fighting like true soldiers for the ideals we all believe in"".'To my mother, Robert and my two jewels- Raihan and Miraya, no gratitude is ever enough for the love and courage you give me. And to my brother, Rahul, you are the bravest of them all… thank you for showing me the way and having my back, always!"" she further wrote.Priyanka, in her debut electoral run, surpassed her brother Rahul's winning margin of Lok Sabha elections 2024. The Wayanad seat, previously held by Rahul who received 3,64,422 votes, has captured national attention.The Wayanad seat, previously held by her brother Rahul Gandhi, has captured national attention, with many wondering if Vadra can replicate his success. The district Congress leadership estimates that Vadra will secure nearly six lakh votes out of the 9.52 lakh polled. Meanwhile, the LDF’s Sathyan Mokeri is projected to get around two lakh votes, and BJP’s Haridas around one lakh votes.Also read: Election results Despite a low voter turnout, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal expressed confidence, stating, “We are not at all worried about the victory or majority Priyanka Gandhi will secure. The low turnout will not affect her lead.” The AICC is currently looking into the reasons behind the unexpected dip in voter participation.Also read: Bypoll Election Results 2024 Rahul Gandhi, who had held the Wayanad seat since 2019, announced his decision to vacate the constituency following his election in the 2024 general elections.Rahul, having secured victories in both Wayanad and Rae Bareli, chose to retain his seat in Uttar Pradesh, leading to the need for a by-poll in Wayanad. The Congress then nominated Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from the seat.Priyanka Gandhi’s entry into the electoral fray has triggered a high-profile contest in Wayanad, where she faces 15 other candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the LDF and Navya Haridas of the NDA. With political dynamics at play, this by-poll has become more than just a local contest.EC has taken extensive steps to ensure a smooth voting process, setting up 1,354 polling booths across the constituency, all equipped with webcasting facilities to monitor the election in real-time.Historically, Wayanad has been a Congress stronghold, with the party winning the seat in every election since its creation in 2008. Rahul Gandhi's victories in 2019 and 2024 were resounding, securing margins of 4.3 lakh and 3.6 lakh votes, respectively.However, the UDF (United Democratic Front) is now banking on Priyanka Gandhi’s popularity to carry the seat once again. The Congress hopes that her appeal, coupled with the party's traditional support base among minorities, settler farmers, and tribal communities, will help secure a significant win.Priyanka Gandhi’s campaign rallies have been marked by large female audiences, a trend that the UDF interprets as a positive sign for her electoral prospects.The rally crowds, coupled with the groundwork being laid by the party in the form of door-to-door outreach and community engagements, indicated that Priyanka positioned herself as a fresh and dynamic face for the constituency.","Priyanka Gandhi Vadra won the Wayanad Lok Sabha polls with a massive margin.

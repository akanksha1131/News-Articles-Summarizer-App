HIV jab for 115 nations rests on Indian regulators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiv-jab-for-115-nations-rests-on-indian-regulators/articleshow/124199149.cms,"Mumbai: There will be a dramatic shift in how the world prevents HIV and the timelines depend on how quickly Indian drug regulators act. A US-based pharma giant has granted royalty-free licences to four Indian generic manufacturers to produce lenacapavir, which prevents transmission by almost 100%, at $40 per person per year, roughly 0.1% of the original cost.Lenacapavir is an injectable drug whose protection from one jab lasts six months. The licensed manufacturers by Gilead Sciences include Dr Reddy's, Hetero, Emcureand Mylan. The first two have announced their pricing. The drugs are estimated to roll out in 2027. But, it could be much sooner or delayed, and what happens in India will impact local access as well as 115 low- and middle-income countries as these firms will be key exporters. Twenty-six additional such countries where people participated in crucial clinical trials are excluded from it as per licence terms.The exports depend on registration and a certificate of pharmaceutical product from Indian FDA. Besides, there could be regulatory demand for local clinical trials despite strong phase-3 trial data from elsewhere. ""In that case, the delays could spill over into 2027,"" said Leena Menghaney, public health lawyer.There is another pathway to faster access. FDA could provide a waiver for local clinical trials on the grounds that HIV is an epidemic. India reports more than 60,000 new HIV infections annually.There is precedent for such a move. ""Waivers have been given for HIV and TB drugs. These decisions are based on the results of phase-3 clinical trials in countries with very strong regulatory systems,"" Menghaney said.In 2015, the apex committee of the regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation also granted a waiver of local trials for antiviral drugs against Hepatitis C.Even if local production moves ahead quickly, access in India will be limited. National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) has so far included only condoms as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in its HIV prevention programme.There have been drugs similar to lenacapavir, although not on a par in terms of protection and cost, that were not included in the national programme. Naco officials had previously defended this position, saying condoms also help prevent the spread of other STDs and STIs, which increased in some countries when PrEP was introduced and condom use declined.However, Dr Ishwar Gilada, an HIV specialist, said, ""Bringing about behaviour change is difficult, but sex education and awareness are also part of Naco's responsibilities. For the first time in over 40 years, we have a way to control HIV's transmission by almost 100%. This will reduce the number of people requiring lifelong treatment.""Ganesh Acharya, a city-based HIV-TB survivor, said, ""Other such drugs so far have been needed to be taken monthly, are costly and offer relatively lower protection. Even condoms carry a risk of tearing. This drug could bring down new HIV numbers.""","Lenacapavir is an injectable drug whose protection from one jab lasts six months.

Sonu Sood Questioned For Nearly Seven Hours By ED In Betting App PMLA Case

NEW DELHI: With some celebrities, including former cricketers and filmstars, not appearing despite summonses being issued to them in connection with alleged laundering of illegal proceeds of 1xBet online betting platform, ED is considering attaching properties of those linked to cases in which money trails have been established.ED is also likely to soon file a chargesheet in the case, wherein these celebrities may also be named as accused for endorsing illegal activities, sources said.On Sept 24, actor Sonu Sood had appeared before ED at its headquarters for questioning in connection with his alleged association with the 1xBet online betting syndicate. Earlier, cricketers Suresh Raina, Shikhar Dhawan, Robin Utthappa and Yuvraj Singh, and actor and ex-TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty had appeared before the agency and recorded their statements regarding fees received for endorsing illegal betting activities. Actor Urvashi Rautela, who missed the summons issued to her, has been asked to appear for questioning in the same case.The agency is probing the promoters and associates of 1xBet for illegally running a betting and gambling racket in the country and siphoning the proceeds of crime out of India. Attachment of assets in foreign countries is also likely where the agency has found trails of proceeds of crime. Earlier, in the case of Fairplay, another illegal betting app, the enforcement agency had attached assets worth over Rs 307 crore in Dubai, including land, villas and bank balances, linked to the accused.Fairplay was allegedly involved in illegal broadcast of cricket matches, besides online gambling.Among several FIRs registered against Fairplay, one by Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd in Mumbai accused the betting app of causing loss of revenue of more than Rs 100 crore by illegally broadcasting cricket matches.","ED likely to soon file a chargesheet in the case, wherein these celebrities may also be named as accused for endorsing illegal activities, sources said.

modifiable risk factors

NEW DELHI: The incidence of cancer in India has gone up by 26%, from 84.8 per 1 lakh population in 1990 to 107.2 in 2023, according to a new study. Published in The Lancet, it shows deaths due to cancer increased by 21% during this period, despite advances in treatment.In comparison, both incidence and mortality have declined significantly in US and China over the 33-year period. The reason behind this is strong tobacco control, universal vaccination and organised screening in these two countries, Dr Abhishek Shankar, radiation-oncologist at AIIMS Delhi, said.India, he added, continues to fare poorly on both counts because of persisting risk factors such as high use of tobacco, obesity and infections, coupled with limited access to early detection.Evidence-based strategies like HPV and Hepatitis-B vaccination, mammography, lung cancer screening with low-dose CT, and colonoscopy screening, and timely treatment remain uneven or inadequate.For India to reverse its trajectory, we must urgently strengthen risk prevention strategies, expand evidence-based screening programmes and integrate cancer care into its universal health coverage agenda,"" Shankar said.The study's lead author Dr Lisa Force from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, said, ""Cancer remains an important contributor to disease burden globally and our study highlights how it is anticipated to grow substantially over the coming decades, with disproportionate growth in countries with limited resources.""She added that despite the clear need for action, cancer control policies and implementation remain under-prioritised in global health, and there is insufficient funding to address this challenge in many settings.The study shows cancer incidence has declined by 19% and 20% in China and the US, respectively, between 1990 and 2023, while their mortality rates attributable to cancer has also seen a robust decline - 43% decline in mortality due to cancer in China and 33% in the US.The study estimates that 42% (4.3 million) of the estimated 10.4 million cancer deaths in 2023 were attributable to 44 potentially modifiable risk factors - presenting an opportunity for action.""Behavioural risk factors contributed to the most cancer deaths across all country income levels in 2023, especially tobacco use which contributed to 21% of cancer deaths globally. Tobacco was the leading risk factor in all country income levels except low-income countries, where the leading risk factor was unsafe sex (linked to 12.5% of all cancer deaths),"" the study said.A parliamentary committee report tabled in 2023 suggested raising taxes on tobacco products in India to make them less affordable.""Committee recommends the ministry (health) to pursue with the department of revenue to expedite the decision on raising taxes on tobacco products,"" it said.It also stressed upon the need to link the Population-Based Cancer Registry to Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission to get real time data on cancer patients.The mission is a key health initiative by the govt which aims at providing digital health IDs for all Indian citizens to help hospitals, insurance firms, and citizens access health records electronically when required.Most cancer cases in India are detected in late stages leading to poor prognosis.The parliamentary committee suggested that the issue of screening for cancer should be taken up at 'Jan Aandolan Pace', a mass movement to fight against cancer by timely screening.""A day in a month may be fixed for cancer screening on the lines of reproductive and child health,"" the parliamentary committee suggested.","The incidence of cancer in India has gone up by 26%, from 84.8 per 1 lakh population in 1990 to 107.2 in 2023.

Minor tracked target's movement for 15 days

NEW DELHI: It was an almost decade-long vendetta that led to the murder of 56-year-old property dealer Lakhpat Singh Kataria in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar, police said on Sunday. A father-son duo has been nabbed for the crime after a 48-hour manhunt aided by CCTV analysis, technical surveillance and human intelligence, cops said.The man arrested for Kataria's murder has criminal antecedents, special commissioner (law and order) Ravindra Yadav said. He had filed an FIR against Kataria in 2016 following a brawl that he claimed left him bedridden for nine months. The son was just nine at the time. They nurtured the grudge for nine long years and finally attacked Kataria last week.The suspect, 47, roped in his 17-year-old son for the murder, deliberately timing the act a day before the boy's 18th birthday so that he could benefit from juvenile laws.On the day of incident, the father-son duo first attacked the victim with a cricket bat and fired multiple shots at him inside Vijay Mandal Park, Malviya Nagar. Singh was declared brought dead at AIIMS.At the crime scene, cops found bloodstains scattered across the park, along with a broken cricket bat handle and the bat itself. A case under Sections 103 (murder) and 3(5) (common intention) of BNS)and Sections 25/27 of the Arms Act was registered at Malviya Nagar police station.Deputy commissioner of police (South) Ankit Chauhan said, ""Around 650 CCTV cameras across a 55km stretch were scrutinised to track the movements of the assailants, who had arrived on a black Hero Splendor with no number plate. ""The accused waited outside the park and chased the victim inside, where they murdered him. After the incident, they escaped towards Outer Delhi using multiple routes.The CCTV analysis, combined with call detail records (CDRs), pointed towards the involvement of a 47-year-old man residing in Auchandi village, Chauhan added. His mobile phone was switched off during the relevant period, further raising suspicion. Police teams then apprehended his minor son, who led them to his father.Police have seized the motorcycle used in the crime. The accused has four FIRs registered at Malviya Nagar police station between 2006 and 2016, involving charges of attempt to murder, assault, criminal intimidation, and extortion.During interrogation, the accused revealed that the motive stemmed from a violent clash in 2016. At the time, Lakhpat Singh and his associates had allegedly assaulted the accused over a property dispute. A case was then registered against Singh and his brother, while a cross-case was filed against the accused and his family.""He has disclosed that he instigated his 17-year-old son to join him in the plan, timing the execution a day before the boy's 18th birthday to exploit juvenile laws. The accused deputed his son to recce the victim's morning routine and then arranged a country-made pistol,"" DCP Chauhan added.The son had come to stay with a relative in the area about 15 days before the incident and closely tracked the victim's movements. He noted that Singh regularly went for morning walks in Vijay Mandal Park. On Sept 25, he shared this information with his father, and together they executed the plan next morning. On Sept 26, the duo, with faces covered, arrived on a motorcycle without a number plate and executed the murder.","Property dealer Lakhpat Singh Kataria, 56, was shot dead in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar.

NEW DELHI: The UAE remained the leading travel destination for Indian nationals in 2024, followed by Saudi Arabia, the US, Thailand, Singapore, the UK, Qatar, Canada, Kuwait and Oman. Together, these top 10 countries accounted for approximately 71.1% of all Indian Nationals' Departures (INDs) during the year.The data, part of the India Tourism Data Compendium 2025 released by the ministry of tourism, shows that overall, Indian nationals travelled abroad primarily for leisure and recreational purposes (42.5%), followed closely by visits related to the Indian diaspora (34.6%). Business and professional travel accounted for 14.9% of total departures, while pilgrimage (3.9%), education (2.4%) and other purposes (1.4%) comprised the remaining share.""INDs from India have shown a strong upward trend over the past three decades, rising from 1.9 million in 1991 to 30.8 million in 2024, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%,"" it is stated in the compendium.While the Covid-19 pandemic caused a decline of nearly 73% in travel in 2020, a strong recovery began as restrictions eased, with departures rising by 152.6% in 2022 and surpassing pre-pandemic levels in 2023, reaching 27.8 million - a 29% year-on-year increase.In 2024, India continued its upward trajectory, recording growth of 10.7% over the previous year.Higher disposable incomes, improved air connectivity and greater exposure to global destinations are among the factors that contributed to Indian nationals travelling abroad in greater numbers.The data on traveller profiles shows that in 2024, Indian nationals travelling abroad were predominantly from the working-age population, with the 25-34 age group accounting for the highest share (27.4%), followed closely by the 35-44 age group (24.5%). As far as gender distribution is concerned, while females accounted for 34.1% of travellers in 2024, males made up the remaining 65.8%.If one looks at the data on destination countries visited by Indian nationals for the years 2019, 2023 and 2024, all three years saw the UAE ranked first.

Understanding organizational restructuring, severance implications, and the economic drivers behind workforce decisions can help professionals navigate transitions more strategically. Resilience in uncertainty: Even in high-performing firms reporting revenue growth, such as Accenture, which posted a 7% year-on-year increase to $17.6 billion in the June-August quarter of fiscal 2025, job security is not guaranteed, making emotional resilience and strategic foresight critical for sustaining a long-term career.

Looking ahead

Global consulting giant Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across its offices worldwide in the past three months. The company cited slowing corporate demand and the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) as primary drivers of the workforce reduction. While the restructuring, valued at $865 million, aims to align the company with evolving client needs, it also signals a broader shift in the skills white-collar professionals will need to remain relevant.Accenture Chief Executive Officer Julie Sweet addressed analysts, explaining that the company is “exiting people on a compressed timeline where reskilling is not a viable path for the skills we need.” The statement underscores a growing reality in corporate environments: not all employees can be retrained fast enough to meet the demands of rapidly changing technology. Sweet emphasized that the company will prioritize workforce alignment with client demand for AI-driven solutions, a move that may result in further exits in the months ahead.At the end of August 2025, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. The layoffs , part of a continuing process expected to run until November 2025, reflect both operational restructuring and the financial imperative of managing severance costs.The company projects that the initiative will save over $1 billion, even as it seeks to retain core talent capable of delivering on AI-focused projects.Alongside workforce reductions, Accenture is investing in upskilling programs focused on agentic AI, a new class of tools designed to automate complex decision-making and operational tasks. Sweet noted that these programs are essential for meeting client expectations as businesses globally seek to reinvent operations with AI. For white-collar professionals, the implication is clear: developing proficiency in emerging AI technologies is no longer optional but increasingly central to career sustainability.While the Accenture layoffs are significant, they offer critical lessons for professionals navigating a transforming work environment:Accenture’s approach demonstrates a broader trend: the integration of AI into corporate strategy is reshaping not only business models but also the expectations placed on white-collar professionals. Those who embrace continuous learning, anticipate technological shifts, and develop highly relevant skills will find themselves better positioned in a rapidly evolving job market.The Accenture story serves as a reminder that career growth is increasingly tied to adaptability, specialized expertise, and proactive planning. For white-collar professionals, the lesson is unambiguous: the future belongs to those who prepare for it, not those who wait for it.","Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across its offices worldwide in the past three months.

Yes No

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes. This year, we decided to replicate the Durga Puja pandal made by Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Kolkata in 2022 on the theme of Vatican City,"" Yadav said.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal had expressed concern on Thursday on X, saying, ""This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion.

""","Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) alleged that the marquee was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: India’s cheetah reintroduction programme will notch a historic first on Monday when Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, becomes the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood- a crucial milestone in creating a self-sustaining population.“Mukhi, a female cub born to Namibian cheetah Jwala on March 29, 2023, will reach adulthood, as it will turn 915 days or 30 months old, on Monday, ready to contribute to increasing the cheetah population in India,” Project Cheetah director Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.Her survival is notable. “Of the four cubs Jwala delivered, three died due to extreme heat, but Mukhi survived and has grown well. Today our efforts have yielded encouraging results,” Sharma said.Project Cheetah began on September 17, 2022, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the release of eight Namibian cheetahs into a designated enclosure at Kuno—the world’s first inter-continental relocation of a large wild carnivore. Another 12 cheetahs arrived from South Africa in February 2023.India now hosts 27 cheetahs, of which 16 were born in the country. At Kuno, 26 cubs have been born since the project began, but 19 cheetahs—nine imported adults and 10 India-born cubs—have died so far, leaving 24 animals at Kuno and three at Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.Amid those losses, India today has seven more cheetahs than were initially imported, and Kuno’s cub survival rate stands above 61 per cent, exceeding the global average of 40 per cent.Officials call the progress a “big success” and are negotiating with African nations, including Botswana and Namibia, to bring in 8–10 more cheetahs by December to strengthen the gene pool.","Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, will become the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood.

""This Vijayadashami is special for another reason,"" he said. ""This day marks 100 years of the foundation of RSS. This journey of a century is as amazing and unprecedented as it is inspiring. When RSS was founded 100 years ago, the country had been bound by the chains of slavery for centuries. ""In his I-Day address, Modi had said for the past 100 years, RSS swayamsevaks (volunteers) have dedicated their lives to fulfilling the resolve of ""vyakti nirman"" (character development) and ""rashtra nirman"" (nation building) for the welfare of ""matrubhoomi"" (motherland).Centuries-long slavery had deeply hurt the country's self-respect and self-confidence, and the world's oldest civilisation was facing an identity crisis. ""Our countrymen were becoming victims of an inferiority complex,"" Modi said. ""Therefore, along with the country's independence, it was also important that the country be freed from intellectual slavery. In this context, the most revered Dr Hedgewar began to ponder over this issue.For this herculean task, he founded RSS on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami in 1925.""The PM further said, ""After Dr Saheb's passing, Param Poojya Guruji carried forward this great yagya of service to the nation. Param Poojya Guruji used to say, 'Rashtraya Swaha, Idam Rashtraya Idam Na Mam', meaning, 'This is not mine; this belongs to the nation'.""Modi noted that the resolve of RSS founders had inspired countrymen to rise above self-interest and embrace dedication to the nation. ""This statement by Guruji Golwalkar has shown millions of volunteers the path of sacrifice and service."" The PM said the spirit of sacrifice, service, and the discipline it inculcates among its members are the true strengths of Sangh. ""Today, RSS has been relentlessly and tirelessly engaged in national service for over a hundred years. ""He explained this is why RSS volunteers are the first to reach the area whenever a natural disaster strikes anywhere in the country. ""This spirit of 'nation first' always remains paramount in every action and every endeavour of millions of volunteers,"" Modi said and extended his wishes to RSS volunteers.Referring to the coming month, the PM highlighted that Oct 7 marks Maharishi Valmiki Jayanti. ""We all know how great a foundation Maharishi Valmiki laid for Indian culture. It was indeed Maharishi Valmiki who introduced us extensively to the Avatar Kathas of Bhagwan Ram. He presented humanity with the marvellous epic of the Ramayan.""Modi added that the influence of the Ramayan stems from the ideals and values of Bhagwan Ram enshrined in it. ""Bhagwan Ram embraced everyone with a spirit of service, harmony and compassion,"" the PM said.""That is why we feel that the Ram of Maharishi Valmiki's Ramayan is complete only with Mata Shabari and Nishadraj,"" he said, highlighting the significance of the two Ramayan characters, who hailed from marginalised communities.""That is why, friends, when the Ram temple was erected in Ayodhya, a temple dedicated to Nishadraj and Maharishi Valmiki was also built alongside it,"" Modi said and urged those visiting Ayodhya to see Ram Lalla, and the Maharishi Valmiki and Nishadraj temples.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi hails RSS for an ""unprecedented and inspiring"" journey.

Addressing a Charmakar Seva Sangh scholarship event where 505 students were felicitated, Gadkari said: ""Crores of people paid their respects during Garg's final journey because he was talented, not because he had other privileges.

NEW DELHI: Significant to Bihar ahead of the assembly elections, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said govt would work for the inclusion of Chhath Puja , the state’s biggest festival, in Unesco’s list of cultural heritage.“Our festivals keep India’s culture alive. Chhath Puja is one such sacred festival that comes right after Diwali. Dedicated to the Sun God, this great festival is very special.

He pointed out that Kolkata's Durga Puja had earlier received a similar recognition, reinforcing the possibility of Chhath securing global acknowledgment.During his campaign for Bihar's last assembly poll, Modi had highlighted his scheme of free distribution of foodgrains, saying it ensured that women in Bihar celebrated Chhath.Looking ahead to the festive season, Modi urged citizens to prioritise local products. ""If we give our cultural celebrations global recognition, the world will know them, understand them and come forward to participate. At the same time, I appeal to people to buy local products. This not only boosts traditional industries but directly benefits the families making them, thereby strengthening economy from the grassroots. ""By foregrounding Chhath - an occasion particularly significant in Bihar and the east - Modi sought to underline cultural pride and govt's effort to elevate regional traditions to global platforms.

Rs 355 crore sale marks new high for Indian art market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-355-crore-sale-marks-new-high-for-indian-art-market/articleshow/124200368.cms,"Vasudeo Gaitonde was a man who pursued perfection. He could spend months on a single canvas, only to destroy it if it failed his exacting standards. In his lifetime, his sublime abstractions-with their play of light and colour -were often overshadowed in a market enamoured of the decorative aesthetic of figurative art. Little could he have imagined that decades later, these same works would command millions in the auction room.On Saturday, a luminous yellow ochre canvas by the reclusive painter, who died in 2001, set a new world record for the artist at Saffronart's 25th anniversary sale in Delhi. The work sold for Rs 67.08 crore ($7.6 million), not only eclipsing his previous benchmark of Rs 42 crore but also making him the second priciest artist in India.The top slot still belongs to his fellow modernist M F Husain whose Gram Yatra sold for over Rs 100 crore earlier this year.The sale itself set a new benchmark. With total proceeds of Rs 355.8 crore ($40.2 million), it became the highest-value auction of South Asian art worldwide-a resounding signal of the Indian market's resilience even as global art sales waver. ""Indians are now seeing generational value in Indian art,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart's CEO.""For the wealthy, it's not just about diversification alongside real estate, equity, and gold. There's also social pressure-you can't have a big home and bad art.""Several other artists set new records that night. Tyeb Mehta's Trussed Bull (1956) fetched Rs 56 crore, eight times its upper estimate. Jehangir Sabavala's The Anchorite (1983) sold for Rs 16.8 crore while F N Souza's Six Gentlemen of Our Times (1955) brought in Rs 20 crore, a global auction record for a South Asian work on paper.The evening also saw a breakthrough for contemporary art. Nalini Malani's Nursery Tales sold for Rs 3.6 crore, underscoring how young collectors are increasingly drawn to politically and socially charged work. Malani, whose practice has long been unapologetically feminist and political, transforms the whimsy of nursery rhymes into allegories of violence and resistance.Her presence in international museums is well established; now the auction house too is a stage where her narratives command attention. Her success at Saffronart signals that as prices for the modernists soar, buyers are turning to contemporary voices that better match both their pockets and their sensibilities.","Vasudeo Gaitonde's painting sets a new world record for the artist at Saffronart's 25th anniversary sale in Delhi.

However, this requirement has not been proposed for electric two- and three-wheelers, as well as e-rickshaws, which too produce no noise.The draft notification states that all new models of electric passenger and goods vehicles manufactured after Oct 2026 must be equipped with AVAS, and all existing models produced from Oct 2027 onward must have the feature.TOI had reported on July 5 the govt’s move to introduce this regulation requiring vehicle manufacturers to install an electronic system that automatically produces sound when these electric vehicles are moving at speeds of up to 20 kmph. Since such vehicles produce almost no noise, they are categorised as Quiet Road Transport Vehicles (QRTVs).The AVAS is primarily designed for electric and hybrid vehicles to emit artificial sounds to alert pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users to their presence, especially at low speeds when these vehicles are very quiet.“There is a dire need to mandate this feature in electric two- and three-wheelers too.We see more instances of pedestrians being hit by two-wheelers, and since these make no noise, the risk of accidents is greater,” said Anil Chhikara, a former deputy transport commissioner of Delhi.The AVAS will not be required for higher speeds when tyres of EVs generate sufficient noise.Sources said the ministry’s notification also proposes to do away with the requirement to carry a spare tyre for cars, three-wheelers, and quadricycles that have tubeless tyres.","From Oct 2027 all electric cars, buses, and trucks will be required to have an Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System.

Leh Protests: DGP Explains Wangchuk Arrest, Pakistan Connection Under Scanner

Police cite foreign links, wife counters

'Peaceful protest escalated due to CRPF action '

Defence against financial charges

Call for 'mindful development'

NEW DELHI: Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife, Gitanjali Angmo, dismissed allegations of Pakistan links and financial irregularities against him, insisting that he has always advocated in the “most Gandhian way possible. ”Wangchuk, a prominent face of the five-year-long agitation for Ladakh’s statehood and inclusion under the Sixth Schedule, was detained under the National Security Act (NSA) on Friday. His arrest came two days after violent protests in Leh on September 24 left four dead and 90 injured. He has since been lodged in Jodhpur prison in Rajasthan.Speaking to news agency PTI over the phone, Angmo, co-founder of the Himalayan Institute of Alternative Learning (HIAL), said she has not been able to contact her husband since his detention. “They promised to send [the detention order] on Friday. We will take legal recourse,” she said.Ladakh DGP SD Singh Jamwal said Wangchuk is being investigated for alleged links with Pakistan following the arrest of a Pakistani Intelligence Operative last month, who reportedly circulated videos of his protests. The police also flagged Wangchuk’s “suspicious” overseas trips, including a visit to Pakistan to attend an event organised by The Dawn.Angmo, however, said their recent visit across the border was purely professional and focused on climate issues. “We attended a conference organised by the United Nations, and it was on climate change. The glacier on the top of the Himalayas is not going to see whether I'm flowing into Pakistan or India,” she said.She added that the ‘Breathe Pakistan’ conference in February was hosted by the UN Pakistan and Dawn Media, with international participation. “There are organisations like the ICIMOD, which bring together all the eight Hindu Kush countries and work on different issues. We are part of the ICIMOD’s Himalayan University Consortium,” she explained.Angmo also pointed out that Wangchuk had praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the event. “The Nepal and Bangladesh reference being bandied around is actually an example Sonam gave, i.e., ‘when governments are not responsive, it leads to a revolution’. We should avoid the interpretations,” she said.Angmo strongly contested the NSA charges, arguing that Wangchuk has a long track record of peaceful protests. “I think it is a very wrong charge. Sonam certainly is not a threat to any public order,” she said.She insisted that the Leh Apex Body protest was peaceful until security forces intervened. “We have videos to show that the students and the youth were just there for a peaceful protest. Sonam did not even know about (a non-peaceful plan)… But when the CRPF personnel fired tear gas shells, the youth reacted by pelting stones, and the whole situation escalated.”Questioning the force’s response, she asked: “My question is, who gave the CRPF the right to open fire? Why should you open fire on your own people, on your own youth?”On allegations that Wangchuk delivered a provocative speech, she said his words were mistranslated. “He just said that ‘when change has to happen, it can start with one individual, or with the death of one individual and that individual could be me; I'm happy to give my life for it’,” Angmo explained.Angmo also rejected allegations of financial irregularities involving Wangchuk’s institutions, presenting details on HIAL’s funding, UGC registration, and land allotment.She said HIAL did not receive foreign donations without FCRA clearance, clarifying that payments were made for services. “We have the service agreements, which say this is a consulting assignment that we're giving to HIAL for which we will be paying them,” she said.According to her, HIAL, where 400 students study free of cost, covers expenses through innovations such as ice stupas and passive solar buildings, and does not patent its technologies. She added that the institute applied for UGC registration in 2022 and deposited ₹15 lakh, but the process has been stalled.Angmo said the lease for HIAL’s land remains unresolved due to the UT administration’s lack of a category for such institutions. “While questions are being raised on HIAL, the Sindhu Central University, which started in 2021, still doesn't have a building,” she noted.Angmo stressed that her husband is not against development, but supports giving Ladakhis a say in shaping it under the Sixth Schedule. She highlighted HIAL’s proposal to use translucent solar panels in Changtang to both generate electricity and grow fodder for Pashmina goats.“This kind of mindful development is what he’s talking about... HIAL is at the forefront of innovation. It is not that he’s anti-development,” she said.Meanwhile, the Union home ministry has cancelled the FCRA licence of the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL), an organisation founded by Wangchuk, citing alleged financial discrepancies.",Sonam Wangchuk was detained under the National Security Act (NSA) on Friday.

BJP, Congress Clash After Rahul Gandhi’s Jibe at PM Modi Over H-1B Fee Hike

The Congress party on Sunday wrote to home minister Amit Shah, raising concerns over a death threat issued against leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi during a televised debate. Congress leader KC Venugopal shared the letter he sent to Amit Shah, after Pintu Mahadev, spokesperson of Kerala BJP, reportedly said that “Rahul Gandhi will be shot in the chest.”Venugopal wrote on X: ""Disagreements in the political arena must be solved politically, within the constitutional framework. BJP leaders, however, are giving death threats to their political opponents on live TV. Surely, RahulGandhi ji’s vehement fight against the RSS-BJP ideology has rattled them.""Calling the threat “cold, calculated and chilling”, the party demanded urgent action. It said, ""This is neither a slip of the tongue, nor careless hyperbole. It is a cold, calculated and chilling death threat against the leader of the opposition and one of India's foremost political leaders.""The letter also pointed to multiple previous threats against Rahul Gandhi on social media, some linked to the BJP, and mentioned the assassination of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.The party called the threat a ""careless outburst of a petty functionary, symptomatic of a deliberately cultivated, toxic atmosphere of hate that renders the Lop vulnerable to mindless violence.""It urged the home minister to act immediately and decisively, warning that failure to do so would amount to “a de facto licence” for legitimising violence against Rahul Gandhi.""Any failure by you to act swiftly, decisively and publicly will be judged as complicity a de facto licence for the legitimisation and normalisation of violence against the leader of the opposition and a grave breach of your oath as Union home minister,"" it said.Also read: 'Stop the killing': Rahul Gandhi says 'Ladakh under attack by RSS, BJP'; pitches for 6th Schedule The letter added that millions of Indians regard Rahul Gandhi as a champion of rights and pluralistic values, emphasizing that a death threat against him amounts to an assault on democracy itself, not merely on one individual.","Congress leader KC Venugopal shared the letter he sent to Amit Shah, after Pintu Mahadev, spokesperson of Kerala BJP, reportedly said that “Rahul Gandhi will be shot in the chest” The party called the threat “cold, calculated and chilling”, the party demanded urgent action.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124196454,imgsize-38458,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-2025-09-28t203851508.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"".

Team India celebrates the Asia Cup win on the podium without the trophy.

The Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan ended in ugly drama on Sunday night in Dubai, after Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and ACC president Mohsin Naqvi allegedly walked away with the winners’ trophy, leaving the presentation ceremony in complete disarray.India, who defeated Pakistan by five wickets to clinch a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, flatly refused to accept the silverware from Naqvi. The players stood firm at a distance from the stage, reportedly informing the organisers that they would not participate in the presentation if the PCB chief attempted to hand over the trophy.The standoff brought the ceremony to a grinding halt. As Naqvi waited awkwardly on the dais, Indian fans inside the stadium booed loudly, chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”, making the atmosphere even more hostile. It was quite apparent that Naqvi didn’t want to see India getting photographed with the trophy, with organisers eventually whisking it away into the dressing room after prolonged delays.Sources revealed that the Indian team had already informed the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that Naqvi, also Pakistan’s interior minister, was an unacceptable figure to present the cup. The refusal followed a series of frosty exchanges during the tournament — from no handshakes between players, to the absence of the traditional pre-toss photoshoot.An ACC source further revealed that the Indian team made it clear they didn’t want Naqvi on the podium.In another twist, the Pakistan players remained inside their dressing room for nearly an hour after the match, leaving Naqvi stranded on stage. When skipper Salman Agha and his team eventually emerged, they were greeted by deafening chants of “Indiaaaa, Indiaaaa” from the crowd.On the field, however, India’s win was emphatic. Tilak Varma anchored the chase with an unbeaten 69 off 53 balls, adding a crucial 60-run stand with Shivam Dube (33). Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav’s 4-30 dismantled Pakistan’s middle order, restricting them to 146 after a promising start from Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46).While India celebrated yet another continental crown, the night will be remembered as much for the cricket as for the chaotic and unprecedented trophy fiasco that followed.","India defeated Pakistan by five wickets to clinch a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Live Score:

NEW DELHI: Another storm brewed at the Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, as Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf found themselves at the centre of a fresh controversy.Moments before the blockbuster clash got underway, both teams lined up for the national anthem s. Pakistan’s anthem played first, followed by India’s. While players from both sides stood in attention as per protocol, cameras captured Shaheen and Haris casually chatting during India’s national anthem — a gesture that quickly went viral and was widely slammed as “disrespectful.”The incident has only fuelled tensions in what was already a high-voltage summit clash. It came on the heels of another flashpoint: India skipper Suryakumar Yadav sticking to the “No Handshake” policy against Pakistan.At the toss, Suryakumar shook hands with broadcaster Ravi Shastri but pointedly ignored former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis. Just like in the group stage and Super Four encounters earlier in the tournament, he also skipped the customary handshake with Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha.Adding further intrigue, the toss itself was conducted in an unusual manner, with Shastri interviewing the Indian captain and Waqar handling Pakistan’s leader — a rare arrangement in world cricket.To make things worse, the Pakistan skipper also claimed that Suryakumar had shaken hands with him not once, but twice in private before the handshake snubs started on-camera.For India, the evening also began with a massive setback as skipper Suryakumar confirmed at the toss that star all-rounder Hardik Pandya was ruled out due to a niggle. The absence of Pandya, who has a proven record in big matches against Pakistan, leaves a significant void in India’s line-up.With controversies over handshakes, anthem etiquette, and team selection overshadowing the pre-match proceedings, the stage was set for an emotionally charged finale.In the end, it was India that came out on top after a tense affair in Dubai. After Pakistan were skittled out for a 146-run total, India too, had to overcome early challenges. After being reduced to 20/3 inside the powerplay, the Suryakumar-led side rode on the back of a sensational batting display from Tilak Varma (69* from 53 balls) and a solid partnership with Shivam Dube (33 from 22 balls) to clinch the trophy. In the end, it was Rinku Singh, who faced his first-ever ball of this tournament, who scored the winning runs with a four in the fourth delivery of the final over.",Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf found themselves at the centre of a fresh controversy during the national anthem. The incident has only fuelled tensions in what was already a high-voltage summit clash.

Rookie quarterback faces controversy just days before his first NFL start

A chance for Jaxson Dart to make history against the Chargers’ defense

Jaxson Dart’s NFL journey is off to a dramatic start. Just days before making his debut for the New York Giants, the 22-year-old quarterback found himself caught in the middle of a viral controversy involving a fake Instagram post linking him to pop star Madison Beer, who is rumored to be dating Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert Jaxson Dart hasn’t even taken his first official snap for the New York Giants, but the rookie quarterback is already at the center of controversy. Ahead of his debut against the undefeated Los Angeles Chargers, Dart’s name was linked to a digitally altered Instagram post that appeared to show him connected to Madison Beer — pop star and rumored partner of Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert.The image spread rapidly online, racking up nearly four million views before being debunked. While completely fabricated, the viral post fueled unnecessary drama around Dart’s first professional start, turning what should have been a straightforward quarterback storyline into an off-field distraction.Head coach Brian Daboll made the bold decision to bench Russell Wilson after an 0-3 start, handing the keys of the offense to 22-year-old Dart. The move marks a fresh chapter for the Giants, who have been searching for stability at quarterback since Eli Manning’s retirement.Justin Herbert, meanwhile, has guided the Chargers to a 3-0 start. His undefeated record combined with his rumored relationship with Beer has only heightened the intrigue surrounding this Week 4 showdown. Reports of Herbert attending Beer’s concert and later appearing alongside her in Brazil earlier this month gave the romance speculation more traction, adding to the media spotlight on his personal life.For Jaxson Dart, Sunday’s debut carries more than just personal significance. If the Giants manage to upset the 3-0 Chargers, he would become the first quarterback in 23 years to defeat an undefeated team in his very first NFL start.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded India’s thrilling Asia Cup 2025 triumph over Pakistan with a striking message on X, writing: “#OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same – India wins! Congrats to our cricketers.”The post quickly went viral, framing the victory as not just a cricketing milestone but also a symbolic triumph in a tense rivalry.This Asia Cup marked the first cricketing encounter between India and Pakistan since the Pahalgam attack and the subsequent Operation Sindoor.The arch-rivals clashed three times in the tournament, and on each occasion, India emerged victorious.On this occasion, Union Home Minister Amit Shah wrote, ""A phenomenal victory. The fierce energy of our boys blew up the rivals again.""External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar wrote, ""Congrats to Team India on winning the Asia Cup. New India delivers.""Reacting to the victory, ICC chairman Jay Shah also congratulated India, penning, ""Congratulations to Team India on lifting the Asia Cup 2025! A proud moment for Indian cricket as Team India showcases excellence, consistency, and character on the biggest stage.Kudos to the players and support staff for a stellar campaign.""On Sunday, Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 69 was the cornerstone of India’s five-wicket win in Dubai, securing a record-extending ninth Asia Cup crown.Chasing 147, India endured early jolts at 20/3 and later 77/4, but the 21-year-old left-hander displayed poise well beyond his years.With three fours and four sixes, he anchored the innings, forging a crucial 60-run partnership with Shivam Dube (33).The final over held its share of drama.India needed 10 runs from six balls after Dube’s dismissal, but Varma swung momentum back with a towering six before Rinku Singh finished the job with a boundary, sparking joyous celebrations in a stadium dominated by Indian supporters.Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav’s spin heroics (4/30) turned the contest in India’s favour.Pakistan had raced to 84 without loss, thanks to Sahibzada Farhan’s 57 and Fakhar Zaman’s 46.Yet their promising platform crumbled as they lost nine wickets for just 33 runs, eventually bowled out for 146 in 19.1 overs. Kuldeep’s 17th-over burst, three wickets in four balls, including skipper Salman Agha, was the decisive strike.The rivalry’s political undertones loomed large. There were no handshakes at the toss or after the match, echoing tensions between the neighbours. Jasprit Bumrah even mirrored Haris Rauf’s earlier gesture to the crowd after bowling him out, adding another fiery subplot to the clash.India’s third win over Pakistan in this tournament not only reaffirmed their dominance but also served as a dress rehearsal ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup.For fans, though, the moment was captured in Modi’s words and Varma’s calm finish — #OperationSindoor had played out on the cricket field, and India had triumphed again.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded India's thrilling Asia Cup 2025 triumph over Pakistan with a striking message on X.

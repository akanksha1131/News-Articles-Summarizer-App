NEW DELHI: Asserting that India needs to demonstrate leadership on the issue of Palestine, Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Thursday slammed the Modi government's stance, saying its response has been characterised by a ""profound silence"" and an abdication of both humanity and morality.She said the government's actions appear to be driven primarily by the personal friendship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and rather than India's constitutional values or its strategic interests.""This style of personalised diplomacy is never tenable and cannot be the guiding compass of India's foreign policy. Attempts to do the same in other parts of the world, most notably in the United States , have come undone in the most painful and humiliating ways in recent months,"" Gandhi said in her article published in The Hindu.This is the third article by Gandhi on the Israel-Palestine conflict, published in a national daily in the recent past, in which she has vehemently criticised the Modi government's stance on the issue.India's standing on the world stage cannot be wrapped up into the personal glory-seeking ways of one individual, nor can it rest on its historical laurels. It demands persistent courage and a sense of historical continuity, she said in her article titled 'India's muted voice, its detachment with Palestine'.Gandhi pointed out that France has joined the United Kingdom, Canada, Portugal and Australia in recognising Palestinian statehood -- ""the first step in the fulfilment of the legitimate aspirations of the long-suffering Palestinian people"".More than 150 of the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations have now done so, she said.Gandhi underlined that India had been a leader in this regard having formally recognised Palestinian statehood way back on November 18, 1988, after years of support to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).She cited the examples of how India raised the issue of Apartheid South Africa even before Independence and during the Algerian struggle for independence (1954-62), India was one of the strongest voices for an independent Algeria.In 1971, India intervened firmly to prevent genocide in what was then East Pakistan, midwifing the birth of modern-day Bangladesh, she pointed out.On the critical and sensitive issue of Israel-Palestine as well, India has long maintained a delicate but principled position, emphasising its commitment to peace and the protection of human rights, the former Congress chief said.India needs to demonstrate leadership on the issue of Palestine, which is now a battle for justice, identity, dignity and human rights, Gandhi asserted.In the last two years, since the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Palestine in October 2023, India has all but relinquished its role, she opined.""The brutal and inhumane Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, 2023, were followed by an Israeli response that has been nothing less than genocidal. As I have previously raised, more than 55,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed, including 17,000 children,"" she said.The residential, schooling and health infrastructure of the Gaza Strip has been obliterated, as have agriculture and industry, Gandhi said.""Gazans have been forced into a famine-like situation, with the Israeli military cruelly obstructing the delivery of much-needed food, medicine, and other aid -- a 'drip-feeding' of aid amidst an ocean of desperation,"" she said.In one of the most revolting acts of inhumanity, hundreds of civilians have been shot down while trying to access food, she pointed out.Gandhi opined that the world has been slow to respond, implicitly legitimising the Israeli actions.The recent moves by several countries to recognise Palestine as a sovereign state are a welcome and long-due departure from the policy of inaction, she said.""This is a historical moment and an assertion of the principles of justice, self-determination and human rights. These steps are not merely diplomatic gestures; they are affirmations of the moral responsibility that nations bear in the face of prolonged injustice.It is a reminder that in the modern world, silence is not neutrality, it is complicity,"" she said.And here, India's voice, once so unwavering in the cause of freedom and human dignity, has remained ""conspicuously muted"", Gandhi said, hitting out at the Modi government.Meanwhile, it is appalling that just two weeks ago, India not only signed a bilateral investment agreement with Israel, in New Delhi, but also hosted its highly controversial far-right finance minister who has invited global condemnation for his repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, she said.Gandhi argued that India must not approach the issue of Palestine as merely a matter of foreign policy but as a test of India's ethical and civilisational heritage.The people of Palestine have endured decades of displacement, prolonged occupation, settlement expansion, restrictions on movement and repeated assaults on their civil, political and human rights, she said.Their plight echoes the struggles that India faced during the colonial era -- a people deprived of their sovereignty, denied a nationhood, exploited for their resources, and stripped of all rights and security.""We owe Palestine a sense of historical empathy in its quest for dignity, and we also owe Palestine the courage to translate that empathy into principled action,"" she said.","Sonia Gandhi says India needs to demonstrate leadership on the issue of Palestine. She says its response has been characterised by a ""profound silence"" and an abdication of both humanity and morality. This is the third article by Gandhi on the Israel-Palestine conflict.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124104383,imgsize-636647,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday successfully conducted a test launch of the intermediate-range Agni-Prime missile from a rail-based mobile launcher system. This marks the first time such a launch has been carried out using a specially designed platform integrated with the national railway network.Defence minister Rajnath Singh confirmed the successful test in a statement on X, calling it a ""first-of-its-kind launch"" that demonstrates India’s growing strategic deterrence capabilities.“The first-of-its-kind launch carried out today from a specially designed rail-based Mobile Launcher has the capability to move on the Rail network without any preconditions, which allows users to have cross-country mobility and launch within a short reaction time with reduced visibility,” he said.""Congratulations to DRDO , Strategic Forces Command (SFC) and the Armed Forces on the successful test of the Intermediate Range Agni-Prime missile. This successful flight test has put India in the group of select nations having capabilities that have developed a canisterised launch system from a mobile rail network,"" the post added.The Agni-Prime, a next-generation ballistic missile is capable of striking targets at ranges of up to 2,000 kilometers.The test follows the successful launch of the missile in August at Chandipur, Odisha.In March 2024, a trial of Agni-5 was conducted under ‘Mission Divyastra’, showcasing MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) capability.A MIRV-equipped missile can carry 3–4 nuclear warheads, each aimed at different targets. Currently, the SFC, formed in 2003, operates only single-warhead missiles. The solid-fuelled, three-stage Agni-5 is canister-launched, allowing rapid deployment.","The Agni-Prime, a next-generation ballistic missile is capable of striking targets at ranges of up to 2,000 kilometers.

The Asean bloc, after a rather lackluster round of AITIGA (Asean India Trade in Goods Agreement) review in Delhi last month, has offered a new package that will create a ""landing zone"" for India to address the widening trade imbalance concerns. India's trade deficit with Asean stood at approximately $43.57 billion in FY 2022-23.Talking to TOI, Mastura Ahmad Mustafa, deputy secretary general (trade), ministry of investment, trade and industry, Malaysia, said, ""We convened special AEM (Asean Economic Ministers) meetings subsequent to our discussions at the Delhi AITIGA review, to reach key decisions that will help us achieve a substantial conclusion of the review process before this year ends. We have offered a new package to India, a landing zone, which will provide a constructive basis to progress our talks.

Portuguese-era case resolved by Supreme Court 78 yrs after Independence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/portuguese-era-case-resolved-by-supreme-court-78-yrs-after-independence/articleshow/124102488.cms,"NEW DELHI: After half a century and several rounds of litigation, Supreme Court approved on Wednesday an April 30, 1974, decision of the collector of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to rescind the erstwhile Portuguese govt’s grant of possession rights over land to Indians for cultivation.What rankled a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N K Singh was that even after 78 years of Independence the highest court is engaged in resolving disputes relating to rights conferred by colonial powers, which exploited India’s wealth and resources.Dadra and Nagar Haveli was liberated from Portuguese occupation in 1954 and was integrated with India in 1961 as a Union Territory.Certain persons were granted inheritable possession rights over vast tracts of land in Dadra and Nagar Haveli by Portuguese govt for an indefinite period, subject to payment of annual rent. Over a century, these landowners’ progeny have divided these lands between them.Indian govt in 1969 rescinded the lands allotted by Portuguese govt and reverted these to administration. These were challenged before Bombay HC.During pendency, D&N Land Reforms Regulation, 1971, was brought in, which stipulated that land allotted by Portuguese govt to persons should have been cultivated regularly.The collector found the land uncultivated and took back the land by an order of April 30, 1974.This was challenged in the trial court by heirs of people who were given possession of land. Trial court quashed the collector’s order in June 1978.Govt appealed against this in HC, which ruled that a 1963 ruling of Lisbon court on rights of such allottees cannot serve as a precedent for Indian courts and govt, in exercise of its sovereign powers, can exercise its powers to resume land allotted by an erstwhile colonial govt.Dismissing appeals against the hcourt’s decision and writing a 79-page judgment, Justice Kant said, “The appellants’ pleas of waiver, acquiescence, delay, impossibility, and condonation have no legal or factual basis, and none of these principles render the Collector’s order, dated April 30, 1974, unsustainable.”“The Collector’s order was not tainted by mala fides and cannot be construed as having been passed with the intent to disentitle the appellants from the statutory benefits under the 1971 Land Reforms Regulation,” the bench said.","Dadra and Nagar Haveli was liberated from Portuguese occupation in 1954.

In a sweeping immigration update, the United Arab Emirates has reportedly halted the issuance of tourist and work visas temporarily for citizens of nine countries spanning Africa and Asia. Though no official confirmation has been publicly released, an internal immigration circular signals a significant policy shift — one with far-reaching economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian consequences. The 2026 UAE visa ban reflects evolving concerns over security, health, and migration governance.According to a confidential immigration circular accessed by multiple outlets, the UAE has imposed a temporary suspension on new visa applications from the following countries:Citizens of these nine nations are barred from applying for both tourist visas and work permits in the UAE as of 2026. The policy remains in effect until further notice, with no announced timeline for reassessment or reversal.It's important to emphasize that this is a visa ban, not a comprehensive travel ban. Nationals of the listed countries who already hold valid UAE visas are not affected and can continue residing or working without issue in the UAE legally.While the UAE government has not released an official explanation, sources and analysts have pointed to several contributing factors behind this decision:The most cited rationale in unofficial reports is national security. The UAE has previously enacted similar measures in response to concerns about:The suspension is described by insiders as a preventive measure to shield the country from potential risks associated with fraudulent or unverified entries.Tense or complex bilateral relations between the UAE and some of the affected nations may also be influencing the visa policy. Past instances suggest that immigration policies are sometimes used to manage or reflect broader diplomatic positions.Residual COVID-19 protocols appear to remain part of the UAE’s visa review process. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in cross-border health management. Analysts point to concerns over:These health considerations may continue to shape immigration policy well into the post-pandemic era.The visa freeze also closely aligns with broader efforts to streamline documentation, improve identity verification measures, and fully digitize the visa process. The UAE is reportedly working diligently to overhaul its immigration systems to significantly reduce paperwork inconsistencies and identity fraud.The UAE’s visa ban has triggered a chain reaction across multiple sectors:Though indefinite, the UAE visa ban is not permanent. Once lifted, nationals from the listed countries will regain access to the UAE visa application process via:The standard visa requirements will then apply, including:Authorities and businesses across affected countries are awaiting further clarification from the UAE.

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

MUMBAI: A private jet carrying passengers from Ahmedabad quietly scripted aviation history this weekend, becoming the first aircraft to officially land at the long-awaited Navi Mumbai airport.The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day, completing the first-ever runway operation at the greenfield airport.Though an IndiGo Airbus 320 aircraft landed on the Navi Mumbai main runway 26 in Dec 2024, it was a validation flight mandated to test the airport's navigation systems.Prior to this, a symbolic touchdown took place in October, when an IAF Airbus C-295, a tactical airlifter, touched down on the main runway without using the airport's ground-based navigation aids.""The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on September 19 granted approval for the landing of a non-scheduled aircraft, marked 'passengers flight' at Navi Mumbai,"" said a source.To accommodate this arrival and departure, AAI cancelled its earlier notice (NOTAM to pilots, airlines) about Navi Mumbai runway's closure till 11:59pm, Sept 20.A new NOTAM was issued on Friday, which announced that the Navi Mumbai airport runway was open from 8:30am to 11am on Saturday and another three hours on Sunday.The private jet, a Pilatus PC-24 (VT-APV), took off from Ahmedabad at 9am to head south, overfly the Gulf of Khambhat, and then the Arabian Sea, from where it turned east to cross into Mumbai over Bandra and Sion, flying south of the busy city airport.It came south of the new Navi Mumbai airport, from where it turned north and then west to carry out an approach on runway 28 and land at 10:20 am. It departed Navi Mumbai airport at 12:40am on Sunday and took the land route to Ahmedabad.Over the weekend, the flight also landed on X, with @hiravaero posting a clip of the landing captured by Sandeep Pilania, a plane spotter. Industry experts pointed out that the new Navi Mumbai airport has other firsts still to come. The most awaited among these will be the first scheduled commercial airline flight.While PM Modi is set to inaugurate the airport and its terminal building on September 30, the commissioning of the airport, after the security sweeping and other procedures, is likely to take a few more months.But the landing or take-off of the first airline flight carrying fare-paying passengers will be the most significant milestone, as it would signal the start of a major capacity boost for Mumbai's overstretched airport infrastructure.","The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day.

India–Canada Relations Set For Reset; Modi And Carney Seek To Mend Broken Ties | G7 Summit

NEW DELHI: After PM Narendra Modi’s meeting with counterpart Mark Carney in June this year, India and Canada seem set take another decisive step forward to normalise the relationship in the form of a likely visit next month to New Delhi by Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand.This will be the first bilateral visit by the foreign minister of either country since ties nosedived in 2023, following claims by Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau that the Indian government had a role in the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. Both sides remain in touch to finalise the dates for the visit in October.The breakthrough in Modi-Carney meeting on the margins of the G7 summit in Canada led to the return of the high commissioners to each other’s capital earlier this month. High-level bilateral exchanges also seem to have resumed with Canadian National Security and Intelligence Adviser (NSIA) Nathalie Drouin and deputy foreign minister David Morrison visiting India in September.India and Canada have appointed veteran diplomats, Dinesh Patnaik and Christopher Cooter respectively, as high commissioners. According to Anand, Canada backs step-by-step approach to deepening diplomatic engagement and advancing bilateral cooperation with India.India is seeking a constructive and balanced relationship based on respect for each other’s concerns and sensitivities.India’s foreign ministry and Global Affairs Canada in talks last week reaffirmed the importance of India–Canada ties, anchored in “shared democratic values, respect for the rule of law, and commitment to the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity”. They also agreed to resume bilateral dialogue across key sectors like trade, defence, energy, civil nuclear, security, law enforcement and critical minerals. Amid global uncertainties that have been exacerbated by the US tariff policy, both sides seem keen to expand their economic partnership and build upon people-to-people contacts.Significantly, India and Canada have also agreed to address the shortage of diplomatic staff at their respective missions that resulted from expulsion of diplomats by both sides amid rising tensions last year over Nijjar’s murder. This is important for restoring diplomatic services in both countries for ordinary citizens, students and businesses. In Drouin’s meeting with counterpart Ajit Doval, according to an Indian readout, both sides had acknowledged the “clear momentum” for rebuilding trust and expanding cooperation at the highest levels of political leadership.",India and Canada seem set take another decisive step forward to normalise the relationship in the form of a likely visit next month to New Delhi by Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand.

Ladakh violence: Government blames Wangchuk for provoking mob; says police fired in self-defence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-on-ladakh-violence-guided-by-activist-sonam-wangchuk-through-provocative-statements/articleshow/124096379.cms,"Sonam Wangchuk (PTI file photo)

Poll Do you believe Sonam Wangchuk's actions are responsible for the violence in Ladakh? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The Union government on Wednesday said activist Sonam Wangchuk was responsible for the ongoing violence in Ladakh.“It is clear that mob violence in Ladakh was guided by activist Sonam Wangchuk through his provocative statements,” the government said in a statement.The Centre said Wangchuk's hunger strike continued despite ongoing talks through a High-Powered Committee that had delivered key concessions.""A hunger strike was started by Sonam Wangchuk on 10-09-2025 stating the demand of 6 schedule and statehood for Ladakh. It is well known that Government of India has been actively engaged with Apex Body Leh and the Kargil Democratic Alliance on same issues,"" it said.It further alleged that his provocative speeches incited a mob on 24 September, injuring over 30 security personnel and forcing police to fire, which caused casualties. The government said it remained committed to Ladakh’s aspirations.The statement came after Wangchuk defended Congress against Amit Malviya’s charge that the party was behind the violence in Ladakh. Wangchuk said, “Congress doesn’t have that kind of influence here to get 5,000 youth out on the roads. Yesterday, a Congress councillor went to a hospital in anger because two people from his village were brought there injured.”In a post on X, BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya asked whether Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wanted this kind of unrest in Ladakh. ""This man rioting in Ladakh is Phuntsog Stanzin Tsepag, Congress Councillor for Upper Leh Ward. He can be clearly seen instigating the mob and participating in violence that targeted the BJP office and the Hill Council. Is this the kind of unrest Rahul Gandhi has been fantasising about?"" Malviya said while sharing the photos and videos of Congress councillor.Ladakh lieutenant governor Kavinder Gupta also alleged conspiracy behind the statehood protest in Leh turning violent, claiming people were being incited by drawing parallels with the youth-led movements in Bangladesh and Nepal that toppled governments there.Wangchuk called off his 15-day hunger strike on Wednesday after the demonstrations demanding statehood for Ladakh turned violent. He called the protest a ""Gen Z revolution"", a term popularised by the recent youth-led demonstrations that toppled the government in Nepal.Protest in the Union Territory is gathering pace demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh which was carved out from Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.

NEW DELHI: With Supreme Court scheduling day-to-day final hearing from November 12 on petitions seeking lowering of age of consent from 18 to 16 years, amicus curiae and senior advocate Indira Jaising said on Wednesday adolescents, who are attaining puberty sooner than ever, can give mature consent for sexual relationships.With a host of interveners supporting Center's stand against lowering age of consent, Jaising told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria that in the present age and time, adolescents increasingly getting sexually aware is part and parcel of natural attraction between sexes leading to development of sexual relationships of choice.The amicus argued that there is no empirical data or research to indicate that persons aged between 16 and 18 are incapable of making mature decisions in relation to their sexual preferences and activities. On the contrary, global trends indicate that decisions in relation to sexual activity can be made from the age of 16.She said decriminalising consensual sexual activity between adolescents in the age bracket of 16-18 years along with focus on sexual education will ensure non-abusive and non-exploitative sexual relationships.""It will also lower cases that every HC in this country has to grapple with, where romantic relationships have been criminalised, leading to incarceration of young adolescent couples, which was never the intention of the statute,"" Jaising said.However, as many as seven interveners, including Dr Ambedkar Jankalyan Samiti and Centre for Social Development, argued that reducing the age of consent would be misused to manipulate young children and take the crime out of Pocso Act, which was enacted to protect them against sexual exploitation. It may also lead to child marriages, they feared.Jaising said criminalising such consensual sexual relationships would force teenagers to get married to avoid prosecution. Citing National Health and Family Survey-5, she said 45% teenage girls in the age group of 15-19 had sexual intercourse.Dr Ambedkar Jankalyan Samiti apprehended that lowering age of consent will also lead to increasing offences of illegal religious conversion and marriage through mala fide inducement. The Samiti and CSD argued that the age of consent and its genuineness can be decided by courts on a case to case basis without giving blanket immunity from Pocso Act.","Supreme Court scheduling day-to-day final hearing from November 12 on petitions seeking lowering of age of consent from 18 to 16 years.

Poll How significant do you think the credibility of India's investigation process is in the global aviation community? Extremely significant Somewhat significant

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has written a letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation demanding a judicial probe into the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI 171, alleging that the officials are prematurely pushing a ""pilot error"" narrative.In its letter to the civil aviation minister, dated September 22, the FIP said the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) had ""fundamentally and irrevocably compromised the integrity, impartiality, and legality of the ongoing investigation.""The FIP alleged that the AAIB's conduct has ""moved beyond mere procedural irregularity into the realm of manifest bias and unlawful action. This has rendered the current investigation untenable, and its potential findings are likely to affect the morale of the pilots.""The federation alleged that AAIB officials visited the residence of Capt. Sabharwal’s 91-year-old father on August 30 “under the pretext of offering condolences” but instead made “damaging insinuations”.""During this interaction, these officials made damaging 'insinuations' based on a 'selective CVR interpretation and a so-called 'layered voice analysis,' suggesting that Capt. Sabharwal had deliberately moved the fuel control switches to the CUTOFF position post-take-off,"" the pilot body added.Calling the move “professionally indefensible,” the FIP accused AAIB of breaching rules by leaking protected CVR details to the media. Under Rule 17(5) of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, disclosure of cockpit voice recordings is strictly prohibited.The leaks, FIP said, had led to the “character assassination of a decorated professional” with a three-decade career and over 15,000 flying hours.The pilots’ body further stressed that accident probes are meant to prevent future tragedies, not apportion blame, as per Rule 3 of the 2017 Rules.The letter said the probe ""contravenes the spirit and letter of ICAO Annex 13, which obligates member states to conduct independent and impartial investigations.”FIP argued that the flawed handling of the AI 171 probe risks damaging India’s credibility in the global aviation community.Urging immediate intervention, the federation added, ""The FIP submits that the circumstances surrounding the AI 171 investigation make the constitution of a Court of Inquiry not merely 'expedient,' but an absolute and urgent necessity.""Drawing parallels with the 2010 Mangalore crash of Air India Express Flight 812—where a Court of Inquiry was set up—the federation said the present case, with even greater loss of life, warranted no less.It has urged the government to constitute a Court of Inquiry led by a retired Supreme Court judge, supported by independent experts in flight operations, aircraft maintenance, avionics, and human factors.""The Federation of Indian Pilots, and the entire professional pilot community it represents, has a solemn and non-negotiable duty to the victims of Flight AI 171, to their grieving families, and to the future safety of the travelling public,"" the letter concluded.","The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has written a letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation demanding a judicial probe into the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI 171.

CDS Anil Chauhan Reveals Big Operation Sindoor Secret, Reveals Why Army Struck Terror Camps at 1am

NEW DELHI: A little over four months after India conducted deep precision strikes against Pakistan under Operation Sindoor , the govt has approved General Anil Chauhan’s extension of service as the Chief of Defence Staff and secretary of the Department of Military Affairs till May 30 next year when he turns 65.Gen Chauhan, who was commissioned in the 11 Gorkha Rifles in 1981, was appointed the country’s second CDS in Sept 2022 after his predecessor, Gen Bipin Rawat, died in a helicopter crash in Dec 2021.The appointments committee of the cabinet on Wednesday approved the extension of Gen Chauhan, who was the military advisor to national security advisor Ajit Doval before becoming the CDS, till May 2026 “or until further orders, whichever is earlier”.The move was expected since a CDS can serve till 65, unlike the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs who serve till 62 or for three years, whichever is earlier. Moreover, the CDS’ main charter of spearheading the creation of integrated theatre commands (ITCs) to ensure a cost-effective and unified war-fighting machinery remains unfinished.The Modi govt has been pushing for the long-pending creation of the ITCs, in what will be the most radical military reorganization envisaged since Independence.Even the BJP manifesto in the run-up to the 2024 general elections had also promised to “establish military theatre commands for more efficient operations” after creating the CDS post in December 2019.While Gen Chauhan has been working towards bringing in some much-needed synergy among the Army, Navy and IAF in operations, logistics, plans and doctrines as well as inter-service prioritization of capital arms procurements, the progress on ITCs has been very slow.India currently has 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which do not have the requisite synergy in planning, logistics and operations. The plan is to have two “adversary-specific” ITCs -- one for the northern borders with China at Lucknow and the other for the western front with Pakistan at Jaipur. The Maritime Theatre Command at Thiruvananthapuram, in turn, will be for the Indian Ocean Region as well as the larger Indo-Pacific, as reported by TOI earlier.","General Anil Chauhan was appointed the country’s second CDS in Sept 2022 after his predecessor, Gen Bipin Rawat, died in a helicopter crash in Dec 2021.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday ticked off the Union govt for opposing consideration of the plea of condemned prisoner Balwant Singh Rajoana, convicted of killing then Punjab CM Beant Singh in 1995, for commutation of death sentence.Rajoana has petitioned for reprieve on the ground that he has been on death row for nearly two decades now.Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj told a bench headed by Justice Vikram Nath that the President did not take a call on Rajoana's plea as it was filed by others and not by the prisoner himself. The bench, however, was not persuaded.Appearing for Rajoana, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that Supreme Court has commuted death sentences of convicts who had been facing the gallows for just two years. ""Here the man has been behind bars for three decades, and two decades under the shadow of a death sentence. If SC commutes his sentence to life imprisonment, he will be released from prison,"" Rohatgi said.He cited an apex court judgment commuting the death sentence of Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar and said the man was convicted for 1993 bomb blasts in Delhi, which had killed nine persons, and had remained on death row since 2001.In 2014, SC commuted his sentence to life term on the ground that there had been an inordinate delay in his execution despite the President rejecting his mercy plea, argued the senior advocate.On Sept 27, 2019, Union home ministry informed the Punjab chief secretary that on the occasion of commemoration of 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev a decision was taken to commute Rajoana's death penalty to life term. But this was not given effect to.Rajoana, who had not appealed against the death sentence given by trial court in 2007 and its approval by Punjab and Haryana HC in 2010, moved SC seeking commutation of his death sentence on the ground that he was in prison for last 25 years and on death row for last 13 years.Rajoana and Jagtar Singh Hawara were awarded death sentences by the trial court for the bomb blast on Aug 31, 1995 which killed Beant Singh and 16 others outside the Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat in Chandigarh.","Rajoana has petitioned for reprieve on the ground that he has been on death row for nearly two decades now.

Poll Which factor do you think is the most critical in maintaining IAF's combat readiness? Timely delivery of fighter jets Successful weapon trials and testing

NEW DELHI: The largest-ever contract worth Rs 66,500 crore for 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters is now all set to be inked with Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), though the IAF is yet to get even the first such `improved’ jet of the 83 ordered earlier for Rs 46,898 crore in Feb 2021.The mega 97-jet contract for the fourth-generation Tejas could be inked as early as Thursday, a day ahead of the retirement of 36 old MiG-21s that will drag down the IAF to its all-time low of 29 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets), defence sources told TOI.Pakistan, in contrast, is cruising close behind with 25 fighter squadrons, and will get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation Chinese stealth jets in the near future. China, of course, is leagues ahead, with more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.After Operation Sindoor, which saw Pakistan use Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles with ranges over 200-km, an IAF internal assessment has held it will need far more than even its “authorized” 42.5 fighter squadrons to tackle the collusive and fused threat from its adversaries.The IAF has repeatedly set the alarm bells ringing over the excruciatingly slow development saga of the single-engine Tejas fighters, stressing that operational preparedness cannot be sacrificed at the altar of `atmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) endlessly. Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself said IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.All the 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets under the 2021 contract were to be delivered in the Feb 2024-Feb 2028 timeframe. The PM-led cabinet committee on security approved the acquisition of another 97 such jets on Aug 19 this year.“The IAF was insistent the new contract should not be inked before deliveries of the earlier 83 jets begin, with HAL being held accountable. The defence ministry, however, must spend its budget within specified timelines…the initial payment will go to HAL once the contract is signed,” a source said.HAL, on its part, contends it will be able to deliver the first two of the 83 Tejas jets in Oct. Deliveries of the 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, now appear to be stabilizing, an official said.GE has delivered three engines till now, with another seven slated by Dec. Thereafter, GE is expected to deliver 20 engines every year. For the 97-jet deal, HAL will ink another deal with GE for 113 more such engines for $1 billion, as earlier reported by TOI.The IAF, however, wants to accept the first two fighters only if the ongoing firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs from them are successfully completed and properly certified.“The weapon trials and integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system will take time. I don’t see the delivery happening before year-end unless IAF is forced to accept the fighters without certification,” a senior officer said.HAL has promised to progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains","The mega 97-jet contract for the fourth-generation Tejas could be inked as early as Thursday.

Vessels costing less than Rs 100 crore will receive 15% assistance, those over Rs 100 crore 20%, and green or hybrid vessels 25%. At least 30% domestic value addition is required to avail benefits.

Supreme Court Says Flaws In Bihar SIR Can Nullify Exercise; Ruling To Extend Across The country

NEW DELHI: Election Commission now requires an applicant seeking fresh enrolment or inclusion/exclusion of a voter from the electoral roll via online mode to mandatorily verify his identity through OTP-based Aadhaar authentication.While online applications related to the electoral roll - through Form 6 (fresh enrolment), Form 7 (objection to inclusion/exclusion of voter in roll) and Form 8 (corrections) - would henceforth require'e-sign' based on Aadhaar authentication, those who do not have Aadhaar number can always fill out the physical forms and personally submit them to the electoral registration officer (ERO) or the booth level officer (BLO).The 'e-sign' requirement for online applications related to the voters' list, EC sources told TOI, was conceptualised in Aug and rolled out quietly in the second week of Sept. The reform, it was underlined, preceded Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's Sept 18 press conference during which he had alleged unauthorised attempts at deletion of over 6,000 voters in Aland assembly constituency of Karnataka in Dec 2022.The 'e-sign' initiative is meant to ensure that the applicant's name in the electoral photo identity card (EPIC) and phone number - as declared in the online Forms 6, 7 or 8 - matches with his/her details recorded in the Aadhaar system.Form 7 allows an elector to object against the proposed inclusion or exclusion of a voter in the electoral roll of a constituency in which he himself is also registered. Such an applicant must mention his name, EPIC number and mobile number of self 'or' relative (father/mother/husband/legal guardian) in the form. The e-sign option prompts the applicant to complete his OTP-based Aadhaar authentication before submitting the form.EC had, soon after Rahul's presser, clarified only 24 of the 6,018 applications for deletions in Aland were found genuine, while the remaining 5,994 were found incorrect, and rejected. An FIR was filed on Sept 6, 2023 by the Aland ERO in the case and all available details handed over to the investigation agency.","EC now requires an applicant seeking fresh enrolment or inclusion/exclusion of a voter from the electoral roll via online mode to mandatorily verify his identity through OTP-based Aadhaar authentication.

NEW DELHI: Ladakh lieutenant governor Kavinder Gupta on Wednesday alleged a conspiracy behind the statehood protest in Leh turning violent, claiming people were being incited by drawing parallels with the youth-led movements in Bangladesh and Nepal that toppled governments there.""In a democratic system, protesting is a right.

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh’s ruling Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) leader and MLA Nara Lokesh has alleged that over Rs 100 crore was stolen from the parakamani (donation box) of the Tirumala temple during the YSR Congress Party government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.Lokesh, who is also TDP’s general secretary, shared purported CCTV footage on X on Saturday, claiming it shows large-scale misappropriation of Lord Venkateswara’s offerings.“YCP thieves have looted the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara. YCP leaders are behind the ‘hundred crore Parakamani theft’. During Jagan’s five-year rule, corruption reigned supreme. Anarchy ran rampant. Jagan turned Andhra Pradesh into a haven for thieves, looters, and mafia dons. The Jagan gang plundered mines, lands, forests, and all resources, along with exploiting the people... and in the end, they did not even spare the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala,” said Lokesh in his post.He also accused former Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Chairman Bhumana Karunakar Reddy of facilitating the scam and claimed that “shares of the loot” reached Tadepalli Palace, the residence of then chief minister Jagan.TTD is the official custodian of Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, the richest Hindu shrine in the world.Lokesh alleged that the stolen funds were diverted into real estate and attempts were made to “settle” the matter in a Lok Adalat. “With the backing of power, Jagan’s gang committed every possible sacrilege against Lord Venkateswara,” he added.""The sins of Jagan’s gang, the former rulers who looted the temple and its hundi, have now come to fruition.

'Offensive': Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma's sharp retort to Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus' Northeast ‘landlocked’ remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/offensive-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarmas-sharp-retort-to-bangladeshs-muhammad-yunus-northeast-landlocked-remark/articleshow/119840858.cms,"Muhammad Yunus (left) and Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday strongly condemned the statement made by Bangladesh government's chief advisor, Muhammad Yunus, claiming that Bangladesh is the ""only guardian"" of the Indian Ocean for the region, as the seven northeastern Indian states are ""landlocked."" Sarma called Yunus' comments ""offensive"".""The statement made by Md Younis of Bangladesh's so called interim government referring to the seven sister states of Northeast India as landlocked and positioning Bangladesh as their guardian of ocean access, is offensive and strongly condemnable,"" Sarma said in a post on X.Chief advisor to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus, during his four-day visit to China, invited Beijing to expand its presence in the region. He highlighted that India's seven northeastern states are landlocked and suggested that Bangladesh could serve as a key gateway to the ocean for the region.In a widely shared video on social media, Yunus encouraged China to establish an economic base in Bangladesh, saying that Dhaka holds strategic access to the sea. He said, ""Seven states of India, eastern part of India, called seven sisters ... they are landlocked country, landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean.""Yunus further said, ""We are the only guardian of the ocean for all this region. So this opens up a huge possibility. So this could be an extension of the Chinese economy. Build things, produce things, market things, bring things to China, bring it out to the whole rest of the world.""Responding to Yunus's statement, Assam CM said, ""This remark underscores the persistent vulnerability narrative associated with India’s strategic “Chicken’s Neck” corridor. Historically, even internal elements within India have dangerously suggested severing this critical passageway to isolate the Northeast from the mainland physically.""Sarma also called for building alternative road routes to Northeast India. ""Therefore, it is imperative to develop more robust railway and road networks both underneath and around the Chicken’s Neck corridor . Additionally, exploring alternative road routes connecting the Northeast to mainland India, effectively bypassing the Chicken’s Neck, should be prioritized. Though this may pose significant engineering challenges, it is achievable with determination and innovation,"" he said.Earlier, on Monday, the Congress party called Yunus's statement ""very dangerous"" for the security of the Northeast region and alleged that the government is not taking care of the region including Manipur. ""Bangladesh is inviting China to encircle India. This attitude of the Bangladesh government is very dangerous for the security of our North East region. The government is not taking care of Manipur and China has already settled villages in Arunachal,"" Congress's head of media and publicity department Pawan Khera said in a post in Hindi on X.""Our foreign policy is in such a pathetic state that the country, in whose creation India had a major role, is also today engaged in rallying against us,"" Khera added.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma strongly condemned the statement made by Bangladesh government's chief advisor, Muhammad Yunus.

US Secret Service nixed Pannun plan to serve NSA Ajit Doval summons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-secret-service-nixed-pannun-plan-to-serve-ajit-doval-summons/articleshow/119822944.cms,"NEW DELHI: A US court has observed that the service of delivery of summons to NSA Ajit Doval , who accompanied PM Narendra Modi during his visit to the US on February 12-13, was not completed during his stay there, brushing aside Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun’s claim that he managed to get the notice delivered to the top Indian security official.The court was responding to a letter from Pannun’s lawyer which also revealed that US Secret Service agents guarding the Blair House, where the Indian delegation was put up, threatened to arrest his server when he tried to place the notice on the ground outside what is the president’s guest house. The server could only leave the summons with a nearby Starbucks store that didn’t prove to be enough for the court.After reviewing the letter, a judge of the Southern District of New York said that “the complaint was not delivered to a member of the hotel management or staff or any officers or agents providing security for Defendant (Doval), as required by the court's order”. The development confirms the Indian position that the NSA wasn’t served the summons, which foreign secretary Vikram Misri had described as based on unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations, during his stay in the US.The summons was issued last year in September by a US court in response to a civil lawsuit filed by Pannun about an alleged murder plot against him for which American authorities had blamed an Indian government agent named Vikash Yadav . The Indian government has conducted a probe into the issue and recommended legal action against Yadav. Indian national Nikhil Gupta remains in US custody for his alleged involvement in the plot and his case will go to trial on November 3, 2025.Pannun is said to have hired 2 process servers and one investigator to effect service on Doval in Washington DC during the latter’s 2-day trip to the US. According to the contents of the letter, the first server, identified as Ambiko Wallace, reached Blair House on February 12 at 7.22 pm and found it barricaded with a single checkpoint that was guarded by Secret Service agents. Wallace showed the legal document to an agent, but he would have none of it and forced the server to immediately leave the checkpoint.Another individual named Wayne Engram, apparently a more enterprising process server with 15 years of experience, approached the agents next day at 12.15 pm. As the Secret Service again refused to accept any document, he tried to place the envelope on the ground before them – a “standard method of service” apparently. However, one of the agents told him that he would be arrested if he left the summons on the ground. It was then that Engram decided to leave the documents at the nearest public location where he would not be arrested. This happened to be a Starbucks approximately 100 feet from the checkpoint. “Mr. Engram left the service documents in a sealed envelope in the public seating area outside the Starbucks. Then he went back to the checkpoint, told the agents where he had left the documents, and asked them to please retrieve them and give them to Defendant as soon as possible,’’ says the letter. This clearly proved to be insufficient for the court. While all this was going on, the investigator hired by Pannun also spoke to Blair House staff and Secret Service over phone but was told there was no way to serve the Defendant there. They also refused to share any email that could be used for sharing the summons.The Pannun murder plot threatened to snowball into a major diplomatic row last year, with the Biden administration not just seeking accountability but also backing similar charges by Canada over the murder of another Khalistan leader named Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Having recommended legal action against Yadav and pledging “functional improvements” in the system to deal with a matter like this, India will hope that the case will no longer act as an irritant in bilateral ties. Pannun, who was designated as a terrorist by India in 2020, is the spokesperson for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a Khalistan group India wants the US to ban.",A US court has observed that the service of delivery of summons to NSA Ajit Doval was not completed during his stay there.

India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor: The project faces significant challenges in the wake of Trump's threats against Iran. IMEC aims to enhance economic integration between India, the Middle East, and Europe by bypassing traditional routes like the Suez Canal. However, tensions between the US and Iran could disrupt this ambitious initiative. Trump's aggressive stance against Iran exacerbates regional tensions, threatening trade routes and infrastructure projects. This instability could divert investment away from IMEC, favoring more secure alternatives. As a result, India must navigate these complexities carefully to ensure the corridor's viability and maintain its strategic influence in the region. The project's future hinges on diplomatic efforts to stabilise the region and mitigate the impact of US-Iran tensions on IMEC's development and operations.

Oil imports : India, which was once the largest buyer of Iranian oil, had to seek alternative sources after the US withdrew sanction exemptions for oil imports. Continued sanctions would maintain this status quo, affecting India's energy security and forcing it to rely on more expensive alternatives. India has had to diversify its oil import basket, turning to other suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even the United States to fill the gap.

Chabahar Port development : The Chabahar Port project, a cornerstone of India-Iran economic engagement, faces potential setbacks due to increased US sanctions and regional tensions. Although the port is considered outside the purview of US sanctions, the overall geopolitical tension and financial restrictions have indirectly affected its development and utilisation. It offers India an alternative route for trade with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries, reducing dependence on Pakistan-controlled transit routes. However, US sanctions have made it difficult for international companies and financial institutions to participate in the project, slowing down its progress. Indian investments and operations at the port have continued, but at a reduced pace. The uncertainty surrounding the sanctions regime has also deterred potential partners and investors, limiting the port's growth potential.

India's relations with Iran are further complicated by Tehran's stance in Yemen, which conflicts with the interests of India's partners, including the US. The Yemen conflict, where Iran supports the Houthi rebels, has created a challenging diplomatic environment for India. Competition from China: China's increasing presence in the region, including a 25-year strategic partnership with Iran, poses a challenge to India's strategic interests. US sanctions could inadvertently strengthen China's position by limiting India's engagement with Iran. There are apprehensions that China might leverage its growing relationship with Iran to gain preferential access to Iranian resources and markets, potentially at the expense of Indian projects.

As part of his 'maximum pressure' approach, US president Donald Trump has threatened Iran with military action if Tehran does not agree to a new nuclear deal with Washington, a move that has hightened tensions in the region and will likely impact India's trade and security interests in the Middle East.The threat was made during a phone interview with NBC News, where Trump stated that if Iran fails to make a deal, there would be ""bombing the likes of which they have never seen before"". Additionally, Trump mentioned the possibility of imposing secondary tariffs on Iran if an agreement is not reached.Iran has responded strongly to these threats.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that if the US acts on Trump's threat, Iran will deliver a ""strong blow"" in retaliation. Iran has also prepared its missile arsenal, with many missiles positioned in underground facilities designed to withstand airstrikes, ready to strike US-linked positions worldwide.Trump's threat came after Iran rejected direct negotiations with the US but said it was open to indirect talks through intermediaries like Oman. The tensions between the US and Iran have escalated significantly since Trump withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, during his first term in office.If Trump's 'maximum pressure' approach against Iran continues, India's trade, ties, and strategic interests with Tehran could be affected.","IMEC aims to enhance economic integration between India, the Middle East, and Europe by bypassing traditional routes like the Suez Canal. Trump's aggressive stance against Iran exacerbates regional tensions, threatening trade routes and infrastructure projects. The project's future hinges on diplomatic efforts to stabilise the region and mitigate the impact of US-Iran tensions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119804233,imgsize-1615392,width-400,resizemode-4/119804233.jpg"
"Nearly 20 years after nuclear deal, DoE clears US firm to build & design reactors in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nearly-20-years-after-nuclear-deal-doe-clears-us-firm-to-build-design-reactors-in-india/articleshow/119826549.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough in the Indo-US nuclear deal that was signed nearly two decades ago, the US Department of Energy (DoE) has provided regulatory clearance to an American company to build and design nuclear reactors in India .On March 26, 2025, DoE granted Holtec International a critical regulatory approval, allowing the company to transfer small modular reactor (SMR) technology to India. Holtec specialises in the design and manufacture of parts for nuclear reactors and is the world leader in storage and transport casks used for spent nuclear fuel.The DoE approval to Holtec International has been given under conditions that it shares ‘unclassified small modular reactor (SMR) technology’ with three Indian firms: Holtec Asia (its regional subsidiary), Larsen &Toubro Ltd and Tata Consulting Engineers Ltd. The deal is under the restrictive regulation of the US, ‘10CFR810’, with the approval being valid for 10 years and will be re-evaluated every five years.But the US has set one condition — these jointly-designed and manufactured nuclear power plants “will not be re-transferred to any other entity or end user in India or to other countries except the US without the prior written consent of the Government of the United States”.Holtec had also sought approvals for two Indian govt-owned firms, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), and also for Atomic Energy Review Board or AERB. However, the govt of India had not provided required clearances for these state-owned corporations since Holtec had not yet got DoE permission.The India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed in August 2007 by then PM Manmohan Singh and then US President George W Bush to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation between the two nations. However, it took nearly 20 years for the deal to kick in due to multiple legal and regulatory challenges.Till now, under the civil nuclear deal, US firms could export nuclear reactors and equipment to India, but forbid them from any design work or manufacturing of nuclear equipment in the country.In mid-Feb, PM Narendra Modi met President Trump and agreed to a new initiative to drive “transformative change across key pillars of cooperation” between the two countries. The two leaders then announced plans to build US-designed nuclear reactors in India. During the talks, Modi and Trump had also committed to leaning into the 123 Agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation the nations signed in 2007.The two leaders then agreed that energy security was fundamental to economic growth, social well-being and technical innovation in both countries by ensuring energy affordability, reliability, and availability in stable energy markets. To help facilitate the joint work decided between Modi and Trump, the Indian govt is considering amendments to India’s Atomic Energy Act of 1962, which bars private investments in India's nuclear power plants.Currently, India has 22 operating reactors, with an installed capacity of 6780 MWe. Among these eighteen reactors are Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and four are Light Water Reactors (LWRs). In Feb last year, Kakrapar Unit 4 became India’s newest nuclear power plant to become operational.","The India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed in August 2007 by then PM Manmohan Singh and then US President George W Bush.

HYDERABAD: Following media reports about the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) president and some other top officials harassing and blackmailing the IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad over free tickets, Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy, on Monday, ordered an investigation into the matter.The state government appointed senior IPS officer Kothakota Sreenivasa Reddy , currently serving as director general (vigilance & enforcement) to conduct an investigation in the case and submit a report soon.Recently, the SRH management took strong objection to HCA president A Jagan Mohan Rao’s conduct and shot an email, threatening to stop playing matches in Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket stadium if they continue to harass them with demands for free tickets.“All these unprofessional threats and actions by HCA, especially by the HCA president, make it evident that you don’t want Sunrisers to play at your stadium.

States most affected

Rising temperatures and health risks

Electricity demand surge expected

NEW DELHI: India is set to experience an unusually hot summer from April to June, with heatwave days expected to double in several states, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned on Monday. Central and eastern India, along with the northwestern plains, are likely to see prolonged spells of extreme heat.IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra stated that most parts of the country will witness above-normal maximum temperatures, except for some regions in western and eastern India, where temperatures may remain near normal. Minimum temperatures, however, are predicted to be above average in most regions.""From April to June, north, east, and central India, as well as the plains of northwest India, are expected to see two to four additional heatwave days than usual,"" Mohapatra told PTI. Typically, India records four to seven heatwave days in this period.The states expected to witness more intense heatwaves include Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and the northern parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Some states, such as eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha, could see as many as 10 to 11 heatwave days, Mohapatra added.In April, maximum temperatures are forecasted to be higher than usual across most of India, while some extreme southern and northwestern regions may see near-normal temperatures. Minimum temperatures will remain elevated across most of the country, except for a few areas in the northwest and northeast.The central government has already urged states to ensure hospitals are equipped to handle heatstroke cases. Last year, India witnessed a record-breaking summer with 536 heatwave days—the highest in 14 years—leading to 41,789 suspected heatstroke cases and 143 confirmed deaths.However, experts warn that heat-related deaths could be underreported due to inadequate data collection.With rising temperatures, electricity demand is expected to grow by 9-10% this summer. Last year, peak electricity demand crossed 250 gigawatts on May 30, exceeding projections by 6.3%. The IMD cautioned that climate change-driven heat stress is a significant factor behind rising energy consumption.The IMD predicts normal rainfall in April, ranging between 88-112% of the long-term average of 39.2 mm. Some areas in northwest, northeast, west-central, and peninsular India could receive normal to above-normal rainfall. However, Mohapatra also warned of possible landslides in the Western Ghats region of Kerala and Karnataka, as well as potential flooding in northeastern states in April.As India gears up for a hotter-than-usual summer, authorities are urging preparedness to mitigate the effects of extreme heat on public health and infrastructure.","Central and eastern India, along with the northwestern plains, are likely to see prolonged spells of extreme heat.

NAGPUR: Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis Monday rejected speculation about his potential candidacy for prime ministerial role in 2029, asserting that PM Narendra Modi remains the 'undisputed leader of BJP' and has many years of service ahead.Fadnavis dismissed Sena UBT member Sanjay Raut 's claim that Modi's visit to Hedgewar memorial in Reshimbagh signalled his impending retirement, as baseless. ""In Hindu culture, a child is not considered a replacement for his father while the father is still alive. Such successions occur in Mughal culture, not ours. Modi remains our leader, and BJP is committed to seeing him continue as PM beyond 2029,"" he said.Raut claimed Modi's visit to RSS' Hedgewar memorial was meant to signal his exit from active politics in Sept this year, further suggesting that Modi's successor would be from Maharashtra and finalised by the Sangh. Modi turns 75 in Sept, and BJP has an informal rule that leaders beyond this age should not hold ministerial positions.Fadnavis also countered ex-Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's criticism of National Education Policy , which she termed 'communal, coercive agenda.' Defending the policy, he emphasised the necessity of dismantling the British-imposed education framework. ""British designed an education system to weaken Indian identity. Lord Macaulay explicitly stated in his letter that unless India's indigenous education was dismantled, British cannot rule. Any patriot should support efforts to Indianise our education system. Sonia must study these reforms properly and extend support,"" he said.On MNS chief Raj Thackeray's concerns on governance and rural distress, raised during his Gudi Padwa speech Sunday, Fadnavis said, ""We are working to take everyone along in running the govt. He raised some important points, and we will consider them. As for his suggestion on loudspeakers at mosques, we will strictly implement SC order prohibiting their use beyond permissible limits.""Addressing Thackeray's remarks on deteriorating condition of rivers in state, the CM pointed to the ongoing efforts to rejuvenate state's water resources, especially Godavari.","Fadnavis dismissed Sena UBT member Sanjay Raut's claim that Modi's visit to Hedgewar memorial in Reshimbagh signalled his impending retirement.

A govt source said the limit will be decided by the central board. In May 2024, the EPFO increased auto settlement of the advanced claim limit from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh.Auto settlement is available to deal with four specific situations - medical treatment, education, marriage and housing.EPFO recently simplified the process for auto settlement resulting in a majority of claims being processed within three days, instead of weeks earlier.

Which religion were you specifically referring to? Sanatan Hindu Dharma?"" he wrote.Adhikari further alleged that Banerjee repeatedly used the words ""Danga"" (riot) and questioned whether the event was meant to be religious or political.

He (Aurangzeb) died here, so his tomb has been built here.

Countering them, the superintendent, along with students, staff members and local residents, wrote to the minister claiming the allegations were ""false and baseless"". An inquiry by the director of the state Directorate of Industrial Training revealed that the allegations against the superintendent could not be substantiated as the accusers could not provide any proof.The school superintendent then filed a criminal defamation case against the mass petitioners, claiming they had not only maligned him but tarnished his image in the eyes of all concerned, including teachers, students, staff members, guardians and locals.The main contention before Justice Ajay Kumar Gupta was whether the mass complaint could be punishable as defamation, criminal intimidation, and criminal conspiracy. Justice Gupta ruled out defamation, observing that the mass complaint was on a matter of public interest that was submitted to an authority, and was never made public as per the claims of the mass petitioners.""This mass petition is for the protection of the institution or the students or their own rights and interest and cannot be construed as malice and imputation of reputation in public or society as such, cannot be said to have been made with intent to defame the complainant,"" the court said.",Calcutta high court quashes defamation case against 287 people.

"Land not available, Kashipur's historic horse market shuts down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/land-not-available-kashipurs-historic-horse-market-shuts-down/articleshow/119825468.cms,"RUDRAPUR: The annual ' Nakhasa Bazaar ,' a 170-year-old tradition of the Chaiti fair in Udham Singh Nagar's Kashipur, which is held during the Navratras, has been cancelled this year due to unavailability of land. Known for rare horse breeds, the market once drew traders from across India. According to local lore, even bandits like Sultana Daku and Phoolan Devi ""blended into the crowd to buy horses"".The market's abrupt closure marks the end of an era, as per locals. The two-acre land that once hosted this bustling bazaar has been divided among the Panda family, custodians of the fair, who informed traders that it was no longer available for hosting the market.Believed to have been established by Hussain Baksh, a prominent horse trader from UP's Rampur in 1855, the Nakhasa market was once a thriving hub for traders from Afghanistan, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. In recent years, however, the number of participating regions dwindled, with traders primarily coming from Punjab, Gujarat, UP, and Haryana, selling horses in a price range of Rs 40,000 to Rs 40 lakh. Over 50 horses were sold every year.""Around 10 to 12 breeds of horses would arrive each year for sale,"" said local historian Rupesh Singh. Prized breeds like Marwari, Sindhi, Kathiawadi, Spiti and Manipuri, which are valued for their speed, were star attractions. ""The significance of the market went beyond commerce. This was a living relic of our past, where history and trade intertwined. It was a cultural institution that reflected the socio-economic dynamics of the region. Its closure is a loss not just for Kashipur but for the entire region,"" Singh said.In recent years, the dwindling number of buyers had cast a shadow over the market's existence. The news of the bazaar's closure came as a shock for many traders who had travelled long distances, expecting another successful season. On Sunday morning, around 100 horses arrived from cities across UP and Rajasthan, only to be turned away. ""We were ready to set up shop, but there was no space available,"" said a trader, his voice heavy with frustration.Chief priest of Ma Bal Sundari Devi temple, Krishna Gopal Agnihotri, told TOI: ""We had no choice but to ask the horse traders to return."" As traders packed up their horses and began the long journey home, the dust settled on an empty field that had once pulsed with life.","Nakhasa Bazaar is a 170-year-old tradition of the Chaiti fair in Udham Singh Nagar's Kashipur.

April-June likely to be hotter than usual across India: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/april-june-likely-to-be-hotter-than-usual-across-india-imd/articleshow/119824913.cms,"NEW DELHI: The April-June summer season is likely to be hotter than normal over most parts of the country with both maximum (day) and minimum (night) temperatures, and number of heatwave days expected to be 'above-normal' during the three months, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.During the period, the number of heatwave days is also expected to be higher than normal (2-4 additional heatwave days) over Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and northern parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.""Eastern region of India may experience up to 10-11 heatwave days during April-June,"" said IMD chief, M Mohapatra, while releasing temperature and rainfall outlook for the coming months.During heatwaves, elevated temperatures pose significant risks, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, who are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heatstroke.Additionally, prolonged periods of extreme heat can lead to dehydration and strain on infrastructure such as power grids and transportation systems, and therefore the IMD expects ""anticipatory actions"" by local authorities as per the existing guidelines and heat action plans.""During the 2025 hot weather season (April to June), above-normal maximum temperatures are most likely over most parts of the country, except some parts of west peninsular India and isolated regions of east-central and east India where normal maximum temperatures are most likely,"" said Mohapatra.Even in April, above-normal maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country except some parts of extreme south peninsular India and northwest India, where normal maximum temperatures are most likely.As far as rainfall is concerned, the Met department will come out with its first stage long-term forecast for the upcoming monsoon season (June-Sept) in mid-April when it will predict extent of quantitative rainfall for the period factoring in various climatic phenomena including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).Mohapatra said though the latest Monsoon Mission Climate Forecast System (MMCFS) model indicates that the neutral ENSO conditions are likely to continue in the upcoming season, it would be premature to say anything about the monsoon season at this juncture as there are other factors that guide the sea sonal rainfall. Normally, EL Nino adversely impacts monsoon rainfall whereas La Nina triggers good seasonal rainfall. So, neutral conditions mean no possibility of ENSO’s impact on rainfall during the monsoon season.",The April-June summer season is likely to be hotter than normal over most parts of the country. Both maximum (day) and minimum (night) temperatures are expected to be 'above-normal' during the three months. Eastern region of India may experience up to 10-11 heatwave days.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119824977,imgsize-1064932,width-400,resizemode-4/119824977.jpg"
"Hand over 14 assets of Tiger Memon, kin to Centre: Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hand-over-14-assets-of-tiger-memon-kin-to-centre-court/articleshow/119824599.cms,"MUMBAI: A special Tada court has directed that 14 immovable properties, including several flats, vacant plots, office premises, and shops belonging to Tiger Memon, Yakub Memon , and his family, several of whom were either convicted, acquitted, or are absconding in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts case, be handed over to the central govt. Attached in 1994, the properties are with the court receiver, Bombay HC.""The court receiver, HC, Bombay, is hereby discharged in respect of... 14 immovable properties... and subject to the payment of costs, charges, and expenses to be paid by the competent authority upon disposal of the properties through sale proceeds or by any other legal mode deemed fit and proper by it,"" special judge VD Kedar said on March 26.While the alleged mastermind of the blasts, Tiger Memon, is absconding, his brother Yakub, who stood trial and was convicted, was hanged in 2015. Among the properties are Yakub's flat at Almeida Park, Bandra (West), a vacant plot and flat at Santacruz, two flats at Kurla, an office on Mohamed Ali Road, a shop, flat, and land at Dongri, an open plot at Mahim, three shops at Manish Market, a building and plot at Zaveri Bazaar, and a garage at Mahim. Property owners include Abdul Razak Memon, Essa Memon, Yakub Memon, and Rubina Memon.Notices for the release of the properties were sent to 13 members of the Memon family, including Tiger Memon, but they did not respond to the plea. The plea was moved by the central govt through the competent authority under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act (SAFEMA) on Jan 7, 2025. It was submitted that the function of the authority is to trace the illegally acquired properties of smugglers and drug traffickers and order their forfeiture to the central govt.It was further submitted that the forfeiture proceedings were initiated against Ibrahim Abdul Razak Memon, aka Tiger Memon, on the basis of a 1992 detention order by the Govt of Maharashtra, home department, under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Act (COFEPSA). Thereafter, in 1993, under SAFEMA, the authorities ordered the forfeiture of various properties. However, the properties were attached by the Tada court in 1994, and a court receiver was appointed to take custody of them. Over the years, those affected by the forfeiture moved several courts seeking the properties' release. However, the pleas were denied.In Aug 2024, the court ordered the transfer of three flats in Mahim's Al Hussain building, once owned by the Memon family, to the central government. The flats were linked to Tiger, Yakub, and their relatives, including their mother Hanifa (acquitted), sister-in-law Rubina (serving life sentence), and wife Shabana (absconding). The housing society's plea for maintenance arrears and redevelopment was rejected, with the court directing them to approach the competent authority.","A special Tada court has directed that 14 immovable properties, including several flats, vacant plots, office premises, and shops belonging to Tiger Memon, Yakub Memon and his family be handed over to the central govt.

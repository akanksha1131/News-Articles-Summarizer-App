SCALP cruise missile

HAMMER precision-guided bomb

Loitering munitions

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday launched Operation Sindoor , targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation destroyed multiple Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) training facilities.Carried out in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22, the mission was ""focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature.""The Indian forces specifically targeted key JeM and LeT bases involved in orchestrating terror attacks within India. A total of nine sites were hit, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke.Using advanced precision weaponry and real-time intelligence, the Army, Navy, and Air Force conducted the strikes in coordination, avoiding any engagement with Pakistani military installations.India employed a range of high-precision, long-range strike weapons during the operation, including the SCALP cruise missile , the HAMMER precision-guided bomb , and loitering munitions.SCALP, also known as Storm Shadow, is a long-range, air-launched cruise missile designed for precision deep strikes against high-value, fixed targets. Manufactured by the European defence firm MBDA, the missile is conventionally armed and primarily used to destroy fortified bunkers and critical infrastructure.Weighing approximately 1,300 kilograms (2,870 pounds), SCALP is typically deployed from advanced fighter jets like the Rafale. Its integration into the Indian Air Force arsenal enables stealth operations deep within enemy territory, particularly for pre-planned missions targeting strategic assets.Beyond India, SCALP has seen combat use in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and was also supplied to Ukraine, where its long range significantly enhanced the country's capability to strike deep behind Russian lines.HAMMER, short for Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range, is an air-to-ground precision-guided missile system developed by Safran Electronics & Defense, a French defense firm. Designed for medium-range tactical missions, HAMMER delivers high-accuracy strikes against both stationary and mobile targets.Its standout feature is a modular design, allowing it to be fitted with various guidance systems—including GPS, infrared imaging, and laser targeting. This versatility makes it effective against a broad spectrum of targets, from fortified positions to moving assets on the battlefield.Loitering munitions, often called ""kamikaze drones,"" are used for surveillance, target identification, and executing precision strikes. They loiter over potential targets and can engage threats either autonomously or under remote human control.During Operation Sindoor, the Indian Air Force deployed HAMMER missiles to engage targets requiring precision and flexibility, such as medium-range sites and potentially mobile assets linked to terror groups in the region. HAMMER’s adaptable guidance systems allowed the IAF to strike locations where dynamic targeting was essential.Its use complemented the SCALP missile, which is optimised for long-range strikes on fixed targets. Together, the deployment of HAMMER and SCALP enabled the IAF to carry out deep, precise attacks inside Pakistani territory, neutralising terror infrastructure without involving ground troops.","India on Wednesday launched Operation Sindoor, targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Trump said he hoped that the escalation to end quickly.""We just heard about it as we were walking through the doors of the Oval. Just heard about it.

Operation Sindoor vs Balakot: India raises the stakes with deep strikes in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-pahalgam-avenged-india-strikes-terror-camp-in-pakistan-pok/articleshow/120948721.cms,"Out of the nine targets chosen by India, four were in Pakistan and the remaining five were in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Why it matters: A quantum leap from Balakot

Hit more targets (nine vs one in Balakot)

Penetrated deeper into Pakistani territory (striking Bahawalpur and Muridke), and

Employed sophisticated precision munitions, including loitering drones.

Security analyst Aadil Mir told ANI: “India has crossed two significant thresholds… striking multiple sites and targeting Pakistan’s heartland. This goes far beyond 2019.”

Zoom in: The strikes and what they hit

Execution & technology:

The strikes were carried out entirely from Indian airspace using a mix of:

Loitering munitions (which hover before attacking),

Precision-guided missiles, and

Air Force, Navy, and Army strike coordination.

Targets included:

Markaz Subhan Allah (Bahawalpur) - JeM HQ

Markaz Taiba (Muridke) - LeT’s main base

Syedna Bilal & Shwawai Nalla camps (Muzaffarabad) - JeM & LeT hubs

Makaz Raheel Shahid & Mehmoona Joya (Kotli & Sialkot) - Hizbul Mujahideen sites

Other logistical, training and recruitment centers in Barnala and Tehra Kalan

Indian military sources confirmed the intent was to “decapitate” leadership and logistics across JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure.

The symbolism

Sindoor

What they're saying

Following Operation Sindoor, the Indian Army said on 'X': ""Justice is Served.""

Defence ministry: “Focused, measured, and non-escalatory… no Pakistani military sites were targeted.”

Defence minister Rajnath Singh: “Bharat Mata Ki Jai.”

Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria (Retd): “Nine terrorist sites and their infrastructure were targeted… A fitting response under PM Modi’s direction to inflict unimaginable punishment.”

US President Donald Trump said at an unrelated White House interaction with news reporters: “We just heard about it as we were walking through the doors of the Oval ... They've been fighting for a long time. ... I just hope it ends very quickly.”

Between the lines: This was not Balakot 2.0 - it’s a new doctrine

More importantly, Sindoor introduced:

Wider spatial escalation - hitting targets near Lahore (Muridke) and Sialkot.

Higher operational tempo - All nine strikes occurred within minutes.

Zero intrusion strategy - India used standoff weapons, minimizing airspace breach and escalation risk.

The big picture: Why now, and what changed?

What’s next: Escalation or deterrence?

Ceasefire violations:

India’s stance:

The takeaway: A new red line has been drawn

Operation Sindoor

Raised the cost of cross-border terrorism,

Expanded its military playbook, and

Sent a clear message: No more sanctuaries, even in Pakistan’s heartland.

India also showed its restraint and maturity by not hitting military targets, avoiding a full-scale escalation - even as it delivered a strategic blow to terror infrastructure.

As Brigadier Hemant Mahajan (Retd) put it:

""This was a world-class, precision strike. The Armed Forces must be complimented. We hit them when they least expected it - and hit them hard.""

In a bold and coordinated military action, the Indian armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor - a high-precision missile strike targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack , which killed 25 Indian civilians and a Nepali national just two weeks earlier.The targets included JeM's Bahawalpur HQ, LeT’s base in Muridke, and several key infrastructure hubs of Hizbul Mujahideen, marking India’s most comprehensive cross-border military strike in over 50 years.India's previous cross-border strikes - the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes - were relatively limited in scope and geography. In contrast, Operation Sindoor:The operation's name,, is derived from the red vermillion Hindu women wear to signify marriage — a nod to the Pahalgam widows, including one whose Navy officer husband was gunned down in front of her.While both Balakot and Sindoor were retaliatory anti-terror operations:Balakot (2019): Targeted a single JeM training camp in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Sindoor (2025): Targeted multiple, geographically dispersed terror sites, including deep inside Pakistan’s Punjab.The Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 - where civilians, including security families, were massacred - generated national outrage and international concern.PM Narendra Modi, in an April 29 security briefing, gave the armed forces ""complete operational freedom"". This green greenlight, combined with high-quality intelligence and technological advances, led to the execution of a strike unprecedented since the 1971 war.India then moved swiftly to brief world powers, including the US, UK, Russia, UAE, and Saudi Arabia, explaining the non-escalatory nature of the operation.NSA Ajit Doval spoke directly to US NSA and secretary of state Marco Rubio, laying out evidence of Pakistan-based terror links to Pahalgam.Hours after the strikes, Pakistan’s army opened artillery fire along the LoC in Jammu’s Bhimber Gali area, killing three Indian civilians. India’s army said it was responding in a “calibrated manner.”New Delhi is projecting this as a deterrence-by-punishment strategy - precise, contained, and legally justified. “We only hit known terror camps,” the Indian embassy in New York emphasized.With, India has:(With inputs from agencies)","Operation Sindoor targeted nine terror camps deep in Pakistan and Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK) The strikes were carried out entirely from Indian airspace using a mix of:Loitering munitions (which hover before attacking), precision-guided missiles, and air force, Navy, and Army strike coordination.

Here's what we know so far:

The Indian Armed Forces launched ‘Operation Sindoor’ on Wednesday, targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan.

The operation was carried out in response to the recent Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen.

A total of nine terrorist infrastructure sites were hit during the operation, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

The strikes focused on areas from where attacks against India were reportedly being planned and directed.

The MoD clarified that the operation was focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature.

The government reaffirmed its commitment to holding those responsible for the Pahalgam attack accountable.

A detailed briefing on Operation Sindoor is scheduled to take place later today.

In a post on X, the Indian Army said, “Justice is served. Jai Hind!”

Pakistan violated the Ceasefire Agreement by firing artillery in Bhimber Gali, located in the Poonch-Rajouri area of Jammu and Kashmir, hours after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh publicly expressed national pride following Operation Sindoor, declaring ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" in support of the armed forces.

Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath voiced support for the military by posting ""Jai Hind! Jai Hind Ki Sena!"" on social media.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal also backed the strikes, sharing “Bharat Mata Ki Jai #OperationSindoor” in a post online.

US President Donald Trump said he had just been informed about India’s Operation Sindoor as he entered the Oval Office, calling the situation ""a shame"".

Trump remarked that ""people knew something was going to happen,"" suggesting the strike was anticipated due to past tensions.

He commented on the historical India-Pakistan conflict, saying they’ve been fighting “for centuries” and added, “I hope it ends very quickly.”

NEW DELHI: India has launched a major military operation, codenamed Operation Sindoor , targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK and in a direct response to the Pahalgam terror attack that left 26 people dead, including 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen.The strikes come amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following the Pahalgam massacre, where most of the victims were reportedly tourists. The ministry of defence has stated that a detailed briefing on Operation Sindoor will be held later today to provide further clarity on the objectives, outcomes, and intelligence behind the mission.A total of nine (9) sites have been precisely targeted. Our operations have been deliberate, restrained, and non-escalatory. No Pakistani military installations were struck. India has exercised significant restraint in both the choice of targets and the manner of execution. These actions follow the heinous terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which claimed the lives of 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national. We remain firmly committed to holding those responsible accountable. A detailed briefing on ‘OPERATION SINDOOR’ will be provided later today, the defence ministry said.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared that Pakistan reserves the full right to deliver a firm response to what he described as an act of war by India—adding that such a response is already underway.He added that the entire nation stands united behind the Pakistan Armed Forces, with national morale and determination running high.“The Pakistani nation and the Pakistan Armed Forces know very well how to deal with the enemy,” he said. “We will never let the enemy succeed in its nefarious objectives.”The operation targeted nine locations, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke. Utilizing advanced precision weapons and intelligence-based targeting, the Army, Navy, and Air Force coordinated the strikes without engaging Pakistani military sites. The defence ministry called the operation “focused and non-escalatory.” Prime Minister Modi had earlier vowed a strong response to terrorism, granting the military full operational freedom. Operation Sindoor, the Army stated, was India’s answer: “Justice is Served.”","The Indian Armed Forces launched ‘Operation Sindoor’ on Wednesday, targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan.

'Cover fire for terrorists': Indian envoy blasts Irish Times over Pahalgam terror attack editorial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cover-fire-for-terrorists-indian-envoy-blasts-irish-times-over-pahalgam-terror-attack-editorial/articleshow/120938544.cms,"(PTI photo)

Poll Do you agree with the Indian ambassador's criticism of The Irish Times editorial regarding the Pahalgam terror attack? No, I think the editorial was justified. Yes, I support the ambassador's stance.

NEW DELHI: Indian ambassador to Ireland Akhilesh Mishra has issued a strong rebuttal to The Irish Times over its editorial on the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, accusing the publication of downplaying terrorism and echoing narratives that provide ""cover fire"" to its perpetrators.In a post on X, Mishra condemned the editorial for failing to unequivocally denounce the terror attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in Jammu and Kashmir. Instead, he mentioned, it chose to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “rattling sabres,” and drew an equivalence between India and Pakistan, a country Mishra described as the ""global epicentre of terrorism.""“Our reply to a malicious Irish Times editorial on the terrorist attack in Pahalgam,” India envoy wrote. “Instead of condemning terror and sympathising with innocent victims, it provides cover fire for the terrorists and their sponsors by charging PM Modi of rattling sabres and equating India with Pakistan.”In a letter to the editor, Mishra called the editorial unprofessional and biased, stating that it stood in stark contrast to the support and solidarity expressed by Irish citizens and leaders, including Taoiseach Micheál Martin.He highlighted that while world leaders - including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen - and institutions like the UN Security Council had condemned the attack in the strongest terms, the editorial omitted these facts and instead questioned India’s response.“The UN Security Council... underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice. The Irish Times failed to mention this main operative portion of the UN statement,” Mishra wrote.Refuting the editorial's portrayal of post-2019 Jammu and Kashmir, Indian ambassador Mishra specified that the region has seen major progress since the abrogation of Article 370, with rising investments, a tourism boom, and high voter turnout in the recent Lok Sabha elections.“Contrary to The Irish Times’ misperception… the people have witnessed unprecedented economic and infrastructural development… A democratic government was elected in 2024 with 63.9% turnout,” the letter said.Mishra also pointed to national unity in the aftermath of the attack, saying the entire country, including opposition parties and Kashmiri civil society, was firmly behind the Centre's resolve to act against the perpetrators.The Irish Times editorial, published on April 28, had stated that while Pakistan denied involvement and offered to cooperate with an international investigation, India had not presented evidence beyond historical claims. It accused PM Modi of ""rattling sabres"" and warned against escalation.In response to the April 22 attack, India has taken several strong steps, including suspending long-standing Indus Waters Treaty, in a firm response to Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism.","Indian ambassador to Ireland Akhilesh Mishra has issued a strong rebuttal to The Irish Times over its editorial on the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: Indian Armed Forces targeted the headquarters of banned terror groups Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in a series of precision strikes carried out at nine sites in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in early hours of Wednesday, PTI reported citing officials.Bahawalpur emerged as the stronghold of JeM terror group following the release of Masood Azhar in 1999, secured in exchange for the hostages of hijacked flight IC-814.

He founded the terror group in January 2000 with backing from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), senior Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden, and various Sunni sectarian groups in Pakistan, officials said.Muridke, located 30 km from Lahore, has served as the headquarters of LeT since 1990 under the leadership of Hafiz Saeed.The group, led by Saeed was behind the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and has orchestrated strikes across India, including in J&K, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, PTI reported citing officials.Among the nine sites targeted are the JeM headquarters in Bahawalpur and the LeT's in Muridke, both in Pakistan, they said.

‘Pak to hike def spending by 18 per cent'

An IED blast carried out by Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) targeting a Pakistan army convoy in MachKachhi district on Monday killed at least eight soldiers, including a special operations commander, and injured six others.BLA said its freedom fighters targeted the army convoy using a remote-controlled device. The blast destroyed the enemy vehicle, killing multiple personnel, it said. The Pakistan armed force’s media and public relations wing, ISPR, alleged India’s involvement in the attack, a claim that has become a recurring narrative in such incidents. “Terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy, so called Baloch Liberation Army, targeted security forces’ vehicles with an improvised explosive device in the general area Mach-Kachhi district. Resultantly, seven personnel embraced shahadat,” ISPR said.However, according to a list of deceased released by local officials, eight personnel were killed in the attack. The army vehicle was hit between the Amir Post and the Ali Khan base in the Gestri area, according to local enforcement officers.The attack is the latest in a series of strikes against the Pakistan army in Balochistan, highlighting the ongoing tensions in the region.Three days ago, BLA attacked a prison van by blocking a key highway. While the prisoners were freed, five policemen were taken hostage.Pakistan’s coalition govt has endorsed an 18% increase in defence spending to over Rs 2.5 trillion in the next budget due to tensions with India, according to a media report on Tuesday.

The PML-N-led govt shared the roughly Rs 17.5 trillion worth of new budget framework with PPP, which agreed to the 18% increase in defence outlay.There was a consensus between the allies to increase the defence budget due to the recent wave of tensions with India, the newspaper said. In the current fiscal, govt allocated Rs 2,122 billion for defence.

NEW DELHI: A drill to check Delhi's preparedness for emergency situations such as air raids, blackouts and evacuations in case of attacks is all set to take place in 55 locations across the capital at 4pm Wednesday, as part of a national exercise.Under ' Operation Abhyaas ', air-raid sirens will be sounded and residents will be trained on evacuation protocols, and search and rescue operations, among other measures.While a total blackout may not take place as it will require coordination with the Northern Powergrid and may bring the city to a standstill, officials said sporadic power cuts may be carried out in pockets.In Ghaziabad, sirens will go off twice, at 10am and 8pm. In Gurgaon, a voluntary ""blackout"" will be observed between 7pm and 8pm. Noida, which does not have a civil defence unit, will have a different drill.The drill is aimed at gauging how quickly the civilian population responds to an emergency, such as an air strike, in a war-like situation.The directive for the drill came from the Union home ministry in light of “new and complex threats” emerging due to heightened tensions with Pakistan following the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, where 26 civilians — 25 of them tourists — were shot dead on April 22.Officials said the drill will take place simultaneously at 55 locations across the 11 districts of the capital. These will include educational institutions, markets, residential pockets, housing societies, hospitals, and govt installations. More than 7,000 Civil Defence volunteers and 1,800 Aapda Mitras, who are trained in disaster response by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), will be at the forefront of the drill, along with local police, traffic police, fire services, and home guards, besides the departments of revenue, health, transport, education, and power, among others.CM Rekha Gupta said the national capital was “fully prepared” for the drill. “Every activity is being undertaken as per the directions of the Centre,” she said. A senior revenue department official said the exercise will be a test of how well-oiled, robust, and alert the civil defence mechanism is.The day will start with special training programmes for students in 660 schools – 550 private and 110 state-run – on disaster response. Officials said a demonstration video has been shared to help schools understand how to conduct a drill.The directorate of education issued a circular Tuesday, directing schools to ensure full participation in the drill and to cooperate with the visiting DDMA teams “in the right spirit, with the aim of promoting a culture of safety, preparedness and civic responsibility among students”. Officials added that the drills will continue and training will be imparted to students in all schools over the next fortnight.Volunteer platform Yuvamanthan will depute teams to assist schools with the awareness programmes and basic drills for hostile threat preparedness, an official said. “The demonstration video shared with the schools shows teachers responding to an alarm by closing doors, windows and curtains, and switching off electrical appliances. Students are instructed to take cover under their desks or near walls, protecting their heads with their school bags and hands. Senior students will also be trained to guide the younger ones and help maintain calm,” said an official.The civil defence exercise will also involve the district controller, various district authorities, civil defence wardens and volunteers, home guards (both active and reservists), as well as members of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS), Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) and students from schools and colleges. The directorate of education has asked all govt and private aided schools to submit a report, along with photographs of the drill, to their respective district education offices on Wednesday.The drill for civilians will begin in the evening. Standard operating procedures have been distributed to all departments, resident and market associations, and institutions, and a communication strategy has been developed, an official said. Civilians will familiarise themselves with the sounds of the air-raid siren — long wails for alerts and short bursts for all-clear — identify nearest shelter locations such as basements, underground car parks or designated safe zones and keep ready items such as a torch, emergency kit and water bottles, among others, the official said. “Following the drill, we will carry out a complete assessment of the state of equipment and communication devices,” an official said.","The drill is aimed at gauging how quickly the civilian population responds to an emergency, such as an air strike, in a war-like situation.

NEW DELHI: The United Nations Security Council's closed-door meeting on rising India-Pakistan tensions expectedly failed to yield any substantive outcome for Pakistan.Indian govt sources said Pakistan's efforts to internationalise the issue made little headway as UNSC advised Islamabad to resolve issues bilaterally with India and sought accountability for the Pahalgam attack , while expressing concern over Pakistan's nuclear rhetoric and missile tests.In the 90-minute meeting, the member-states are learnt to have condemned the April 22 attack and posed ""tough questions"" about the likely involvement of UN-proscribed Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba While views were expressed individually by some after the consultations, the Council didn't collectively make any statement. The least Pakistan would have hoped for is an oral statement by the Council president.Former Indian permanent representative to UN Syed Akbaruddin said Pakistan's quest to resurrect an agenda item which has not been deliberated upon formally since 1965 by Council expectedly didn't take off. Pakistan is a non-permanent UNSC member currently.""The lack of a response by the Council to Pakistan's briefing is a vindication of Indian stance,"" said Akbaruddin, who was India's ambassador to the UN when Pakistan last sought closed-door consultations through China in 2019. That was after India revoked J&K's special status in Aug 2019.The 2019 meeting too had ended without any outcome or formal statement even though China had strongly pushed for it. Closed-door meetings comprise informal discussions that are held not in Council room but in an adjacent chamber with limited number of delegates.For Pakistan, as in 2019, the latest meeting too was more an exercise in managing public perception than advancing any meaningful discussions, even though the consultations were held under the India-Pakistan Question that relates to J&K and not under, as it was meant to be initially, the generic 'Threats to International Peace and Security' agenda item.In the meeting, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, members disapproved of false flag narrative initially propounded by Pakistan and asked about the likely involvement of LeT in the attack. There were questions about targeting of tourists based on their religious identity. ""There was condemnation of the attack and recognition of the need for accountability. Some members specifically brought up the targeting of tourists on basis of their religious faith,"" said a source, adding many members expressed concern that Pakistan's missile tests and nuclear rhetoric were escalatory factors.Before the meeting, some Council members were reported to have backed the idea of an independent international investigation into the attack. According to the Security Council Report, China and Greece appeared to have already indicated - before the meeting - their support for such an investigation. Such a probe though will need the consent of both India and Pakistan.Pakistan issued a statement after the meet in which it said Council members expressed ""deep concern"" over the risk of escalation and urged restraint. It also claimed several members underscored that the J&K dispute remained the root cause of regional instability.",Indian govt sources said Pakistan's efforts to internationalise the issue made little headway.

Border states J&K, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat will spearhead Wednesday the nation's largest coordinated civil defence exercise in decades, featuring blackouts, sirens, and evacuation drills across hundreds of districts as part of "" Operation Abhyaas "" - a nationwide emergency preparedness campaign prompted by rising Indo-Pak tensions following the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives.Simultaneously, civil aviation authorities said Tuesday a separate IAF drill in western India will begin Wednesday night. Key airports like Delhi and Bengaluru will hold disaster management activities. Airlines said operations are expected to continue unaffected, though passengers should check flight status.The drills will focus on civilian and infrastructure safety in the event of aerial strikes. In Rajasthan, multiple districts will conduct coordinated air raid simulations, with Kota and Rawatbhata designated as high-sensitivity zones due to their thermal power, uranium storage, and nuclear facilities.Western border districts like Barmer and Jaisalmer will deploy over 1,000 civil defence personnel, while BSF will maintain close surveillance and coordination.Jaipur will activate 10 sirens and conduct a 10-20 minute blackout to test emergency responses under low visibility. ""Residents should stay calm,"" Jaipur DC JK Soni said.Gujarat will activate air raid sirens at all vital installations at 4.30pm, followed by a strict blackout from 7.30 to 8pm. ""No light should be visible from outside homes or offices,"" said minister of state for home Harsh Sanghavi.In Punjab, border district Tarn Taran - originally omitted due to an outdated 2005 list - has been added to the schedule.

NEW DELHI: India will launch a major air combat exercise close to the international border in Rajasthan with frontline fighters like Rafales, Mirage-2000s & Sukhoi-30MKIs as well as force-multipliers, in some more muscle-flexing to keep Pakistan on the edge after naval drills in the north Arabian Sea.A NOTAM (notice to airmen) for airspace reservation has been issued for the exercise over a large area hugging the border with Pakistan from 3.30pm on Wednesday to 9.30pm on Thursday, officials said.The public warning came as Indian and Pakistan armies Tuesday talked over the director-general of military operations (DGMO) hotline, while they continued to exchange small arms fire at multiple places across Line of Control for the 12th successive night.The high-tempo air drill, which the IAF described as a ""routine pre-planned training exercise"", will include the entire spectrum of day and night warfare under simulated hostile conditions. This is in keeping with the high operational readiness being maintained by the Indian armed forces, as various military options against Pakistan are being kept open by govt.Fighters, helicopters, remotely-piloted aircraft and force-enablers like IL-78 mid-air refuellers and airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft will be deployed from different air bases for the exercise. Rajasthan itself has some key airbases like Jaisalmer, Uttarlai, Suratgarh, Nal and Phalodi.The IAF exercise mirrors the Navy's multiple drills conducted in the northern Arabian Sea last week, with several frontline warships being deployed and BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other weapon systems being tested. One specified zone was just around 80-85 nautical miles from where the Pakistan navy was undertaking its own drills.The show of force has now been extended from the maritime to the air domain. The IAF has been undertaking regular combat air patrols (CAPs) amid the heightened tensions with Pakistan, while it has also increased the number of operational readiness platforms (ORPs) at airbases on the western front.Over the DGMO hotline, through which talks traditionally take place every Tuesday, the Indian Army is learnt to have raised the issue of Pakistan army posts opening ""unprovoked"" small arms fire at several locations across the 778-km long LoC.The exchanges with rifles and LMGs took place in areas like Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch, Rajouri, Mendhar, Naushera, Sunderbani and Akhnoor on Monday night, with Indian troops ""responding promptly in a proportionate manner"", an officer said.While heavy-calibre weapons like 155mm artillery guns and 120mm mortars are not yet being used by either side, this upward spiral in ceasefire violations (CFVs) - since the Pahalgam terror massacre - was last witnessed when India had scrapped the provisions of Article 370 in Aug 2019.It had led to a particularly violent 2020, with as many as 5,133 CFVs of firing and artillery duels being recorded that year. In Feb 2021, the two DGMOs had reached a fresh understanding to maintain peace and tranquillity along the LoC and the 198-km international boundary in J&K. Earlier, in May 2018, a similar understanding between the DGMOs had gradually withered away with escalation in cross-border hostilities.","India will launch a major air combat exercise close to the international border in Rajasthan.

Though he did not elaborate, the assertion was seen as another sign that the counsel of a few foreign capitals for restraint might not be a determining factor in how the Modi govt responds to the Pakistan-backed terror attack.""For decades, we had this negative mindset where people would worry before taking a big decision, 'what will the world think, will we get votes or not'? And decisions and big reforms languished due to such considerations,"" he said.The audience's response, like in Modi's earlier public speeches post-Pahalgam, was indicative of the strong desire for retaliation against Pakistan. The crowd started applauding as soon as he said that these days, water had become a hot topic of discussion. ""You people are really smart, got it right immediately,"" an indulgent PM said.Modi, in keeping with the 'India@2047' theme of the event, focused his speech on development. He said for decades, the water of our rivers was a subject of tension and conflict, but the govt, in collaboration with state govts, had launched a massive campaign to link rivers. ""The Ken-Betwa link project and the Parvati-Kalisindh-Chambal link project will benefit millions of farmers,"" the PM said as he cited several examples to claim that the decisions of his govt were merit-based unlike past govts, which were more considerate about vote bank and their own survival.The PM said when people looked at country now, they could proudly say ""democracy can deliver"", and stressed that the govt was moving from a GDP-centric approach to progress based on Gross Empowerment of People (GEP).Referring to the new waqf law, Modi said the need for reforming the law was being felt for decades, but to satisfy a vote bank, even this noble work was defamed. ""Now amendments have been made which in real sense will help poor Muslim mothers and sisters & poor Pasmanda Muslims.""","PM Narendra Modi said the water, which belonged to the country, would flow in India's favour and be used by India only. His first remarks after New Delhi decided to pause operation of the water treaty under which waters of Indus, Jhelum and Chenab have been earmarked for Pakistan.

Police won't interfere in BBMB ops, Punjab's counsel assures HC

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court Tuesday urged restraint from both Punjab and Haryana over their water-sharing dispute , saying: ""We do this to enemy nations - let us not do it to our own states.""The division bench of CJ Sheel Nagu and Justice Sumeet Goel made the oral observation while hearing a petition filed by Bhakra Beas Management Board , which alleged a forcible takeover of Nangal dam and Lohand control room by Punjab police. The matter was disposed of after Punjab's counsel Gurminder Singh assured the court that state police would not interfere in BBMB operations .Punjab's counsel Gurminder Singh assured the court that state police would not interfere in BBMB operations and submitted an affidavit to that effect. BBMB's counsel Rajesh Garg said Punjab had deployed 55 police personnel - up from the usual 15 - and taken over dam operations without justification. ""Instead of arm twisting, Punjab govt should approach central govt,"" Garg said, calling the move unprecedented. He cited an email from BBMB's chief engineer confirming the takeover and referenced a Delhi HC judgment mandating the board supply 1,049 cusecs of water daily to Delhi.The court was told that political party workers had been present at the dam ""to trouble the operations"" and that Punjab was using the pretext of security to exert control. Punjab countered that law and order is a state subject and, given rising Indo-Pak tensions, it had acted to secure a sensitive installation.Additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain, representing Centre, said BBMB resolution remains valid and that Punjab should challenge it through legal channels rather than obstruct operations. ""What if tomorrow Himachal Pradesh, from where the water originates, decides to block it?"" he asked.BBMB has requested the deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF), such as CISF, to secure the dam. While the bench declined to issue an order for CAPF deployment, it said central installations are typically protected by paramilitary forces. The court said it would pass a formal order later.",Punjab's counsel Gurminder Singh assured the court that state police would not interfere in BBMB operations.

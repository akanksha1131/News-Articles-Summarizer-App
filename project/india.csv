AHEMDABAD: Counting of votes in the bypoll to the Vav assembly seat in Gujarat's Banaskantha district, where ruling BJP and opposition Congress were the main contenders, began on Saturday morning. The vote count for the bypoll held on November 13 commenced at 8 am at an engineering college in Jagana village, officials said.Nearly 160 election officials and 400 personnel of the Gujarat police and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) have been deployed at the counting centre, the office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) for Gujarat has said. A voter turnout of 70.55 per cent was recorded in the by-election. Out of the 3.10 lakh registered voters, nearly 2.19 lakh exercised their franchise at 321 polling booths using EVMs and VVPAT machines.The Vav seat fell vacant following the resignation of Congress MLA Geniben Thakor, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Banaskantha in June. Congress candidate and former MLA Gulabsinh Rajput and BJP's Swaroopji Thakor are the main contestants, but the presence of BJP rebel Mavji Patel has made the bypoll a three-way fight. Patel (73), who comes from the dominant Chaudhary community, was suspended as BJP's primary member on Sunday for his decision to contest as an independent candidate.Seven other candidates - six independents and one from the Bharatiya Jan Parishad party - were also in the fray for the bypoll. BJP's Thakor had lost from the seat, a Congress bastion, to opposition party candidate Geniben Thakor in the 2022 assembly polls.The constituency has been a Congress stronghold, with Geniben winning the seat in 2017 and again in 2022. Patel had won the Vav seat in 1990 as a Janata Dal candidate. He then joined the opposition Congress, but switched to the ruling BJP in 2019 after being denied a ticket from Tharad seat in the 2017 assembly polls.","Counting of votes in the bypoll to the Vav assembly seat in Gujarat's Banaskantha district began on Saturday morning.

BAGALKOT: In a shocking twist to the incident of a hair dryer exploding in the hands of a woman recently, leaving her maimed, Karnataka police have arrested a person who allegedly planted a detonator inside the appliance with the intention to kill.However, in a bizarre turn of events, it ended up maiming the accused's paramour rather than his purported target - a woman who was opposed to their relationship.Accused is Siddappa Sheelavant alias Hudedmani, 35, of Kurtageri village in Karnataka's Koppal. The hair dryer was originally couriered to a woman, Shashikala, on Nov 15. Since she was not at home, she requested the delivery man to hand it over to one of her neighbours, Basavarajeshwari, to collect the parcel and open it. However, as soon as Basavarajeshwari switched it on, it exploded, severing her hands.Though police had initially suspected an electrical short circuit as reason behind the blast, investigation revealed that it was Siddappa who had plotted to kill Shashikala for objecting to his affair with Basavarajeshwari. Sources said Siddappa and Basavarajeshwari were from the same village and were in a relationship. Their affair continued after the death of Basavarajeshwari's husband Papanna Yarnal, an ex-armyman.Bagalkot SP Amarnath Reddy said a few months ago, Basavarajeshwari introduced her friend and neighbour Shashikala to Siddappa. Once Shashikala came to know about the affair, she advised Basavarajeshwari to avoid Siddappa, which she did. This angered Siddappa and led him to plot the lethal, booby-trap attack.Police said Siddappa's job at a granite company for past 16 years had made him familiar with detonators and their use. He bought a hair dryer and fixed a detonator - commonly used for blasting rocks at quarries - in it.","Accused is Siddappa Sheelavant alias Hudedmani, 35, of Kurtageri village in Karnataka's Koppal.

MOSCOW: Amid govt's big push for more Vande Bharats, railways is yet to finalise the design for the semi-high-speed train 's new sleeper coach version, even after 14 months of it signing a Rs 55,000 crore contract with Russian firm TMH under a joint venture. The reasons for the hold-up are need for more toilets in a coach (four instead of three), a pantry car in every train set, and luggage space in each coach - issues that could lead to an increase in project cost and roll-out delay.The matter was taken up at a high-level committee meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and first deputy PM of Russia Denis Manturov in Delhi last week, TMH CEO Kirill Lipa said. He added that even Russian President Vladimir Putin is aware of the issue.""We raised this issue during the meeting. It's not that we are seeking some pressure from Russian govt, but we want Indian Railways to give us key explanations. For that, we need some support from Indian govt,"" Kirill said.TMH is the major shareholder in Kinet Railway Solutions, SPV of the Russian firm and Indian Railways PSU RVNL. It bagged the contract and signed an agreement with Indian Railways in Sept 2023 to manufacture 1,920 Vande Bharat sleeper coaches and maintain them for 35 years.Kirill said till May this year, they were hopeful of rolling out the first prototype of the train by year-end. ""But Indian Railways sought changes in the design and we had to rework. These changes are creating need for time and for additional budget,"" he said. Kinet has also sought compensation for changes in design.A railway spokesperson said the ""technical modifications"" were sought as per the contract agreement and Kinet gave responses ""after a gap of 4-5 months"". The response is under examination.(The reporter is in Moscow on invitation of the Russian foreign affairs ministry)","The hold-up is need for more toilets in a coach, a pantry car in every train set, and luggage space in each coach.

HYDERABAD: Telangana HC Friday set aside a single judge order of Sept 9 directing assembly secretary to convey within four weeks a time frame for adjudicating disqualification pleas against three turncoat BRS MLAs pending before the Speaker. The trio had joined Congress.The bench said that the Speaker must decide the pleas against Danam Nagender, Kadiam Srihari and Tellam Venkat Rao within a ""reasonable time"".The bench stressed that the Speaker, as chairman of the tribunal constituted under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, must keep in mind the purpose of this schedule and resultant anti-defection law .""The Speaker shall bear in mind the concept of reasonable time by taking into account the period of pendency of the disqualification petitions , the object of inclusion of Tenth Schedule to the Constitution as well as the tenure of the assembly,"" the bench further explained.The assembly secretary had challenged the single judge order, contending that courts could review decisions only after the Speaker took them and not before that. While BRS had filed three separate pleas seeking disqualification, BJP lodged a separate petition seeking disqualification of Nagender who had contested as Secunderabad LS Congress candidate immediately after getting elected as Khairatabad MLA on a BRS ticket.","Telangana HC Friday set aside a single judge order of Sept 9 directing assembly secretary to convey within four weeks a time frame for adjudicating disqualification pleas against three turncoat BRS MLAs.

"Final design of Vande Bharat sleeper trains stuck after railways seek for more toilets, luggage space & pantry car",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-design-of-vande-bharat-sleeper-trains-stuck-after-railways-seek-for-more-toilets-luggage-space-pantry-car/articleshow/115565486.cms,"MOSCOW: Amid the big push for Vande Bharat trains , the railways is yet to finalise the design for these new trains with sleeper coaches even 14 months after it signed an agreement with an Indo-Russian joint venture (JV). What has held up the freezing design is the need for more toilets, new luggage zones in every coach and a pantry car in each train to meet Indian requirements.“If Indian Railways will postpone the process, the timeline for execution will definitely be impacted…We are keen to start production quickly. To my feelings, what we are discussing can all be resolved at the same time, within two hours. We are spending months just sending letters and waiting for the explanations,” said Kirill Lipa, CEO of TMH , the major shareholder in the JV that has got the contract to manufacture 1,920 Vande Bharat sleeper coaches or.Kinet Railway Solutions, the SPV of TMH and Indian Railways’ PSU, RVNL to execute the project, bagged the Rs 55,000 crore contract to manufacture Vande Bharat sleeper trains and the agreement was signed in September last year. TMH is among the top five railway companies across the globe with more than 1 lakh manpower.Lipa said till May this year they were hopeful of rolling out the first prototype of the train by the year end. But the Indian Railways sought changes in the design of the coaches and they had to rework. “These changes are creating the need for time and for additional budget,” he added. The SPV has sought compensation for the changes in design.However, he said they are hopeful of rolling out the prototype by the second quarter of next year and as per the contract, they need to do so by the end of 2025.An official spokesperson of TMH said while in the original contract the condition was to manufacture 120 trains and each having 16 coaches, now it needs to produce 80 trains and each having 24 coaches. In place of the earlier condition for three toilets in every coach, now Kinet has to provide four lavatories, and every train needs to have a pantry car, which was not in the original tender conditions. The railways also sought space for luggage zones in each coach, which was not there earlier.A railway spokesperson said the “technical modifications” were sought as per the contract agreement and Kinet gave the responses “after a gap of 4-5 months” and their response is under examination. The railway said, “Looking into the future requirements of travelling passengers on the Indian Railways network, it has been decided to opt for 24 coaches in future.”Lipa said while the composition of each train so far as the number of coaches are concerned is not an issue at all, changes in design is a complex process. “It’s not the design of the coaches itself. The significant changes have been about the design. For example, we got the demand to increase the number of toilets. If you put this additional toilet into the coach, it seems there is no problem. But the problem comes from engineering. We need certain systems for this, and it means you need to change the whole layout of the coach; reshape the design and engineering infrastructure within the coach. You need to change in terms of windows and seats. So, when we have some deviations like this, it unfortunately brings us back in terms of design because the old design is more or less completely finished,” the TMH CEO said.On the fresh requirement of a pantry car in each train, he said this is not just about cooking, but this must be done as per the standards of railways and fire system for security of wires. “We need a very clear explanation from the customer of what exactly it wants to have in a pantry; what are the terms and conditions. It needs electricity, heating and water supply. You need to put certain cable and pipes in the train and not just in the one pantry car. Once again, the trainset will be redesigned to some extent,” Lipa said.He said since these were key changes as compared to the original contract they have sought resigning of the contract with modifications to avoid any legal problem in future. Lipa said they have sent letters to the Indian railways and recently on September 27. “We have given official letters to Indian Railways mentioning point by point what should be done in terms of resigning of the contract and we are ready to do it. It has not been resigned yet,” he added.The CEO said the matter was raised even at the India Russia Inter-Governmental Commission for Trade, Economic, Scientific and Cultural Cooperation (IRIGEC-TEC) meeting in Delhi last week, which was chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Lipa said, “We raised this issue during the meeting, and we hope it was raised in the right manner and at the right level. It’s not that we are seeking some pressure from the Russian govt but we want the Indian railways to give us key explanations. And for that, we definitely need some support from the govt leaders in India. I believe that after this meeting we will find solutions.”","Kinet Railway Solutions, the SPV of TMH and Indian Railways’ PSU, RVNL to execute the project, bagged the Rs 55,000 crore contract to manufacture Vande Bharat sleeper trains and the agreement was signed in September last year.

Rahul Gandhi's exit paved way for Priyanka



Three-way contest in Wayanad



Congress's stronghold at stake



Priyanka's campaign rallies draw large crowds



The Wayanad parliamentary seat has captured national attention as Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra makes her electoral debut, contesting in the crucial bypoll from the constituency.Vadra faces competition from CPI veteran Sathyan Mokeri and BJP's Navya Haridas, with all eyes on whether she can replicate the victory of her brother, Rahul Gandhi, who vacated the seat earlier this year.Also read: Election results Of the 9.52 lakh votes polled, the district Congress leadership estimates close to six lakh votes for her. Its estimates for LDF candidate Sathyan Mokeri and BJP candidate Navya Haridas are close to two lakh and one lakh votes, respectively.“We are not at all worried about the victory or majority Priyanka Gandhi will secure. The low voter turnout will not impact the majority,” AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said, adding that AICC was examining the reasons for the “unexpected” low voter turnout.Also read: Bypoll Election Results 2024 Rahul Gandhi, who had held the Wayanad seat since 2019, announced his decision to vacate the constituency following his election in the 2024 general elections.Rahul, having secured victories in both Wayanad and Rae Bareli, chose to retain his seat in Uttar Pradesh, leading to the need for a by-poll in Wayanad. The Congress then nominated Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from the seat.Priyanka Gandhi’s entry into the electoral fray has triggered a high-profile contest in Wayanad, where she faces 15 other candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the LDF and Navya Haridas of the NDA. With political dynamics at play, this by-poll has become more than just a local contest.EC has taken extensive steps to ensure a smooth voting process, setting up 1,354 polling booths across the constituency, all equipped with webcasting facilities to monitor the election in real-time.Historically, Wayanad has been a Congress stronghold, with the party winning the seat in every election since its creation in 2008. Rahul Gandhi's victories in 2019 and 2024 were resounding, securing margins of 4.3 lakh and 3.6 lakh votes, respectively.However, the UDF (United Democratic Front) is now banking on Priyanka Gandhi’s popularity to carry the seat once again. The Congress hopes that her appeal, coupled with the party's traditional support base among minorities, settler farmers, and tribal communities, will help secure a significant win.Priyanka Gandhi’s campaign rallies have been marked by large female audiences, a trend that the UDF interprets as a positive sign for her electoral prospects.The rally crowds, coupled with the groundwork being laid by the party in the form of door-to-door outreach and community engagements, indicated that Priyanka positioned herself as a fresh and dynamic face for the constituency.","The Wayanad parliamentary seat has captured national attention as Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra makes her electoral debut.

Amit Shah's stern message to Delhi cops: 'Laxity unacceptable',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-ticks-off-delhi-police-over-rising-crime/articleshow/115579318.cms,"Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: In a stern message to Delhi Police commissioner Sanjay Arora and his deputies, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday made it clear to the police brass that law and order was top priority and any laxity was ""unacceptable"".Expressing concern over the rising crime in the national capital, Shah is learnt to have warned senior cops that if crime was not brought under control soon, officials, from top to bottom, would be replaced.He specifically warned the special cell and the crime branch to work with utmost seriousness, sources said. ""When two special commissioners tried to cover up, Shah apparently snubbed them saying 'rehne dijiye' and 'bandh kijiye', indicating how miffed he was with the functioning of Delhi Police,"" a source said.Shah was expected to visit the Delhi Police headquarters on Friday but instead the police chief and five-six special CPs were summoned to Ministry of Home Affairs and the home minister apparently didn't mince words while engaging with them for around 15 minutes. Union home secretary Govind Mohan then reviewed their working for about one and a half hours. The Intelligence Bureau director and a few others were also present.The home minister reiterated that it was the personal responsibility of all Delhi Police personnel to ensure that every Delhiite felt completely safe. He also stressed the need for the special cell and the crime branch to be completely revamped. ""Safai kijiye,"" he warned. This year, barring two central agency-aided operations, the cell has not conducted a single major anti-terror operation.To address the growing concerns over crime in Delhi, Shah directed police to create special action plans and run campaigns in important areas related to civil security. ""The aim is to ensure that criminals are afraid of police and citizens feel assured of their safety,"" he said. ""You are good people, but you are not in sync.""The safety of children, women and senior citizens should be the top priority, Shah emphasised.The home minister's directives come amid growing concerns over the deteriorating law and order situation in Delhi. Organised crimes like extortion and shooting incidents have skyrocketed and street crimes had risen drastically. Police have been citing data to claim a decline in crime trends, but on-ground situation has been narrating a different story. In any case, MHA was clear that much needs to be done to ensure the safety and security of Delhi's residents.","Amit Shah is learnt to have warned senior cops that if crime was not brought under control soon, officials, from top to bottom, would be replaced.

We will discuss govt formation,"" former minister and UBT Sena politician Anil Parab said. The meeting was attended by Parab, UBT Sena MPs Sanjay Raut and Anil Desai, and Congress' Balasaheb Thorat.Raut said Sena (UBT) had made 'arrangements' in Mumbai for their MLAs from rural parts of the state to stay. ""Old MLAs have some arrangements but new ones may not,"" he said.Sharad Pawar claimed on Friday that MVA would secure 157 seats, while Uddhav Thackeray put the number at 160. MPCC president Nana Patole was confident of 150 to 155 seats. Sources in Congress said an internal survey revealed that MVA would win 158 seats, while Mahayuti would get 113. The survey stated that BJP would emerge as the single-largest party with 67 seats.AICC general secretary Ramesh Chennithala rejected reports that MVA would want to shift its legislators to neighbouring states. ""Our legislators have remained loyal even during the worst crises, so there is no need to shift them out of Maharashtra,"" he said.Parab said specific instructions had been given to all MVA candidates that they should be alert during counting of votes and if any untoward incident took place, it should be brought to the notice of the returning officer immediately; if there was no response, the matter should be escalated.Chennithala said he was confident MVA would form the govt ""with a clear majority"" and that there was no dispute over the CM's post. The decision on the CM would be taken after consulting all senior MVA functionaries and the AICC brass, he said.Incidentally, in the past five years, the state has seen two rounds of hotel and resort politics - once in 2019 when Shiv Sena walked out of the alliance with BJP and formed MVA, and then in 2022, when Eknath Shinde rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray's leadership with 40 MLAs. While in 2019, several MLAs from NCP had flown to Surat and then returned to form the MVA govt, in 2022, Sena MLAs backing Shinde first went to Surat, then Guwahati and then to Goa, from where they returned after Shinde took oath as CM.","Maha Vikas Aghadi comprising NCP (SP), Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress has summoned all its winning candidates to Mumbai immediately after the poll results are declared on Saturday.

'Ludicrous, smear campaign': India rejects Canadian media report on Nijjar killing

Globe and Mail report

NEW DELHI: Canada on Friday issued a statement clarifying that it has no evidence linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, or National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to criminal activities in the country.""On October 14, because of a significant and ongoing threat to public safety, the RCMP and officials took the extraordinary step of making public accusations of serious criminal activity in Canada perpetrated by agents of the Government of India,"" statement issued by intelligence advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau read as.""The government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada. Any suggestion to the contrary is both speculative and inaccurate,"" it added.This comes after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October had publicly accused India of conducting covert operations in Canada that posed a significant threat to public safety. Trudeau claimed that Canadian officials had made multiple attempts to collaborate with Indian authorities but faced consistent refusals.The Canadian Prime Minister stated that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had compelling evidence linking Indian government agents to activities such as information-gathering and coercion, including involvement in serious criminal acts. Trudeau condemned these actions and called for respect for Canada's sovereignty.India had categorically rejected these allegations, labelling them as baseless and politically motivated. The ministry of external affairs said that Trudeau’s government was using anti-India rhetoric for domestic political gains. They pointed to his past actions, including associations with political groups that advocate for separatism in India, as evidence of his longstanding hostility towards India.The MEA also criticised Canada for providing a platform to extremist elements, especially in light of the investigation into Nijjar’s murder.Following this, India expelled six Canadian diplomats and recalled its High Commissioner from Canada. The MEA summoned Canada’s charge d’affaires, Stewart Wheeler, to express discontent over the allegations and warned that further retaliatory actions could follow. India’s government, meanwhile, dismissed the claims of Modi’s involvement in Nijjar’s death as “ludicrous” and said that the accusations were designed to serve political purposes, further straining already tense relations.On Wednesday, India strongly rejected Canadian media reports alleging that PM Modi was aware of a plot to kill pro-Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.The MEA dismissed these claims as ""ludicrous"" and urged that they be dismissed with the ""contempt they deserve."" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We do not normally comment on media reports. However, such ludicrous statements made to a newspaper purportedly by a Canadian government source should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve. Smear campaigns like this only further damage our already strained ties.""The rejection followed alinking Nijjar's death to the Indian government, citing a senior Canadian security official. The official alleged that Canadian agencies believed PM Modi had knowledge of Nijjar’s death and ""other violent plots"" in Canada.","Canada on Friday issued a statement clarifying that it has no evidence linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, or National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to criminal activities in the country. This comes after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October had publicly accused India of conducting covert operations in Canada. India had categorically rejected these allegations, labelling them as baseless and politically motivated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115550058,imgsize-1833493,width-400,resizemode-4/115550058.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The BJP-led NDA and the opposition's INDIA bloc will keep their fingers crossed a day ahead of the counting of votes in Maharashtra and Jharkhand as they anxiously await the people's verdict in the two states.With the exit polls throwing up a diverse range of predictions, both the camps are gearing up for all eventualities and possibilities. With some exit polls predicting neck and neck battle, the parties are busy preparing their Plan B, and even Plan C, to tide over the possible challenges that may come their way after the actual numbers are out.The Maha Vikas Aghadi constituents have decided to house all their newly-elected MLAs together in Mumbai after the election results. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said the move is aimed at preventing poaching ahead of government formation. The Congress has appointed observers for both states to oversee the post-election scenarios. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge deputed Ashok Gehlot, Bhupesh Baghel and G Parameshwara as AICC observers to Maharashtra with immediate effect, while for Jharkhand, Tariq Anwar, Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and Krishna Allavuru have been named observers.On the Mahayuti side, Ramdas Athawale, who is a Union minister and chief of RPI(A), claimed that Maharashtra's ruling alliance is confident of victory but is still in touch with several Independents. If the Maharashtra mandate is fractured, the state could see a flurry of political activities including defections and even realignments.In 2019, the state was witness to one of the biggest political realignments over the CM post when the then-divided Shiv Sena dumped BJP to join hands with the long-time nemesis NCP and the Congress party, which paved the way for Uddhav Thackeray to take oath as Maharashtra chief minister under the Maha Vikas Agahadi alliance.In 2022, the Shiv Sena, which was the largest party in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), saw a vertical split when Eknath Shinde and 39 other MLAs revolted against Uddhav Thackeray and joined hands with BJP.The defection of a majority of Sena MLAs led to the collapse of the MVA government, prompting Uddhav to resign as CM.Several political leaders credited Fadnavis for engineering the split in Shiv Sena. The BJP leader himself admitted to playing a key role in the Shinde-led revolt, calling it ""an act of revenge"".Later, the the BJP leadership, in a surprise move, decided to give the post of chief minister to Shinde, whose rebellion helped the NDA return to power in the state.However, the Mahayuti faced a major setback in this year's Lok Sabha polls as the ruling alliance was able to win only 17 seats out of the 48 seats, while the MVA won 31 seats, including one independent candidate.When considering the possibility of realignment in Maharashtra, Jharkhand is not far aloof as exit polls have projected a hung assembly in the state with the BJP-led NDA and the JMM-led INDIA bloc involved in a neck-and-neck race.Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren's JMM, however, on Thursday junked the exit polls, which gave the BJP-led NDA an edge, and claimed that the INDIA bloc would return to office for another term with a bigger mandate.Reacting to JMM's claims, the BJP said it was a last-minute effort to console their dejected party workers. ""Only two days remain. JMM and Congress can pat their own backs, but the reality is that the people of Jharkhand have voted for a change this time,"" BJP's state spokesperson Pradeep Sinha.Irrespective of the claims made by the party, there's no suspense that if the Jharkhand electorate throws up a hung assembly, as projected by the exit polls, the state may see a shift in allegiances.","Maha Vikas Aghadi constituents have decided to house all their newly-elected MLAs together in Mumbai after the election results.

Instead of reporting the deaths to higher authorities, the workers allegedly chose to bury the bodies in a nearby pit in an attempt to cover up the incident.The incident came to light after members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad raised concerns after learning about the mass burial.This is not the first time such an incident has been reported. Last year, carcasses of nearly 100 monkeys were discovered on the outskirts of a village in Telangana’s Siddipet district. Officials suspected that the monkeys had been poisoned elsewhere, with their bodies later dumped in the area.","The pesticide, identified as aluminium phosphide, was sprayed on wheat sacks in the FCI godown on November 7.

'Socialism' in India means 'social welfare state': Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/socialism-in-india-means-social-welfare-state-supreme-court/articleshow/115578573.cms,"NEW DELHI: The issue of the legality of the insertion of 'socialism' in the Preamble of the Constitution through the 42nd amendment during the infamous Emergency, which has simmered for decades, will be decided on Monday. Supreme Court on Friday reserved its order on petitions challenging the changes in the Preamble to put 'socialism' and 'secularism' in it in 1976, even while making plain its disinclination to intervene saying 'socialism' in the Indian context meant "" social welfare state "".Advocate Vishnu Jain cited the recent judgment of a nine-judge SC bench, in which the court had said during the nascent years of the nation, the country had followed the mixed economy model, which in the 1960s and 70s gave way to to a socialist pattern. ""Since the decade of the 1990s, or the liberalisation years, there has been a shift towards pursuing a policy of market-based reforms,"" it had said.Jain said the nine-judge bench had ruled against imposition of a particular economic ideology, for example socialism, and argued that since the Preamble too formed part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it could not have been amended by Parliament in 1976 in violation of the 13-judge bench 'basic structure' ruling in Kesavananda Bharati case. Similar arguments were advanced by Subramanian Swamy and advocates Ashwini Upadhyay and Alakh A Srivastava.However, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said, ""The way we understand socialism in India is different from the way it is understood in other parts of the world.""The CJI said, ""In India, it means a welfare state. Despite the inclusion of the word 'socialism' in the Preamble of our Constitution, we have turned to privatisation and benefited from it. But we have also focussed on equal opportunity for every citizen. So, why should the court go into the validity of inclusion of 'socialism' in the Preamble?""The CJI-led bench said the 1976 constitutional amendment has not prevented courts from striking down many legislations.In favour of the amendment inserting 'socialism' in the Preamble, the bench said, ""Power under 168 of the Constitution (to amend the Constitution) extends to amending the Preamble, which is part and parcel of the Constitution."" When arguments were advanced that Preamble too was part of the basic structure, which could not have been amended, SC asked, ""Who says Preamble is part of basic structure?""","The issue of the legality of the insertion of'socialism' in the Preamble of the Constitution through the 42nd amendment during the infamous Emergency has simmered for decades.

NEW DELHI: Two more exit poll agencies released their projections on Thursday giving boost to Eknath-Shinde led Mahayuti in Maharashtra assembly elections.According to Today's Chanakya exit poll predictions, Mahayuti is projected to secure 175 ± 11 seats, while the Congress-led Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) is expected to win 100 ± 11 seats. The agency has projected 13 ± 5 seats for other parties and independents.Meanwhile, Axis My India also predicted 178-200 seats for Mahayuti and 82-102 for MVA. The agency has predicted 6-12 seats for others and Independents.The Axis My India exit poll results have also revealed that Eknath Shinde is the preferred chief minister choice at 31 per cent, followed by Uddhav Thackeray at 18 per cent and Devendra Fadnavis at 12 per cent.With this, the Mahayuti is now projected to win 168 seats, according to the poll of polls, MVA 109 and others are likely to get 11 seats.The two exit poll results are in line with the projections released a day earlier where most polls on predicted victory for the BJP-led alliance in Maharashtra.On Wednesday, three pollsters - Peoples Pulse, Matrize and Chankya Strategies predicted clear majority for the Mahayuti while three - P-Marq, Dainik Bhaskar and Poll Diary predicted Mahayuti ahead of the MVA, but short of majority.The Matrize exit poll predicted 150-170 seats for the BJP and allies in Maharashtra with a 48 per cent vote share, it gave the Congress and other allies only 110-130 seats with a vote share of 42 per cent. The poll gave others 8 to 10 seats, with a vote share of 10 per cent. People's Pulse gave NDA's Mahayuti a whopping 175-195 seats while giving only 85-112 seats to MVA and 7-12 to others in Maharashtra.The actual results will be announced by the Election Commission on November 23.During the 2019 assembly elections, BJP had secured its position as the dominant party by winning 105 seats, whilst their alliance partner Shiv Sena obtained 56 seats. A disagreement over the chief minister's position led to Uddhav Thackeray's separation from the BJP. Subsequently, he established the MVA administration with support from Congress and the NCP, which had secured 44 and 54 seats respectively.The BJP orchestrated its response in 2022 when Eknath Shinde caused a division within the Shiv Sena, leading to the MVA government's collapse. The BJP then appointed Shinde as the chief minister. The following year, Ajit Pawar's rebellion against his uncle Sharad Pawar and the subsequent NCP split resulted in the formation of the Mahayuti.","Two more exit poll agencies released their projections on Thursday giving boost to Eknath-Shinde led Mahayuti in Maharashtra assembly elections.

RANCHI: Several political parties, including JMM, Congress, RJD, BJP, Ajsu-P, JD(U), LJP(R) and newly formed JKLM along with 1,128 candidates in total are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the battle of ballots, which will be declared on Saturday. Of two political camps - the BJP-led NDA - has been favoured by most exit polls to beat the INDIA bloc led by JMM to form the next govt in Jharkhand.With the voter turnout across the 81 assembly constituencies, which went to polls in two phases (Nov 13 and Nov 20), posting an all-time high turnout of over 67% since the state's inception in 2000, both camps on Friday claimed that they would form the next govt by comfortably crossing the majority mark of 41 seats. Counting is expected to commence at 8 am. As candidates spent anxious moments, heavyweights like Hemant Soren and his wife Kalpana held meetings with the party's senior leadership about preparations for the counting day. BJP state president Babulal Marandi, who is a candidate from the Dhanwar assembly segment in Giridih district, held meetings with the party's booth committee members at the party office here on Friday.Saturday's counting will be a test of the Hemant-led govt's key welfare schemes, including the Maiya Samman Yojana , Abua Awas Yojana, universal pension schemes for the elderly, widows and the differently abled, and the old pension scheme for the state govt employees. It will also be a test of popularity and acceptance for Hemant himself following his arrest by the ED and a five-month imprisonment in a land scam case earlier this year.The election comes close on the heels of the Lok Sabha polls, where the NDA won nine out of the 14 parliamentary seats in the state, while the INDIA bloc won only five. The electoral battle was also played out three months after Hemant, who served five months in jail, took over the reins of the govt on July 4 after deposing his ""chacha"" Champai Soren. Miffed, Champai crossed over to BJP a month later.BJP with its allies Ajsu-P, JD(U), and LJP (R), based its campaigning on attacking the outgoing Hemant govt over corruption, question paper leaks of recruitment tests and the death of excise constable aspirants. However, the thrust of BJP was the alleged changing demographics of the tribal hinterlands of the state due to the illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators. Its star campaigners like PM Narendra Modi, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, attacked JMM and Congress over the issue, with Modi and Yogi raising slogans such as ""Ek rahenge toh safe rahenge"" and ""Batenge toh Katenge"".While BJP fielded candidates on 68 seats, Ajsu-P contested 10. Their ally JD(U) fought on two seats, while LJP (R) contested on one seat. On the other hand, JMM fought 43 seats, while Congress fielded candidates on 30 seats. RJD and CPI-ML contested in four seats each.High turnout of women voters in the state indicated that the INDIA bloc's announcement of hiking the monthly stipends under its Maiya Samman Yojana and BJP's promise of 'Go go Didi Yojana' struck a chord with them. INDIA bloc leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, attempted to woo the electorate by promising a caste census and increasing the reservation ceiling from the existing 50%.""We have given respect and recognition to the state's women in the past five years and presented a clear roadmap for the state before the people. Unlike BJP, we did not campaign on baseless statements. That is why we are confident of a great result tomorrow,"" said Ghulam Ahmed Mir, the AICC's Jharkhand-in-charge, on Friday.BJP spokesperson Ajay Shah claimed NDA will clean sweep most of the seats in Kolhan and Santhal Pargana regions, helping it to clinch 60% of the seats. ""We will be in a comfortable position to form the govt,"" he claimed.","The BJP-led NDA has been favoured by most exit polls to beat the INDIA bloc led by JMM to form the next govt in Jharkhand.

BAKU: Negotiations at CO went into overtime as the presidency texts that were tabled on Friday, the UN climate talks scheduled concluding day, carried huge gaps on climate finance issues, which need to be bridged for a final outcome.The biggest point of disagreement was meagre core goal of $250 billion per year which developed countries are expected to mobilise for developing nations from a ""wide variety of sources"", including public, private, bilateral and multilateral, by 2035, rather than only from public finance.Though the annual $250 billion is part of the overall figure of ""at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035"" from ""all public and private sources"", developing countries outrightly rejected it as they are pitching for a bigger share of public finance (grants and grants equivalence resources) from the developed nations in the overall package. The post-2025 annual $250 billion by 2035 in the text is meant for replacing the existing goal of $100 billion per year.The other point of discord is the provision where even developing countries are expected to make additional contributions to supplement the finance goal.","Negotiations at CO went into overtime as the presidency texts that were tabled on Friday carried huge gaps on climate finance issues.

KULLU: More than three months have passed since a flash flood had wiped away the road to Malana in Parvati valley of Kullu , but the Himachal Pradesh village continues to remain cut off from the rest of the district.Food has become expensive as it has to be carried to the village by labourers and patients have to be carried on stretchers across 8 km of rough terrain to reach a point from where they can get transport. And now it's time for snow.The link road, around 8 km in length, is yet to be rebuilt from Malana Hydro Dam-I project site, which also was damaged in the flash flood, up to near Malana village .Villagers are forced to cover the 8 km on foot if they wish to visit any other part of the district.","More than three months have passed since a flash flood had wiped away the road to Malana in Parvati valley of Kullu.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday sought Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque management committee's response to a plea of the Hindu side for an ASI conducted scientific survey of the sealed area inside mosque, where a court commissioner had purportedly discovered a huge 'Shivling' which the Muslim side claimed was a fountain.The Hindu side, through senior advocate Shyam Divan, said ASI survey of the area inside the mosque, which has been sealed on the orders of SC since May 20, 2022, could not take place and pleaded that ASI be directed to conduct the survey using all possible scientific methods and submit a report to SC.The Hindu side's application, through advocate Vishnu S Jain, said the ASI survey report on other parts of the Gyanvapi mosque contained several photographs and material relating to the temple. ""There is important material and evidence relating to the temple within the sealed area which could serve as important evidence in deciding the suits seeking right to worship within the mosque,"" it said.Earlier, SC had deferred scientific survey of the 'Shivling' as even the Centre had said that such a survey, as ordered by the trial court in Varanasi and upheld by Allahabad HC, could be postponed.Divan pointed out that several suits were pending for trial before the district judge and civil judge (senior division) in Varanasi and pleaded for their consolidation before the district judge, whom SC had entrusted with the main suit, or before a three-judge bench of HC. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan said it was for consolidation of the suits to avoid conflicting views. However, it said consolidation of suits before HC would not be advisable as HC should remain the appellate forum, which could re-appreciate evidence.","Supreme Court on Friday sought Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque management committee's response to a plea of the Hindu side for an ASI conducted scientific survey of the sealed area inside mosque.

SHIMLA: HP high court allowed Friday nine of 18 loss-making hotels of Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC) to continue operations until March 31 next year, modifying a Nov 19 order that required all the state-run properties to shut down from Nov 25 due to the cash crunch and unpaid staff dues.A single bench of Justice Ajay Mohan Goel clarified that the continuation of the nine hotels would be reviewed after March.HPTDC had urged the court to allow at least nine of these hotels to continue, citing earnings from other sources, including restaurants, banquet halls and entry tickets, despite their low occupancy rates. Some of these hotels have obligations such as room and event bookings, with advances already received, HPTDC said.Justice Goel had earlier called the 18 hotels ""white elephants"" and ordered them shut as they had less than 40% occupancy in last few years, including Palace Hotel in Chail. The order had come on a plea by some retired HPTDC employees denied their dues.",Himachal Pradesh high court allows nine of 18 loss-making hotels to continue operations until March 31 next year.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Friday met the production team and cast of ' The Sabarmati Report ' - a film based on the Godhra train burning incident of Feb 27, 2002 - and congratulated them ""for their courage to narrate the truth"".""The film exposes the lies and misleading facts to unveil the truth that was suppressed for a long time to meet political interests,"" Shah stated in a post on 'X'. The post put out photographs of his meeting with key members of the team behind the film at his North Block office.Produced by Balaji Motion Pictures and distributed by Zee Studies, the movie stars Vikrant Massey , Raashii Khanna and Riddhi Dogra. It is directed by Dheeraj Sarna. The post by Shah comes close on the heels of many BJP-ruled states declaring the film tax-free. These states include Haryana, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan and UP.Fire inside the Sabarmati Express near Godhra railway station in Gujarat in 2002 had killed 59 Hindu pilgrims and kar sevaks who were returning from Ayodhya. The incident had triggered communal riots in Gujarat. A commission set up by the then railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav had in its report described the fire as an accident. However, the trial court in March 2011 convicted 31 persons, sentencing 11 to death and 20 to life imprisonment. In Oct 2017, Gujarat HC upheld the convictions but commuted the death sentences of 11 to life imprisonment. Several appeals against Gujarat HC are pending in SC.","Home minister Amit Shah met the production team and cast of 'The Sabarmati Report' Shah congratulated them ""for their courage to narrate the truth"" The movie stars Vikrant Massey, Raashii Khanna and Riddhi Dogra.

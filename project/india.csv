"Resignation twist: Bhupen Borah quits Congress, pauses decision, Himanta’s BJP offer follows — row explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/resignation-twist-bhupen-borah-quits-congress-pauses-decision-himantas-bjp-offer-follows-row-explained/articleshow/128448201.cms,"NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday invited former Assam Congress chief Bhupen Borah to join the BJP , hours after Borah submitted his resignation from the party, triggering political upheaval in the poll-bound state.Sarma said the BJP’s doors were open for Borah and promised to help him get elected from a “safe seat” if he joined. He also announced that he would visit Borah’s residence to discuss his future plans.“If he wants to join the BJP, we will welcome him, but even if he does not want to do so, we extend our best wishes to him,” Sarma told reporters.Sarma described Borah as the “last Hindu leader” in the Congress without a family background holding ministerial or legislative posts and said his resignation sent a larger message about internal democracy in the party.“His resignation carries the symbolic message that in the Congress, no one from a normal family can prosper. Congress does not give recognition to people from ordinary families, but I hail from an ordinary middle-class family and the BJP has made me a chief minister. We stay opposite to the politics of blue blood,” he said.Drawing a parallel with his own political journey, Sarma added, “Even Sarma was forced to leave the party as he was not made CM despite the support of 58 MLAs.Is this internal democracy? How long will this kind of politics continue? Somebody has to raise their voice, and I have done so.”In Guwahati, senior Congress leaders maintained that Borah had reconsidered his decision following intervention by the party high command.AICC Assam in-charge Jitendra Singh said party president Mallikarjun Kharge and senior leader Rahul Gandhi had spoken to Borah.“The party leadership has discussed the matter with Borah. Rahul Gandhi also spoke to him for 15 minutes,” Singh told reporters outside Borah’s residence.“This is our internal matter; we discussed in detail about the issues bothering him and I thank him for agreeing to withdraw his resignation,” he said.However, Borah clarified that he had only sought time to reconsider.“My old colleagues and the party's central leadership came to my house, and I respect them. I have sought time till tomorrow morning so that I can talk to my family and take a decision in this regard,” he said.In a late-night interaction, Borah confirmed that he had sent his resignation after 32 years in the party.“The resignation letter has been sent, but the central leadership has said it will not accept it,” Borah said, adding, “I cannot give directions to the central leadership, but I have asked for time to think about it and will inform them by tomorrow.”He said he was consulting senior leaders and well-wishers before taking a final call.“Many senior leaders and colleagues have asked me to consider all aspects, but nobody has said that I did anything wrong by sending the resignation letter,” he said.Responding to Sarma’s statement about visiting his residence, Borah said, “If any CM wants to visit my home, it is a matter of pride for me.”Borah, who served as Assam Congress president from 2021 to 2025 and was replaced by Gaurav Gogoi last year, has been a two-time MLA.Senior Congress leaders including Gogoi, MP Pradyut Bordoloi, Leader of Opposition Debabrata Saikia and other MLAs met Borah after he sent his resignation letter to Kharge, alleging that he was being “ignored” by the party leadership and not being accorded his due in the state unit.Gogoi described Borah as a “pillar of strength” for the party.“I apologise to him as a younger brother if he felt hurt due to certain issues in the party,” he said.The United Opposition Forum, Assam, also appealed to Borah to stay. Its spokesperson and Raijor Dal president Akhil Gogoi said the forum would not allow him to switch sides.“No one from the united opposition will let him join the BJP even if PM Narendra Modi or Home Minister Amit Shah comes. He was, is and will remain with us. Who will let him go...we will carry him everywhere with us,” Gogoi said.He alleged that the Chief Minister was trying to create confusion by suggesting Borah would join the BJP but added, “this will not happen...we will not let it happen.”With Borah seeking time until Tuesday morning to take a final decision, his political future remains uncertain, even as the BJP steps up its outreach and the Congress leadership attempts to contain the fallout ahead of the Assembly polls.",Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma invited Bhupen Borah to join the BJP. Sarma said the BJP’s doors were open for Borah and promised to help him get elected from a “safe seat” if he joined.

“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

Parliamentary approval process underway

Double contributions convention to be implemented in parallel

Tariff reductions and market access

The India-UK free trade agreement signed in July last year is expected to be implemented from April 2026, a government official said.India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025, under which 99 per cent of Indian exports will enter the British market at zero duty, while India will reduce tariffs on a range of British goods including cars and whisky.“We are expecting the pact to be implemented from April this year,” the official said, as quoted by news agency PTI.The agreement requires approval from the UK Parliament before it can take effect. In India, such trade agreements are cleared by the Union Cabinet.According to PTI, after ratification by the British Parliament, the pact will be implemented on a mutually agreed date. The House of Commons held a debate on the India-UK CETA earlier this week.Chris Bryant, minister of state in the UK Department for Business and Trade, responded during the debate on behalf of the Labour government, describing CETA as a significant achievement that goes “well beyond India's precedent in opening the door for UK businesses”.The British Parliament is currently ratifying the agreement, including debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, along with committee reviews, before implementation in the coming months.Alongside CETA, the two countries have signed a Double Contributions Convention (DCC) pact to prevent temporary workers from having to pay social security contributions in both countries.The official said both CETA and the DCC are likely to be implemented in parallel, as per PTI.CETA aims to double bilateral trade, currently estimated at $56 billion, between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies by 2030.Under the agreement, India will reduce import duties on Scotch whisky from 150 per cent to 75 per cent immediately, with a further reduction to 40 per cent by 2035.Also read| India-UK trade deal: From 99% duty-free access to benefits for Indian professionals - Here’s the FTA in 10 big numbers Import duties on automobiles will be cut to 10 per cent over five years from the current levels of up to 110 per cent, under a quota-based liberalisation system.In return, Indian exporters are set to gain improved access to the UK market for goods such as textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, sports goods and toys.India has also agreed to lower tariffs on British consumer products including chocolates, biscuits and cosmetics.During his visit to India in 2025, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed the desire for the agreement to be implemented as soon as “humanly possible.”Speaking in Mumbai in October last year, Starmer described the trade deal as Britain’s largest post-Brexit trade achievement and said he had instructed his team to ensure it is executed “as quickly as humanly possible”.Also read| India-UK trade deal: Starmer wants FTA implementation as soon as 'humanly possible'! The agreement was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to London in July 2025.Economists estimate the pact could increase trade between the two countries by about £25.5 billion ($34 billion) by 2040, with UK officials describing that figure as a starting point for further growth.If implemented as expected in April 2026, the agreement would mark a significant step in expanding bilateral economic ties and reducing tariff barriers across key sectors.","India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025.

In a format where supremacy is often short-lived and margins razor-thin, the team has an opportunity to defend a men’s T20 World Cup title — an achievement that would further strengthen their legacy in the shortest format. India are also aiming to become the first nation to lift the T20 World Cup trophy on home soil.A successful campaign would also make India the first team to win the men’s T20 World Cup three times.India’s journey in the tournament began with glory in the inaugural edition in 2007, when they defeated Pakistan in the final at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win. India edged past South Africa in a thrilling final to finally end their prolonged title drought.Now, with momentum on their side, India will look to script another historic chapter in T20 World Cup history.","India begin their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign against USA on Saturday.

"Villages in Noida in grip of child-lifting rumours; parents quit jobs, change shifts: ‘We can’t take chances’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/villages-in-noida-in-grip-of-child-lifting-rumours/articleshow/128401541.cms,"Image used for representative purpose only

Noida: Yamuna Illegal Mining Patrols, Jaypee Projects Under Scrutiny, Waste Plant Clash And More





NOIDA: Guddi has quit two cooking jobs so she can be home at Sarfabad early each afternoon. Her six-year-old son walks back from school, and the fear of what might happen on the way has become overwhelming.""Once children leave the school gate, the school authorities say that they are not responsible,"" she said. ""That scared many of us. We can't take chances.""Guddi's decision was driven by panic as rumours of girls going missing swirled through village pockets across Noida, with unverified claims of child lifters spreading rapidly in recent weeks. Neighbourhood conversations and social media forwards have triggered panic among parents despite repeated assurances from police and NGOs that there is no evidence to support them.The latest rumours, similar to the pre-Covid hysteria about children going missing — which led to several lynchings and WhatsApp enforcing curbs on forwards — have been triggered by a report circulating on social media in Jan about girls going missing in Delhi, police said.Senior police officers told TOI that no complaint or verified report of a child abduction had been received. “These appear to be hoaxes, possibly triggered by misleading social media messages,” an officer said, urging residents to avoid spreading unverified information.Fear has nonetheless reshaped daily routines. Several women have quit jobs, men have changed shifts, children are not being sent to school, and locals are putting up watches for child lifters. “We rush back every day to be with our children,” said another domestic staffer from Sarfabad, who works in a nearby high-rise society. “Even if this turns out to be false, the fear is real.”Several non-profits and schools reported a visible impact. Mala Bhandari, founder of a Noida-based NGO, said attendance dropped sharply in centres operating in Nagla, Tugalpur and Haldoni. “Parents stopped sending children altogether,” she said. “When our team did field visits, we found no incidents.”Another NGO temporarily shut operations after first hearing the rumour from children. “We closed for a few days because attendance dropped,” the owner said. “When we cross-checked with families, no one had seen or knew a victim. It was unverified talk, but the panic had already spread.”Primary schools in nearby villages reported similar disruptions. A teacher in Harola said attendance dropped as rumours intensified, though follow-ups revealed no abduction cases. “Some absences were also for personal reasons, like family weddings,” she said.In some schools, the response was precautionary. Sunita, a teacher at a private school in one of the villages, said the management circulated consent forms asking parents to pre-declare how children would commute and who would collect them. “Students are released only to authorised guardians,” she said. “There are no such cases here that we know of, but awareness feels necessary.”A police officer said such episodes are not new. Similar rumours have surfaced in the past, briefly fuelling fear before being debunked. The concern, they added, is that misinformation, especially when amplified online, can quickly disrupt community life and strain trust.The panic echoes 2018 and 2019, when India witnessed a spate of mob violence sparked by suspicions of child lifting, many of them triggered by viral WhatsApp messages. According to data compiled by Centre for Study of Society and Secularism, there were 41 reported incidents of mob violence in 2018 linked to such rumours, making child-lifting fears the leading trigger that year. Though National Crime Records Bureau does not maintain data for mob lynching, making comprehensive tracking difficult, at least 20 people were killed in the mob attack during the period.","Unverified claims of child lifters spreading rapidly in Noida, India.

Indian coastal authorities 'seize' 3 US-sanctioned oil tankers linked to Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-coastal-authorities-seize-3-us-sanctioned-oil-tankers-linked-to-iran/articleshow/128437223.cms,"Photo: File photo of oil vessel Asphalt Star

NEW DELHI: Indian coastal authorities reportedly “seized three US-sanctioned tanker ships linked to Iran” earlier this month, a source informed TOI on Monday. The vessel seizures follow the improvement in India-US relations with Washington announcing recently that it would cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.In a related development, US military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea, in an effort to target illicit oil trade connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said on Sunday.‘Shadow fleet’ vessels Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia carrying sanctioned Iranian oil were seized on Feb 6. India’s unprecedented enforcement action took place the same day that Washington and New Delhi unveiled a major bilateral trade framework.Indian coastal authorities said in a post on X on Feb 6 that they had intercepted the three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker in India's exclusive economic zone. However, the post was later deleted.Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia frequently changed their identities to evade action by coastal states, and their owners were based overseas, it was said.According to Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington DC-based research institute, “All three were previously sanctioned by the US for their ties to Iran. They form part of a 30-tanker fleet managed by Jugwinder Singh Brar, a UAE-based Indian national designated by the Treasury Department in April 2025 for operating in the petroleum sector of the Iranian economy. The Stellar Ruby was still flying an Iranian flag at the time of the seizure”.Importantly, Iran too had seized an oil tanker, MT Valiant Roar, on Dec 8 with 16 Indian crew members on board. Of the 16, eight have been released, but eight are still in Iran’s custody. Their families have been demanding the release of the sailors.As for US forces boarding another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean, Venezuela has faced US sanctions on its oil for several years and relied on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. President Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in Dec to pressure then-President Nicolás Maduro -- Maduro was apprehended in Jan during an American military operation.Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast in the wake of the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The Defense Department said in a post on X that US forces had boarded Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding.” “The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine — hoping to slip away,” the Pentagon said. “We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance and shut it down,” it added.",Indian coastal authorities reportedly ‘seized three US-sanctioned tanker ships linked to Iran’ Vessel seizures follow the improvement in India-US relations with Washington announcing it would cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.

India Speeds Up Chenab Hydropower Projects, Redrawing Indus Rivers Water Control Lines For Pakistan

JAMMU: India is preparing to stop surplus water from the Ravi flowing into Pakistan once the Shahpur Kandi dam on Punjab-J&K border becomes operational, marking a long-awaited shift in use of eastern river waters of Indus basin.J&K minister Javed Ahmed Rana said Monday the dam is expected to be completed by March 31 and is a priority for drought-prone Kathua and Samba districts. Officials said the project will irrigate about 5,000 hectares in Punjab and more than 32,173 hectares across Kathua and Samba in J&K. Central assistance of Rs 485.38 crore was approved for the irrigation component.Former irrigation minister Taj Mohideen said the dam falls outside Indus Waters Treaty because India has exclusive rights over the Ravi. Rana added that suspension of the treaty has accelerated power and dam projects in J&K.The 1960 treaty divides the Indus system’s waters, designating eastern rivers (Sutlej, Beas, Ravi) to India and western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan. India put the treaty in abeyance after the April 2025 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, a sharp policy shift aimed at pressuring Pakistan over cross-border terrorism.The move halted data sharing and opened the door for greater use of western river waters.Part of the Ravi flows unused through Madhopur into Pakistan despite demand in Punjab and J&K, Rana said, stressing that the dam would curb such wastage. Projects like Shahpur Kandi are critical to reallocating flows towards domestic irrigation and away from downstream discharge.The project was first cleared in Nov 2001 but stalled for years amid interstate disputes. After a series of bilateral and central meetings, Punjab and J&K reached an agreement in Sept 2018. Union cabinet chaired by PM Narendra Modi approved implementation on Dec 6 that year.Bani MLA Dr Rameshwar Singh said residents had waited years for completion. “Once it is completed, the water will no longer flow into Pakistan but will instead be used to irrigate our own vast areas in Kathua,” he said.","India is preparing to stop surplus water from the Ravi flowing into Pakistan once the Shahpur Kandi dam on Punjab-J&K border becomes operational.

NEW DELHI: The mother of a 23-year-old man who died in a road accident in Dwarka earlier this month has posted an emotional video on social media, alleging that her son was killed by a minor who was driving an SUV recklessly while making “speed fun reels”.Sahil Dhaneshra died in the accident on February 3 near Lal Bahadur Shastri College in Dwarka. In a video message shared on Sunday, his mother appealed to the government, media and local residents to help her seek justice.“I raised my child for 23 years as a single mother. On February 3, my innocent child was blown away by a car. I am a helpless mother,” she said in the video posted on X.In a post accompanying the video, she wrote, “I lost my son Sahil Dhaneshra, a 22+ year old young and most talented boy whom I raised for 23 years alone as a single mom, was killed brutally by a Scorpio N bearing no.

NEW DELHI: As the country moves towards becoming Naxalism-free by March 31, it's not just the last of Maoist leaders and cadres that are being hunted or asked to surrender. The physical symbols of Left-wing extremism -- specifically, 'memorials' built by CPI(Maoist) to ""honour"" its top leaders and commanders killed over the years -- are also being wiped out in mission mode, ensuring that the once Naxal-infested villages are never reminded of their violent and troubled past.In line with home minister Amit Shah's directions, reiterated at the Feb 8 review of Left-wing extremism in Raipur, the Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) has, over the last 15 days, demolished 53 such 'memorials' across Sukma, Bijapur and Bastar in Chhattisgarh. Backed by location-mapping of these 'memorials', often with help from the locals, the CRPF is targeting the demolition of all by February end. This will be followed up with a plantation drive in the cleared areas, so that they merge with the surrounding forests, said a CRPF source.CRPF has been at the forefront of the multi-state offensive to reclaim Maoists' pocket-boroughs and has a predominant presence in the interior villages of Bastar region through forward-operating bases.Among the CPI(Maoist) 'memorials' -- usually tiered, concrete structures shaped like a pyramid or pagoda, some topped with CPI(Maoist) insignia -- razed by earthmovers over the past fortnight were ones erected following the neutralisation of its general secretary Namballa Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju in Narayanpur in May 2025 and of central committee member Ramachandra Pratap Reddy @ Chalapathi (CC) in Gariyaband in Jan 2025.""CRPF is very close to the goal of uprooting Left-wing extremism from the country. Its efforts now extend to eliminating the fear of Maoists from the minds of people of Chhattisgarh, particularly tribals of Bastar who have borne the brunt of decades of Left-wing extremist violence. When the villagers see these 'memorials' reduced to dust by earthmovers, tractors, rope and hammers, without a murmur of protest or confrontation by any Naxal, a clear message goes regarding the fall of Maoism,"" a senior CRPF officer told TOI.A second officer said the fallen CPI(Maoist) 'memorials' also rule out any potential rallying or meeting points for ""residual"" Naxals or Maoist sympathisers. ""It's a strong message rejecting Maoist ideology and reflects a change in mindset,"" the officer added.While a CPI(Maoist) 'memorial' in Mirtoor, Bijapur was demolished on Feb 9, one each in Bijapur and Sukma was razed on Feb 11. Six 'memorial structures' were bulldozed in Sukma and Bijapur on Feb 12, and another nine and five on Feb 13 and 14 respectively.","Over the last 15 days, CRPF has demolished 53 ‘memorials’ across Sukma, Bijapur and Bastar in Chhattisgarh.

Maha CM Fadnavis stays minority tags issued hours after Ajit Pawar's death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maha-cm-fadnavis-stays-minority-tags-issued-hours-after-ajit-pawars-death/articleshow/128436263.cms,"Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar

PUNE: Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis Monday stayed certificates granting minority status to at least 75 educational institutes across the state soon after the death of former deputy CM Ajit Pawar, who also headed the minority affairs department, in a plane crash on Jan 28. The action followed inquiry demand from opposition members.""Orders have been issued to stay (the permissions) and investigate the matter,"" Fadnavis told TOI on Monday.Deputy CM and late Ajit Pawar's wife Sunetra Pawar, who now oversees the minority affairs ministry, convened an urgent meeting in Mumbai and directed senior officials to take strict action against those who issued these certificates.The issue was flagged by members of Indian Youth Congress (IYC) in Pune, who questioned how the department cleared certificates within hours of Ajit Pawar's demise. Akshay Jain, general secretary of IYC's state unit, said the process of issuing minority certificates had been halted by former minister Manikrao Kokate last Aug. After Kokate resigned in Dec 2025, Ajit Pawar took charge and maintained the status quo, he said.Jain said the department, however, abruptly resumed issuing certificates within hours of Ajit Pawar's death. ""He (Ajit) passed away in the morning, and by afternoon, applications from educational institutes were approved.Between Jan 28 and Feb 3, around 75 institutes were granted the minority tag,"" Jain told TOI. ""This appears to be a nexus rather than the act of an individual. Those found responsible should be punished,"" he said, welcoming the CM's decision to stay these certificates and order an inquiry.The issue was also raised by opposition members, including Congress state chief Harshwardhan Sapkal and NCP-SP MLA Rohit Pawar. ""A mere stay on certificates is not enough. A thorough investigation must be conducted. We have information that officials collected Rs 25 lakh for issuing each certificate,"" Rohit said.Sapkal said govt must clarify on whose orders the approvals were granted. ""Ajit dada had a strong command over the administration. If such a thing happened in his department soon after his demise, the responsibility rests with CM Fadnavis,"" he said. Sena UBT's Ambadas Danve, too, hit out at govt over the issue and demanded a thorough probe.Pyare Khan, chairperson of state minority commission, told TOI that more than 3,300 educational institutes across Maharashtra held minority status and received various govt benefits. ""I initiated action against some of these institutes as they operated only to corner concessions under the minority tag, without passing on the benefits to the students. Several cases were also registered against the owners of some education institutes after an investigation by the SIT revealed a large number of bogus teachers,"" he said, adding that even education department officials were arrested for aiding these institutes.Khan said minority-status schools were exempted from admitting students under the Right to Education quota and could appoint teachers directly, even without TET qualification. He alleged that management of many such institutes misused this provision to appoint unqualified relatives, harming students' education.",Devendra Fadnavis stayed certificates granting minority status to at least 75 educational institutes across the state.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

BENGALURU: A foreign tour by a bloc of Congress legislators aligned with CM Siddaramaiah has injected volatility into Karnataka politics, sharpening a power struggle with deputy CM DK Shivakumar over a long-speculated transition.About 27 Congress MLAs and MLCs are set to leave for Australia and NZ Tuesday, party insiders said. Legislators insist the travel is routine, but within the party it is seen as a tactical move to undercut Shivakumar's push for a Congress legislature party meeting to press for a change at the top.Congress returned to office in 2023 amid talk of an unwritten power-sharing deal under which DKS would succeed Siddaramaiah. Anticipating a leadership push before budget session March 6, Siddaramaiah camp is said to have encouraged select legislators to travel. The high command moved to rein in damage, with Randeep Surjewala calling MLAs to defer plans. Some complied, but others went ahead, signalling camp loyalties.","27 Congress MLAs and MLCs are set to leave for Australia and NZ Tuesday, party insiders said.

""The Nehru-Gandhi family is built into the DNA of every Congressman. Why should anyone be in Congress when all of Rahul Gandhi's friends have departed for other shores. It's only because if you don't believe in the leadership of the Nehru-Gandhi family, you would not be in Congress,"" he said, adding, ""I am in Congress, I have not left it. If Pawan Khera is going to expel me, I will happily go outside and kick his backside.Interestingly, Aiyar also made remarks like ""I am Rajivian (Rajiv Gandhi), not Rahulian (Rahul Gandhi)"", and that he does not need Congress, as it does not need him. Besides, he also criticised other Congress members at the national level and in Kerala.Aiyar has been a thorn in the flesh for Congress, with his remarks on politicians and politics having embarrassed Congress many times.

‘Crucial Role For India In AI Governance’: Duncan Cass-Beggs At AI Summit

‘Tech Produces Great Value, But Also Turmoil’

BENGALURU: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said even as artificial intelligence technology produces great value, it will also bring big economic turmoil. So it is important, he said, to ensure everyone shares in the benefits, and urged India, as the world's largest democracy, to use AI to make governance more efficient and citizen-centric. ""That's a really valuable use of the technology,"" Amodei said at the maiden edition of Anthropic's Builder Summit in Bengaluru on Monday.Anthropic, valued at $380 billion and whose AI products are used widely by enterprises to make coding more efficient, recently launched a slew of new tools for other enterprise functions like legal, sales and marketing that caused a collapse in the share prices of software and IT services companies around the world.Amodei's visit coincided with the AI company launching its Bengaluru operations. Speaking to some 250 developers and entrepreneurs, he noted that the technical intensity of AI adoption in India tends to be higher than elsewhere. He said he's heard ministry of statistics is building an AI system to query economic data and statistics. ""Generally, govt bodies elsewhere don't move this fast,"" he said.Anthropic's business run rate revenue in India, he said, has doubled over the past four months.""It's just really incredible... It mirrors the general progress and explosion in Claude models and coding models. But I think it's even more extreme in India than we've seen in other places of the world.""Amodei also pointed to India's extraordinary scale as a catalyst for innovation. ""You can run experiments with hundreds of millions of people. That scale allows entrepreneurs and builders to pivot quickly and learn faster in ways that simply aren't possible in smaller markets.""He said India's linguistic diversity as a powerful driver for AI innovation. It enables, he said, building tools interoperate across languages, make translation easier, and enable true multilingual capabilities. Claude, he said, is working hard to support the long tail of languages, and ""with so many regional languages in India, I've seen some cool applications, including in the non-profit and social benefit space. ""On the philosophy of his 38-page essay 'The Adolescence of Technology', Amodei said, ""We need to understand that this technology is really going to change the world at a speed and to a degree that we haven't seen with any other technology before. That may sound hyperbolic, but if we look at the rate of improvement, diffusion, and adoption, it's something that has no real precedent in modern history."" The essay emphasises core principles aimed at protecting against the worst-case risks posed by AI.Amodei highlighted the transformative potential of AI in specialised fields such as medicine and biology, noting that innovations rooted in the physical world are likely to create the most defensible businesses. ""I really encourage people to build where AI intersects with areas like medicine and health. The biggest moats will come from applications tied to the physical world - things that aren't easy to do and require specialised skills. Biology and medicine fit all of those criteria. It's a complex, knowledge-heavy space that involves navigating regulatory systems, but that hard work will lead to durable businesses. So I strongly encourage builders to move in that direction.""",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei urges India to use AI to make governance more efficient and citizen-centric.

The bench comprising Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan was hearing the bail application of a man accused of rape on the pretext of marriage. It questioned the complainant about why she had travelled to Dubai, where the two engaged in a physical relationship.""It's consensual. We may be old-fashioned but a boy and girl before marriage are total strangers. They should be circumspect in indulging in physical relationships before marriage,"" PTI quoted the bench observed.""Whatever may be the thick and thin of their relationship, we fail to understand how they can be indulging in physical relationship before marriage. Maybe we are old- fashioned but you must be very careful, nobody should believe anybody before marriage,"" Justice Nagarathna said.The woman’s counsel submitted that the two met through a matrimonial website in 2022, and that the accused allegedly entered into a physical relationship with her on several occasions in Delhi and later in Dubai on the false assurance of marriage.""She should not have gone before marriage if she was so strict about it. We will send them to mediation. These are not cases which are to be tried and convicted when there is consensual relationship,"" Justice Nagarathna said in response to this.In her complaint, the woman alleged that the man persuaded her to travel to Dubai, where he established physical relations with her on the false promise of marriage, recorded intimate videos without her consent, and threatened to circulate them. She later discovered that he had married another woman in Punjab in January 2024.Both the trial court and the Delhi high court had rejected his bail plea, with the high court observing that the promise of marriage appeared false from the outset, especially since he was already married and remarried in January 2024. The man has now approached the Supreme Court seeking bail.Justice Nagarathna suggested that the accused consider paying compensation to the woman to resolve the matter, while the bench also asked her counsel to explore the possibility of a settlement.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25.

'Tremendous Alliance': Netanyahu Highlights India's Love For Israel Ahead Of PM Modi's Visit

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday jabbed the Centre after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Israel, saying India was learning about its own government’s decisions from foreign leaders.PM Modi is set to travel to Israel on a two-day visit from February 25 to 26, news agency PTI repeorted citing sources. The visit was first mentioned by Netanyahu while addressing the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations on Sunday.Reacting to this, Congress general secretary (communications) Jairam Ramesh in a post on X wrote, “India hears of the halt to Operation Sindoor first from the US Secretary of State. India hears of the India-US trade deal first from the US President.”“Just now India has heard of Prime Minister Modi’s dates for his visit to Israel first from Mr. Netanyahu - who has reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and is now dispossessing and displacing more Palestinians in the occupied West Bank,” Ramesh added.The Congress remarks also referred to the recently concluded interim India-US trade agreement, which was first announced by US President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform earlier this month.The party alleged that key diplomatic and trade decisions were being communicated abroad before being formally shared in India.“Parliament address on the anvil. Who’s coming here next week? Narendra Modi,” Netanyahu said at the gathering, highlighting what he described as a “tremendous alliance” between India and Israel.Meanwhile, a source in Jerusalem told PTI that PM Modi’s visit is “likely to be short from February 25 to 26”, but added that “its impact is deep given the popularity PM Modi enjoys not only in Israel but around the world”.The programme for the visit is still being worked out. However, PM Modi is expected to address the Israeli Knesset during his stay and discuss bilateral and regional issues. This will be his second visit to Israel, after his landmark trip in July 2017, the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to the Jewish state.Netanyahu, speaking about the upcoming visit, described India as “enormously powerful” and “enormously popular” and said both sides would discuss expanding cooperation.India has consistently supported a “two-state solution” to the Israel-Gaza conflict, while also maintaining a strategic partnership with Israel.Last year, PM Modi and Netanyahu held a telephonic conversation and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.PM Modi had then said, “Spoke with my friend Prime Minister Netanyahu. We reviewed progress in the India-Israel Strategic Partnership and agreed to further strengthen our cooperation. Also reaffirmed our shared commitment to zero tolerance for terrorism. India supports all efforts aimed at achieving a just and durable peace in the region.”Netanyahu’s own visit to India has been on hold since 2023 following the October 7 Hamas attacks, which disrupted planned engagements.","PM Modi is set to travel to Israel on a two-day visit from February 25 to 26.

Women's entry in Sabarimala not a govt order: Kerala minister

NEW DELHI:A nine-judge bench of SC will on April 7 start hearing one of the most contentious disputes between faith and fundamental rights, arising from its Sept 2018 judgment that allowed women of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple , which had customarily barred entry of females of menstruating age.The judgment had triggered a series of petitions seeking its review and pleas for similar rulings on PILs that had sought entry of women into mosques, abolition of the practice of khatna (female genital mutilation) among Dawoodi Bohra community members and pleas for entry of Parsi women who have married outside their community into fire temple.A bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said it would hear the batches of appeal separately and examine the core issue - the conflict between faith-based customs and women's fundamental rights. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta supported petitions seeking review of Sabarimala judgment without elaborating on Centre's stand.Kerala law minister P Rajeev said on Monday that the state govt still has time to clarify its stand on the issue of women entering the Sabarimala temple, and that the matter cannot be reduced to a ""yes or no"" answer.""Several constitutional complications are involved in it. All aspects need to be considered,"" Rajeev said. He added that govt's action at the time of the earlier controversy was in compliance with the SC verdict. ""It was not a govt order ... The apex court verdict is naturally binding,"" he said. Asked whether govt would support or seek a modification of the practice, Rajeeve said faith and social reform must go together and that this was govt's stand in its affidavit before the court.","A nine-judge bench of SC will on April 7 start hearing one of the most contentious disputes between faith and fundamental rights, arising from its Sept 2018 judgment that allowed women of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple.

NEW DELHI: The legal battle over Sonam Wangchuk 's detention seems to be stuck at the transcript of his speech. Pointing out discrepancies in the speech of the climate activist in Ladakhi language and the translated transcript relied upon by govt authorities, his wife Gitanjali Angmo Monday told the court the alleged words on the basis of which the detention order was passed were never uttered by him.A bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and PB Varale prima facie found merit in the allegation and said there seems to be variance. ""If the speech is of 3 minutes and your transcription goes on for 7-8 minutes, there is certainly malice in that,"" it said.Taking note of the submission by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Wangchuk's wife, the bench said: ""In a lighter vein, there's this couplet, ""humne woh sun liya jo unhone kaha hi nahi (we heard what they didn't say at all)"". To which Sibal responded, ""Aur jo hum keh rahe hain unhone suna hi nahi (and they haven't heard what we are saying)"".Challenging the detention, Sibal told the bench that the detaining authority relied upon an incorrect transcript of Wangchuk's speech and the authority's decision was based on non-existent material. He placed before the bench a comparative analysis of what the activist had said and the translated version relied upon by the govt to buttress his submission to the bench.After going through the chart, the bench told additional solicitor general K M Natraj, ""The tabular list you have filed, some of these things don't even find a place in the detention order.

The bench said AI could be used for translation with 98% accuracy, at least.Sibal then moved to another point of submission and contended that the videos which were relied upon by the detaining authority were not provided to the activist which is also violation of law, making the detention illegal.He told the court that the four videos of his speeches, which were cited by the detaining authority in the detention order, were not there in the pendrive which was handed over to him on Sept 29.The bench directed the Jodhpur jail superintendent to produce in a sealed box the pendrive given by the govt authority to Wangchuk. ""The learned senior counsel would submit that the pendrive furnished to detenu on 29th Sept 2025, is in his custody... we direct the same pendrive... shall be obtained in a sealed box...,"" the bench said in its order.",The legal battle over Sonam Wangchuk's detention seems to be stuck at the transcript of his speech. Wangchuk's wife Gitanjali Angmo Monday told the court the alleged words on the basis of which the detention order was passed were never uttered by him.

SC 9-judge bench to revisit definition of 'industry',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-9-judge-bench-torevisit-definition-of-industry/articleshow/128444364.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: A nine-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant will hear on March 17 and 18 the correctness of the expansive definition of 'industry', laid down nearly 50 years ago by a seven-judge bench, bringing universities, hospitals, govt institutions and welfare organisations under the ambit of the Industrial Disputes (ID) Act regulating worker-employer relations.Petitions have been pending since 2002 and a seven-judge SC bench on Jan 2, 2017, had referred the issue - whether the triple test laid down by Justice Krishna Iyer in the seven-judge bench ruling of 1978 in the Bangalore Water Supply case is correct - to a nine-judge bench.A bench of the CJI and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi Monday said apart from testing the correctness of the seven-judge bench ruling, the nine-judge bench will also consider the interpretation of 'industry' in Section 2(j) of the ID Act.Section 2(j) provides that 'industry' means any business, trade, undertaking, manufacture or calling of employers, and includes any calling service, employment, handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen.It had laid down the triple test - systematic activity; organised cooperation between employer and employee; and production/distribution of goods and services to satisfy human needs - which virtually included every activity under the ID Act.The court had excluded sovereign functions - defence, law and order - from the ambit of 'industry'.The bench while asking the counsel to strictly adhere to the hearing schedule, nine hours spread over the two days, said the nine-judge bench will consider what are the state activities which will fall outside the definition of Section 2(j). It said solicitor general Tushar Mehta and other law officers will get four hours while others opposing the Union govt would also get four hours.",A nine-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant will hear on March 17 and 18.

NEW DELHI: With the number of rape complaints, arising out of false promise of marriage, on the rise, Supreme Court Monday cautioned young men and women about pre-marital physical relationships, even it admitted that the view may be branded as old-fashioned.Hearing the bail plea of a man who is facing prosecution for rape over a false promise of marriage, Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan raised questions over how the woman in question had agreed to go with the man to Dubai, where the two had a physical relationship.""It's consensual. We may be old-fashioned, but a boy and girl before marriage are total strangers.

It asked the two parties to explore the possibility of settlement and posted the matter for hearing on Wednesday to ascertain their views.""She should not have gone before marriage if she was so strict about it.

NEW DELHI: At a time when climate change is increasingly reshaping public health risks across the globe, Indian media, including TOI, has quietly carved out a leadership role in linking the two, reports Jahnavi.A new study published in The Lancet Planetary Health has found that Indian news outlets are emerging as global frontrunners in climate-health journalism, surpassing coverage trends in both the US and China. According to the research, Indian outlets - including TOI - recorded the highest proportion of substantive climate-health coverage at 46.4%, compared to 31.3% in the US and 17% in China.The study, titled 'The evolution of news coverage about climate change as a health issue: a decadal analysis in China, India and the USA', examined legacy media coverage across the three countries between 2012 and 2023. Researchers conducted a manual content analysis of articles from five mainstream newspapers and one news agency per country, sourced through archival databases. In India, TOI was among the five newspapers included in the sample.Climate-health journalism was defined as news content that substantively connects climate change to human health outcomes or health-related actions.The study noted that Indian media consistently performed better in covering issues that directly affect everyday life like heat, food security, air quality, and extreme weather.","Study finds Indian news outlets are emerging as global frontrunners in climate- health journalism.

NEW DELHI: The AI Impact Summit 2026 marks a shift in India's AI story - from cloud-heavy, software-led narratives to physical, deployable AI embedded in machines, devices and infrastructure.Spread across 70,000 square metres at Bharat Mandapam at the national capital, the summit is less about future promises and more about AI already at work: robots in healthcare and factories, drones in farms, and wearables in public services.Inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the five-day summit, from Feb 16 to 20, brings together over 300 curated pavilions and over 600 startups cutting across sectors. The emphasis throughout the exhibition floor is on deployment rather than demos. Autonomous drones scan crops for disease, wearable devices assist frontline health workers, industrial robots demonstrate predictive maintenance, and AI-powered tools translate court judgments and govt documents into Indian languages.Global technology giants have mounted some of the largest and most crowded showcases. Google's pavilion highlights applications ranging from climate modelling and extreme weather prediction to language tools and its AI cricket coach, tailored for Indian users.Microsoft is showcasing secure AI platforms for governance, public services and enterprise adoption, while Nvidia has drawn steady crowds with live demonstrations of GPU-powered robotics, real-time simulations and industrial AI systems, underlining the growing importance of high-performance computing. Open AI, Qualcomm, Amazon Web Services, and Schneider Electric are also present, positioning their platforms for large, diverse markets such as India, with a sharp focus on scale, cost efficiency and compliance.Equally prominent is the presence of India's own tech majors. Tata Group's showcase spans manufacturing, mobility and digital public infrastructure, demonstrating how AI is being integrated into traditional industries. HCL Tech has focused on enterprise AI, secure data systems and responsible deployment frameworks, while Reliance Industries is highlighting applications in telecom, retail and cloud infrastructure.The summit's international character is reinforced by country pavilions from Japan, the UK, and Germany, hosting live demonstrations and bilateral discussions. Senior members of global technology firms are attending closed door sessions and public interactions, using the platform to explore partnerships and policy alignment in one of the world's fastest-growing AI markets.Despite the heavy presence of big tech, the energy on the floor is driven just as much by startups, students and young innovators. Youth zones are packed with school and college teams presenting solutions for precision farming, healthcare diagnostics, climate resilience and education, many designed to work offline or in regional languages. ""Cost is our biggest constraint,"" said Shashwat Ranjan, a computer science student developing an AI-based mental health tool. ""Running models for college projects is expensive. Being here helps us understand how to build affordable systems that can actually scale.""Several pavilions highlight indigenous foundation models trained on Indian datasets and designed to support all 22 official languages, backed by domestic compute infrastructure and governed by local data protection frameworks. Officials say the aim is to ensure AI systems reflect Indian realities and remain accessible to startups, researchers and public institutions.","The AI Impact Summit 2026 marks a shift in India's AI story.

NEW DELHI: In a significant step towards regulating and scaling artificial intelligence in public healthcare, Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda will on Tuesday launch two landmark national initiatives — a policy roadmap and a testing platform — aimed at ensuring AI tools are safe, accountable and ready for real-world deployment.At the India AI Summit at Bharat Mandapam, Nadda will unveil the Strategy for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare for India (SAHI) and BODH, the Benchmarking Open Data Platform for Health AI.SAHI lays down the country’s first structured framework to guide how AI should be integrated into hospitals, public health programmes and digital health systems. The strategy makes clear that AI must assist doctors and health workers, not replace them, and should operate within clear guardrails of transparency, accountability and equity. It sets out a national direction on governance, data stewardship, validation standards and responsible deployment, while encouraging innovation aligned with public health priorities.Alongside it, BODH is designed as a national evaluation platform to test AI tools before they are rolled out at scale. Developed by IIT Kanpur in collaboration with the National Health Authority under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, the platform allows AI models to be benchmarked on diverse, real-world health data without sharing or exposing patient information.The aim is to ensure that AI systems perform reliably across different hospitals, regions and patient populations.Officials say the twin initiatives mark a shift from experimentation to structured oversight, as AI tools increasingly enter areas such as diagnostics, clinical decision support, claims management and disease surveillance. By combining a national policy framework with a privacy-preserving testing mechanism, the government is seeking to balance innovation with safety in one of the most sensitive sectors — healthcare.The launches come amid the five-day India AI Summit 2026, being hosted in the Global South for the first time, where health AI has emerged as a key pillar of India’s digital public infrastructure push.","Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda will on Tuesday launch two landmark national initiatives.

"Inaugurating centenary celebrations, President Droupadi Murmu hails 'Ol Chiki' script as a powerful symbol of Santhali identity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inaugurating-centenary-celebrations-president-droupadi-murmu-hails-ol-chiki-script-as-a-powerful-symbol-of-santhali-identity/articleshow/128431513.cms,"NEW DELHI: President of India Droupadi Murmu on Monday described the Ol Chiki script as a ""powerful symbol"" of the Santhali identity. “It is also an effective means of establishing unity among the Santhal community,” she added.The President’s remarks came at the inauguration of the centenary celebration of the Ol Chiki script, being organised by the ministry of culture. Addressing a programme to mark the occasion in the national Capital, the President said that the Santhal community has its own language, literature and culture.“However, due to the lack of its own script, the Santhali language was initially written in the Roman, Devanagari, Oriya, and Bengali scripts. Members of the Santal community living in Nepal, Bhutan, and Mauritius also used to write in the scripts prevalent in those countries. These scripts were not able to correctly pronounce the original words of the Santhali language. In 1925, Pandit Raghunath Murmu invented the Ol Chiki script,” she highlighted.“Since then, it has been used for the Santhali language. Now, this script is a powerful symbol of Santhal identity worldwide.It is also an effective means of establishing unity among the Santhal community,” Murmu said.The President said that the centenary celebrations of Ol Chiki should be an occasion to resolve for promoting this script. “While children can get education in Hindi, English, Oriya and Bengali, or any other language, they should also learn their mother tongue, Santhali, in the Ol Chiki script,” she added.The President was happy to note that many writers are enriching Santhali literature through their works. She advised them to awaken people through their writings. She also expressed happiness over the Santhali language growing in the digital medium.“Language and literature are the threads that uphold unity within the communities. The exchange of literature can enrich languages. Efforts should be made to make Santhali literature accessible to students of other languages through translation and writing and vice versa,” the President said.On the occasion, Murmu released a commemorative coin and postage stamp on the completion of 100 years of Ol Chiki. She also felicitated 10 achievers from the Santal community for promoting wide use of Ol Chiki script among the Santhali people.Union minister for tribal affairs, Jual Oram, culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, and culture secretary, Vivek Aggarwal, were present at the event.Last year in December, the President had participated in a centenary celebration of the script in Jamshedpur in Jharkhand. To expand constitutional awareness and accessibility, the Constitution of India was officially translated into the Santhali language using the Ol Chiki script and released in December 2025 by President Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Published by the legislative department of the ministry of law and justice, this marked the first time that the nation’s foundational legal text became available in Santhali in its own indigenous script.Santhali language, one of India’s prominent tribal languages spoken widely across Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, and Bihar. Belonging to the Austroasiatic language family, Santhali has historically thrived through these oral traditions. However, while this strength ensured cultural continuity, the absence of a standardised script posed significant challenges for documentation, formal education, and literary development.Ol Chiki script was developed in 1925 by Pandit Raghunath Murmu specifically for the Santhali language, which was later included in the Constitution of India’s Eighth Schedule in 2003. The script consists of 30 letters designed to accurately represent Santhali phonetics.","President of India Droupadi Murmu described the Ol Chiki script as a ""powerful symbol"" of the Santhali identity. “It is also an effective means of establishing unity among the Santhal community,” she added.

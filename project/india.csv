Inputs from Shailvee Sharda & Intishab Ali

On returning from college recently, Kolkata-based Anusha (name changed) — a thalassaemia patient who contracted HIV through a blood transfusion a few years ago — read a headline that gave her pause.Two years after 14 children in Uttar Pradesh reportedly contracted HIV and hepatitis after blood transfusions, five children with thalassaemia tested HIV-positive after receiving blood at Jharkhand’s Chaibasa Sadar Hospital last month, with a sixth case emerging at another facility in the state.“At least I can afford treatment,” says Anusha. “Many who visit rural centres and govt hospitals can’t.”Opposition leaders have claimed that six more children in Ranchi and one child in Koderma have been affected.For thalassaemia patients — dependent on lifelong transfusions — the Jharkhand case has reopened an old wound.“We are sick and tired,” says lawyer Anubha Taneja Mukherjee. A thalassaemia patient herself, she is member-secretary of Thalassemia Patients Advocacy Group (TPAG), which has long been seeking a uniform national blood law and mandatory upgrade of screening technologies. “This isn’t just a system failure.It’s a violation of the right to safe, life-saving care.”Initial investigation indicates that the Chaibasa blood bank used fourth-generation ELISA tests, but not nucleic-acid amplification testing (NAAT), which can detect infections during the “window period” when ELISA may fail.Five cases have been traced to this facility, whose licence — according to local media reports — lapsed in 2023. While hospitals often operate under “deemed-continuation” rules during renewal, the case has raised questions about accountability, oversight and quality control.Jharkhand health authorities have suspended senior officers and ordered statewide inspections of blood banks, while the high court has taken suo motu cognizance, asking for data on monitoring, donor-camp protocols, and blood-availability practices.Following statewide inspections, the Jharkhand high court — on Nov 19 — noted that licences of 17 blood banks have been cancelled, and directed the state to set a clear timeline for adopting NAAT for blood screening. The court also found that although the inquiry into the Chaibasa incident is complete, the report has not yet been placed on record.“It’s not an isolated incident,” says Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretarygeneral, People’s Health Organisation (PHO), an NGO known for its work in HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention, and treatment advocacy. “They reflect policy paralysis and administrative collapse.”The tragedy comes even as some states have attempted to build stronger shields around vulnerable patients.In Rajasthan, a health official says the state follows a two-layer protocol for those needing frequent transfusions.“For patients requiring frequent transfusions, we first test by ELISA and then use NAAT to prevent transfusion-transmitted infections,” the official says.“We have been using NAAT for four years.” Rajasthan has begun extending NAAT to general patients in Jaipur and Udaipur, with phased expansion planned across districts still reliant only on ELISA. “NAAT must become universal for high-risk groups,” the official adds.In UP, transfusion oversight is managed by the State Blood Transfusion Council, led by Dr Geeta Agarwal. “No case of contaminated blood transfusion has come to the council’s notice in the past 10 years,” she says, adding that UP follows guidelines and SOPs issued by National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC, the central body that coordinates state blood transfusion councils) and cross-checks compliance.“We reinforce rational use of blood every three weeks across all blood banks, mandate testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C, malaria and syphilis, review data monthly, and conduct quarterly quality assessments.”UP has also created a digital monitoring tool with nearly 200 parameters, she says, adding that the Food and Drug Administration conducts at least one physical inspection a year.This is in stark contrast to the gaps exposed in Jharkhand.India’s fight for safe blood began in the late 1980s, when PHO’s public-interest petition spurred early HIV screening in Maharashtra and Goa. A landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1998 mandated national screening and empowered NACO (National Aids Control Organization, under the ministry of health and family welfare) to overhaul blood banks.The reforms worked: transfusion-linked HIV transmission in formal systems dropped from nearly 10% of infections to under 1%. According to NACO’s 2024 report, there are now 2.5 million Indians living with HIV.“While progress has been made, a blood market exists,” says Dr Sanghamitra Ghosh of the Indian Public Health Association. Informal networks, untrained staff and patchy supervision create unsafe pockets, especially in states with limited resources.Thalassaemics are the most vulnerable as they require regular transfusions. India has one of the world’s largest burdens of thalassaemia: of the 12,000 such patients born each year, nearly half don’t reach adulthood.A 2011-2018 study of 1,087 patients across five Indian centres found mortality up to seven times higher in children under five, with transfusion-transmitted infections significantly increasing risk.Globally, NAAT is a gold-standard test because it detects viruses during the earliest phase of infection. It is, however, expensive and requires trained personnel. ELISA is mandated in India; NAAT is optional: “Why is NAAT testing only mandated in certain hospitals in certain states when it should be available to all?” Anusha asks.This safety gap is particularly dangerous in Jharkhand, where tribals constitute over 26% of the population.Experts, as cited in a media report, note that the prevalence of beta-thalassaemia traits is alarmingly high (11%) in these communities because of genetic clustering, historical malaria prevalence, and intra-community marriages, making the need for advanced screening critical.“What we call technology gaps are also governance and capacity gaps,” says Dr Yazdi Italia, Padma Shri awardee and blood-safety advocate. “Machines are only as good as the people running them.”In June, TPAG convened transfusion experts, policymakers and patient groups in Delhi for a strategic dialogue on strengthening blood safety. The group released a white paper shared exclusively with TOI, noting that India’s blood-safety system remains “complex and fragmented”, with varied practices across states and institutions.“Despite its proven effectiveness, NAAT is not yet mandatory or uniformly implemented across India, especially in govt-run or rural facilities,” the paper states.Mukherjee calls the tragedy a wake-up call. “This is not merely a medical systems issue. It is about dignity, equity and the right to safe care.” Transfusion-medicine specialist Dr Sangeeta Pathak told the forum that safety isn’t only about screening: “Any lapse in the chain — from improper cold storage to outdated transport protocols — can waste units and endanger lives.”She called for real-time coldchain trackers, digitised inventories, and geo-tagged traceability from donor to recipient.Despite progress, a shadow market persists. In some pockets, up to 30% of blood still comes from paid donors, who often use false identities to bypass screening.“The blood market still exists,” says Dr Ghosh. “Donors must be traced in this case — otherwise, the chain of infection will continue.”Most banks test only for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and malaria. Donors aren’t always notified of positive results, enabling repeat donation elsewhere.Atul Gera, called the ‘Blood Man of Jharkhand’, told a media outlet that the only guaranteed way to prevent such incidents is to stop the acceptance of “replacement blood” (where a patient’s family must provide a donor) and mandate reliance solely on voluntary blood donation.Experts argue that universal NAAT is unrealistic for every small centre. Instead, they recommend a hub-andspoke model: centralised high-tech hubs that perform advanced screening, with peripheral centres handling storage and distribution.Countries like Canada and the UK already follow this model. “It removes dependence on local equipment or staffing,” says Dr Italia.India has the science, infrastructure and experience to build a safe transfusion system. What it needs, experts say, is political will and urgency. “We owe the kids in Jharkhand — and every citizen — a system where every drop of blood is safe,” Dr Gilada says.","Five children with thalassaemia tested HIV-positive after receiving blood at Jharkhand’s Chaibasa Sadar Hospital last month. The case has raised questions about accountability, oversight and quality control. Rajasthan has begun extending NAAT to general patients in Jaipur and Udaipur.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125578293,imgsize-370785,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-66.jpg"

Give deported people chance to prove their nationality: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday suggested to the Centre that it bring back the pregnant Sunali Khatun, and five others, including her husband Danish Sekh and their minor son Sabir, who were deported to Bangladesh on grounds of being illegal immigrants, as an interim measure and inquire about their nationality on their return, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The court, however, called for tough measures against infiltrators.Appearing for the deportees, senior advocates Sanjay Hegde, Kapil Sibal and G Sankaranarayanan told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that Sunali, her husband and son have documents to prove citizenship and their deportation violated their fundamental rights. ""They must be brought back as per Calcutta HC's order,"" they said.Hearing the Centre's appeal against the HC order, the bench said, ""Now that certain material, including landholding records and relatives' statements, have come on record, why don't you bring them back and inquire about their nationality? You hardly held any inquiry before deporting them.""As an interim measure, bring them back and hold an inquiry. Examine the documents produced by them or on their behalf and give them a chance to prove their nationality,"" the bench said.However, it accepted that the removal of illegal Bangladeshi migrants from Indian soil is absolutely justified. The bench sought Centre's response to its suggestion on Monday.In its appeal, Centre has challenged the Calcutta high court's Sept 26 order quashing the detention order of June 24 and deportation order of June 26, and directing the home ministry to take all steps to bring back the six persons so deported within four weeks by working in coordination with high commission of India in Dhaka.Centre said that the six people in question had failed to produce any document to substantiate their claim of being Indian citizens or residing legally in India. After their deportation, a missing person/s complaint was filed with West Bengal police and the gram panchayat issued them domicile certificates. Thereafter, HCs of Delhi and Calcutta were petitioned simultaneously, with the petition before Delhi HC being withdrawn without disclosing that another is pending before Calcutta HC.It said the Delhi Police's inquiry had established that the persons concerned were illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. In fact, they themselves had admitted to the fact. The deportation orders were passed after following due procedure, Centre said. ""Since India has open/porous land borders with many countries such as Bangladesh and Myanmar, there is continuous threat of influx of illegal immigrants, and such influx has serious national security ramifications. There is an organised and well-orchestrated influx of illegal immigrants through various agents and touts for monetary considerations,"" Centre argued.","Supreme Court suggested to Centre that it bring back the pregnant Sunali Khatun, and five others, including her husband Danish Sekh and their minor son Sabir.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday severely criticised a Christian lieutenant for putting his own understanding of his faith over and above the religious sentiments of soldiers he was leading, and endorsed the Army brass's decision to sack him.""I have participated in all religious celebrations like Holi, Diwali and Lori. But I cannot be forced to offer flowers or hold 'thali' inside a gurdwara as that is a religious ritual which my religion does not permit me to perform. My religion does not permit me to worship another god,"" said Lt Samuel Kamalesan, who had been commanding a troop of cavalrymen comprising Sikhs, Rajputs and Jats.The bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said one cannot claim breach of fundamental right to religion just because one's sentiments get violated. ""You must respect the faith of majority of the troops under your command... He may be an outstanding officer, but unfit to be in the secular and highly disciplined Army,"" it said.Appearing for Lt Samuel Kamalesan, senior advocate G Sankaranarayanan challenged the validity of the sacking order on the ground that it violated his fundamental right to practise and profess a particular religion guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution.The bench, after perusing records, said to dispel his dogmatic views, Army authorities had taken the lieutenant to a renowned pastor in Chandigarh who advised him that going inside the sanctum sanctorum of a 'sarv dharma sthal' would not violate his religious rights.""Despite that you remained obstinate and refused to go into the gurdwara where your troops were praying. This demonstrates your mindset and your religious ego. You do not follow the advice of the pastor.

But you stuck to your own interpretation and understanding of Christianity and refused to offer flowers at gurdwara,"" the bench said. ""You cannot bring in your own private understanding of religion to hurt the sentiments of your troops.""Sankaranarayanan said there was no 'sarv dharma sthal' where he was posted, only a gurudwara and a temple.As the bench said the lieutenant was unfit to be in the secular Army, the counsel replied, ""It is not a secular Army as it has caste-based regiments"".The bench said it will not get into a debate on the Army.

The reduced strength of the delegation was, however, questioned by national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who asked why EC was scared to face 10 MPs. He even dared EC to telecast the meeting live.Derek, meanwhile, wrote to EC again Tuesday, reiterating the 10 names for the delegation.Interestingly, the 'authorised representatives' of the party - who, as per EC records, are Lok Sabha MPs Abhishek Banerjee and Kakoli Dastidar - do not figure on this list of 10.Sources in EC said as per the rule, only the party president or ""authorised party representatives"" declared to the commission can nominate members of their party's delegation for a meeting with EC.

Udaipur’s High-Profile Wedding

UDAIPUR: All eyes were on Donald Trump Jr as he arrived in Udaipur for a high-profile wedding, but the families hosting the lavish celebrations are far from ordinary. At the centre of the glittering weekend is Rama Raju Mantena, an Andhra-origin US entrepreneur, whose daughter, Netra Mantena, married Vamsi Gadiraju on Sunday at the historic Jag Mandir Island Palace.Rama Raju Mantena — known to many as Raj — traces his roots to Vijayawada. A pharmacy graduate, he moved to the United States in 1984 and went on to build a remarkable entrepreneurial journey.Over the decades, he founded seven companies in the pharmacy and IT sectors, steadily creating value and selling these ventures after unlocking their true potential.His latest enterprise, Integra Connect, focuses on value-based, precision medicine and leads in real-world data, analytics, and AI capabilities for speciality care organisations.Rama Raju’s business instinct and success in the US have earned him the reputation of a powerful industry figure. He is also the nephew of Gokaraju Gangaraju, former BJP MP and entrepreneur.The celebrations began Friday with performances by Kriti, Madhuri, and Shahid, followed by high-voltage shows on Saturday featuring Jennifer Lopez, who flew in on a chartered flight from Ireland, and Justin Bieber.A grand reception is scheduled for November 24.The groom, Vamsi Gadiraju, a Columbia University alumnus and co-founder of the New York-based tech firm Superorder, also has Telugu roots and featured on Forbes’ Under 30 list. Netra, meanwhile, completed her undergraduate studies in pharmacology and works in New York.Trump Jr.’s visit has drawn international attention. After arriving with his girlfriend, he toured the Udaipur City Palace with Rama Raju and met Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar.The meeting reflected deep cultural traditions, with discussions on Mewar’s history. Singh presented symbolic emblems, which Trump Jr described as “special and memorable,” expressing admiration for Maharana Kumbha, Maharana Sanga, and Maharana Pratap.The lavish celebrations, the international guest list, and the layers of security have all drawn attention — but at the heart of it lies the story of Rama Raju Mantena, the Vijayawada-born entrepreneur whose American dream has led to one of Udaipur’s most talked-about weddings.","Rama Raju Mantena, an Andhra-origin US entrepreneur, married Vamsi Gadiraju on Sunday at the historic Jag Mandir Island Palace.

Ash Cloud From Ethiopia Hits India’s Airspace At High Speed, DGCA Issues Urgent Safety Advisory

Ash cloud from Ethiopia's volcano expected to reach North India by 10 pm (Photo - Sat: Meteosat-9)

Ethiopia’s ash cloud heads toward India

Here's the top 10 things to know:

DGCA issued an advisory on Monday asking airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions from the volcanic ash plume drifting from Ethiopia.

According to IndiaMetSky Weather the ash cloud entered Gujarat Monday evening before moving towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab. The service stated: ""Ash cloud is about to enter Gujarat (West side) and move towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab by 10 pm, and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions.""

The plume is travelling 100–120 km/h at altitudes between 15,000 and 45,000 feet, carrying ash, sulphur dioxide and microscopic glass and rock particles.

Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM have cancelled flights, with routes to the Middle East and Europe particularly affected. Akasa Air said: ""Following recent volcanic activity in Ethiopia and the resulting ash plume in the surrounding airspace, our flights to and from Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled for 24th and 25th November 2025 have been cancelled.""

DGCA instructed airlines to avoid ash-affected airspace, revise flight planning and immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine anomalies or cabin smoke/odour.

Airports have been told to inspect runways, taxiways and aprons and restrict operations until cleaning is completed if ash contamination is detected.

Mumbai airport warned passengers: ""A volcanic eruption in Ethiopia has affected airspace over parts of West Asia, which may impact some international routes.""

Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.

The explosive eruption, which began around 8:30 am UTC [1.30 pm IST] on Sunday, marks the first activity from the nearly 10,000-year-dormant volcano.

After the eruption, volcanic ash activity has been reported over parts of the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in airlines issuing cautionary notices for passengers flying through the Middle East, though no advisories have mentioned ash drift toward India.

NEW DELHI: Airline operations across parts of the country faced disruptions after volcanic ash from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi eruption drifted toward western and northern regions, prompting the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday to issue a detailed advisory.The ash plume, travelling at high altitudes and significant speed, entered Gujarat and moved eastward through Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.With the cloud containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and fine glass particles, airlines have begun cancelling and diverting flights to avoid the dangerous plume.Airports have also been asked to remain vigilant and inspect surfaces for ash contamination that could affect aircraft engines and airfield operations.Multiple carriers, including IndiGo, Akasa Air, and KLM, have already modified schedules, while authorities continue monitoring the cloud’s trajectory. Disruptions are expected to evolve as the plume moves across northern India.IndiGo's Kannur-Abu Dhabi flight (6E 1433) diverted to Ahmedabad on Monday to avoid the affected corridor, while another Indian carrier operating into Abu Dhabi conducted extensive engine checks before beginning its return journey, reported news agency ANI.","Ash cloud from Ethiopia's volcano expected to reach North India by 10 pm.

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

New Labour Codes: Why will your take home pay go down?

Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages.

and payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of their total CTC, or meet the government-specified percentage.

This adjustment will lead to higher contributions as both PF and gratuity calculations are based on an individual’s basic pay .

. Whilst this change ensures enhanced retirement benefits for workers, it also means reduced take-home pay, as the increased contributions will come from the existing CTC.

The regulation concerning basic salary aims to stop organisations from intentionally maintaining low basic salary whilst increasing allowances to reduce their obligations towards retirement benefits and gratuity.

Currently, PF contributions are set at 12% of the basic salary, whilst gratuity payments are determined by the final basic pay and tenure at an organisation.

New labour Codes: Impact on Take-Home Salary

.

New Labour Codes: Top points to know

.

New labour codes 2025: The government has notified the new labour laws that may require companies to ensure that the basic salary makes up at least 50% of the total cost-to-company (CTC). This could potentially prompt changes in how pay packages are structured. As a result, for many employees, take-home pay could come down over time as contributions to retirement savings are likely to rise.The government has unified 29 labour-related central laws into four extensive Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020), and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020). Starting November 21, 2025, these Codes seek to simplify regulatory compliance, enhance worker safeguards, and modernise India's workforce regulations in accordance with contemporary economic conditions.The Code on Wages became operational on Friday, with the government expected to announce detailed rules within the next 45 days. Companies will need to restructure their salary frameworks to comply with these new regulations.According to experts, employees might receive reduced take-home pay under the new rules, as both provident fund and gratuity contributions would increase within the existing CTC framework.""The new labour codes unify the definition of 'wages' under the Code on Wages and Social Security. This would mean better retirement security through higher gratuity and provident fund but a possible dip in take-home pay if employers restructure allowances downward to offset costs,"" Suchita Dutta, executive director of the Indian Staffing Federation was quoted as saying by ET.The standardisation of wage definitions across labour codes ensures uniformity in computing social security benefits.""Wages now include basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance; 50% of the total remuneration (or such percentage as may be notified) shall be added back to compute wages, ensuring consistency in calculating gratuity, pension and social security benefits,"" explains Anjali Malhotra, partner at professional services firm Nangia Group.According to Puneet Gupta, partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, the implementation of labour codes could result in increased gratuity payments since calculations will be based on ""wages"", encompassing basic salary and all allowances, excluding HRA and conveyance allowance.The new labour codes introduce universal minimum wages for all employees across organised and unorganised sectors, replacing the earlier system that covered only about 30% of workers.A statutory floor wage will be set by the government based on minimum living standards, and no state can fix wages below this benchmark.A uniform definition of wages now applies, where basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance together must account for at least 50% of total remuneration.The codes mandate gender equality, prohibiting discrimination in hiring, wages, or employment terms for similar work, along with universal wage payment coverage that ensures timely payments and prevents unauthorised deductions for employees earning up to ₹24,000 per month. Overtime compensation must be paid at twice the normal rate.Several compliance and enforcement reforms are included as well. Decriminalisation of offences replaces imprisonment with monetary penalties for first-time violations, and compounding of offences allows certain fines to be settled without prosecution.The threshold for government approval of lay-offs, retrenchment, or closure has increased from 100 to 300 workers, with states allowed to raise it further.Work-from-home is formally recognised in services sectors based on mutual agreement, while dispute resolution will be handled by two-member tribunals for faster outcomes.A mandatory 14-day strike notice aims to prevent sudden disruptions and includes mass casual leave within the definition of a strike.The codes extend social protections to new categories, requiring aggregators to contribute 1–2% of annual turnover towards gig and platform workers’ social security (capped at 5% of their payments).Fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after just one year of continuous service instead of five.The inspector-cum-facilitator system introduces randomised, technology-driven inspections to reduce harassment and improve transparency. Compliance is simplified through digitisation of records, as well as a streamlined one license, one registration, one return system.Employers must issue formal appointment letters detailing job roles, wages, and social security.The codes also expand labour flexibility and reduce burdens on small units.Night shifts for women are permitted in all establishments with their consent and safety measures. Contract labour rules include an all-India licence valid for five years.Factory thresholds have been raised to 20 workers for units using power and 40 for those without, reducing compliance requirements for smaller factories.Finally, working hours remain capped at 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week, with flexible weekly structures allowed through mutual consent.","The government has unified 29 labour-related central laws into four extensive Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020) Starting November 21, 2025, these Codes seek to simplify regulatory compliance, enhance worker safeguards, and modernise India's workforce regulations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125516988,imgsize-41896,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-code-impact.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a self-evident fact, asserted Indian govt as China reiterated its claim over the northeast Indian state following controversy over the detention of an Arunachal Pradesh woman at Shanghai airport.No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality, said the ministry of extrenal affairs (MEA) in a statement on Tuesday. ""The issue of the detention has been taken up strongly with the Chinese side. Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, adding that the action by Chinese also violated their own regulations that allow visa-free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries.The ministry was responding to the Chinese foreign ministry's remarks on the ""arbitrary"" detention of an Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh, who was holding a valid passport and was transiting through Shanghai International Airport on her onward travel to Japan.Denying that the woman was detained or harassed, the Chinese foreign ministry had earlier said border checks on people entering and exiting a country and carrying out law enforcement according to the ""specific situation of the entry or exit is the usual practice"" of border enforcement authorities of countries.India on Monday lodged a strong protest with China for the treatment meted out to the Indian.""Zangnan is China's territory.

NEW DLEHI: China on Tuesday denied allegations that an Indian woman from Arunachal Pradesh was harassed or detained at Shanghai airport, insisting that its border checks were conducted strictly “in accordance with laws and regulations. ” The statement came even as India lodged a strong diplomatic protest.The woman, Pema Wangjom Thongdok, a UK-based Indian passport holder, was travelling from London to Japan on November 21 when immigration officials reportedly flagged her passport as “invalid” because it listed Arunachal Pradesh as her birthplace.She later wrote on social media that she was held for around 18 hours, until officials at the Indian Consulate in Shanghai intervened.Responding to PTI’s query on the incident, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the woman was not subjected to any coercive action.“During the entire time, China’s border inspection authorities carried out checks procedures in accordance with laws and regulations… no compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called ‘detaining’ or ‘harassing’,” Mao said, adding that the airline had provided “resting facilities and meals.”Mao also said Beijing’s position on the state, saying, “Zangnan is China’s territory, and China does not recognise the so-called Arunachal Pradesh illegally established by India.”Citing sources agencies said, a demarche was issued to China in New Delhi and Beijing on the day of the incident, asserting that Arunachal Pradesh is an “indisputable” part of India and residents are entitled to travel on Indian passports. The Indian Consulate in Shanghai “extended the fullest assistance” to the passenger, officials added.Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu said he was “deeply shocked” and called the episode a “violation of international norms and an affront to the dignity of Indian citizens.”The Congress party, reacting sharply to Mao’s remarks, accused Beijing of making an “offensive” statement and urged the government to respond firmly.In a post on X, the party said China’s comments were “extremely objectionable” and “a blatant attack on India’s integrity,” adding that “India will not tolerate such low-level rhetoric.”(With inputs from agencies)","Pema Wangjom Thongdok, a UK-based Indian passport holder, was travelling from London to Japan.

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice Surya Kant has said the growing backlog of cases - 5.4 crore in trial courts, high courts and Supreme Court put together - is a manifestation of deeper structural bottlenecks in the system.The CJI declined to elaborate on his efforts to ensure adequate representation of women and regional representation among SC judges as well as the issue of selective implementation of collegium recommendations for appointments and transfers by the government. ""I am working on these issues,"" he said.After taking oath as CJI on Monday, Justice Kant told TOI, ""A scientific and comprehensive approach is essential to address the challenge of pendency across all tiers of the judiciary."" As of Tuesday, 4.8 crore cases were pending in trial courts, 63.8 lakh in high courts, and more than 90,000 in SC.Batting for a healthy three-tier judiciary that expeditiously addresses citizen's grievances, the CJI said, ""Our judicial system operates as an integrated whole, with each tier serving a crucial purpose. The effectiveness of our democracy depends on the robust functioning of all three levels of the judiciary.""Attributing pendency mainly to acute infrastructural deficiencies, the CJI said, ""A coordinated effort by government and the judiciary is needed. What is urgently required to be done are - timely identification of land and resources for courts, equipping them with essential facilities and expeditious completion of judicial infrastructural projects,"" he said, adding that the emphasis on mediation and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms is expected to lessen the burden on courts in the future.Asked about the growing sense of disappointment among HC judges because of the 'big brother' approach of SC on the judicial side, the CJI said, ""The relationship between HCs and SC is one of constitutional complementarity, not competition. Both institutions serve distinct yet harmonious roles within our federal democracy.""He said the HC's power under Article 225 (jurisdiction of HCs) is in many aspects broader than SC's power under Article 32 (right to constitutional remedies). And, in many instances, SC has asked litigants to first approach HCs for ventilating their grievances, the CJI said. ""The real strength of HCs lies in their proximity to the people. They engage directly with regional realities and local challenges,"" he said.""A vast majority of constitutional matters - right to protection, administrative oversight, executive accountability - continues to be addressed by HCs.

This made the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi ask senior advocate Balbir Singh, appearing for SEC, to furnish details by Friday.SC sought by Friday details of the 57 civic bodies where the 50% quota limit is breached and also the percentage of OBC quota in those municipal councils and nagar panchayats. The SEC said the poll schedule for 32 zila parishads and 20 municipal corporations has not yet been finalised.SEC said if Banthia commission recommendations are to be followed, then the delimitation and prescription of reservation as per the percentage of backward and tribal population would be required to be worked out afresh for each civic body, which will take considerable time. The SC had directed the civic body polls, which have not been held for a considerable period, to be held based on reservation in vogue prior to the Banthia report.Appearing for the Maharashtra govt, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said discussions are going on to harmonise the reservations to the extent possible and sought two days' time to get back with response to the court.CJI Kant-led bench said, ""Ultimately if we find that reservation exceeds 50%, we will set it aside as it is constitutionally impermissible. The completion of the election process will not impede SC from striking down the elections if it violated the binding norms laid by constitution benches of the court.""Both SG and senior advocates Indira Jaising and Shekhar Naphade said the reservation has exceeded in civic bodies in five districts where an overwhelming majority of the population are tribals. ""Should their representation be limited because of the 50% ceiling,"" asked Jaising.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place. Our Consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended fullest assistance to the stranded passenger.”It was asserted Arunachal Pradesh is an ‘indisputably Indian territory,’ calling the reason for detention as ‘ludicrous.’“It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.

Airline issue warnings



NEW DELHI: An ash cloud from Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano hit parts of India Monday evening, according to IndiaMetSky Weather. The plumes first entered Gujarat from the west and then moved rapidly toward Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab by around 10 pm, and is drifting towards the Himalayas and other northern regions.Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.The ash plume is travelling at altitudes between 15,000-25,000 feet, rising up to 45,000 feet in some layers, and carries volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide, and tiny particles of glass and rock.IndiaMetSky Weather warned that skies could appear ""darker and hazier than usual"" and said that the plume may disrupt air traffic and lead to ""delays and longer travel.""The Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said the explosive eruption began around 8:30 am GMT on Sunday, marking the first activity from the almost 10,000-year-dormant Hayli Gubbi volcano.Thick columns of ash rose up to 14 kilometres into the sky from the Afar region, located around 800 km northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border.The VAAC confirmed that while the eruption had stopped, ""a large ash plume is moving toward northern India.""The volcano sits within the geologically active Rift Valley, where two tectonic plates meet. After erupting, the ash swept across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman before drifting eastwards into India and northern Pakistan, according to VAAC and regional media outlets.The windborne ash cloud swept across vast stretches of northwest India on Monday night, passing over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR and Punjab. Visibility dipped in several pockets as the plume drifted eastward.IndiaMetSky Weather said, ""Ash clouds moving towards North India. A large ash plume can be seen stretching from #HayliGubbi Volcano region upto #Gujarat. The eruption has stopped ever since the eruption, but this Ash plume has been sent up into the atmosphere, which is moving at a speed of 100-120km/h toward North India.”It added that the plume, containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and ""small particles of glass/rock,"" would likely darken the skies and impact flight routes. ""The Ash cloud is about to enter #Gujarat (West side) and move towards #Rajasthan NW #Maharashtra, #Delhi, #Haryana and #Punjab by 10 pm and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions,"" the agency said.By late night, the sulphur dioxide–rich plume was already moving over Delhi, NCR, Haryana and adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh. IndiaMetSky Weather explained that although some pockets of ash could be seen over Rajasthan, chances of ashfall on the plains remained ""less.""Also read: 'Moving at a speed of 100-120km/h': Ethiopian volcanic ash drifts towards India — 10 things to know According to the meteorological service, the ash cloud’s altitude means that India’s surface-level AQI is not expected to deteriorate.It reiterated that the event was ""mostly safe"" and said it would ""not like to impact surface AQI levels as Ash clouds are in 25,000 to 45,000 feet above the surface.""The agency said the plume was stretching from the Oman–Arabian Sea region into northern and central India. ""Its will not impact AQI levels but it will impact So2 level at #Hills of #Nepal, #Himalayas and adjoining Terai belt of #UttarPradesh as some of the material will bump into the hills and later move into China,"" it posted on X.It clarified that the plume would drift over Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan, but the impact on the ground would be limited to darker skies and hazier conditions.While a few particles might fall to the surface, IndiaMetSky described the likelihood as ""low.”The agency also noted that residents might notice skies resembling a dust storm, though without harmful concentrations of particulate matter at ground level. People were advised to wear masks as a precaution, but officials stressed that the event was occurring at ""middle levels of the atmosphere.""Also read: Ethiopia’s volcanic ash cloud enters India: Is Delhi's already ‘very poor’ air at risk?

In India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) released an advisory on Monday instructing airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions.It directed carriers to avoid volcanic-ash-affected routes and adjust flight plans, routing and fuel loads based on the latest advisories. The DGCA also said airports must immediately inspect runways, taxiways and aprons if ash contamination is suspected and restrict operations until cleaning is completed.Also Read: What is the new Ethiopian volcanic ash cloud speeding towards India?

'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

Mallikarjun Kharge on Karnataka power tussle

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Tuesday remarked that he does not want to discuss the CM change issue “publicly,” describing it as a “secret deal” involving “four and five people” in the party.Shivakumar, who also heads the Karnataka Congress, explained that he does not want to cause any “embarrassment” to the grand old party.“I don’t know. I have not asked to be made CM. It is a secret deal between five and six of us. I don’t want to speak publicly on this. I believe in my conscience. We should work with our conscience. I don’t want to embarrass the party or weaken it. If the party is there, we are there. If ‘karyakartas’ are there, we are there,” he told reporters, according to PTI. He was visiting his home constituency, Kanakapura.“The chief minister ( Siddaramaiah ) has spoken. He is a senior leader, an asset for the party. He has completed 7.5 years as CM,” Shivakumar added, referring to Siddaramaiah’s earlier five-year term from 2013–2018.Asked about legislators backing him travelling to Delhi to meet the Congress high command with a demand to make him CM, Shivakumar responded that he was ""unaware"" of it, suggesting they might be making efforts to secure ministerial positions.“I have not telephoned or called any of them (legislators) or spoken to them. I’m not asking them why they went. I don’t need it,” he remarked.A batch of six Congress legislators supporting him had travelled to Delhi on November 23 to meet senior leaders, according to party sources, who added that a few more MLAs are likely to follow soon to push Shivakumar’s case.Last week, around ten legislators backing him had met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge with the same demand.The power tussle within the ruling party has intensified amid speculation over a leadership change, after the state government reached the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, following talk of a “power-sharing” agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar in 2023.Meanwhile, Kharge, too, maintained that the issue of leadership change in Karnataka is not something to be taken up in public.The veteran leader, in Delhi to attend Constitution Day celebrations on Wednesday, told reporters: “This is not a subject to be discussed here and that too in public. I have specially come to attend an event related to Constitution Day. After the event, I have review meetings, after which I will proceed further.”Siddaramaiah has repeatedly maintained that he will remain chief minister for the full five-year term and will continue to present future state budgets.", DK Shivakumar says he does not want to discuss the CM change issue ‘publicly’ He says it is a ‘secret deal’ involving ‘four and five people’ in the party.

NEW DELHI: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has full confidence in India's security under PM Narendra Modi, stressed the former's office after reports appeared in Israeli media saying he had postponed his visit because of concerns over the recent Delhi blast.Neither side had announced the visit. Earlier in the day, Indian govt sources strongly denied that there was any link between the blast and the proposed Netanyahu visit. ""Media reports in this regard are misleading and factually incorrect. Drawing links with the Delhi blast is irresponsible. We would urge caution against such misleading news stories,"" said a source.Netanyahu's visit has been pending since 2023, when the Oct 7 Hamas terrorist attacks scuttled a proposed bilateral visit. With a ceasefire in place, even if fragile, both sides were in touch about a possible visit in Dec. However, as Netanyahu's office said, India and Israel are contemplating a new date - the visit is now expected to take place early next year.Israel's bond with India and that between Netanyahu and Modi remain very strong, the Israeli PMO said, adding the PM had full confidence in India's security apparatus, and teams were already coordinating a new visit date.","Netanyahu's visit has been pending since 2023, when the Oct 7 Hamas terrorist attacks scuttled a proposed bilateral visit.

NEW DELHI: A fresh calculation by Enforcement Directorate shows that if fugitive Sandesara brothers - Nitin and Chetan - stick to their offer to pay Rs 5,100 crore to lender banks, they will have paid more than what they owe these financial institutions.Govt has already recovered Rs 4,700 crore from the Sandesaras' Sterling Biotech Ltd (SBL) since 2018, when the agency began its money laundering probe against the duo and attached more than Rs 14,500 crore worth of their assets in India and abroad, including oil rigs, ships and aircraft in Nigeria. With their fresh commitment, the total recoveries would now be over Rs 9,800 crore, sources said. This is much higher than the banks' earlier demand of Rs 6,700 crore as one-time settlement.A day after Supreme Court took on record the Sandesara brothers' commitment to pay Rs 5,100 crore - if they were allowed to return to India and run their business, and criminal proceedings against them were dropped - there was celebration in ED headquarters over the biggest recovery from accused since enactment of Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The total recovery in the case is now set to touch Rs 10,000 crore.Their offer will bring relief to an interesting cast that was found to have links with SBL and whose assets were treated as ""proceeds of crime"" and attached.The attached assets, which may now be released, include properties of actors Sanjay Khan (Rs 3 crore), Dino Morea (Rs 1.4 crore), DJ Aqeel (Rs 2 crore), Congress neta Sonia Gandhi's political secretary the late Ahmed Patel (Rs 2.5 crore) and his son-in-law Irfan Siddiqui's properties worth Rs 2.4 crore, besides 23 luxury vehicles of Sandesara brothers and their associates.The success in bringing the duo to the negotiating table is also being credited to the accused siblings being declared fugitive economic offenders in Sept 2020.""This declaration strengthened ED's position considerably because it enabled the agency to seek confiscation of all their properties, irrespective of whether they were proceeds of crime or untainted assets,"" sources said. This recognised that SBL's promoters had deliberately avoided the jurisdiction of Indian courts.""It is the continuous pressure created by ED and the coordinated approach of other agencies that compelled the group to eventually seek a resolution on terms acceptable to the lenders and the state. What appears on the surface as a concession is in reality the final step in a long process of enforcement, asset-tracing and legal action, much of it undertaken by ED, which ultimately brought the fugitives to the negotiating table,"" a senior official said.The Sandesara brothers and their SBL had already paid Rs 3,508 crore on various dates during legal proceedings before various courts. In addition, the insolvency proceedings against their group entities yielded another Rs 1,192 crore, the official said.""With this, the total realisation becomes significant. The amounts already recovered (Rs 4,700 crore) along with what is now being ordered by SC (Rs 5,100 crore) add up to Rs 9,800 crore. This is nearly double the figure alleged in the FIR and it shows that the enforcement and recovery process has resulted in a substantial net restitution to the banking system,"" the official added.CBI's FIR registered in 2017 had alleged diversion and defaults by the group amounting to Rs 5,383 crore. The lender banks had later proposed one-time settlement for all dues for Rs 6,761 crore. The recoveries of nearly Rs 10,000 crore exceeds even their expectations.","The total recovery in the case is now set to touch Rs 10,000 crore. Supreme Court took on record the Sandesara brothers' commitment to pay Rs 5,100 crore - if they were allowed to return to India and run their business.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125573545,imgsize-1020536,width-400,resizemode-4/article-65.jpg"
"Cannot monitor, entertain every hate speech case in country: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-monitor-entertain-every-hate-speech-case-in-country-sc/articleshow/125572876.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed its reluctance to take cognisance and interfere in cases of hate speeches brought before it from every nook and corner of the country, and said the aggrieved person should instead approach police or the concerned high court to raise their grievances.While hearing an application pertaining to alleged calls made by lawmakers of various states for the social and economic boycott of a particular community, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said it was not possible for the apex court to entertain every such incident. The bench said SC had already passed the order and it was for police to take action as per law.""How can this court continue to monitor all such instances all over the country? You approach the authorities. Let them take action, otherwise go to HC,"" the bench said.Advocate Nizam Pasha, appearing for journalist Qurban Ali, submitted that the state authorities were not taking action and the apex court order was being violated with impunity. He said the top court had itself passed an order directing that suo-motu action must be taken by police in case of hate speech, failing which contempt proceedings would be initiated.Opposing the plea, solicitor general Tushar Mehta submitted that only instances of hate speeches against a particular community are brought before the court and not all hate speech cases. He also questioned the motive behind the application. ""No one can indulge in hate speech - that is my stand. But while complaining, a public spirited person cannot be selective,"" Mehta said.But Pasha said hate speeches calling for social and economic boycott were made by MLAs and various organisations. He told the court an Assam minister made a controversial remark on ""gobi farming"" after the Bihar assembly poll result which allegedly referred to a gory incident during the 1989 Bhagalpur riots.""It is submitted that a call for boycott whether made by a public authority or a private citizen is in violation of Article 15 of the Constitution, particularly when the said boycott is based solely on religious grounds. It is pertinent to note that such calls for boycott based solely on religion are a threat to national unity and integrity and are also blot on the idea of India as envisioned by framers of our Constitution. The said instances of banishment have remained unchecked by the state authorities despite being duty bound to protect all the citizens of this country. It is further submitted that the major brunt of this gross discrimination is borne by the lowest income groups,"" the application said.The court, after a brief hearing, directed that the applications will be heard along with the main case and posted it for next month.Last month, the court had agreed to hear an application filed by former Patna HC judge Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali who brought to the court's notice a video circulated by Assam BJP in support of its claim that Muslims would take over the state if BJP goes out of office.","Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said it was not possible for the apex court to entertain every such incident.

Treat cricket betting profits as 'proceeds of crime': HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/treat-cricket-betting-profits-as-proceeds-of-crime-hc/articleshow/125572327.cms,"NEW DELHI: Profits from cricket betting will be treated as ""proceeds of crime"" under the money laundering law if the money is found to be linked to a criminal activity defined as a scheduled offence under PMLA, Delhi high court has ruled.Justices Kshetarpal and Shankar dismissed a batch of petitions filed by several individuals involved in an alleged Rs 2,400-crore international cricket betting racket, dating to 2015, who had challenged the provisional attachment orders issued over a decade ago by ED.In Sept 2015, ED attached movable and immovable properties valued at Rs 20 crore belonging to the accused and issued a show-cause notice in Oct 2015 for money laundering. The action was initiated in connection with large-scale hawala transactions and illegal international cricket betting operations conducted through a UK-based website, Betfair.com.ED alleged that the operations were run from a farmhouse in a village in Vadodara. The attachment followed a raid on the residence of one of the accused, who was allegedly acting as a conduit in the betting network. He had reportedly bought master and client login IDs for a betting platform at Rs 2.4 crore each and made payments abroad through unauthorised channels.The agency found these IDs were issued without the KYC process. ED recovered incriminating documents, valuables and Rs 10 lakh in cash. The petitioners challenged these actions in HC.The bench observed, ""If a person acquires any immovable property through acts of forgery, cheating, and criminal conspiracy, and thereafter utilises such property for a downstream activity - such as conducting an unlicensed real-estate business, which is not a scheduled offence - the proceeds generated from the latter activity nonetheless constitute 'proceeds of crime' under PMLA.""","Justices Kshetarpal and Shankar dismissed a batch of petitions filed by several individuals involved in an alleged Rs 2,400-crore international cricket betting racket.

Omar Abdullah slams BJP in Muslims’ admission row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-abdullah-slams-bjp-in-muslims-admission-row/articleshow/125571221.cms,"Omar Abdullah (File photo)

SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah slammed Tuesday BJP’s objections to admission of Muslims in Katra’s Vaishno Devi Medical College, saying the party should then have it declared as a minority institution.Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary joined Omar in denouncing BJP’s stance, with the two heavyweights of the governing National Conference (NC) framing its objections as a direct challenge to India’s secular principles and constitutional values.“If you don’t want Muslim students to study in the medical college, then declare it a minority institution. There is one Sikh candidate and several Muslim candidates, let them know it so they can withdraw and seek admission elsewhere. If this continues, our children will go elsewhere. They will go to Bangladesh or Turkey to study,” Omar said.The row erupted after the new college filled seats strictly on NEET’s merit list and reserved 85% of its seats for J&K domiciles, with only eight Hindu students from Jammu making it to the first MBBS batch of 50.After the admissions were completed, VHP and Bajrang Dal were the first to protest, arguing that an institution funded by Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindus only.BJP joined them later. On Saturday, BJP’s leader of opposition Sunil Sharma formally lodged a protest with J&K lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, who is ex-officio chairman of the shrine board, submitting a memorandum seeking a review of admission norms.On Tuesday, J&K BJP president and Rajya Sabha member Sat Sharma reiterated the position, saying only those who have faith in Shri Mata Vaishno Devi should get admission in the medical college, which comes under Mata Vaishno Devi University.Omar questioned the stance. “When the J&K assembly passed the bill (for the university)...it was clearly stated that admissions will be based on merit. If you want admissions without merit, then seek permission from Supreme Court. As far as I know, our Constitution does not allow religion-based admissions,” the CM said.Omar urged BJP to read the bill under which Mata Vaishno Devi University was established, insisting nowhere does it mention “religion-based admissions”.The CM drew a parallel with Vaishno Devi Hospital, which has been functioning in Katra for several years. “If that logic is applied, then Muslims or non-Hindus should be denied treatment at the hospital? Where will it end? Should we ask people their faith before giving them ration? Should the police decide their duty based on religion?” Omar said.The word “secularism” is still in the Constitution, Omar pointed out. “If you don’t want secularism in this country, remove it from the Constitution. Then you can do what you want, and we will do what we must.”Deputy CM Choudhary asserted that admissions cannot be tied to faith. “These (medical college) students have qualified NEET. We must maintain brotherhood and it shouldn’t be made an issue,” Choudhary said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah slams BJP's objections to admission of Muslims in Katra's Vaishno Devi Medical College.

NEW DELHI: With reporting irregularities in implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) scheme, seven states have imposed penalties to the tune of around Rs 129 crore, including the maximum Rs 120 crore by Gujarat, against contractors and others, and registered cases against them and certain officials following a directive from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spare no one when it comes to irregularities in the flagship initiative.Modi is learnt to have also instructed the Jal Shakti ministry and the states concerned to initiate action against all such cases of irregularities and directed the strict monitoring of the scheme, with zero tolerance for any financial, procedural and quality-related violations.The govt has recovered around Rs 13 crore in these states so far, with more than Rs 6.6 crore being recovered from Gujarat. The six other states from where penalty recovery has been made are Rajasthan (Rs 5.3 crore), Maharashtra (Rs 2 crore), Tripura (Rs 1.2 crore), Karnataka (Rs 1 crore), Assam (Rs 5 lakh) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 3 lakh).According to the ministry, 20 states/UTs — Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Ladakh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and West Bengal — have reported cases of irregularities and taken action in 607 cases against 621 departmental officials, 969 contractors and 153 Third Party Inspection Agencies (TPIAs).Nine FIRs have been registered against 20 officials, 10 contractors, and 1 TPIA.

SHAHABAD, KURUKSHETRA: India’s cooperation sector is set for major expansion as Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah has set a national target to establish 150 new sugar mills in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a Developed India by 2047, said Haryana Cooperation, Jails, Elections, Heritage and Tourism Minister Dr Arvind Sharma. He said that work has already begun to set up a cooperative sugar mill in Naraingarh, marking the state's contribution to this national initiative.Addressing the inaugural ceremonies of the 50th crushing season of the Karnal Cooperative Sugar Mill and the 42nd crushing season of the Shahabad Cooperative Sugar Mill through online mode, Minister Sharma highlighted that Haryana has taken significant steps to support sugarcane farmers. He said chief minister Nayab Singh Saini has announced the highest sugarcane procurement price in the country—Rs 415 per quintal for early varieties and Rs 408 per quintal for late varieties. Sharma said he would soon meet the chief minister along with public representatives to request special incentive schemes for sugarcane farmers.The events were attended by cabinet minister Krishna Kumar Bedi, MP Naveen Jindal, MLA Ramkaran Kala in Shahabad, and Chief Whip and Indri MLA Ramkumar Kashyap, along with Sugar Federation MD Shakti Singh and farmers in Karnal.Sharma emphasised that the cooperative sector will play a crucial role in fulfilling the nation’s development goals. He noted that the Haryana government has ensured timely payment to farmers and introduced an online token system, which has helped farmers save 10–12 hours in transporting cane to the mills.Thanks to last year’s efforts to reconnect former cane growers with the mills, Karnal Mill is expected to crush 3.9 lakh quintals more cane, while Shahabad Mill will receive an additional 2 lakh quintals this season. Both mills continue to win national awards and are progressing with the collective hard work of farmers and staff.Sharma said he would urge the CM to provide subsidised harvesting machinery to ease farmers’ workload and launch new incentive schemes to encourage continuous cane cultivation. He directed mill managements to prioritise farmers’ welfare, “win their hearts,” and ensure they face no difficulties.Reaffirming the government’s commitment, Dr Sharma said that both the Centre and the Haryana government are dedicated to strengthening farmers’ interests. He conveyed CM Saini’s greetings to the farmers and management teams on the commencement of the crushing season.Senior officials, including Shahabad Mill MD Pradeep Ahlawat and Karnal Mill MD Aditi, were also present on the occasion.","Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah has set a national target to establish 150 new sugar mills in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a Developed India by 2047.

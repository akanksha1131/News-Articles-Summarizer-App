Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

"Bihar polls: My age may be young, but my promise is mature, says Tejashwi Yadav",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-my-age-may-be-young-but-my-promise-is-mature-says-tejashwi-yadav/articleshow/125009260.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav (ANI)

As the Bihar assembly election campaign intensifies, INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, lays out his vision for development, employment and economic justice while taking aim at his political rivals.

He shares his plans to create jobs, strengthen the economy and build an inclusive Bihar with TOI’s AlokKNMishra. Excerpts:

You are the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc and have been campaigning extensively across Bihar for the past several weeks. What promises are you making to people, and what feedback are you getting?

“My Age May Be Young, But My Promise Is Mature,” Says Tejashwi Yadav Ahead of Bihar Polls

You have pledged to provide a govt job for every family. Critics argue that this may not be financially feasible for Bihar, which does not have the financial resources to fund this. How do you plan to implement this promise?

Have you consulted experts, carried out any study or prepared a blueprint for this?

The INDIA bloc and the NDA are both contesting the election on the development plank. How is the RJD-led alliance’s development plank different from the NDA's?

Having served as deputy chief minister under Nitish Kumar, what do you think about Nitish Kumar's style of leadership and the way he runs the Government?

RJD has traditionally relied on support from the Muslim-Yadav vote base. This time, you have fielded more candidates from women, Dalits, and EBC communities. How is the RJD attempting to broaden its appeal beyond the MuslimYadav combination?

The voting patterns in recent Bihar elections indicate that a larger share of EBC, upper-caste and several groups within the Dalit community voters have favoured the NDA over the RJD

Women in Bihar have traditionally been seen as strong supporters of Nitish Kumar. What strategies is the RJD adopting to attract more women voters in this election?

Do you think the women of Bihar are going to support the INDIA bloc this time?

The NDA is contesting the election under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, but it has not yet categorically announced that Nitish will be the CM if the NDA wins. What is your view on this?

Why will the NDA not make Nitish Kumar the CM?

RJD rule in Bihar ended 20 years ago. Even now, many people say that a return of the RJD to power could bring back the ‘jungle raj’ of the past. Why do such perceptions persist even after so many years since the RJD last governed Bihar?

You have been saying that Lalu Yadav gave social justice to the people of Bihar, and you will deliver economic justice. Can you elaborate?

There have been reports of internal differences within the INDIA bloc. How have you addressed or managed these challenges?

But across 11 se

ats, the INDIA bloc partners are contesting against each other in what is being described as a friendly fight.

Congress is an important partner of the RJD-led alliance in Bihar. It won 19 seats in 2020. How do you feel it is going to perform in this election?

Did you give any suggestions to Congress when they were finalising the tickets?

There seems to be tension in your family, with your elder brother’s newly formed party (Janshakti Janata Dal) contesting the election against many RJD candidates. As his younger brother, many would expect him to support you and stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this crucial time. How do you respond to this?

Is there any possibility of the RJD again aligning with Nitish Kumar’s party JD(U) in future?

How challenging is Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj for the INDIA bloc?

You are the INDIA bloc’s CM face. The VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) chief is the deputy chief minister face. Is there a possibility that there could be another deputy CM from the Muslim community?

We have taken an oath to make Bihar the number one state in the country and that is our ultimate objective. Our vision is to build a Bihar where no Bihari brother or sister has to migrate in search of work or opportunities. Every facility and opportunity should be available right here, in our own state. Bihar should have factories and job opportunities, as well as quality hospitals, colleges and universities.Factories should be set up, jute mills reopened, food processing units established and new IT parks and SEZs developed.Our goal is to make Bihar an educational hub so that students do not have to go to places like Kota to prepare for exams and we want to build good hospitals so that people do not have to travel outside the state for treatment. Bihar today is one of the poorest states with the lowest per capita income. We are determined to change that by ensuring that every citizen has access to education, healthcare, income, opportunities and justice – and that the govt is truly action-oriented.Bihar also has immense potential in the tourism sector – whether it is religious tourism, heritage tourism or general tourism. We want to develop this potential and promote Bihar as a major tourism destination. We want to make such a Bihar that moves ahead on the path of progress. We are getting a great response from the people who want a change in Bihar.Let the people say what they want to say. The last time, they were saying that giving 10 lakh jobs was impossible. Now, the same people – the BJP and JD(U) – have been forced to talk about jobs, and they are saying they will give one crore jobs. We have done and shown what we promised.We gave five lakh jobs – about 3.5 lakh every year during the 17 months from Aug 2022 to Jan 2024, when I served as deputy chief minister in the Grand Alliance govt. We also gave the status of Bihar govt employees to over four lakh contractual teachers in the state in Dec 2023. So, we have already done it, and soon we will turn this task – which looks impossible – into a possible one. My age may be young, but my promise is mature.We do not make any announcements without consulting the experts and without conducting the required research and study. We only make announcements that are feasible and practical. We have prepared the blueprint for it.The NDA has no development plank and no vision for Bihar. The BJP wants factories to be set up only in Gujarat – the semiconductor factory is in Gujarat, investor meetings are held there, SEZs are established there, and even the international stadium is built there.Everything is being done in Gujarat, while nothing is being done for Bihar. They have no road map or vision for Bihar. Amit Shah (union home minister) himself said that there is a dearth of land in Bihar, which is why factories and industries cannot be set up here. So, they have made it clear that they have no development plan for Bihar.At present, Nitish Kumar has been reduced to just a puppet. BJP is running the govt while Nitish Kumar is merely a figurehead – the real power lies with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. We even have sympathy for Nitish Kumar, considering his current condition.This is the same Nitish Kumar who once snapped ties with the NDA after Narendra Modi was announced the chief of the BJP’s campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He had even cancelled a dinner planned for Modi in Patna. In the past, the same Nitish Kumar returned the Rs 5 crore Koshi flood relief donation from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat govt in 2010 when the Gujarat govt issued advertisements for it.And now, Nitish ji has, unfortunately, become a puppet and his health condition also does not allow him to run the govt effectivelyThe RJD has always been a party for everyone – inclusive since the very beginning. No govt has given as much representation in the state cabinet to upper castes as the one led by Laluji. Similarly, no other govt has matched the number of leaders from the EBC category who were made MLAs, MLCs, and given various opportunities under the govt of Laluji.It was Laluji who made Bhagwati Devi, the daughter of the Musahar community, an MP. He ensured that every section of society received respect and representation in governance. Yes, some people may have left us at times, but eventually, all of them have come back — because they know that the RJD truly belongs to everyone.In the 2020 election, the difference between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan was only 12,000 votes, which was less than 1%. It shows that we got votes from all sections of society.The women have woken up now. The truth has come out in the open – that women were often exploited and were denied the respect and rights they truly deserved. This is why there is a growing sense of dissatisfaction among women with the Nitish govt.See, due to growing dissatisfaction among women, the Nitish govt had to give a Rs 10,000 bribe to each woman just before the elections. They realised that their support base among women was drifting away, especially after we announced the ‘Mai Bahin Maan Yojana’ for the women of Bihar, under which women in Bihar will receive Rs 2,500 per month as financial assistance to make them financially independent, and we spoke about making Jeevika Didis permanent.This has clearly panicked the NDA. That is why they are giving out Rs 10,000 in the middle of the election, and yet the Election Commission is not stopping them. What is the emergency that justifies this?Amit Shah ji and the BJP are clear that Nitish Kumar will not become the chief minister again. It is totally clear. He will meet the same fate as Shinde ji (Eknath Shinde was not reinstated as CM after the BJP won a majority in the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections).His situation is not the same. The BJP wants to have its own chief minister in Bihar because, until now, they have never had one. They aspire for it, but that ambition will never be fulfilled.See, this is nothing but complete propaganda and a wrong perception fuelled by those opposed to the RJD. Lalu ji always gave respect to everyone and worked to ensure equality in society. Those who considered themselves superior by birth had to sit at the same level as Dalits and backward communities. This created resentment among such people. True superiority comes from one’s actions, not from birth. Lalu ji made everyone equal and upheld this principle consistently.We are living in an economic age, and people deserve economic justice. Inflation is soaring, jobs are scarce, and household expenses are rising rapidly. How are people supposed to manage their daily lives? Since Modi came to power, under the NDA govt, everything has become more expensive.Modi ji had promised to bring down inflation, but prices have risen fivefold since he took office – fuel, food, and almost everything has become costlier, while people’s incomes remain stagnant. Small and medium-scale factories are shutting down, businesses are struggling and the economy is not growing as it should. The situation worsened further after Trump imposed tariffs. Now is the time to ensure true economic justice for the people.There were no fissures in the INDIA bloc. There was no problem. It was only in the media.The friendly fight is being conducted strategically. In Jharkhand, we contested and won elections despite similar arrangements. Likewise, in Jammu & Kashmir, the INDIA bloc had friendly fights, and they emerged victorious. In Bihar, the situation is no different. We remain united and strong, contesting the elections with our full strength, and we are going to win the elections.Congress will perform much better this time. We are confident of winning more seats compared to 2020, as we have focused carefully on the winnability factor and meticulously selected our candidates.We all sit together and discuss it – the selection of candidates.That’s alright. In a democracy, everyone has the right to form their own party and contest elections. Yes, it would have been far better if the things that happened had not happened, but this is the reality, and we have to accept it.Now, the Janata Dal (United) will not survive after the elections are over. Half of the JD(U) leaders will go to the BJP and half will come to the RJD.We do not care about such things – who is coming to Bihar, who is making what party. Our only focus is to make Bihar the number one state in the country. Our fight is against unemployment.It has already been announced that there will be one more deputy CM if the INDIA bloc forms the govt. When the right time comes, the decision about it will be taken collectively by the alliance partners and an announcement will be made.","Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc.

Team India are set to pocket a record-breaking sum from the International Cricket Council (ICC) following their historic victory in the Women’s World Cup 2025 final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.With the win, India not only lifted their maiden Women’s World Cup title but also secured the highest-ever prize money in the history of cricket - a whopping USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore).The amount is part of a total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (about Rs 123 crore), which was announced by the ICC ahead of the event. This was a whopping 297 per cent increase from the USD 3.5 million purse at the 2022 edition in New Zealand.The winners’ prize of USD 4.48 million represents a 239 per cent jump from the USD 1.32 million that Australia received for winning the last edition, while runners-up South Africa will earn USD 2.24 million (Rs 19.88 crore).Each losing semi-finalist is entitled to USD 1.12 million (Rs 9.94 crore), while all eight teams were guaranteed USD 250,000 for participation, plus an additional USD 34,314 for every group-stage win.According to a PTI report, the BCCI is also considering matching the prize and bonuses that the men’s team received after their T20 World Cup 2024 win.A senior BCCI source told PTI, “The BCCI supports equal pay for men and women and hence there are lot of discussions that if our girls win the World Cup, the reward won't be anything less compared to the men's global triumph. But it isn't nice to make an announcement before they win the Cup.”The Rohit Sharma-led men’s team was awarded ₹125 crore for their T20 World Cup victory last year, a figure that could now serve as a benchmark for the women’s side following their landmark success.As the celebrations continue in Navi Mumbai, India’s triumph, and the record prize it brings marks a defining moment for women’s cricket and reflects the ICC’s stated goal of “a world-class Women’s Cricket World Cup” and “a clear commitment to long-term growth.”The final saw Team India women defeat Laura Wolvaardt's South Africa by 52 runs in Navi Mumbai.","India women secured a historic win at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai to secure a record sum in prize money from the ICC.

MUMBAI: Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met, according to the FIR filed by assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, who entered the premises with three other cops to rescue the children and shot the captor in self defence after he “pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist at children’s side for a moment, and then pointed it towards me and my team, and he was about to fire”.Assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, complainant in the hostage crisis, said in the FIR he reached the RA Studio complex around 2pm when chaos broke out. “A few parents rushed in, shouting that their children were not answering calls. Someone showed me a video circulating on WhatsApp — a man named Rohit Arryya claiming he had taken several children hostage inside the studio. He was threatening to burn the place down if anyone tried to intervene.Within minutes, police teams led by API Sohail Subedar and senior PI Sonawane reached the spot. The atmosphere was tense—parents were crying, and we could smell petrol from outside the studio. The accused doused the premises with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met. There were also batteries nearby. Police gained access through a duct and reached the first-floor bathroom where the children were confined.” TOI has a copy of the FIR.The children were kept hostage on the first floor. Waghmare along with sub-inspectors Rakesh Nalawade, Bade and Shinde entered through the bathroom window with the help of fire brigade. “We heard children crying in the bathroom.Then Rohit Aarrya entered and, leaving the children alone, at a distance of about two to three feet, he used a pepper spray, and then pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist... and was about to fire. To save myself, our team and children from being harmed, I fired a shot from my service pistol and he was injured. He was immediately taken to Jogeshwari trauma care hospital and the hostages were rescued and handed over to their parents. ”The FIR stated before the police team entered the studio, Rohan Aher who worked as assistant to Aarrya appeared at the window and told the cops that Aarrya had confined four children with ropes and put adhesive tapes on their mouths. “We saw a person from the window on the first floor saying his name was Rohit Aarrya and he started talking to us policemen. At that time, since his voice was not clear, Sonawane took his mobile number from one Amol Dorugade and called Aarrya on his mobile number. ” Aher is the key witness in the case, said the police.Cops requested him to release the children and promised to fulfil his demands. DCP Datta Nalawade called and tried to talk to him, but he was not stating clearly what his demand was. He threatened on phone that he would set the place on fire and may harm the children, the FIR said.","Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met.

Deadly Stampede at Andhra Pradesh After Chaos, Panic Strikes Venkateswara Temple, At Least 10 Dead





VIJAYAWADA: A stampede at a privately run temple in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh killed nine devotees — eight women and a 13-year-old boy — and left more than 25 injured Saturday morning, after a railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.The toll may rise as the condition of some of the injured is critical.The Venkateswara Swamy temple, located at Kasibugga under Palasa mandal and modelled on the Tirumala shrine in Tirupati, was built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda from Odisha and opened just four months ago.One gate serving as both entry and exit, poor crowd control, and lack of official clearance turned the pilgrimage into chaos. “Nobody is responsible — it was an act of god,” Panda said.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said the main sanctum sits on the first floor with about 20 steps leading to it.“A railing along the staircase, believed to be poorly constructed, collapsed and caused a person to fall, triggering panic as the packed crowd surged forward,” he said.Calling the deaths “extremely heart-breaking”, CM N Chandrababu Naidu said: “Had police been informed in advance, they could have implemented a crowd management plan.Those responsible will face action.”Venkateswara Swamy temple at Kasibugga, visited by around 3,000 devotees on Saturdays, saw a crowd nearly seven times that number on the day of the stampede as it was the first Karthika Ekadashi since the temple’s inauguration. With no prior approval for the gathering or adequate security, the few guards were overwhelmed.District police chief K V Maheswara Reddy said temple authorities failed to alert police or the district administration about the festival and the likely crowd. Police have registered a case under section 100 (culpable homicide) of BNS and detained four temple staff for questioning.The shrine isn’t registered with Andhra Pradesh’s endowments department, which oversees thousands of temples. “Everything looked fine around 9am, but suddenly the number of devotees surged. Narrow stairway was choked. I was nearby when the railing broke and people started falling over each other,” said R Ramanamma, a devotee.The deceasad were identified as E Chinnammi (46), R Vijaya (48) from Tekkali; M Neelamma (60) from Vajrapukotturu; D Rajeswari (60), G Rupa (50), B Brunda from Mandasa; Ch Yasodamma (56) from Nandigam; D Ammulamma from Kasibugga; and L Nikhil (13) from Sompeta. Two women — B Kalavathi and R Kumari — remain critical. “I have instructed officials to ensure proper treatment for the injured,” chief minister Naidu said.PM Modi said he was “pained” by the tragedy. “My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover soon,” he said, announcing Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to each victim’s family and Rs 50,000 to the injured. Saturday’s crush was the third major temple tragedy in Andhra Pradesh this year — following six deaths at Tirupati’s Vaikunta Ekadashi token centre on Jan 8 and seven killed in a wall collapse at Visakhapatnam’s Simhachalam temple on Apr 30.","A railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.

Gold Card versus EB-5



EB-5's rising momentum



MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite the high approval rate for applications, the EB-5 route remains a high-stakes bet: a blend of financial investment, immigration strategy, and faith in the American market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it. Despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card.

slams attempts to crush farmers’ movement

Justice N V Ramana (retd) disclosed Saturday that the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021 because they supported Amaravati capital city project of Andhra Pradesh.""All of you present here know how my family was targeted and criminal cases were filed against them. All this was done only to coerce me,"" he said while addressing students at the convocation ceremony of VIT-AP at Amaravati.The Jagan Reddy government diluted the previous N Chandrababu Naidu government's Amaravati capital project by announcing the trifurcation of the capital, which was opposed by farmers whose land had already been acquired.The farmers agitated for five years from 2019 till 2024 and the trifurcation idea was dropped after the Chandrababu Naidu government returned to office last year.Recalling his deep association with Amaravati since his student days, he said, ""Present-day Amaravati owes its existence to the resilience of the farmers of this region. The city survives on the back of the farmers' struggle, one of the longest in southern India.""Talking about attempts to ""crush the farmers' struggle"", Justice Ramana said, ""Rarely the media or any politician ever spoken the truth or given real credit as to how the capital of Amaravati survived and sustained,"" he said.Briefly touching on the ""painful days of police action"" against his family members, the former CJI said, ""I was not alone. During that difficult period, all those who empathised with the cause of the farmers, faced intimidation and coercion."" ""Even members of the judiciary who upheld constitutional principles faced transfers, pressure, and at times, persecution. Families of judges, who had no role, suffered collateral damage because of political machinations,"" he said.In these testing times, many political leaders hesitated to take a stand and preferred silence, he said. ""It was the jurists, lawyers and the courts which stood by their constitutional promise,"" he said. ""While govts may change, the courts and the rule of law remain as the anchor of stability. The rule of law survives only when people, in whom the public repose trust, decline to surrender their integrity for convenience,"" he said.""In the coming times, the role of farmers, lawyers, jurists, members of civil society and judges will have to remain the enduring source of inspiration with their integrity and commitment to rule of law,"" he said.",Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021.

NEW DELHI: India and Afghanistan are set to further ramp up their diplomatic relations with the appointment of a diplomat by the Taliban regime here this month. This will be the first official placement of a diplomat by the Taliban in India since their return to Kabul in August 2021 and will be followed - as conveyed by Kabul to Indian authorities - by the appointment of another diplomat in late December or early January.The relationship has progressed steadily this year, culminating in an unprecedented visit by foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India last month. India has reinforced its role as a trusted partner of Afghanistan with its continued supply of aid and medical supplies to the country, even in the absence of an official recognition by the Indian govt of the dispensation in Kabul.Muttaqi's visit saw India announcing its decision to upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to the level of embassy and also agreeing to accept Taliban diplomats. Both sides are expected to soon have a charge d'affaires leading their respective missions.A Taliban spokesperson on Sunday expressed appreciation for India's donation of over 16 tonnes of anti-vector-borne disease medicines. ""This latest donation underscores India's longstanding partnership and developmental support to Afghanistan. By contributing essential medical supplies, India reaffirms its role as a reliable partner in promoting health, stability and humanitarian cooperation in the region,"" he said.Muttaqi's visit was significant as it also saw the Taliban backing India's sovereignty over J&K. India too has firmly supported Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity, at a time the Taliban's ties with Pakistan have hit a nadir because of heavy border clashes. The two countries have reached a ceasefire but the threat of an escalation is yet to fully dissipate. The Taliban this week accused Pakistan of working to create chaos in Afghanistan that would allow the US to return and take over Bagram airbase.","The relationship has progressed steadily this year, culminating in an unprecedented visit by foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India last month.

When he sought stay of trial proceedings, the bench declined and said it would hear arguments on constitutionality of the law.Appearing for the state, additional solicitor general K M Nataraj said govt had filed its affidavit, which said the anti-gangster law was a special law, like NIA Act and PMLA, and was required to address the deteriorating law and order situation because of activities of gangsters. It said the anti-gangsters law classified an accused as a member of a gang if he was ""acting either singly or collectively, by violence, or threat of violence, or intimidation, or coercion or otherwise with the object of disturbing public order or of gaining any undue temporal, pecuniary, indulge in antisocial activities"".The UP govt said the classification was fair and reasonable, and had a nexus with the objective of ""combating the rapidly escalating phenomenon of gangsterism in the state"", prevalent criminal statutes having failed to curb the same.Citing similar laws enacted by other states, the UP govt said attachment of properties of those booked under this law was a necessity. ""The scheme of the Act, insofar as it contemplates attachment of properties of an accused prior to conviction, is necessary because of the fact that on initiation of criminal proceedings, it is often the case that the accused transfer or alienate the properties acquired by them through commission of offences to frustrate the trial,"" it said.""In view of the covert nature of the operation of gangs, recovery of such properties, consequent to their alienation by the accused, is rendered hopeless. The Union and state legislatures have provided for similar provisions in Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act,"" it said.","Petitioner Siraj Ahmed Khan had challenged his arrest under the anti-gangster law. His counsel, senior advocate Amit Anand Tiwari, had told a bench led by CJI B R Gavai on Friday that attachment of property prior to a person being pronounced guilty was ex facie unconstitutional.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125041802,imgsize-1428575,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

The Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO ) on Sunday successfully launched CMS-03, the heaviest communication satellite to be launched from India, onboard its LVM3-M5 (GSLV-MkIII) heavy-lift rocket from the Second Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre , Sriharikota. The mission marks the fifth operational flight of the LVM3 vehicle. The previous mission using the rocket was Chandrayaan-3 on July 14, 2023.Around 16minutes after liftoff, the rocket with a total lift off mass of 642 tonnes and a height of 43.5 metres, placed the 4410-kg CMS-03 satellite into a Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO).The mission’s flight sequence began with the ignition of both S200 boosters at lift-off, followed by their separation at around 131.14 seconds when the vehicle reached an altitude of 62.3 km. The L110 stage ignited at 106.94 seconds and separated at 304.70 seconds, at an altitude of 166.9 km. The C25 cryogenic stage ignited at 307.10 seconds and continued its burn until 950.94 seconds, achieving an inertial velocity of 10.14 km/s. The CMS-03 satellite separated from the launch vehicle at 965.94 seconds at an altitude of 179.8 km, completing its insertion into the targeted orbit.PM Modi congratulated Isro and wrote on social media platform X, ""Our space sector continues to make us proud! Congratulations ISRO on the successful launch of India’s heaviest communication satellite, CMS-03.Powered by our space scientists, it is commendable how our space sector has become synonymous with excellence and innovation. Their successes have furthered national progress and empowered countless lives. ""The LVM3-M5 vehicle, which has seven consecutive successful missions, consisted of two solid strap-on boosters (S200), a liquid core stage (L110), and a cryogenic upper stage (C25), all housed within a 5-metre diameter Ogive Payload Fairing. Each S200 motor carried 204.5 tonnes of Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-based solid propellant, while the L110 core contained 115.9 tonnes of UH25 and N2O4 liquid propellants. The C25 cryogenic stage was loaded with 28.6 tonnes of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.On the occasion, Isro chairman V Narayanan said, ""LVM3-M5 successfully injected into the required orbit precisely. This is the 8th consecutive successful launch by LVM3. CMS-03 is the heaviest satellite placed in GTO orbit. The vehicle performance was enhanced to increase its payload capacity by 10%.""""The satellite has a life of 15 years and carries a host of new technologies. We accomplished this mission despite the difficult weather condition. The launch also had the reignition of C20 cryogenic engine for the first time after placing the satellite.

Mokama Murder Case: JD(U) Candidate Anant Singh Arrested Over Killing of Jan Suraaj Worker

From allies to arch-rivals

The killing that reignited the faultlines



The caste arithmetic in Mokama

Bhumihars: Around 55,000–60,000

Yadavs: Around 40,000

Dhanuks (Koeris): Around 45,000

Muslims and Dalits: Together account for roughly 30 per cent of the electorate.

Verdict to echo beyond boundaries

NEW DELHI: The murder of 76-year-old Dularchand Yadav while he was campaigning for a Jan Suraaj candidate has ruptured a long-smouldering local equilibrium in Mokama, turning what should have been a routine assembly fight into a high-stakes prestige battle between two bahubali figures and the caste blocs that back them.The Mokama battle is centred around two powerful strongmen from the influential Bhumihar caste: Anant Singh , akaof JD(U) and Surajbhan Singh, who is aligned with RJD.What was shaping up to be a familiar, muscle-driven election in Mokama has now turned into a prestige battle with caste loyalties, community pride, and the question of law and order hanging in the balance.To understand the intensity of Mokama’s politics, one must go back two decades to a time when the Singh brothers of Barh and Mokama defined the region’s power matrix. Anant Kumar Singh, once a close aide of Nitish Kumar , rose rapidly in the early 2000s as the enforcer of the JD(U)’s presence in the Bhumihar belt. Known for his flamboyant persona, blunt speech, and a knack for dispensing justice outside the system, Anant became both feared and adored -- the archetypal bahubali of central Bihar.On the other hand, Surajbhan Singh, hailing from the nearby Begusarai–Barh area, was cut from the same cloth -- a Bhumihar strongman who turned to politics after a string of criminal cases.Aligned first with the LJP under Ram Vilas Paswan and later seen close to the RJD ecosystem, Surajbhan represented the rival pole of Bhumihar assertion. Their rivalry was not just personal. It was territorial and symbolic.Both commanded loyalty among the Bhumihars, both controlled local networks of influence, and both saw themselves as the natural claimant to the region’s political crown.In the early 2000s, there were phases when the two operated within the same broader political alliance. But as Nitish Kumar consolidated power in 2005, Anant Singh emerged as the JD(U)’s uncontested strongman, while Surajbhan’s camp drifted toward the LJP-RJD axis.Anant Singh's political rise, from muscleman to MLA, coincided with Surajbhan's declining electoral influence due to criminal convictions. Yet, the latter's family continued to retain sway over nearby constituencies through his wife, Veena Devi.Over the years, the rivalry took violent turns as their supporters clashed over land control, local contracts, and political dominance.Mokama, Barh, and adjoining areas became a microcosm of Bihar’s bahubali politics, where muscle met caste mobilisation and the rule of law often bent to the weight of reputation.The murder of Dularchand Yadav on Thursday has revived the darker shades of that rivalry. Yadav, a campaigner for Jan Suraaj, was reportedly attacked while mobilising support for the party’s candidate in a region where Yadav and Dhanuk voters are crucial swing blocs.Police have arrested Anant Singh in connection with the killing, prompting a wave of outrage from opposition ranks and a renewed debate over Bihar’s law and order under Nitish Kumar.For the ruling camp, it’s an embarrassment to have a high-profile candidate in custody during an election campaign. For the opposition, it is less a moral crusade than a political opening and a chance to highlight administrative ""lapses"", question Nitish Kumar's control over his own strongmen, and mobilise discontent in a constituency long defined by muscle and loyalty rather than party lines.However, reacting to Anant Singh's arrest, the ruling NDA has maintained that, unlike the Lalu regime, no leader can have immunity from legal action.According to the latest electoral roll (as of January 2024), Mokama has about 2.9 lakh registered voters. The constituency’s caste composition is sharply layered:In the 2020 Bihar Assembly election, Anant Kumar Singh, contesting as an Independent, secured 78,721 votes, which was about 53 per cent of all valid votes cast in Mokama. The victory affirmed his influence among sections of the Bhumihar community, which forms a significant part of the constituency’s voter base.This time, however, the equations appear more fluid. The killing of a Jan Suraaj worker belonging to the Yadav community has introduced an unpredictable element into the contest.It is believed the incident could influence voter sentiment, particularly among backward caste groups such as Yadavs and Dhanuks, who together make up nearly 30 per cent of the electorate.At the same time, the Bhumihar vote, which has largely remained cohesive in previous elections, may witness some degree of division given the presence of more than one influential leader from within the community.With both Anant Singh and Surajbhan Singh commanding their own networks, political observers say a section of forward-caste voters could align differently this time.In a constituency with fewer than three lakh electors, even a 5–10 per cent shift in turnout or community alignment is equivalent to about 15,000–25,000 votes, which could significantly affect the final outcome.If Anant Singh wins, it will restate that the Bahubali era in Bihar has not ended -- it has merely evolved. The forms may have changed, but the substance of power remains rooted in personality, caste pride, and the defiant cult of local strongmen.For Nitish Kumar, a victory under such a shadow would still signal control, proof that his political arithmetic can withstand scandal, sentiment, and scrutiny alike.If the opposition wrests the seat, it would not necessarily mark a moral shift, for none of Mokama’s contenders are untouched by the state’s legacy of muscle and might, but it would signal a recalibration. It would suggest that alliances, caste equations, and public perception can still tilt the scales even against entrenched power.Either way, the fight in Mokama has outgrown the ballot box. It has become a test of endurance between two political orders, both born of Bihar’s rough-and-tumble past, both adapting to a voter base that now weighs loyalty as much as legacy.","The murder of 76-year-old Dularchand Yadav has ruptured a long-smouldering local equilibrium in Mokama. It has turned what should have been a routine assembly fight into a high-stakes prestige battle between two bahubali figures and the caste blocs that back them.

'Vote For Bihar’s Future, Not Family Rule': Nitish Kumar Targets Lalu Yadav, RJD In Pre-Poll Message

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has drawn sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after videos of him celebrating Halloween with his grandchildren surfaced on social media on Saturday.The BJP accused the former Bihar chief minister of hypocrisy, pointing out that he had earlier termed the Maha Kumbh festival “meaningless”.The party’s Kisan Morcha, in a post on X, said, “Don’t forget, people of Bihar, this is the same Lalu Yadav who had called the grand festival of faith and spirituality Maha Kumbh useless and is now celebrating the festival of Halloween. Those who attack faith will not get votes from the people of Bihar.”The videos were shared by Lalu’s daughter and RJD leader Rohini Acharya, who posted pictures of the family’s Halloween celebrations with the caption, “Happy Halloween to everyone.” The visuals showed Yadav posing for photos with his grandchildren dressed in costumes.Halloween, observed annually on October 31, is one of the most popular festivals in Western countries. Its roots trace back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the close of the harvest season and the onset of winter - a period once thought to dissolve the boundary between the living and the dead.In modern times, the celebration features costumes, trick-or-treating, pumpkin carving, eerie decorations, and themed parties.Lalu had sparked a row in February this year after he called the Maha Kumbh festival in Prayagraj “faltu"" (meaningless). Asked about the large crowds attending the religious gathering, he had said, “The Kumbh has no meaning… It is just meaningless.” His comment came while reacting to a stampede at the New Delhi railway station that left 18 people dead and several injured as passengers rushed to board trains bound for the religious congregation.Asked about the massive crowds travelling to Prayagraj and measures for crowd management, the RJD chief had said, “Kumbh ka kahan koi matlab hai. Faltu hai Kumbh (Is there any meaning to Kumbh? It is just meaningless).”The remarks triggered strong criticism from the BJP and several Hindu religious leaders, who accused Yadav of politicising the tragedy. Bihar BJP spokesperson Manoj Sharma said the statement reflected the RJD’s “mindset towards Hinduism”, while deputy chief minister Vijay Kumar Sinha charged the RJD leader with insulting Sanatana dharma and engaging in politics over the deaths.The fresh exchange between the BJP and RJD comes just days before the Bihar assembly elections, with polling scheduled in two phases on November 6 and 11 for the 243-seat assembly. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","Lalu Prasad Yadav has drawn sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) The BJP accused the former Bihar chief minister of hypocrisy, pointing out that he had earlier termed the Maha Kumbh festival ""meaningless"" The fresh exchange comes just days before the Bihar assembly elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125028769,imgsize-1026852,width-400,resizemode-4/lalu-yadav-with-his-grandchildren-rohiniacharya2.jpg"

PM Modi Rips Into RJD-Congress For ‘Insulting Faith’, Warns Bihar Voters

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday sharpened his attack on the Opposition’s INDIA bloc during his campaign rallies in Bihar’s Arrah, Bhojpur, and Nawada districts, alleging that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) “forced” the Congress to announce Tejashwi Yadav as their chief ministerial candidate.As per PTI, PM Modi claimed that the Congress “never wanted” Tejashwi to be declared the alliance’s CM face but was pressured into doing so. “The RJD secured it by placing a katta (country-made gun) on the head of the Congress. They have learnt their lessons in the school of jungle raj. Such elements can never do good for Bihar,” he said at a rally in Bhojpur.The Prime Minister alleged that the RJD’s “hooliganism” and “strong-arm politics” reflected the party’s old ways of governance.As per news agency ANI, the Prime Minister said, “Just a day before nomination filing, behind closed doors, gundagardi was happening. Congress did not want to have an RJD CM, but RJD did not leave the opportunity. They put a gun on Congress' head and stole the CM’s post.”He further claimed that the alliance partners were divided and would “break each other’s heads” after the elections.PM Modi also said that the ruling NDA represented unity and development, while the Opposition alliance symbolised “jungle raj marked by katta, grirta, katuta, kusanskar, kushashan, and corruption.”He alleged that the RJD-Congress combine was working to “erase Bihar’s identity” by supporting infiltrators.In Nawada, PM Modi highlighted the NDA’s promise to give an additional Rs 3,000 to farmers under the state’s ‘Kapurgari Thakur Kisan Samman Nidhi’ scheme, over and above the ₹6,000 provided annually under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi.“This is Modi — jinhe koi nahi poochhta, Modi unhe poojta hai (Modi worships those whom no one else cares about),” he said, as reported by ANI.The PM claimed Rs 650 crore had already been deposited into accounts of two lakh farmers in Nawada and noted that the NDA’s policies were aimed at uplifting small farmers, “ignored since Independence.”He also took a swipe at the Congress for corruption during past governments, recalling Rajiv Gandhi’s remark that only “15 paisa out of every rupee sent from Delhi reached the villages.”PM Modi added that his government ensures that “the full amount reaches farmers without any cut or commission.”As per news agency PTI, the PM urged people to reject “those responsible for jungle raj,” asserting that the NDA government was “upright, foresighted, and committed to building a developed Bihar as part of a Viksit Bharat.”He also invoked Operation Sindoor, saying it “made the nation proud,” and targeted the Congress for “losing sleep when terrorists were being bombed.”Polling for Bihar’s 243 assembly seats will take place in two phases: on November 6 and 11, with counting on November 14.",PM Narendra Modi sharpened his attack on the Opposition’s INDIA bloc during his campaign rallies in Bihar.

MUMBAI: A 45-year-old social entrepreneur who ran a project for the state govt held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series.The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.Police said Aarrya owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes and had extensively worked with children.They said he had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call.Auditions began at 10am and the children—hailing from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state—arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative’s Chembur flat for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted “simple answers” to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him.In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted “to be heard”. “Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,” he said.The captor, Rohit Aarrya , was a social entrepreneur and project management consultant who owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile showed he was an alumnus of Symbiosis International University, Pune, and had completed an executive MBA from ISB, Mumbai.He had worked extensively with children on the central govt’s Swacchh Bharat initiative, saying he was inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s plan for cleanliness in public spaces.Since 2017, Aarrya had engaged actors, including Prem Chopra, to enact short videos to generate awareness. He claimed actor Ramesh Deo as his mentor. His social media profiles contain pictures of ministers and a few celebrities.He said he had taken the children hostage “according to a plan”. “I really want to conduct the ‘Let’s Change’ programme. I am going to do it. If I am alive, then I will do it. If I die, then someone else will do it. But it will definitely happen,” he said.His tone then turned menacing. “It will happen with these kids only if they are not harmed. Because the slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this place on fire and die in it.Whether I die or not, the kids will definitely be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised. I don’t know what will happen to them. If something does happen to them, I should not be held responsible.""Those persons should be held responsible who are triggering this unnecessarily, when a normal, common person just wants to talk.

Please do not trigger me to do some harm to anybody.”Police spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with the captor, Rohit Aarrya, and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls’ parents said she suffered from seizures, cops said. An official said he appeared calm when police spoke to him.City police chief Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with lives. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option.”Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the priority, adding that the team’s response was measured and as per the protocol. The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry.","Rohit Aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai. The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124979949,imgsize-109926,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, ""thwarting for 70 years"" the construction of the temple, which he said had been a matter of struggle ""since the times of the Mughals, and continued under the British"".Shah praised the Modi government for developing a new university at Nalanda, saying ""no Bakhtiyar Khilji will be able to destroy"" it. He also mentioned an ongoing project worth about Rs 850 crore to develop Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi district, which is linked to the birthplace of Goddess Sita. ""In two years from now, you will see PM Modi performing the consecration ceremony (pran pratishtha) at Punaura Dham,"" he said.At a rally in Nalanda, Shah opened his speech with references to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. He then criticised the previous RJD governments led by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, saying Bihar witnessed ""over 32,000 kidnappings and 12 major massacres"" during their tenure. He said, ""Nitish Kumar ended the ‘jungle raj’... but RJD is trying to bring back ‘jungle raj’ in the state with a new face.""Shah rejected claims by Tejashwi Yadav that the NDA would take back money deposited in women’s accounts under welfare schemes. ""Nobody can dare to take that money back. RJD leaders must give up this diatribe,"" he said.The home minister said that during Nitish Kumar’s time in power, ""there has been a 20 per cent drop in murders while dacoities and kidnappings have gone down by 80 per cent"". He added, ""We are preparing the youth of Bihar to win medals in the 2036 Olympics that will happen in India.""","Amit Shah takes 'Italy' Jibe at Rahul Gandhi after Cong MP Targets PM Modi over Chhath 'Nautanki' He asks voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124980899,imgsize-681244,width-400,resizemode-4/lkn-35.jpg"

Bengaluru Road Rage Horror: Delivery Boy Chased, Crushed To Death By Martial Arts Trainer Couple

Victim Darshan

The accused, Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30)





BENGALURU: A chilling CCTV footage has emerged showing a Kalaripayattu trainer and his wife deliberately mowing down a 24-year-old food delivery agent in a fit of rage — and returning to the crime scene later to collect broken car parts.Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident that killed Darshan, a resident of Kembattalli.The couple, married for five years, has been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.The CCTV footage, accessed by police from Nataraja Layout in South Bengaluru, has revealed the sequence of events that turned a minor brush on the road into a murder.Also read: Delivery boy chased, crushed after road rage spat; martial arts trainer, wife arrested for murder Around 9pm, Darshan’s gearless scooter accidentally brushed against Kumar’s car, slightly damaging its right-side rear-view mirror. Though Darshan apologised and sped away — as he was on his way to deliver food — Kumar allegedly lost his temper.“Losing control of himself, he took a U-turn, chased the scooter, and rammed it from behind,” said a senior investigating officer. “The impact threw Darshan and his pillion rider Varun onto the road.The car didn’t stop.”Locals rushed the duo to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Darshan brought dead. His sister later filed a hit-and-run case with JP Nagar traffic police.But when investigators examined the CCTV footage, they were stunned. “To our horror, we discovered it was not an accident. The driver deliberately veered left and rammed into the scooter,” a senior officer said.Further footage showed the same car returning to the accident site around 9.40pm. “The couple, wearing masks, parked nearby and collected parts of their car that had broken off during the impact. As they left again, CCTV cameras captured their faces clearly,” the officer added.The footage helped police identify the car and trace the couple to their residence. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Lokesh Jagalasar confirmed the arrests, saying, “The accused have confessed to their involvement.”While Manoj claimed he was alone during the ramming and that Aarati had only accompanied him later to retrieve the car parts, police said they are verifying his version.Darshan, a bachelor, is survived by his parents and sister. His family is demanding strict action against the accused.","Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan.

Man behind Mumbai hostage scare sat on hunger strike over Rs 2 crore govt dues; new details emerge According to police, Arya had released a video in which he demanded to speak to certain individuals and warned that he would harm himself and the children and “set everything on fire” if prevented.The standoff ended after a police inspector forced entry into the studio and seized an airgun and some chemical from Arya’s possession, Powai police said.Joint Commissioner of Police (L&O) Satyanarayan Chaudhary said, “Prima facie, the motive behind the hostage act appears to be related to some pending work-related dues.”Police said the incident was reported around 1.45 pm, when a distress call from the studio prompted teams from Powai and Sakinaka police stations to rush to the spot.The children, aged between 13 and 17 years, had reportedly travelled from different parts of Maharashtra to attend an audition for an ad shoot being held at the studio.Officials had described the accused as mentally unstable and said they acted swiftly to defuse the situation. Police confirmed that all the children were rescued safely and have been handed over to their parents.The captor, Rohit Aarrya, a social entrepreneur & project management consultant, owned a company that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile shows he was an alumnus of Symbiosis and ISB-Mumbai.Three years ago, he launched a ‘Swachhata Monitor’ in various schools across the state.The next year, he sat on a hunger strike against the then education minister Deepak Kesarkar alleging non-payment of Rs 2 crore dues.","A man identified as Rohit Arya allegedly took 19 people hostage, including 17 children, a senior citizen and one unidentified man.

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

How Michael Irvin discovered his wife’s early-onset Alzheimer’s

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

“It’s quite hard to take care of someone 24 hours a day… I have to keep a 24-hour nurse with her all the time.”

“If anyone has earned the right to stay in her house, MY WIFE HAS!!! … That I shall honour. No matter what it takes.”

Being a football legend is one thing, but facing life’s toughest plays off the field is a whole different ballgame. Michael Irvin , the iconic Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, has opened up about one of the most personal challenges of his life, his wife Sandy Harrell (née Irvin) has been diagnosed with very early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.Irvin, known for his unforgettable catches and fiery personality on the field, revealed that his wife’s symptoms first appeared around 8–10 years ago. At the time, they thought it might be normal aging or menopause but it soon became clear that something more serious was happening and it needed attention. His emotional revelation gives fans a glimpse of the human side of a public figure often celebrated for his athletic prowess.Talking candidly, Irvin shared:This initial uncertainty highlights how subtle the early signs of Alzheimer’s can be especially in someone so young.Very early-onset Alzheimer’s (diagnosed under 65) is rare, and Irvin’s story shows the complex emotions families face when symptoms first appear.Irvin didn’t shy away from describing the realities of caring for his wife:Balancing the responsibilities of caregiving with his public life has been a profound challenge. Yet, Irvin’s dedication never wavered. He emphasizes the emotional labor behind every decision, reflecting a side of him fans rarely see, the deep and unwavering devotion of a husband navigating one of life’s hardest battles.For Irvin, the focus has always been on Sandy’s comfort and dignity. He explained :Rather than placing her in a facility, the couple relies on a live-in caregiver to ensure Sandy remains in the home they built together. This choice underscores both love and respect, showing that Irvin’s heroics aren’t just on the football field they’re at home, too.Michael Irvin’s story is a reminder that real strength often comes in quiet, daily acts of love and care. Through sleepless nights, emotional trials, and public attention, he stands by Sandy, determined to honor her wishes and protect her dignity.

“Those songs hit her hard”: Blake Lively reportedly crushed after hearing Taylor Swift’s new songs as Travis Kelce helps fuel album buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/those-songs-hit-her-hard-blake-lively-reportedly-crushed-after-hearing-taylor-swifts-new-songs-as-travis-kelce-helps-fuel-album-buzz/articleshow/125015013.cms,"A reported rift between close friends Blake Lively and Taylor Swift is causing a stir, fueled by speculation surrounding Swift's new album. Fans are dissecting song titles and lyrics, believing they allude to Lively, intensifying rumors of a fallout. This alleged distance challenges the perception of Swift's seemingly unbreakable inner circle, raising concerns about professional repercussions for Lively.

The album rollout raises suspicion as fans attach meaning to specific tracks





Why this fracture hits different in celebrity culture





Hollywood friendships have always lived in a strange middle ground, they look unbreakable when cameras flash, yet they can shatter just as easily under the pressure of personal choices, creative control, and the public’s hunger to connect dots. That is why the reported rift between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift feels bigger than a typical celebrity cold patch.This isn’t a pair of distant acquaintances, this is a friendship that once looked bulletproof, from Swift becoming godmother to Lively’s children to their quiet but consistent show of support for each other during their heaviest career chapters. But since the release of Swift’s latest album The Life of a Showgirl, internet sleuthing and lyrics speculation has made their silent distance impossible to ignore.According to Radar Online, “Blake is devastated – this isn’t something she can easily move past.” And that is where things become more layered. The speculation is not rooted in coincidence, Swift herself personally revealed titles like Ruin the Friendship and CANCELLED! on fiancé Travis Kelce ’s New Heights podcast, which only intensified theories before a single track was heard.“Hearing those songs has hit her hard, and seeing people online convinced they’re about her just makes it even more painful,” the source added.Add to that, fans believe certain lines from “CANCELLED!” read like surgical references to Blake’s year tied to legal tension with Justin Baldoni. It doesn’t matter that Swift never names her, the public is convinced the arrows are labeled.This isn’t just about lyrics or an album cycle. This story is ripping at a cultural myth: that Swift’s inner circle is impenetrable. In a celebrity ecosystem where reputation is currency, Blake reportedly fears the professional splashback, because Swift’s silent distancing doesn’t stay silent for long.If this friendship is truly done, the end isn’t loud. It’s subtle, strategic, and eerily poetic.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s choreographer exposes her past struggles — from stage anxiety to finding confidence with Travis Kelce by her side","A reported rift between close friends Blake Lively and Taylor Swift is causing a stir.

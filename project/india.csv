Tu idhar udhar ki na baat kar, yeh bata ki kafila kyun luta, humein rahjano se gila nahi, teri rahbari ka sawal hai

Mana ki teri deed ke kaabil nahin hoon main, tu mera shauq dekh mera intezar dekh

Humein unse hai wafa ki ummeed jo nahin jante wafa kya hai

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , aged 92, passed away late on Thursday evening after prolonged illness.Manmohan Singh is widely regarded as the architect of the economic reforms introduced during PV Narasimha Rao's tenure, which contributed to India's economic growth . Beyond economics, Singh had a deep interest in ' shayari ' (Urdu poetry), often using it during parliamentary debates and press briefings to respond to political opponents.One of his most famous poetic statements was: "".""From 2009 to 2014, during the 15th Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, then Leader of the Opposition, engaged in several poetic exchanges with the former prime minister. One notable instance occurred in March 2011, during a heated discussion on a Wikileaks cable that alleged Congress had bribed MPs during the 2008 trust vote. Sushma Swaraj recited Shahab Jafari's lines:"" (Don’t change the topic, just tell why the caravan was looted, we have nothing to say about the robbers, but this is a question on your leadership).Manmohan Singh responded with Allama Iqbal’s couplet:"" (I know I am not worth your attention, but look at my longing).Another poetic exchange occurred in 2013 during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address. The former PM remarked with Mirza Ghalib’s words:"" (We expect loyalty from those who don’t know what loyalty is).In response, Sushma Swaraj recited two couplets. The first, by Bashir Badr:"" (There must be a reason for betraying love).Her second response was:"" (You don’t remember loyalty and we don’t remember disloyalty, life and death have two rhythms, you don’t remember one, we don’t remember the other).After Sushma Swaraj’s passing in August 2019, Manmohan Singh described her as a great parliamentarian and a talented Union minister.It is also worth noting the former PM's reply to the no-confidence motion against his government in 2008. Singh said almost prophetically, ""The greatness of democracy is that we are all birds of passage! We are here today, gone tomorrow! But in the brief time that the people of India entrust us with this responsibility, it is our duty to be honest and sincere in the discharge of these responsibilities.""","Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dies aged 92 after prolonged illness.

Watch: When Manmohan Singh attended Rajya Sabha in a wheelchair drawing praise from PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-when-manmohan-singh-attended-rajya-sabha-in-a-wheelchair-drawing-praise-from-pm-modi/articleshow/116697496.cms,"LIVE I 'Manmohan Singh Came In Wheelchair...': When Modi Heaped Praise On Former PM

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , then 91, made an appearance in the Rajya Sabha in a wheelchair. It was August 7, 2023, and the Upper House was deliberating on the contentious Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2023. Despite his frail health, Singh displayed his steadfast dedication to the democratic process.The bill at hand sought to enhance the central government’s authority over the affairs of Delhi’s administration, including framing rules regarding the functions, terms, and service conditions of officers and employees.Recognising the significance of the vote, the Congress party issued a stern three-line whip, urging its MPs to be present in full force. It called on its members to “remain present in the House from 11:00 am onwards till adjournment” and “support the party stand.”The dedication of the former Prime Minister did not go unnoticed.Days later, during the farewell session for retiring Rajya Sabha members, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Singh’s contribution and unwavering sense of duty. Recalling the moment, PM Modi said, “I remember in the other House, during the voting, it was known that the treasury bench would win, but Dr Manmohan Singh came in his wheelchair and cast his vote. This is an example of a member being alert to his duties.”Singh breathed his last at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on the night of December 26, at the age of 92 leaving behind a legacy that reshaped modern India.As finance minister in the 1990s, Singh’s visionary policies unshackled India from the licence raj, steering the country away from economic collapse. His tenure as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014 witnessed the implementation of transformative initiatives such as the Right to Information (RTI), the Right to Education (RTE), and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA).Manmohan Singh’s political career spanned over three decades, exclusively as a Rajya Sabha member. First elected in 1991, he served as leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before ascending to the nation’s highest executive office. Known for his erudition, humility, and ability to forge consensus, Singh’s contributions extended beyond Indian borders, earning him respect in global financial and economic spheres.","Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made an appearance in the Rajya Sabha in a wheelchair.

Dr. Manmohan Singh, Hon'ble Prime Minister's Press Conference

NEW DELHI: In one of his last press conferences as Prime Minister back in January 2014, Dr Manmohan Singh , who passed away at the age of 92 on Thursday, gave a fitting response to growing criticism about his leadership and remarked that 'history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media.'The press conference featured questions about the Congress veteran's leadership, which some called weak and indecisive. Singh faced these questions amid Bharatiya Janata Party's campaign to portray their PM candidate Narendra Modi as a strong leader.Singh defended his record, saying, ""I do not believe that I have been a weak Prime Minister. I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media or for that matter the opposition in Parliament. Given the political compulsions, I have done the best I could do.""He added, ""I have done as well as I could do according to the circumstances. It is for history to judge what I have done or what I have not done.""Singh's term ended when Narendra Modi became PM in May 2014.Criticising Modi and the 2002 Gujarat riots, Singh had said, ""If you measure the strength of Prime Minister by presiding over mass massacre of innocent citizens on streets of Ahmedabad, then I do not believe in it. I do not think that this kind of strength this country needs least from its Prime Minister. I sincerely believe what Narendra Modi is saying is not going to materialise,"" he stated.He also highlighted the Congress party's success in managing coalition governments during his two terms, saying compromises were made on 'peripheral issues and not on national problems.' When asked about internal criticism within the Congress, Singh responded, ""Nobody has asked me to step down because of any inadequacy that characterised my tenure as prime minister.""","Dr Manmohan Singh gave a fitting response to growing criticism about his leadership and remarked that 'history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media' The press conference featured questions about the Congress veteran's leadership, which some called weak and indecisive.

Manmohan Singh: Man who liberated India's dreams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-man-who-liberated-indias-dreams/articleshow/116696590.cms,"Singh got CWC to twice endorse

nuclear deal

NEW DELHI: It was likely his darkest hour as PM - the shine of popular approbation, a key factor in Congress-led alliance's 2009 election win, had worn off, to be replaced by ominous clouds with nary a silver lining in sight. But Singh, then at the helm of UPA-2's scandals-hit govt, where ministerial bickerings were routine, had a different take. ""History will be more kind to me,"" he said.He was right. And anyone, no matter their politics, would have agreed with Dr Singh's self-assessment as news broke that he breathed his last in AIIMS on Thursday, on a cold, foggy Delhi evening.No Indian PM could match him in nonchalance when facing a blizzard of bad news. Recall those days - Commonwealth scam, 2G scam, coal scam, Manmohan's big mantris behaving as if they didn't have a boss, Rahul Gandhi tearing up a bill okayed by Singh govt that opened a backdoor for convicted netas to come back to electoral politics.What informed the serene Sikh's cool self-confidence in the face of excoriating banner headlines on corruption and dysfunction? One, Singh was, in public life, unflappable. Two, he knew, even if his critics forgot in the heat of news, his legacy as the man who changed India's economic destiny was unchallengeable.The journey to his taking charge of India's economy showed another key trait in him. He was a determined pragmatist who smartly read the tea leaves of both politics and governance. When Indian Socialism was all the rage, he was an excellent technocrat serving the license-permit raj, When that very economic regime nearly brought India to ruin, and Narasimha Rao picked him - after IG Patel had turned down Rao's offer to be FM - to save the economy by changing India's economic DNA, Singh, with equal felicity, became the Sardar of Reforms. Communists and protection-loving corporate chiefs dissed Singh. It didn't affect him one bit. The 1991 rewriting of industrial policy and the budget that followed are milestones in India's evolution. If India is today reckoned globally as a serious economic player, if it's pegged as a future economic heavyweight, if its markets and middle class are in MNCs' and fund managers' radars, it all goes back to those key calls taken by a quiet man.Dr Singh's story is all the more riveting because not just his ascension to FM, but even to the country's top job were, as his former press adviser Sanjaya Baru had described, accidental.He wouldn't have been FM had Patel taken the job. He wouldn't have been PM had Sonia Gandhi not decided to rule herself out of the job after Congress+ beat BJP+ in a dramatic upset in 2004.The thing is he took to both jobs as if he were made for them. On May 19, 2004 evening, standing on the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan with Singh at her side, Sonia announced him as PM by saying, ""the country will be safe in Dr Manmohan Singh 's hands"".Her praise can be parsed in two ways. Safe for Gandhis because he would be loyal to the family, and safe for India because Singh's competence and professional creds were never in doubt. Plus, there were the political returns for Congress in picking a Singh PM - 1984's wounds and memories were still raw. Singh, despite his reforms record, was often thought as a political novice, especially against wily Congress netas who made a career out of Machiavellian durbar politics. Critics were wrong again. The 2008 nuclear deal with US, shepherded by him against not just BJP and CPM charges of selling the country down but also against disquiet inside Congress, was a masterclass in wiliness.Singh got CWC to twice endorse the nuclear deal, shrugged off Left walking out of UPA-1, and won a LS vote of confidence. 'Singh is King', headlines said.Singh is wise, was the verdict of many world leaders, notably Republican George Bush and his successor Democrat Barack Obama. Obama was particularly impressed. When G20 was born as the financial crisis upended a decade-long bull run everywhere, and various heads of govt spoke, Obama singled out Singh: ""When Dr Singh speaks, the world listens"", the then US president said. But as happens in rough electoral politics, even the wisest leaders are not always listened to. Coming into 2009 LS polls, the economy just about emerging from the taper tantrum and his political and economic stewardship under the scanner, Congress took a drubbing against Modi-led BJP. Singh, both before and after results, spoke of the dangers of 'majoritarianism'. A Partition refugee and a minority in Hindu-majority India, he probably had an acute personal attachment to secular politics. But it went beyond that. He was a political liberal by conviction. Singh's comments on Modi could be seen as typical loser's gripe. But there was more to it. He believed India couldn't afford majoritarian politics .","Singh got CWC to twice endorse the nuclear deal, shrugged off Left walking out of UPA-1, and won a LS vote of confidence.

MAGA vs Tech Titans: Decoding the immigration battle of US over Indian techies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/maga-vs-tech-titans-decoding-the-immigration-battle-of-us-over-indian-techies/articleshow/116656053.cms,"Tech Leaders vs. MAGA: The Debate Over H-1B Visa Reform and Skilled Immigration

Contextualizing the Debate

Players and Their Positions

Tech Leaders

MAGA Anti-Immigration Advocates

Threat to Domestic Employment? A Tech Founder’s Take on the H-1B Visa

America’s Immigration War: The Never-ending Debate

Shriram Krishnan, a Chennai-born engineer appointed as Senior Policy Advisor for AI at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, has sparked a heated debate by backing US immigration policies , including the removal of the country cap (not all caps) on green cards. This controversy highlights the growing rift within conservative circles, as MAGA anti-immigration advocates clash with tech industry figures like David Sacks over issues such as H-1B visas and green card reforms. At the heart of the debate lie competing visions of what best serves America’s economic and social interests: Prioritizing native-born workers or embracing skilled immigration to drive innovation.The H-1B visa program, a lifeline for the US tech industry to source top-tier global talent, has become a lightning rod in the immigration debate. Critics, rallying behind the ""America First"" banner, slam it as a job killer for American workers and a tool to suppress wages. Supporters, however, argue it’s the backbone of innovation, bridging skill gaps and driving economic growth.At the center of recent battles is the push to scrap country-specific caps on employment-based green cards—rules that give equal allocations to all nations, irrespective of demand. This outdated system forces skilled Indian professionals to endure backlogs stretching beyond a decade while applicants from less competitive nations sail through, highlighting glaring inequities in the system. The current system’s 7% cap per country on employment-based green cards disproportionately impacts Indian professionals. Despite comprising a significant share of H-1B holders, Indian applicants face lengthy backlogs due to high demand. Advocates for reform argue that removing these caps would:• Ensure fairer allocation based on merit.• Reduce the uncertainty that deters top global talent from committing to the US long-term.Critics counter that easing these restrictions could flood the labour market, suppress wages, and leave American workers at a disadvantage.Tech leaders advocate for eliminating country-specific green card caps to retain skilled workers and drive innovation, emphasizing global competitiveness and economic growth. In contrast, MAGA critics decry such reforms as undermining American workers, pushing for stricter immigration controls to prioritize native employment and resist globalist influences, reflecting deep ideological divides. The dispute finally boils down to conflicting priorities: Economic Innovation vs. Labour Protectionism and Meritocracy vs. Nationalism.Prominent figures like Sriram Krishnan, David Sacks, and Elon Musk are at the forefront of advocating for reforms such as eliminating country-specific caps on green cards, while maintaining the overall cap. They argue that this targeted reform is merit-based, designed to retain skilled workers essential to driving innovation in critical sectors like STEM and AI. Their position underscores the tech industry's dependence on a global talent pool and its push for a more efficient, equitable pathway to permanent residency for highly skilled professionals.By framing immigration as an economic necessity, tech leaders highlight the risks of losing top talent to competing nations with more welcoming policies. For them, reforming outdated systems is not just about fairness but about securing America’s leadership in emerging technologies and ensuring sustained economic growth.On the other side, critics like Laura Loomer vehemently oppose these reforms, branding them as a betrayal of the ""America First"" agenda. They argue that expanding opportunities for foreign workers undermines American graduates and creates unnecessary competition in a job market already under strain. This group advocates for stringent immigration controls, emphasizing self-reliance and prioritizing job opportunities for native-born Americans.For this faction, immigration policies that favor skilled foreign workers are viewed not as a boon for innovation but as a threat to domestic employment and wage stability. Their stance reflects a broader resistance to globalism and a desire to reassert national sovereignty in shaping economic policy.Apoorva Govind, Founder of BesteverAI, shared her thoughts on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting her personal experience with the H-1B visa system. She stated, “I’ve been on both sides of the H1B visa. For context, I graduated with a Masters degree from Carnegie Mellon, interned at Nvidia, worked at Apple, then at Uber & eventually started my own company.”Govind argued that the H-1B program is vital for filling gaps in the US tech industry. She pointed out that the public education system in the US is failing to produce enough homegrown talent in fields like computer science. As she explained, “H1Bs are filling a massive hole left in tech by the poor public education system in America. We just don’t have enough homegrown talent that is talented in CS & willing to move for their jobs.”She added that hiring H-1B workers is expensive and complex for employers, with high costs associated with legal processing, paperwork, and immigration procedures. Govind suggested that to improve the system, “we should remove lotteries, reject the Indian service agencies from gaming the system, and introduce a points system like the rest of the world. Set a high bar for what qualifies as skilled immigration.”Furthermore, she called for a deeper reflection on the failings of the US public education system, stating, “Maybe banning algebra in 6th grade wasn’t such a smart choice?”The battle over skilled immigration exposes a raw clash of priorities at the heart of America’s identity. Advocates argue that streamlining residency for top talent fuels innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, securing the nation’s global dominance in technology and STEM. Yet, fierce opposition from nationalist factions reveals a deeper unease: fears of globalization, cultural erosion, and widening inequality. These voices frame immigration reform as a betrayal of American workers, claiming it displaces native talent and depresses wages. The debate lays bare the fractures within conservative coalitions, pitting economic pragmatists championing progress and global competitiveness against populist nationalists rallying behind ""America First."" As the stakes rise, the fight underscores a pivotal question: Should America embrace the global race for innovation or retreat into protectionist policies at the cost of progress?","The H-1B visa program, a lifeline for the US tech industry to source top-tier global talent, has become a lightning rod in the immigration debate.

This shocking development unfolded at SBI colony at Nandyal district headquarters.According to the Nandyal police , the deceased were identified as Subba Rayudu and Saraswati.Their one and only son Sunil, who turned an autorickshaw driver after completing his B Tech, fell in love with a transgender identified as Smitha about three years ago.The parents who came to know about their son's relationship with a transgender warned him several times in the past and recently they tried to persuade him to get married with a girl of their choice.However, when Sunil bluntly turned down their proposal and made it categorical to his parents that he was in love with Smitha (TG) and that he shall marry her only, the parents even took him to the local police station for counselling. But once again Sunil made his intentions clear that he would continue to live with transgender Smitha only.The dejected parents who felt humiliated at the police station decided to end their lives and consumed pesticides at Nandyal outskirts about two days ago.Though they were immediately admitted to the govt general hospital at Nandyal, Subba Rayudu and Saraswati passed away whole undergoing treatment at the hospital on Wednesday.While the local police said no case was registered against anyone since no complaint was received, relatives and neighbours told the police that a group of transgenders close to Smitha were harassing Subba Rayudu and Saraswati in the pretext of a loan taken by their son Sunil and the couple ended their lives because of the harassment and humiliation allegedly meted our to them by the group of transgenders.","The deceased were identified as Subba Rayudu and Saraswati.

Not surprisingly, the schemes' credit was also taken by Gandhi and her team. The flagship schemes were backed by legislation, with RTI and NREGA being the first ones to be enacted in 2005.Singh's first term also saw the introduction of OBC quotas in education, a move pushed by then HRD minister Arjun Singh, which was resisted by several of his cabinet colleagues before they fell in line. The quota announcement, which set off protests, was followed by govt announcing an expansion in the number of seats in educational institutions. Towards the end of UPA's first term, Centre also announced a mega farm loan package, seen to be a key factor in enabling the coalition return to power in 2009. And, when it returned to office, it enacted RTE and followed it up with the land acquisition act, and Right to Food or the National Food Security Act . While the land law is seen to be a major stumbling block for industries, something that NDA sought to reverse in its first term but was forced to abandon the plans, NFSA was never fully implemented.","The concept for the initiatives didn't come from within govt, but from National Advisory Council, headed by Sonia Gandhi.

Licence Raj

It was June 1991. Manmohan Singh had just returned to Delhi, after attending a conference in the Netherlands, and had gone to bed. Late that night, Singh's son-in-law, Vijay Tankha, took a phone call. The voice on the other end was that of PC Alexander, a confidante of PV Narasimha Rao . Alexander urged Vijay to wake up his father-in-law.Singh and Alexander met a few hours later, and the official told Singh about Rao's plan to appoint him FM. Singh, then UGC chairman, and who had never been in politics, didn't take Alexander seriously.But Rao was serious. On June 21, Singh was in his UGC office. He was told to go home, get dressed and attend the swearing-in function. ""Everybody was surprised to see me as a member of the new team lined up to take the oath of office. My portfolio was allotted later, but I was told straight away by Narasimha Rao ji that I was going to be finance minister,"" Singh is quoted as saying in 'Strictly Personal, Manmohan & Gursharan', a book by his daughter Daman Singh.That appointment changed the course of India's economy. From an insular, control-heavy, low-growth economy it became what's today the world's fastest growing major economy.Along with Rao, Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress. The economy was in tatters, forex reserves had dropped to Rs 2,500 crore, barely sufficient to cover 2 weeks of imports, global banks were refusing to offer loans, forex outflows were large, inflation was soaring.But Singh knew the problems beforehand, and also the solutions, which he outlined in his budget speech a month later. The ball was set rolling within days of moving into North Block. He worked closely with then RBI deputy governor C Rangarajan to devalue the rupee and removed export controls in partnership with P Chidambaram, then the commerce minister.July 24, the day Singh presented his first budget, saw the Indian economy saying good riddance to the licence-permit raj. Hours before the budget, the Rao govt tabled the new industrial policy in Parliament, working on a paper that Singh remembered having seen during his brief stint as economic adviser to Chandra Sekhar, who led a fragile coalition in 1990-91.Based on the document prepared by economic adviser Rakesh Mohan, industrial delicensing was undertaken in all but 18 sectors, and foreign direct investment was allowed in 34 industries. Besides, public sector monopoly in several sectors came to an end and disinvestment of govt shareholding in state-run companies was permitted.His budget freed up fund-raising by Indian companies by setting up Sebi and also announced a new committee under RBI governor M Narasimhan to work out the new architecture for the financial sector, which was implemented by the Rao govt and its successors. The budget focused on fiscal consolidation, by cutting down on wasteful spending.Singh had also drawn attention to the precarious price situation in his 1991 budget speech.""The price situation, which is of immediate concern to the vast mass of our people, poses a serious problem as inflation has reached a double digit level. During the fiscal year ending 31st March 1991 the wholesale price index registered an increase of 12.1%, while the consumer price index registered an increase of 13.6%. The major worrisome feature of the inflation in 1990-91 was that it was concentrated in essential commodities,"" Singh had said.Those reforms had put the economy back on track and triggered optimism globally. The ""Bombay Club"", a group of corporate chiefs who wanted protection from foreign competition, was not happy. But they got it wrong.","Manmohan Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress.

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister and Congress stalwart Dr. Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday at the age of 92. Singh breathed his last at AIIMS Delhi, where he was admitted on Thursday evening.Singh was sworn in as Prime Minister on May 22 after the 2004 general elections and took the oath of office for a second term on May 22, 2009.He was born on September 26, 1932, in a village in the Punjab province of undivided India. He completed his matriculation examinations from the Punjab University in 1948.The Union government declared a seven day-day national mourning of former prime minister .In his long political career, Singh was a member of the Rajya Sabha since 1991, where he was Leader of the Opposition between 1998 and 2004. He retired from the Rajya Sabha in April 2024.Singh represented India at many international conferences and in several international organizations. He led Indian Delegations to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Cyprus (1993) and to the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993.One of the key decisions Manmohan Singh took as PM included the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) (2005), a flagship program that guaranteed 100 days of wage employment per year to rural households.His government also launched the Right to Information Act in 2005 to strengthen transparency and accountability in governance by granting citizens the right to access information held by public authorities. In 2013, his government launched the National Food Security Act to ensure subsidized food grains to approximately two-thirds of India’s population.Singh's academic career took him from Punjab to the University of Cambridge, UK, where he earned a First Class Honours degree in Economics in 1957. Later, he followed this with a D. Phil in Economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.His book, ""India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth"" [Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1964] was an early critique of India’s inward-oriented trade policy.Dr. Singh’s academic credentials were burnished by his years on the faculty of Punjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of Economics.In 1971, Singh joined the government of India as an economic advisor in the commerce ministry. This was soon followed by his appointment as Chief Economic Advisor in the ministry of finance in 1972.Among the many governmental positions that Dr. Singh occupied were secretary in the ministry of finance, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), advisor of the Prime Minister; and chairman of the University Grants Commission.He had a brief stint at the UNCTAD Secretariat as well, during these years. This presaged a subsequent appointment as Secretary General of the South Commission in Geneva between 1987 and 1990.In what became the turning point in the economic history of independent India, Singh spent five years between 1991 and 1996 as India's finance minister under the Narasimha Rao government. His role in ushering in a comprehensive policy of economic reforms is now recognised worldwide. In the popular view of those years in India, that period is inextricably associated with the persona of Singh.Among the many awards and honours conferred upon Singh in his public career, the most prominent are India's second highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan in 1987.","Singh was born on September 26, 1932, in a village in the Punjab province of undivided India.

NEW DELHI: Three years ago, on January 19, 2022, a Gujarati family - 39-year-old Jagdish Patel, wife Vaishali (35), daughter (11) and son (3) - froze to death on the US-Canada border in Manitoba while trying to illegally cross over to the US. The traffickers had left the family in the middle of a snowstorm at -37 degrees Celsius.Three years later, a money laundering probe by the ED against the agents involved in the Patel family case has found an international syndicate of human traffickers that includes at least 260 colleges in Canada that issued student visas to ""illegal migrants"" to take the Canadian route to the US.Those who found the student visa route more convenient, compared to the 'donkey route', paid around Rs 50-60 lakh each to the agents to arrange their student visa and travel to Canada before being ""pushed"" into the US. The probe is still under progress on the transactions of the Canadian colleges and how much money they made from such ""illegal migrants"".""Investigations reveal that to send Indians to the US illegally, the agents arranged their admission in colleges/universities in Canada and sent them on student visas. Once in Canada, instead of joining the college, they illegally crossed the US-Canada border,"" ED said.On December 10 and 19, ED carried out searches at eight premises across Mumbai, Nagpur, Gandhinagar and Vadodara on several agents who were involved in sending illegal migrants through these Canadian colleges.""During searches, it was found that around 35,000 illegal migrants are sent abroad every year by just two agents, based in Mumbai and Nagpur,"" ED said on Wednesday. The probe also found that around 1,700 agents/partners in Gujarat and around 3,500 across India were involved in this racket. ED estimates that more than 800 agents are still active despite a multi-agency crackdown on them.The agency said its probe found that at least two such agents based in Mumbai and Nagpur have signed agreements with several universities and colleges abroad for admission of students on commission basis. All potential illegal migrants are then prepared with required documentation for a student visa.During the searches, ED seized Rs 19 lakh in bank accounts of the accused besides seizure of documents and digital devices.

'I feel I have done reasonably well': Top quotes of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-feel-i-have-done-reasonably-well-top-quotes-of-former-prime-minister-manmohan-singh/articleshow/116690190.cms,"Here's are some top quotes of India’s fourteenth Prime Minister:

""I would be the last person to say there is no scope of doing more"" Singh said at a press conference at the National Media Centre, New Delhi on January 3, 2014.

""I have never felt like resigning at any time. I have enjoyed doing my work. I have tried to do my work with all honesty, with all sense of integrity, without regard, or fear or favour,"" Singh said at a press conference on January 3, 2014.

""I do not believe that I have been a weak Prime Minister. That is for historians to judge. The BJP and its associates may say whatever they like. But if by “strong Prime Minister”, you mean that you preside over a mass massacre of innocent citizens on the streets of Ahmedabad, that is the measure of strength, I do not believe that sort of strength this country needs, least of all, in its Prime Minister,"" he had said at the same press conference when he was asked ""The BJP and Mr Modi’s charge against you is that you have been a weak PM. Does the party have a role,"" he said in a conference.

""It is for you to judge. As far as I am concerned, I feel I have done reasonably well. The growth process that we sustained in the last ten years despite the global financial crisis, despite the Euro-zone crisis, and considering also what is happening in other emerging countries like Brazil, like South Africa, like Indonesia, I don’t think ours is a story which can be described as non-successful or eventful,"" said Singh when he was asked to rate his tenure on a scale of ten at a press conference on Jan 3, 2014.

""Let me say at the outset that I do believe we are set for better times. The cycle of global economic growth is turning for the better,"" he had said during opening remarks at a press conference.

""Well, if I can succeed in normalising relations between India and Pakistan as they should prevail between two normal states, I will consider my job well done,"" he said while he was returning from a two-nation tour of China and Kazkhstan in 2011.

""I would be the first person to admit that we could have done more. We should not be satisfied with what we have achieved. There is always room for improvement and for better outcomes. But I do believe that the record of our first year is a record of reasonable achievement,"" he said.

""I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the Opposition parties in Parliament,"" he said in a press conference.

""India is a hospitable environment for FDI and will continue to do so. We will continue to improve our practices wherever they are needed,"" he said in a press conference in Jan 2014.

""It is often said that time is a great healer. But unfortunately, in the case of demonetisation, the scars and wounds of demonetisation are only getting more visible with time,"" he said on demonetisation in 2018.

“More than any other period of human history, the need for unity of thought and action today is the most urgent,” he said during an event by Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) in 2019.

""When the world is breaking up into fragments, and fragments clash with fragments, surrendering all sense and purpose of living for the larger humanity, it is the humanity which seeks transcendence from narrow limits and boundaries,"" he said during an event by Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) in 2019.

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday night at the age of 92 due to age-related medical conditions. He was admitted to AIIMS Delhi after his health deteriorated.The veteran Congress leader was brought to the emergency department of the hospital.""With profound grief, we inform the demise of former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, aged 92. He was being treated for age-related medical conditions and had sudden loss of consciousness at home on 26th December 2024. Resuscitative measures were started immediately at home.

He was born on September 26, 1932, in a Punjab province village in undivided India. He completed his Matriculation from Punjab University in 1948. His studies led him to the University of Cambridge, UK, where he obtained a First Class Honours in Economics in 1957. He subsequently earned his D Phil in Economics from Oxford University's Nuffield College in 1962. His publication, ""India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth"" [Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1964] provided an early analysis of India's inward-focused trade policies.His government service began in 1971 as economic advisor in the commerce ministry, followed by his appointment as chief economic advisor in the finance ministry in 1972. His distinguished career included positions as finance ministry secretary, planning commission deputy chairman, Reserve Bank of India governor, Prime Minister's advisor, and University Grants Commission chairman.A significant period in independent India's economic history occurred during 1991-1996 when Dr Singh served as finance minister. His contribution to implementing comprehensive economic reforms received global recognition.In his political journey, Dr Singh has represented India's Upper House of Parliament (the Rajya Sabha) since 1991, serving as leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004. He assumed office as Prime Minister on May 22 following the 2004 general elections and began his second term on May 22, 2009.",Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday night at the age of 92 due to age-related medical conditions.

Over the last several decades he tirelessly worked in the service of India and the well being of her people.His economic reforms have been the launching pad for the Indian economy 's sustained high growth over last three decades in spite of the global upheavals.I was fortunate to have him as my mentor over the three decades of my professional life in public service. He has been a model to each and every economist working with Indian govt and he was always available to us all to offer his sagacious advice and guidance. He gave special emphasis on maintaining high moral and personal integrity.On a personal level, he gave a great deal of love and affection to my wife Lata and our daughter Sujata whenever we called on him whether at 7 RCR or his residence at Motilal Nehru Marg .Today, we feel orphaned. For us, there will be never anyone like him again. I join all in praying for eternal peace to the departed soul.I recall when I called him after being appointed 13th Finance Commission chairman. He said Finance Commission should be mindful of handling India's emerging ecological challenges as states have to face consequences of environmental degradation.I also met him as LoP, when I was working with Jaswant Singh in defence ministry. Dr Singh was supportive of our tax reforms and particularly encouraged me to pursue GST reforms. He was convinced that our indirect tax regime is anti-exports and this bias will be cured by GST-like policies.Dr Singh was finance minister when I was petroleum secretary and Captain Satish Sharma was the minister and it was Manmohan Singh who gave full sport for liberalising the petroleum sector.

"Manmohan Singh: Gentle, but ready to take risks on vital national issues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-gentle-but-ready-to-take-risks-on-vital-national-issues/articleshow/116696462.cms,"The last time I met Dr Manmohan Singh at his residence some days ago, he was frail but as always, his gracious self, thanking me for keeping him briefed on what was happening around the world. He was a good listener, raising sharp questions and offering well-considered comments. Since the end of his 10-year tenure as PM in 2014, I used to call on him at regular intervals and engaged him in lively conversations on the latest developments across the world. Even as he grew weak and beset with ailments, his mind was alert and nimble. It was as if my role as foreign secretary, and later as his special envoy in the PMO, had continued without interruption. He would always offer his own perspectives and share unexpected reminiscences about his encounters with the various movers and shakers in the world. He had a mischievous sense of humour accompanied by a gentle twinkle of the eyes. I will miss these memorable moments.Dr Singh was an under-rated PM, whose gentle manners and old-world courtesy obscured a keen intellect, strategic wisdom and a willingness to take risks if a matter of vital national interest was involved. This was evident when he pioneered the path-breaking economic reforms in 1990 as finance minister under PM Narasimha Rao. I was joint secretary in the PMO then, looking after external affairs and had a ring-side view of the pulls and pressures he was subjected to in pushing through the new economic policies. Much later in one of our conversations, he said that those days he carried a letter of resignation in his pocket since he never knew if and when a reversal may come. The same willingness to take a risk and be willing to sacrifice office was evident in the tenacity with which he pursued the India-US nuclear deal between 2005-08 even when his own party was ready to call it quits.As PM, Dr Singh deliberately sought opinions from a wide range of sources. He would emphasise the need to build a consensus around policies but would pick and choose what was important enough to take a stand on and where it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie. In retrospect, I think the choices he made were sound and judicious even though I may have found it frustrating at times. After the Mumbai attack in 2008, there was pressure on him to approve swift retaliation against Pakistan. He did consider it, but after meeting with chiefs of Armed forces, he decided against it and I think in retrospect rightly so.There would be occasions when he wouldn't follow my advice and I would be expected to deliver on whatever policy had been adopted. But never once did I feel that I would in any way suffer if I expressed a viewpoint that I knew he disagreed with. Once on a climate change-related issue I was inclined to take a strong position while he felt that India should be seen as ""part of the solution rather than as part of the problem."" I was somewhat obstinate in holding the view that it was the advanced countries that refused to be part of the solution and not India. Later, I felt that I had perhaps been out of line in expressing my disagreement. The next day, I apologised for my behaviour and said it was wrong of me to insist on a contrary position. Dr Singh smiled and reassured me, saying that if I started playing his own words back to him, there would not be much value in having me as an adviser. He was self-assured enough to handle opinions divergent to his own with grace and equanimity.During my eight years of serving under him, I was witness to the respect with which he was held by his foreign counterparts. His assessment of global economy was always sought at bilateral and multilateral summits. I can say from personal experience that President George Bush had developed a relationship of trust and affection with Dr Singh. At critical moments in the negotiation of Indo-US nuclear deal, it was Dr Singh's personal intervention with President Bush that helped clear the logjam. India gained international stature during his term as PM and his own reputation as a statesman and a wise-thinker was part of it.He said that history would judge him kindly. I think India was fortunate to have his gentle but firm hand at the wheel when it needed it most. Power exercised with empathy and a touch of grace achieves much more than a display of muscularity does. He did India proud.(Author is ex-foreign secretary and ex-special envoy of PM Manmohan Singh for Nuclear Affairs and Climate Change)","Dr Singh was an under-rated PM, whose gentle manners and old-world courtesy obscured a keen intellect, strategic wisdom and a willingness to take risks.

AGRA: Three months ago, five people - the owner of a residential school in Hathras, his son who was its manager, and three teachers - were arrested for the murder of Kritarth Kushwaha , an 11-year-old Class 2 student. The details were macabre enough to ignite outrage: they killed the boy in ritualistic sacrifice ""to bring glory to the school"". The manager then carried the body in a car and drove from Hathras to Aligarh, and then to Agra, to erase their tracks.Now, in a sensational twist, the police chargesheet has absolved the five of murder, reducing their culpability to ""tampering with evidence"". The real culprit, police say, is a 13-year-old Class 8 student from the same school. Disillusioned with life at DL Public School , the boy allegedly sought to bring the institution to its knees by orchestrating its closure. Murdering a student, he believed, would do the job. Before Kritarth, he had tried twice but failed, cops claim.But what made police change track after the five arrested persons had allegedly ""confessed""? Hathras ASP Ashok Kumar, who led the probe, told TOI, ""It was based on preliminary evidence collected at the crime scene that we arrested the five individuals.""At first glance, the case was indeed clear-cut. The accused had, after all, travelled long distances in his car with the dead child's body in the boot of his vehicle. Kumar said, ""Our probe was still on and weeks of interviews with other teachers, students and domestic staff uncovered inconsistencies that challenged the narrative. Through follow-ups, new evidence emerged that led us to the teenager.""The boy was quietly whisked into custody on Dec 16 and sent to a juvenile home. In July, he had attempted to strangle two other students but the school brushed aside these incidents as ""minor acts of misbehaviour"". On Sept 22, his obsession took a darker shape.

PM asks officials to find ways apartment dwellers in cities can get benefit of rooftop solar scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/help-urban-flat-owners-avail-solar-scheme/articleshow/116694662.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pointing out that urban middle class families living in apartments are not getting the benefits of Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojna , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asked officials to find ways out so that they can avail the scheme and cut down their electricity bills.The PM was chairing the web-based PRAGATI meeting with all secretaries in the central govt and chief secretaries from states. At present, people living in apartments can’t avail the scheme under which Centre provides subsidy of up to 40% of the cost of installing solar panels on rooftop as each individual beneficiary needs around 300 sq ft contiguous roof for generation of 300 units per month.Sources said Modi told officials that there is a need to find a solution to this problem for achieving saturation of the ambitious scheme. They added that when officials suggested that the builders may get land for installation of the solar system, the PM said this was not practical in urban areas.In an official release, the PMO said that Modi directed officials to enhance the capacity of installations of rooftops in the states and UTs by developing a quality vendor ecosystem. “He directed reducing the time required in the process, starting from demand generation to operationalisation of rooftop solar. He further directed states to adopt a saturation approach for villages, towns and cities in a phased manner,” the release said.PM also reviewed six Metro rail and two road connectivity and thermal power projects having a combined cost of more than Rs 1 lakh crore. Flagging concern over the delay in execution of projects, PM said these reflect how these lack proper planning, an official said.Officials said the PM raised concern over slow progress of Metro rail projects while pointing out that the authorities are well aware about the ground realities across urban areas when they plan and prepare projects. He advised officials to conduct ‘experience sharing’ workshops for cities where projects are under implementation or are in the pipeline, to capture the best practices and learnings.Reviewing the public grievances related to the banking and insurance sector, Modi asked the officials to focus on the quality of disposal of grievances. The financial services department said that 98% of the grievances had been resolved.",The PM was chairing the web-based PRAGATI meeting with all secretaries in the central govt and chief secretaries from states.

He said his statements were misrepresented and were aimed to sow discord and political unrest.A senior party functionary said, ""The Ambedkar issue was integral to the discussion. It came up that Congress MPs did not react when Shah, in his speech in RS, made the remark. But later, Congress representative held a meeting where Rahul Gandhi was present and they decided to make the remark an issue to be highlighted.

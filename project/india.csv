Cyclone Ditwah Approaches India: Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh Brace For Impact

External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday announced that a C-130J aircraft carrying around 12 tonnes of humanitarian aid has landed in Colombo. The delivery is part of India’s Operation Sagar Bandhu, launched on Friday to assist Sri Lanka in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, which has so far claimed 80 lives.Sharing the update on X, Jaishankar wrote, “#OperationSagarBandhu unfolds. @IAF_MCC C-130J plane carrying approximately 12 tons of humanitarian aid, including tents, tarpaulins, blankets, hygiene kits, and ready-to-eat food items, lands in Colombo.”India initiated Operation Sagar Bandhu as part of its immediate response to assist cyclone-affected areas. The first relief consignments were transported by the Indian Navy’s aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and frontline warship INS Udaigiri, which arrived in Colombo on Friday and handed over supplies to Sri Lankan authorities.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, conveyed his condolences to the people of Sri Lanka, expressing grief over the lives lost in the cyclone and extending solidarity with India’s “closest maritime neighbour.” He noted that India had swiftly dispatched relief supplies and critical Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) equipment under the operation.“We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” said PM Modi, adding that the support was guided by India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR.This comes as India bids to offer help Sri Lanka has been reeling from floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah. The island nation is facing one of its most severe disasters in recent years, with widespread damage to infrastructure and rising casualties. According to PTI, more than 80 people have died as the storm unleashed heavy rains across multiple provinces.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) separately reported 61 deaths and 25 people missing, while nearly 44,000 individuals from over 12,000 families have been affected since adverse weather began on November 16.The crisis intensified as Sri Lanka’s Western Province faced warnings of an “unprecedented disaster situation” owing to rising water levels in the Kelani and Attanagalu rivers. Several districts in the Northern, North-Central, Central, North-Western, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces are expected to receive over 200 mm of rain, according to the Sri Lankan Meteorological Department.

10 things to know about the Airbus A320 recall



Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 A320-family aircraft, a move that is expected to affect more than half of the global fleet. This large-scale recall may cause widespread disruption, especially in the United States, where it coincides with one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.

Airbus has revealed that a recent incident involving one of its A320-family aircraft has uncovered a potential risk linked to ""intense solar radiation"", which may corrupt data essential for the aircraft's flight-control systems. Following this finding, the company identified a significant number of A320 aircraft currently in service that could be affected by the issue.

Air India has acknowledged the directive, saying it is “aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in service across airline operators,” and noted that the requirement will involve a “software/hardware realignment” on part of its fleet. The airline has warned that ""longer turnaround times and delays"" are likely during the update process.

Air India recently completed a major retrofit programme for its older A320neo fleet. With 27 refurbished aircraft, 14 newly delivered A320neos, and additional planes added after the Vistara merger, the airline now operates around 104 A320-family aircraft with new or upgraded interiors.

IndiGo has also confirmed compliance with the directive, emphasising that “safety comes first” and stating that it is carrying out the updates “with full diligence and care.” The airline has indicated that some flights may see schedule changes while the work is underway.

Most of IndiGo’s A320 fleet consists of newer variants, with older models now in single digits. With over 350 A320-family planes, the airline is expected to complete updates on nearly 250 aircraft by Monday or Tuesday, according to sources. Air India, with about 120–125 A320s, is expected to finish updates on more than 100 aircraft in a similar timeframe.

Industry observers say this may be one of the largest recalls Airbus has faced in its 55-year history, as Reuters reported. The timing is notable, coming just weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered aircraft model in the world.

The repair itself is expected to be relatively simple and mainly involves reverting to a previous software version. Even so, airlines must complete the process before the planes can return to passenger service, except for repositioning flights to repair centres.

Airlines across North America, South America, Europe, India, and New Zealand have warned that the required repairs could lead to delays or cancellations. American Airlines, the largest A320 operator globally, expects to update around 340 of its 480 A320s, with each fix likely taking about two hours.

Other major airlines—such as Lufthansa, IndiGo, and easyJet—are also planning brief groundings for the updates. In South America, Avianca has said more than 70% of its fleet is affected, leading the carrier to temporarily shut ticket sales until December 8 for certain travel dates.

The recall comes at a challenging time for the aviation industry, which is already dealing with heavy workloads at repair shops, long delays for separate engine-related inspections, and labour shortages. These factors are expected to slow down the completion of repairs and add further pressure to global flight operations.

JetBlue incident leads to probe



NEW DELHI: Air travel in India and around the world is expected to face major disruptions after Europe-based Airbus issued a technical directive ordering a software upgrade for its A320 family aircraft. In India, more than 350 IndiGo and Air India A320 planes will remain grounded for the next two to three days while the update is carried out, with normal operations expected to resume by Monday or Tuesday.Globally, around 6,000 aircraft from A320 fleet are likely to be impacted. The grounding is significant because Airbus and its main rival Boeing together control over three-quarters of the world's commercial aircraft fleet, meaning any large-scale recall has an immediate and widespread impact on global air traffic.The technical directive reportedly came shortly after an incident involving a JetBlue A320 aircraft, which led to discussions among safety regulators and eventually contributed to a deeper review of the fleet’s software configuration. While details are still emerging, the episode is believed to have triggered closer scrutiny and may have played a role in Airbus deciding to issue a global advisory and recall order for immediate corrective action.","Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 A320-family aircraft.

Parliamentary panel studying ONOE bill to seek extension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliamentary-panel-studying-onoe-bill-to-seek-extension/articleshow/125649577.cms,"NEW DELHI: The parliamentary committee scrutinising the constitutional amendment bill that proposes simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections will seek an extension in its tenure from Parliament as it needs more time to gather views of different stakeholders, including national and regional political parties, the panel’s chairperson P P Chaudhary said on Friday.Its current tenure is till the first day of the last week of the coming Winter Session, which is scheduled between Dec 1 and Dec 19.“The committee needs more time,” Chaudhary told TOI, while emphasising that opinions of various constitutional experts make it clear that the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, commonly known as one-nation-one-election (ONOE) bill, is not violative of the Constitution’s basic structure, a key argument of opposition parties against the proposed law.NDA govt’s vigorous push for simultaneous polls has also received full-throttle endorsement from Law Commission. The “refreshing concept of synchronising of elections” is in larger national interest and is “squarely within the periphery of amending powers of the Parliament,” it has said, according to sources.In its written opinion to the committee, Law Commission is learnt to have said, “Far from undermining democracy, the proposed bill aims to strengthen it by ensuring stability, reducing the constant drain of elections, and allowing govts to focus on governance.”Its representatives along with those from Election Commission of India are scheduled to appear before the Chaudhary-led committee on Dec 4. It has rejected the arguments of opposition parties and some experts that the bill violates the Constitution’s basic structure and federal character.It has also backed some of the more contentious provisions of the bill, especially related to the sweeping powers given to EC under its Article 82A(5) to defer an assembly poll if the poll body thinks that it cannot be conducted simultaneously with that of Lok Sabha.Besides other experts, some former CJIs too, in their comments to the committee, have questioned the “unfettered” powers delegated to EC in the bill and suggested corrective measures, including the need for parliamentary nod in such cases.Law Commission, in its opinion, has equated EC with judiciary, executive and legislature when it comes to upholding democracy, asserting that Article 324 of the Constitution bestows on it extensive and broad powers and protects it from any external influence.","The committee's current tenure is till the first day of the last week of the coming Winter Session, which is scheduled between Dec 1 and Dec 19.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday sealed a Rs 7,995 crore deal with the US as part of a “follow-on support” package for the Navy’s fleet of 24 Seahawk helicopters for five years.The signing of the contract comes amid a strain in ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Indian goods in late Aug.The defence ministry said it signed Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs) with the US for sustainment support of the MH60R helicopter fleet . Manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation, it is an all-weather helicopter designed to support multiple missions with state of the art avionics and sensors. The LOAs were inked under the foreign military sales programme of the US.India had signed an agreement with the US for procurement of 24-MH 60Rs in Feb 2020. The MH 60R Seahawk is a maritime variant of the Blackhawk helicopter.The sustainment support is a comprehensive package that includes provisioning of spares, support equipment, product support, training and technical support, and repair and replenishment of components, according to the defence ministry.It also provides for setting up of intermediate level component repairs and periodic maintenance inspection facilities in India for the choppers. “In-country development of these facilities will ensure capability build-up in the long run and reduced dependence on the US govt, thus aligning with the vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’,” the ministry said. “This would further lead to indigenous product and services development through MSMEs & other Indian firms,” it said in a statement.","India on Friday sealed a Rs 7,995 crore deal with the US as part of a ‘follow-on support’ package for the Navy’s fleet of 24 Seahawk helicopters for five years.

NEW DELHI: Terming dowry as the worst social evil, Supreme Court said on Friday that courts should not show any leniency in granting bail in dowry death cases as it would not only erode public confidence in the justice delivery system but also embolden the perpetrators.It quashed the Allahabad high court order granting bail to a man accused of killing his wife within four months of their marriage after his demand for a Fortuner car was not fulfilled.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan held that HC wrongly applied the principle of 'bail is rule and jail is the exception' without considering the severity of the offence allegedly committed by the man.""This court is constrained to observe that judicial passivity or misplaced leniency in the face of such atrocities would only embolden perpetrators and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. A firm and deterrent judicial response is, therefore, imperative - not only to uphold the majesty of law and do justice in the present case, but also to send an unequivocal message that neither law nor society will countenance barbarities born out of the evil of dowry,"" the bench said.It said permitting alleged prime perpetrators of such heinous crimes to remain at liberty on bail, when evidence indicates active infliction of physical as well as mental cruelty, may not only jeopardise fairness of the trial but also erode public faith in the administration of criminal justice.The bench said it cannot lose sight of the fact that marriage, in its true essence, is a sacred and noble institution founded on mutual trust, companionship and respect, but this pious bond has regrettably been reduced to a mere commercial transaction. ""The evil of dowry, though often sought to be camouflaged as gifts or voluntary offerings, has in reality become a means to display social status and to satiate material greed,"" it said.""The social evil of dowry not only corrodes the sanctity of marriage, but also perpetuates systemic oppression and subjugation of women. When such demands transgress the bounds of reason and culminate in cruelty - or worse, in the untimely death of a young bride - the offence transcends the private sphere of the family and assumes the character of a grave social crime. It ceases to remain a mere personal tragedy and becomes an affront to the collective conscience of society,"" it said.""The phenomenon of dowry deaths represents one of the most abhorrent manifestations of this social malaise, where the life of a young woman is extinguished within her matrimonial home - not for any fault of her own, but solely to satisfy the insatiable greed of others. Such heinous offences strike at the very root of human dignity and violate the constitutional guarantees of equality and life with dignity under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. They corrode the moral fibre of the community, normalise violence against women, and erode the foundations of a civilised society,"" it said.",Supreme Court quashes Allahabad high court order granting bail to a man accused of killing his wife within four months of their marriage.

When I was young, my aunt often took me to the discourses of Krubananda Variyaar. I remember sitting in crowded halls, listening to him unwrap profound truths with humour.In one, he told the story of a saint who lived on food grown in his garden, cooked his own meals and wanted for nothing. The king, his disciple, kept inviting him to the palace. One day, the saint agreed. A lavish dinner was served, and finally, payasam arrived in a golden cup studded with diamonds.The next day, the palace found the cup missing. The minister went to the saint’s ashram to ask about it, but before he could speak, the saint confessed. “I was going to return it today,” he said. “I kept wondering how such a desire entered my mind. Perhaps when I ate palace food, the thoughts and desires of everyone there seeped into me. Desire made me steal.” Variyaar Swami paused and concluded, “You are what you eat.”Only years later did I fully understand it.Our gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that form a richness as biodiverse as the Amazon rainforest. Good bacteria digest food, produce hormones, control blood sugar and influence our moods. A doctor once told me that 90% of cells are bacterial; only 10% are human. In many ways, we are more microbe than man.No wonder the gut is called the second brain.Thiruvalluvar’s chapter on ‘Medicine’ throws us into a sea of surprise. It does not speak of any branch of practices or procedures. Six out of 10 couplets in this chapter talk about gut health and the need for moderation in eating . Among them,Izhivarindhu UnbaanKann InbanPol NirkkumKazhiperu IrayaanKann Noai.As pleasure dwells with a moderate eater,So is disease with a voracious glutton.He was perhaps aware that gut health is the key to all health.Ilya Mechnikov, the Russian scientist of the early 1900s, accidentally opened the world’s eyes to gut microbes. To prove the body houses vast bacterial populations, he drank a broth of bacteria. He remained fine; his student too. But a third colleague nearly died. That was when Mechnikov realised each person carries a unique microbial world. What nourishes one may endanger another. Balance is the key.Mechnikov would have turned in his grave had he known about the invention of antibiotics. He would have been distressed to see antibiotics destroying good bacteria along with the harmful ones.Indian medical systems, interestingly, did not see microbes as enemies or as causes of illness. They focused on balancing vand. Here again, balance is the key.Modern research now says the gut operates almost independently. The digestive tract contains more than 100 million neurons. Serotonin, our natural antidepressant, is mainly produced in the gut. And that is why we sayOur emotional signals often start in the gut long before they reach the mind.When this delicate system is disrupted through overeating, irregular meals, or processed foods, the results are immediate. Public health experts call obesity the silent second pandemic. Late-night biryani shops, round-the-clock food delivery, and eating at all hours have become routine. And through it all, our gut silently loses its balance.Thiruvalluvar’s rule remains the best remedy: eat what you can digest, and what truly agrees with your system.Science affirms it.Experience repeats it.And our own gut whispers it, quietly, persistently reminding us that well-being beginswith what we choose to place inside.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

BENGALURU: With the leadership tussle in Karnataka seeing dramatic twists and turns by the hour, chief minister Siddaramaiah - following a nudge from the Congress high command - on Friday invited his deputy, DK Shivakumar , to a breakfast meeting on Saturday.Siddaramaiah said the high command had spoken to both netas and directed them to meet.""I've invited Shivakumar for breakfast at 9am. If he comes, I'll discuss (the issue) with him,"" he said, adding he would obey the high command.A senior party functionary in Delhi said both politicians had been asked to resolve the issue through discussions. ""If they don't, then the high command will intervene,"" he said.Another state functionary said the party wanted the two to present ""a mutually agreed solution"" to the high command, which it would endorse if both were on board.A day after posting a cryptic message on social media, Shivakumar Friday fired a new salvo - that of sacrifice, after promise - by invoking Sonia Gandhi's decision to forgo the prime ministership while recommending Manhoman Singh's name in 2004.Even as he lauded Sonia's leadership, Shivakumar took the opportunity to reach out to voters, urging them to continue backing the Siddaramaiah-led Congress govt. He appealed for public support in the 2028 assembly elections, describing stability as crucial for the party's long-term plans.While the remarks were framed as praise for Sonia, they triggered a debate within political circles over the message Shivakumar intended to convey. The comments sparked speculation whether he was subtly signalling that Siddaramaiah should make way (sacrifice) for him, or whether he was projecting himself as someone willing to ""sacrifice"" his chief ministerial claim.Former CM and Union minister M Veerappa Moily criticised the power tussle, calling the situation ""practically an anarchy"". In an interaction with a news agency, Moily said the open confrontation had caused ""national embarrassment"" and blamed Congress high command for ""allowing the situation to worsen"". He warned that the party, already weak in many states, could struggle to stay in govt in the state if the ""manufactured crisis"" was not addressed.Meanwhile, a day after Adichunchanagiri Mutt's Nirmalananda Swami visited Shivakumar, another prominent Vokkaliga seer, Brahmeshwara Mutt pontiff Gurugunda Nanjavadutha Swami, called on him and publicly backed him for the CM's post."," DK Shivakumar invoked Sonia Gandhi's decision to forgo the prime ministership while recommending Manhoman Singh's name in 2004.

How the leak allegedly unfolded

Tracing the UKSSSC paper leak : What happened when

The exam was conducted on 21 September 2025, and screenshots of three pages began circulating almost immediately, raising alarm among candidates.



Within two days, Khalid Shahzad and his sister Sabiha were arrested for allegedly forwarding the leaked paper.



Investigation and digital evidence traced the leak to Assistant Professor Chauhan, who was formally named in the FIR along with Khalid and his sisters. Authorities noted this was a coordinated act, not an isolated incident.



The leak sparked widespread public outrage, with aspirants and youth groups protesting and demanding accountability from both the accused and exam officials.



Responding to public pressure, the CBI officially took over the case at the end of October 2025.



The UKSSSC cancelled the exam and scheduled a re-test within three months for the 416 affected vacancies.



On 28 November 2025, Chauhan was arrested, marking a major breakthrough in the investigation, which could expand further to uncover the full network behind the leak.

The investigation into the Uttarakhand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC) graduate-level recruitment exam has taken a major turn with the arrest of Assistant Professor Suman Chauhan by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), according to an official announcement made by the agency.Chauhan, posted at a government college in Tehri Garhwal, is accused of receiving portions of the exam paper during the test, solving the questions, and transmitting the answers back to a candidate through intermediaries. The CBI described the arrest as an important step in uncovering the broader network behind the paper leak.The leak first came to light after images of three pages of the exam began circulating online, triggering widespread outrage among candidates. The exam, held on 21 September 2025, was conducted for graduate-level posts, including Patwari, Lekhpal, and other administrative positions, with over 1.05 lakh candidates appearing for it.According to the FIR and investigation findings reported by TNN, candidate Mohd Khalid Shahzad allegedly photographed the question paper inside the Haridwar exam centre and sent the images to his sisters, Sabiha and Hina, who then forwarded them to Chauhan.Chauhan is accused of solving the questions in real time and sending the answers back to Khalid. The four named individuals are facing charges under provisions related to unfair means in recruitment examinations.Investigators have described the leak as a coordinated effort rather than a spontaneous lapse, highlighting vulnerabilities in exam administration and monitoring. Following the incident, the UKSSSC cancelled the September 21 exam and announced a re-examination within three months to fill the 416 affected vacancies.Here is what has happened so far in the UKSSSC paper leak case:The Uttarakhand government appointed a one-member inquiry commission headed by Justice (Retd.) UC Dhyani, which submitted an interim report to the Chief Minister. The CBI continues its investigation, indicating that further arrests may follow as the agency maps the complete network behind the leak.The case has reignited calls for stricter monitoring, transparency, and stronger safeguards in recruitment examinations. Experts and aspirants have highlighted that the involvement of a sitting academic professional underscores the persistent risk of insider collusion. As per various reports, India has witnessed over 60 major exam leaks since 2010, affecting millions of candidates, with states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat frequently reporting similar incidents.","The Uttarakhand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC) graduate-level recruitment exam has taken a major turn with the arrest of Assistant Professor Suman Chauhan.

Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar meets CM Siddaramaiah at the latter's residence in Bengaluru

Shettar warns Karnataka’s finances are critical

Balakrishna backs DKS

Yathindra Siddaramaiah backs his father

Kharge says decision will follow consultations

Leadership decision likely only in January

Congress high command’s decision on Karnataka leadership change is likely only after January.

The delay can be linked to CM Siddaramaiah’s personal goal of staying in office until 6 January 2026.

Remaining in office till that date would allow Siddaramaiah to match D Devaraj Urs’ record as Karnataka’s longest-serving CM.

Siddaramaiah sees completing a full five-year term as part of his political legacy and believes this is his last term.

Analysts say Siddaramaiah’s Ahinda base and political journey mirror that of Urs, who championed backward-class empowerment.

Both leaders draw strength from the same Ahinda social coalition and have a history of rivalry despite jointly winning the 2023 election.

BENGALURU: The tussle for Karnataka’s chief ministerial post has intensified, with camps supporting chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar (DKS) stepping up pressure. Both leaders insist the final decision rests with the Congress high command, even as political signalling intensifies on the ground.Amid political drama both leaders were seen together on stage in an event on Friday.A day earlier, Siddaramaiah asserted that he would complete his full five-year term as CM, while Shivakumar publicly dismissed all speculation of a leadership change, saying he is “not in a hurry” and has had no discussions with senior Congress leaders on the CM post.During his visit to Mumbai, DKS clarified that he met no national leaders.“I came only for a family function. There was no meeting. If a meeting has to happen, it will be in Bengaluru or Delhi,” he said.Speculation around a mid-term power shift continues to be fueled by the 2023 'power-sharing arrangement', frequently referenced in political circles.Spiritual leader Dr Nanjavadhutha Mahaswamiji, pontiff of the Sri Guru Gundla Brahmeshwara Mahasamsthana, said, ""We had expected Siddaramaiah to become the CM in the first term. Considering his age, we thought he would be given the opportunity. The high command had promised to make him CM for at least 2.5 years. All sections of society are supporting Shivakumar. Let's first resolve the issue there and give Shivakumar an opportunity""Karnataka BJP President BY Vijayendra took a dig at Congress, saying it would not be surprising if Karnataka Congress splits into two factions.While Vijayendra stated that the BJP has nothing to do with the ""internal bickering"" within the ruling Congress, he added, the state administration is being affected.Former CM and BJP leader Jagdish Shettar says Karnataka's financial situation is already critical and the ongoing power tussle over the CM post is going to affect it adversely.AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge’s son, Priyank Kharge, met Shivakumar at his Bengaluru residence on Friday morning, adding curiosity to the already charged atmosphere. Priyank maintained that the high command will intervene only when necessary, and urged an end to needless speculation.“Congress was, is, and will remain united. We walk the talk,” he said.Several Vokkaliga community organisations have come out openly in support of Shivakumar, with plans to write to the Congress leadership urging that he be made the CM.MLA HC Balakrishna threw his weight behind DKS, stating that the high command must step in and take a decision soon. He expressed hope that Shivakumar would eventually take oath as Chief Minister.Congress MLC and Siddaramaiah’s son, Yathindra, reiterated his support for the current CM, saying he is unaware of any power-sharing pact between his father and DKS.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge clarified that a leadership decision will be made after consultations involving central leaders, Siddaramaiah, and Shivakumar.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing leadership crisis in Karnataka over the chief ministerial post, veteran Congress leader M Veerappa Moily on Friday launched an attack against the party high command, saying that “discipline” has to be brought into the party.Talking to news agency IANS, the former Union minister said that the high command representatives should have foreseen some of these developments in the state.“If you want to turn it into a political turmoil, yes, it can happen, but the leaders of the Congress party who are in responsible positions, and also our high command representatives, whoever they may be, should have foreseen some of these developments. It’s not a sudden development,” Moily said.“I will not comment on who should continue, whether he should continue or whether a new Chief Minister will come or not. I am not on that. First, discipline has to be brought into the party,” he added.The Congress leader further claimed that the ongoing developments in Karnataka will party's prospects, saying that the party leadership step down.""What is going on is not in the best interest of the party. This will ruin the party's prospects,"" Moily said.""I think the Congress leadership should step down and, you know, all difficulties—people who are in charge of the states—they should be briefed from time to time about the situation here, but that is not being done. Nobody is made accountable. The people in charge of the state here, you know, are not accountable to the party at any time; accountability lies with the party,"" he added.This comes amid the ongoing tussle between Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar over the top job in the state.The deliberation over the issue has now shifted to Delhi, as both DKS and Siddaramaiah are likely to meet Mallikarjun Kharge along with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on November 30.Earlier, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing. But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in the high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.This was the first acknowledgment by Kharge that there is indeed a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.As soon as the Congress government in Karnataka completed its halfway mark on November 20, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar added to the speculations after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he said.",Veteran Congress leader M Veerappa Moily launched an attack against the party high command.

Grounding for upgrade: Airbus A320 planes hit by software glitch globally; 350 of IndiGo & AI impacted in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/grounding-for-upgrade-airbus-a320-planes-hit-by-software-glitch-globally-350-of-indigo-ai-impacted-in-india/articleshow/125645449.cms,"DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: Air travel will get every impacted in India and across the globe with the world’s largest selling single aisle — Airbus A320 family of planes — going to be grounded this weekend for a software upgrade. In India, over 350 A320 family planes of IndiGo and Air India Group will be grounded for this upgrade that is expected to be over in 2-3 days. They are expected to resume flying by next Monday or Tuesday. Globally about 6,000 aircraft are likely to be impacted.The upgrade is in wake of an American low cost carrier JetBlue’s A320 operating from Cancun to Newark on Oct 30, 2025, “unexpectedly pitch(ing) downward without pilot input.” The uncontrolled descent “likely occurred during an ELAC (flight control computer) switch change,” according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The aircraft diverted to Tampa, where some passengers were hospitalised.Tackling this issue requires a software upgrade. For the new A320 family planes, the work requires about half an hour on each plane through “loading facility.” On older A320s, some hardware upgrade will also be required and hence the overall work will take longer.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive (EAD) for Airbus A320 family of planes which “may unfortunately cause disruption to flight schedules and inconvenience to passengers. As is always the case in aviation, safety is paramount.”In India, almost all IndiGo A320 family planes are the new variants. The older A320s are in single digits. So IndiGo, which has over 350 A320 family planes in its fleet, upgrade on the required 250 aircraft should be over by Monday or Tuesday, said sources. Air India, which has about 120-125 A320 family planes, should also have the same situation, with over 100 impacted.Air India said on X early Saturday morning: “We are aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in-service across airline operators. This will result in a software/hardware realignment on a part of our fleet, leading to longer turnaround time and delays to our scheduled operations. Air India regrets any inconvenience this may cause to passengers till the reset is carried out across the fleet. ”Airbus said in a statement: “Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. Airbus has consequently identified a significant number of A320 family aircraft currently in-service which may be impacted. Airbus has worked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an alert operators transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly. This AOT will be reflected in an emergency airworthiness directive from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).”Airbus “acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers” and apologised “for the inconvenience caused”. The European airspace major said it “will work closely with operators, while keeping safety as our number one and overriding priority.”In its emergency airworthiness directive regarding the issue, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) gave the reason for the same: “An Airbus A320 aeroplane recently experienced an uncommanded and limited pitch down event. The autopilot remained engaged throughout the event, with a brief and limited loss of altitude, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Preliminary technical assessment done by Airbus identified a malfunction of the affected ELAC as possible contributing factor. This condition, if not corrected, could lead in the worst-case scenario to an uncommanded elevator movement that may result in exceeding the aircraft’s structural capability. To address this potential unsafe condition, Airbus issued the alert operators transmission, providing instructions to install a serviceable ELAC.”","In India, over 350 A320 family planes of IndiGo and Air India Group will be grounded for this upgrade.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself. 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone. 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125541547,imgsize-73729,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

India-Russia Summit Dates Out As PM Modi, Putin Review S-400, Su-57 And Global Security Challenges

NEW DELHI: In a development that will be closely followed across Western capitals, Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to India next week - on December 4-5 - for the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit, the government announced Friday. Putin is expected to arrive on December 4 in the evening and head into the summit with PM Narendra Modi the next morning.Several agreements and MoUs spanning across a range of areas are expected to be signed during the visit that will help India reassert its strategic autonomy by underscoring the defence and trade partnerships with Moscow. However, the summit will also test India’s ability to navigate a delicate situation and balance competing interests as it works to ensure that the outcomes don’t act as a deal-breaker in its ties with the US and the EU.Announcing the visit, the Indian government said in a statement that it will provide an opportunity for the leadership of India and Russia to review progress in bilateral relations, set the vision for strengthening the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest.This will be Putin’s first visit to India since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Unlike the last time Putin travelled to India – in December 2021 – for the annual summit, this will be a State Visit during which President Droupadi Murmu will also host a banquet in his honour. Putin’s last visit, in the middle of a Covid wave, lasted only for a few hours. China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia are among the countries Putin has visited since the war started.While the visit allows both sides to reinforce the importance they attach to the relationship, which is defined by longstanding trust, India will be mindful of how the outcomes, especially in defence and energy, are seen in Washington and European capitals. India is looking to conclude negotiations in the next few weeks for a bilateral trade agreement with the US, which has imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on India for its oil purchase from Russia, and of immediate priority also is the EU-India summit that New Delhi will host in January.The EU summit is expected to yield several significant takeaways including an FTA and an ambitious defence and security partnership. It’s important for India to not allow the summit with Russia to indicate – not at this moment anyway - that its ties with Moscow far outweigh its relations with other important partners with whom it’s looking to boost, among other things, trade and defence industrial cooperation.In the meeting, India is likely to seek ways to address the increasing trade deficit with Russia and discuss a proposal to acquire 5 more squadrons of S-400 air defence systems. Russia said in its own announcement that the visit carries significant importance, offering an opportunity to review “the entire spectrum of the #RussiaIndia special and privileged strategic partnership – from politics, trade and the economy to science, technology, and cultural and humanitarian cooperation”.",Vladimir Putin will travel to India next week for the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit.

NEW DELHI: Aadhaar cards will no longer be accepted as the only birth certificate or proof of date of birth in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.""In Uttar Pradesh, Aadhaar card s will no longer be accepted as a birth certificate or proof of date of birth. The Planning Department has issued instructions to all departments. No birth certificate is attached to the Aadhaar card; therefore, it cannot be considered a birth certificate. Amit Singh Bansal, Special Secretary of the Planning Department, issued the order to all departments. The Aadhaar card is no longer valid as a birth certificate,"" the notification read.The Maharashtra government also issued a similar order that says Aadhaar card will not be considered as a document for making a delayed birth certificate and that all birth certificates made only through the Aadhaar card after the Births and Deaths Registration (Amendment) Act, 2023, will be cancelled, a notice by the State Revenue Department said.Instructions have been given to take action against the officers who have issued these certificates till now.The 16-point verification guideline by the Revenue Department said that the orders issued by the Deputy Tehsildar after the amendment made in the Birth and Death Registration Act, 1969, on August 11, 2023, should be withdrawn, and the withdrawn order should be verified at the level of the competent authority or the District Collector.The move comes even as the Supreme Court has allowed Aadhaar to be used in a different context, like as a proof of identity during inclusion in the Bihar electoral roll. Accepting a demand of the opposition, the court directed the Election Commission to accept Aadhaar along with the 11 other documents already permitted under the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process.Last week, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed all district magistrates to take swift and stringent action against illegal immigrants.Reiterating that law and order, national security, and social harmony remain his administration’s top priorities, he said no form of illegal activity would be tolerated.“The chief minister has directed that each district administration ensure the identification of illegal immigrants living in their area and initiate action as per the rules,” the statement read,, according to news agency PTI.“The chief minister has also directed that temporary detention centres be established in each district to house infiltrators,” it added.As per the statement, illegal immigrants holding foreign citizenship will be kept in these centres until the required verification process is completed.Adityanath said those held in the detention facilities will be deported to their countries of origin following established procedures.Uttar Pradesh shares an open border with Nepal, allowing unrestricted movement for citizens of both countries, while individuals of other nationalities are subject to checks.This comes at a time when a nationwide SIR is being carried out in 12 states and union territories, including Uttar Pradesh, with the final elector's list to be published on February 7, 2026.","Aadhar cards will no longer be accepted as the only birth certificate or proof of date of birth in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.

No Indian metro had ‘safe’ air in past 10 years: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-indian-metro-had-safe-air-in-past-10-yrs-study/articleshow/125643655.cms,"Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

MUMBAI: No major Indian city has ""good"" air quality. A 10-year assessment of air pollution across major urban centres has found that none of the country's top cities met safe Air Quality Index (AQI) levels at any point between 2015 and Nov 2025.The report, prepared by Climate Trends, an environmental research firm, analysed long-term pollution patterns across 11 major cities. Delhi remained India's most polluted city throughout the period of study, with average AQI levels peaking above 250 in 2016 and hovering around 180 this year.Despite marginal dips after 2019, the national capital never approached healthy air-quality thresholds. Vehicular emissions, industrial pollution and crop burning were major contributors, compounded by the region's geographical constraints.Cities such as Lucknow, Varanasi and Ahmedabad which recorded persistently high average AQI values — often above 200— in first half of the decade, showed some improvement in the second half. While southern and western cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Bengaluru recorded relatively moderate AQI levels, even they did not meet safe thresholds. Bengaluru posted lowest AQI readings in the country — between 65 and 90 — still too high for ""good"" category.AQI is based on the concentration of toxic particulate matter, PM2.5 or PM10, in the air, whichever is higher.Geography plays a significant role in prolonging pollution episodes, especially across the northern plains. ""With cold north-westerly winds sweeping into the plains, minimum temperatures are set to drop further — making it even harder for pollutants to disperse,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet Weather.He added that this year's weak western disturbances — extratropical storms that bring winter rain and snow to northwestern India — were inadequate and failed to trigger widespread rainfall.""Without rain to wash pollutants out of the atmosphere, the pollution lingers for longer periods, leading to early and persistent smog-like conditions,"" said Palawat.During the cold winters of the Indo-Gangetic plains, the phenomenon of ""temperature inversion"" — which limits vertical air movement — effectively traps pollution in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Dense city structures and tall buildings further slow wind speeds, exacerbating stagnation.Experts stressed the need for better planning and data-driven interventions. ""Technology can help address many local pollution sources within your own airshed, but this requires reliable data,"" said Prof S N Tripathi of IIT-Kanpur. Palak Balyan, research lead at Climate Trends said, ""What India needs is sustained, long-term, science-based policy reform backed by genuine political will to take tough decisions.

Senior advocate Shashi Kiran and lawyer Sadhana Sandhu, appearing for the organisation told the court that various agencies including WHO, UN agencies and human-rights bodies have repeatedly called for states to prevent, criminalise and eliminate FGM as medical evidence showed that short-term and long-term physical and psychological harms are caused due to it.""It is further submitted that there is not any independent law specifically banning this. The act itself falls under multiple offences relating to causing hurt under BNS, such as sections 113, 118(1), 118(2), and 118(3). Even in Pocso Act, touching the genitalia of a minor for non-medical reasons is a violation. It is submitted that WHO has classified FGM as a gross violation of human rights of girls and women. It violates the fundamental guarantees provided by Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Furthermore, FGM is a serious health concern as it can cause infections, problems relating to childbirth, and other severe physical impairments. In Dec 2012, UNGA adopted a unanimous resolution which called for elimination of FGM,"" the petition said.It said approximately 75% of women of the community put their daughters to the barbaric practice of FGM and pleaded the court to intervene to put to end the practice. The petitioner said several countires including US, UK, Australia, and several African countries have banned FGM but India does not have a specific law banning FGM.""Dawoodi Bohras are a religious denomination within Shia Islam. They are the most well-known Muslim community in India to practice FGC, known as Khatna in the community - a ritual that many Islamic scholars around the world do not endorse.

Untold Bravery in Operation Sindoor: CISF Reveals It Foiled Pakistan Attack on Uri Hydro Power Plant

NEW DELHI: India has secured third rank in the Asia Power Index, gaining the status of 'major power.' India secured this ranking in the Lowy Institute study based on its performance in Operation Sindoor The first two ranks of 'superpowers' were retained by the United States and China, respectively.In 2024, India was ranked among the 'middle powers,' with a comprehensive score of 38.1, whereas in this year's reports, India scored 40 out of 100. It stands ahead of Japan and Russia, which hold the fourth and fifth positions, scoring 38.8 and 32.1, respectively. However, the nation still sees a large aspirational gap as compared to China, which has 73.7 points on the index. The US topped the rankings with 80.5 points.As per the detailed assessments, India's rank is backed by its growth in terms of economic and military capabilities. Notably, India rose to ninth place in economic relationships, driven by increases in inward investment.The Lowy Institute said the modest advances in India’s geopolitical relevance were measured through international connectivity, leverage, and technological development.It also highlighted India's military capabilities to have grown steadily.""For the most part, these gains were from improved expert appraisals of its capability, which were likely influenced by India's performance in Operation Sindoor, launched in May 2025, which added to India's recent combat experience,"" the institute said.India saw its sharpest decline in terms of defence networks, dropping its rank to 11th position. It dropped two ranks lower as compared to the 2024 rankings, which were overtaken by the Philippines and Thailand.According to the index, India overtook China as the country attracting the most inward investment after the United States, an indicator capturing 10-year cumulative flows.Overall, the institute concludes that India’s recent military experience and economic momentum have strengthened its regional standing, even as challenges persist in building defence partnerships.The Australia-based think tank study assesses a nation's ability to influence its external environment among the power states in Asia.","India has secured third rank in the Asia Power Index, gaining the status of'major power' India secured this ranking in the Lowy Institute study based on its performance in Operation Sindoor.

'No Longer Optional': PM Modi Calls For UNSC Reforms At IBSA Meet; Urges United Stand Against Terror

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Friday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , asking whether he would take up South Africa’s cause with his “good friend” Donald Trump This comes after the US President announced that South Africa would not be invited to next year’s G20 Summit in Miami.In a post on X, Ramesh wrote: ""President Trump has announced that South Africa will not be a part of the next G20 Summit in the USA. The Prime Minister is the self-proclaimed champion of both Africa and the Global South. Will he take up South Africa's cause with his good friend and ensure that it will get to attend the next G20 Summit - as it is perfectly entitled to?""Earlier, on Wednesday, in a post on Truth Social, Trump announced that he would block South Africa’s participation in the 2026 summit, which will be hosted by the United States.""Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.In his post, Trump added that Washington has suspended all payments and subsidies to Pretoria. He claimed the South African government was failing to address alleged human rights abuses against white communities, accusations that Pretoria has firmly rejected.Ramesh said that South Africa has been a G20 member from the very beginning because it is the continent’s largest economy by GDP, not because of any favour from the US. He stressed that the country has been a “valued presence” in every G20 Summit since the first meeting in Washington DC in 2008.The Congress leader also highlighted the deep ties between India and South Africa, through groupings such as BRICS , IBSA and BASIC and referred to India’s historic role in supporting the anti-apartheid struggle.“South Africa and India share a special relationship. They are part of the original BRICS group also involving Brazil, Russia, and China. They are also part of IBSA along with Brazil and of BASIC as well along with Brazil and China.""Ramesh also invoked historical ties between India and South Africa, highlighting the shared legacy of struggle and cooperation.“It has often been remarked that an Indian lawyer went to South Africa in the late 19th century and returned home as a revolutionary in the early years of the 20th century to lead India’s independence movement,” he further wrote, referring to Mahatma Gandhi.Another senior Congress leader, Anand Sharma, also criticised Trump’s decision, calling it a violation of the G20’s founding principles of equality among nations. He urged India to take a “firm position” and rally the Global South against “new imperialism.”""It is an insult to the African continent and the Global South. India has a moral duty to take a firm position and mobilise the Global South to collectively reject the new imperialism,"" Sharma said.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa labelled Trump’s move “regrettable”, saying it was driven by misinformation rather than diplomatic engagement.

NEW DELHI: India believes in peace and dialogue, but it does not “compromise” when it comes to the sovereignty and security of the nation, defence minister Rajnath Singh said here on Friday.Speaking at the Chanakya Defence Dialogue, Rajnath said, “India's economic growth, technological capabilities and principled foreign policy have made it a voice of balance and responsibility in the changing global environment, with countries across the Indo-Pacific and the Global South viewing us as a reliable partner. ”Emphasizing that a stable India contributes to a stable global economy. the minister said that through Atmanirbharta, the Centre is building a defence industrial ecosystem that encourages innovation, supports industry and reduces external dependencies. He asserted that India is shaping global discussions with a sense of responsibility, strategic autonomy, and confidence rooted in civilisational values.India has earned global trust due to path-breaking reforms, and its consistent stand for respect of the sovereignty of nations and rules-based order, he said. ""We are strengthening border and maritime infrastructure to support security and connectivity. We are modernising our forces through new platforms, technologies, and structures,"" the minister said.“We are reforming procurement processes to ensure speed, transparency, and accountability,” the minister said, adding India is investing in start-ups, “deep-tech capabilities, and research and development that will shape the battlefields of the future,"" Singh said.He emphasised that the geopolitical uncertainty and challenges such as terrorism, cross-border support to extremist elements, attempts to alter the status quo, maritime pressures, and even information warfare require constant vigilance & clarity of purpose, with reforms becoming a strategic necessity more than a choice. “Reforms strengthen the adaptability of institutions, enhance the agility of the armed forces, and give the nation the confidence to shape its own destiny,” he said, while enumerating the steps taken by the Modi govt to build a ‘Sashakt, Surakshit and Viksit Bharat’.Singh said the contribution of the armed forces goes far beyond defending the borders. “Our armed forces bring stability where it is needed most. They support civil authorities in times of disaster. They safeguard our maritime interests. They strengthen our international partnerships through joint exercises and peacekeeping. Their professionalism builds confidence — not only within India, but also among our friends around the world.

The SEC informed the court that quota exceeds 50% in two of the 29 corporations.The SEC, through senior advocate Balbir Singh, informed a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the quota exceeds 50% in two of the 29 municipal corporations, and that a similar exercise to compute the total reservation in 32 zila panchayats and 336 panchayat samitis will be carried out soon. The bench directed the SEC to initiate the election process for these three categories of local bodies, which include the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. The SEC said it would soon announce the election schedule for these local bodies.SEC also informed the court that of the 246 municipal councils and 42 nagar panchayats, where polling is scheduled for Dec 2, the total reservation exceeded the 50% ceiling in 57 of them - 40 in municipal councils and 17 in nagar panchayats. The bench said till it decided the petitions, reservation cannot exceed 50% in any of the civic bodies.Directing the SEC to hold the Dec 2 polls as scheduled, it said results of the 57 local bodies, where reservation exceeds 50%, would be subject to the outcome of pending petitions. It fixed the final hearing on these petitions on Jan 21.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioners, repeatedly stressed that the total reservation, including OBC, cannot exceed the 50% ceiling fixed by constitution benches of SC. He said in local body territory where SC and ST population exceeded 50%, proportionate quota for them can exceed 50%, with no reservation for OBCs. Senior advocate Indira Jaising contested this stand, saying this would deprive backward classes of quota and result in absence of their representation in the civic bodies.The elections could not be conducted in the civic bodies because of a status quo order passed by SC in Aug 2022 on petitions challenging the state govt's ordinance, which based on the Banthia Commission recommendations had provided for 27% OBC reservation in local bodies.Giving 27% quota to OBCs in all civic bodies, the petitions said, would breach the 50% ceiling on reservation in certain areas where SC and ST constitute a majority, warranting assigning of quota over and above the standard 15% and 7.5% reservation for them respectively, and correspondingly the OBC quota would shrink to keep the total quota within the 50% limit.On May 6, SC had asked the SEC to complete by Sept 30 the elections for local bodies following the OBC reservation criteria as existed prior to the Banthia Commission's report in July 2022. On Sept 16, SC had extended the deadline to Jan 31after criticising the SEC for giving excuses to justify its lethargy in completing the exercise within the time limit.","The SC has cleared decks for the election process for all municipal corporations, zila panchayats and pan chayat samitis in the state.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to visit Jordan and Oman in mid-December amidst ongoing efforts by West Asian countries to uphold the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. While this would be Modi’s second visit to Oman, which is among the countries that India is expected to soon sign a free trade agreement with, the only time he visited Jordan earlier was in 2018 when he transited through the country on his way to Ramallah, becoming the first Indian PM to visit Palestine.Modi had last visited Oman in 2018. India and Oman have concluded negotiations for a free trade deal but a formal signing of the agreement is still awaited. If Oman authorities are able to complete all domestic formalities in the next few weeks, the agreement could become the highlight of Modi’s visit.The Gaza issue is likely to figure prominently in Modi’s engagements with both King Abdullah II of Jordan and Oman Sultan Haitham bin Tariq, who had visited India in 2023. With a large diaspora and considerable energy and connectivity interests in the region, India has been consistent in its support for efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, including the Trump peace plan, ensure release of hostages and return to dialogue and diplomacy. India also sees Trump's peace plan as in line with its long-standing support for a negotiated two-State solution.Both countries earlier this year strongly condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack with the Jordanian king expressing condolences and seeking an end to terrorism in all its forms and manifestation in a phone call with Modi.Apart from efforts to boost trade and investment, talks in Amman could also focus on IMEC with Jordan looking to act as a key transit country for the Corridor. According to the Indian government, trade and investment cooperation between the two sides has broadened, with India emerging as the 4th largest trading partner of Jordan in 2023-24 with bilateral trade worth $ 2.8 billion.In the case of Oman, according to the Indian foreign ministry, it is also India’s closest defence partner in the Gulf region and defence cooperation has emerged as a key pillar of the strategic partnership between India and Oman. Oman is the first Gulf country with which all the three wings of India’s defense forces hold joint exercises, according to the MEA.",The Gaza issue is likely to figure prominently in Modi’s engagements with both King Abdullah II of Jordan and Oman Sultan Haitham bin Tariq.

Amit Shah Says BSF Crushed 118 Pak Posts, He Issues Tough Security Message From Sindoor Van In Kutch

NEW DELHI: Stating that the Narendra Modi govt has provided permanent solutions to the three hotspots that had become a festering wound for the nation — Left-wing extremism-hit areas, insurgency-affected North-East, and terror-hit Jammu & Kashmir — home minister Amit Shah on Friday told the police heads from across the country that these regions will “very soon” become like the rest of the country.Addressing the 60th all-India DGP/IGP conference in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, Shah said the security forces and the police are delivering strong blows to extremism, radicalisation and narcotics by focusing on three key aspects: accuracy of intelligence, clarity of objectives, and synergy in action. “We must launch a 360-degree attack on narcotics and organised crime and build such a system that drug traffickers and criminals do not get even an inch of space in this country,” he said. The time has come, he added, for state police forces to work in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and strike hard at narcotics gangs operating at state, national and international levels, and put their masterminds behind bars.Shah said that the DGP/IGP conference has, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emerged as a key forum for resolving the country’s internal security challenges – ranging from identifying problems and challenges to formulating strategies and policies.Referring to the actionable steps taken by the Modi govt for the complete elimination of Naxalism, the home minister noted that 586 fortified police stations had been constructed in Maoist-infested areas, strengthening the security grid. As a result, he said, the number of Naxal-affected districts has come down from 126 in 2014 to just 11 now.“The country will be completely free from the menace of Naxalism before the next DGP/IGP conference,” he announced.Highlighting the concrete steps taken by the Modi govt to bolster national security, Shah recounted the additional powers and mandate given to NIA, including to probe terror crimes against Indian citizens abroad, tightening the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), enactment of three new criminal laws and stronger laws against narcotics and fugitive offenders. He further said that once the three new criminal laws are fully implemented, policing in India will become the most modern in the world.Referring to the stern action taken against terrorism and extremism, Shah said that after the Centre banned the Popular Front of India (PFI), nationwide raids were conducted on their hideouts and arrests were made, “which is an outstanding example of Centre-State coordination”.","Home minister Amit Shah on Friday told the police heads from across the country that these regions will ‘very soon’ become like the rest of the country.

The TMC leader said his party was not opposed to the concept of SIR, but was against the “unplanned manner” and “heartless” way in which EC was executing it.Another member of the delegation, Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra claimed that EC dismissed the submissions on “SIR-related deaths” as mere allegations. “Does EC or the CEC take responsibility for the deaths of BLOs?” TMC asked as it alleged that across several states, numerous BLOs have lost their lives while carrying out their SIR duties. These include cases of BLOs who have been forced to commit suicide, the Mamata Banerjee-led party alleged, citing the “inhuman pressure” by EC.TMC accused EC of anti-West Bengal bias and asked that if the true intent of SIR was to remove illegal immigrants from the voters’ list, why was Bengal the only border state under scrutiny.Why is the exercise watered down as a “special revision” in Assam and non-existent in other border states of the Northeast, and is SIR meant to “protect the voters’ list or to cast doubt on the very identity of Bengalis” and push them out of it, TMC asked. The party sought to know how many non-citizens were eradicated from the rolls in Bihar after the SIR exercises in the state.TMC also asked EC that if the electoral rolls were good enough for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, then why have these been dubbed “unreliable”. “Why not dissolve the Lok Sabha that was elected by these ""unreliable voters,” it said.The TMC has also questioned the neutrality of the SIR process and alleged that when BJP raises a frivolous issue, it is taken up with utmost seriousness. It alleged that sacrosanct rules like the Model Code of Conduct have been tampered with in Bihar to help BJP.“In Bengal, BJP leaders are claiming that one crore voters’ names will be deleted from the rolls. EC has taken no cognizance of these comments, nor has it negated the fear mongering by BJP,” TMC alleged.Later in the evening, TMC parliamentary party leader in Lok Sabha Abhishek Banerjee alleged that EC is “deliberately planting selective leaks to falsely claim that it has provided a point-by-point rebuttal” to the issues raised by the party. “These assertions are not just misleading, they are outright lies,” he alleged."," Trinamool Congress (TMC) delegation in its meeting with Election Commission on Friday alleged that there have been 40 deaths, including those of Booth Level Officers (BLOs), related to the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.

SRINAGAR: Leh police opened fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status on Sept 24 in a “reckless and disproportionate use of lethal force” without orders from a magistrate in the Union territory, Congress and Anjuman-Moin-ul-Islam have claimed before a judicial probe commission.Anjuman is a Leh-based Muslim organisation. The claims came ahead of a Friday deadline for submissions before the panel probing the violence in which four protesters were killed and over 80 injured.Leh Apex Body (LAB), the region’s largest political and religious group that spearheaded the protests, has given the panel detailed accounts but sought more time to present evidence. Late Friday evening, the panel, headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, extended the deadline to Dec 8. LAB member and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is among the over 70 people arrested over the violence. He has been booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).In its representation, Congress has called the police firing on the “peaceful protesters without any order from the on-duty magistrate a direct assault on the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21”.“Compounding this grave misery, many innocent persons, including prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk, continue in detention without substantial evidence against them in clear violation of Article 22’s protections against arbitrary arrest and detention,” states the Congress submission made by former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora.This is not an isolated error but “a symptom of grave mis-governance and a total failure of law enforcement, particularly in a peaceful region like Ladakh where demands for Sixth Schedule and statehood stem from genuine concerns over cultural preservation, environmental protection and equitable development”, Congress said.Seeking immediate release of the detainees, Congress said “the wounds inflicted on Sept 24 run deep in the collective psyche of Ladakh’s social fabric and the nation’s commitment to constitutional values”. “We place our hope in the commission to deliver not just findings but transformative justice and action against the barbaric act,” the party’s representation reads.In its representation, Anjuman has claimed that police “unexpectedly and without sufficient provocation, fired tear gas shells into the crowd, creating panic and chaos”. “This sudden and unprovoked action provoked retaliation in the form of stone-pelting by some agitated youths,” the Anjuman said.It added that the police resorted to direct firing using live ammunition, “targeting the crowd, (with) many victims being hit in the head and chest in clear violation of police protocols and SoPs”.The Union home ministry (MHA) had announced the commission after demands from LAB and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), another key Ladakh organisation. Both had made the panel’s formation a precondition for resuming dialogues with the Centre on autonomy.",Leh police opened fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status on Sept 24 in a “reckless and disproportionate use of lethal force’ Congress and Anjuman-Moin-ul-Islam have claimed before a judicial probe commission.

Drones and sniffer dogs had been roped in to assist the troops on the ground, fortify the cordon, and plug possible escape routes.Basantgarh falls on a traditional infiltration route used by Pakistani terrorists, who cross the international border in Kathua and move through the higher reaches towards Doda and Kishtwar districts in Jammu Division, before proceeding to Kashmir Valley. The Kathua-Udhampur-Doda-Kishtwar belt has witnessed multiple encounters and terror strikes in the past.Last month, a massive joint cordon-and-search operation was initiated in Udhampur’s Latti area after locals reported that a group of terror suspects had allegedly entered a house in Kirchi village, threatened its residents, and fled after snatching cash on Oct 17.",Security forces launched a joint cordon-and-search operation in the upper reaches of Basantgarh in J&K’s Udhampur district.

MUMBAI: PM Narendra Modi’s Thursday announcement about govt moving towards opening up nuclear sector to private players has been welcomed, though with a fair degree of scepticism.According to Modi, privatisation would help in development of small modular reactors (SMRs), advanced reactors and innovation. “This reform will give new strength to India’s energy security and technological leadership.”However, Atomic Energy Commission member Ravi B Grover told TOI Friday, “They (SMRs) are yet to be developed and it is premature to bet on them. With regard to SMRs, we are near peak of expectations. It is better to go for 220MW pressurised heavy water reactors rather than reactors whose technology is not yet established and whose economic viability remains unproven.”Anil Kumar Anand, former director of BARC’s reactor research group, who headed the nuclear submarine project, expressed an equal degree of scepticism. “Opening up nuclear field to private sector requires a lot of resources and money. For industries, to design and develop SMRs will be a challenge.”Anand added govt had set an ambitious target of 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. This means raising proportion of nuclear power from 2% to 9% in two decades.Another ex-official from nuclear sector who declined to be identified said if privatisation plan took off, it might require a revamp of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, which mainly scrutinises safety standards at reactors.He added new private reactors should fall under ambit of the Indo-US nuclear deal, the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group waiver and India-specific safeguards agreement.","PM Narendra Modi said privatisation would help in development of small modular reactors (SMRs) Atomic Energy Commission member Ravi B Grover said SMRs are yet to be developed and it is premature to bet on them.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Friday rejected the Trinamool Congress’ claim that around 40 people have died in West Bengal due to the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, dismissing the allegation as baseless while cautioning the party against interfering with booth officials.The Commission also directed the West Bengal DGP and the Kolkata Police Commissioner to ensure Booth Level Officers are not threatened or pressurised during enumeration, and instructed district authorities to safeguard the independence of BLOs, EROs and DEOs engaged in the process.The 10-member TMC delegation, led by Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien, met the EC top brass and accused Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar of having ""blood on his hands"".

""EC also told the delegation of TMC not to influence or threaten the BLOs regarding dead, shifted and duplicate voters,"" an official said.TMC, however, disputed the Commission’s version, calling its statements ""misleading"" and ""outright lies"".

""We started the meeting by stating that the CEC has blood on his hands. We raised five questions,"" he said. ""The CEC spoke uninterrupted for one hour... but we did not receive any answer to any of our five questions."" A TMC attendee claimed the CEC spent nearly half the time discussing the SIR in Bihar, saying, ""Of the one hour he spoke, he devoted half to praising the job done in Bihar. He said, 'You can apply for corrections in the next two months,' and spent the rest of the time explaining the basics.""The TMC delegation submitted a list of 40 alleged SIR-linked deaths, which the EC termed unverified. Mahua Moitra said, ""We began by presenting a list of individuals whose deaths we believe are linked to the SIR process... The CEC said that these are merely allegations."" Party leaders also questioned why the revision was not being undertaken in Northeastern states that share borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar, and asked how the electoral roll used in the last Lok Sabha polls had become ""unreliable"".They further flagged apprehensions over deletion of voter names and accused BJP leaders of claiming that one crore names would be removed. ""The ECI has taken no cognisance of these comments, nor have they negated the dear mongering by the BJP,"" a TMC leader said.

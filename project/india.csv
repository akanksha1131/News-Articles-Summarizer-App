The win ended RCB’s — and Virat Kohli’s — 18-year wait for the elusive silverware. Kohli, who has been with the franchise since its inception, finally lifted the IPL trophy. RCB had lost three previous IPL finals. A common theme in those defeats was their reliance on two or three individual performances. This time, however, they built a team — instead of just banking on their superstar.

‘Aviation emissions controlneeds strong action by govt’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aviation-emissions-controlneeds-strong-action-by-govt/articleshow/121604852.cms,"The success of the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme hinges on govts stepping up to the challenge, said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh on Wednesday. As airlines brace for the mandatory offsetting of a portion of international flight emissions from Jan 2027, the big question is whether govts will be able to provide enough carbon credits for airlines to purchase and offset the emissions. Offsetting will put a financial burden on airlines, including those from India. However, the current problem for the airline industry is the dearth of purchase options.""If CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) doesn't work the way it should, it won't be because of a lack of action on the part of airlines; it will be because of a lack of action on the part of govts to make credits available,"" said Walsh.""We've been talking to govts and we have realised that many of them do not understand their obligation under the ICAO-CORSIA agreement to make eligible units available to us. (ICAO stands for International Civil Aviation Organization.) We're seeing more and more countries now acknowledge that there is a need to play their part, but also acknowledge that this is an opportunity. There are some credits available, but the volume that is required is going to ramp up significantly.We've highlighted this to ICAO. Our obligation is to buy and redeem carbon credits; their obligation is to make it available. We can't fulfil our obligation on this if govts in the first place don't fulfil theirs,"" he said.While Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production will double to 2 million tons in 2025, it will only meet 0.7% of airline fuel needs, said IATA. ""CORSIA must be successful. It is a credible and verifiable system that requires carbon credits of only the highest standard, making its positive impact on climate unquestionable. But, more govts need to join Guyana, which, to date, is the only state to certify credits for airlines to purchase,"" said Walsh. ""These actions must be accompanied by ringing the alarm bells on SAF production. We need more effective leadership. For govts, that means delivering policy actions and certainty, preferably production incentives, that have a track record of success. Meanwhile, companies that can produce SAF must stop procrastinating and get to work at ramping up production capacity.""","The success of the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme hinges on govts stepping up to the challenge, says IATA director general Willie Walsh.

Why China 'turning off tap' may be another Pakistan bluff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-china-turning-off-tap-may-be-another-pakistan-bluff/articleshow/121607515.cms,"GUWAHATI/NEW DELHI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Monday demolished latest Pakistani scaremongering after India decisively stepped away from Indus Waters Treaty - what if China cuts off Brahmaputra's water supply to India? He called it a myth & cited hard data to prove the river slicing through Assam is a rain-fed watercourse that grows in India, not shrinks.""Let's dismantle this myth - not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,"" Sarma posted on X, adding: ""Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream - it is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory.""According to Sarma, China's contribution to the river's flow is minimal, only 30-35%, mostly from glacial melt and limited Tibetan rainfall. The rest 65-70% is generated inside India by torrential monsoon rainfall across Arunachal, Assam, Nagaland, and Meghalaya.Sarma further listed major Indian tributaries feeding Brahmaputra - Subansiri, Lohit, Kameng, Manas, Dhansiri, Jia-Bharali, and Kopili, along with inflows from Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia Hills via rivers like Krishnai, Digaru, and Kulsi.If China ever does ""turn off the tap"", Sarma said it might actually reduce flood devastation in Assam, which displaces lakhs annually. At Tuting on India-China border in Arunachal's Upper Siang district, Brahmaputra's flow is 2,000-3,000 cubic metre per second - but swells to 15,000-20,000 cubic metre per second in Assam during monsoon.Backed by water governance experts, Sarma's post drew strong support from Nilanjan Ghosh, vice-president of Development Studies and senior director at Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata. Ghosh said China's upstream interventions will have ""negligible or almost no effect"" on Brahmaputra's overall flow.Brahmaputra originates at Angsi Glacier in Tibet, flows 1,625km as Yarlung Tsangpo before entering India where it runs 918km - as Siang, Dihang, then Brahmaputra - and finishes its 2,880km journey with a 337km stretch in Bangladesh, before meeting Ganga.Though China has announced plans to build a massive hydropower dam on Yarlung Tsangpo, Indian experts said Brahmaputra's scale and Indian monsoon strength make fears of water cuts largely unfounded.IDSA senior fellow Uttam Sinha, citing peer-reviewed data, said even during lean periods Yarlung Tsangpo's annual outflow from China is far lower than Brahmaputra's total discharge in India.""India’s lower riparian position does not necessarily mean acute disadvantage,"" said Sinha. He, however, believes that irrespective of whether China eventually builds a super dam or not, India must be prepared by building capacity with an integrated approach to storage facilities, embankments, flood diversion, flood mitigation, inland navigation programmes, and monitoring and verifying capabilities of the flows of the rivers that come from China by using superior satellites for flood risk mapping and flood forecasting.He said, ""As the upper riparian state, China is strategically exploiting Pakistan’s position as the lower riparian to needle India so as to serve its own regional ambitions. Beijing is using the Indus Waters Treaty context to amplify Islamabad’s anxieties and indirectly pressure New Delhi, hoping to box India in on multiple fronts.""This is classic China–Pakistan coordination: Islamabad plays the aggrieved party, while Beijing plays the enabler - leveraging geography as a tool of coercive diplomacy. India should see through these tactics. China wants to shape a South Asian water narrative where India is isolated and hesitant, even when acting within its rights.""Referring to the post of Assam chief minister, Anjal Prakash, Research Director of the Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business (ISB), said the facts dismantle the myth of dependency on China’s flow, highlighting that over 65% of water originates within India, supported by robust monsoon rainfall and tributaries.""The Brahmaputra’s flow fluctuates naturally, and even if China were to restrict its contribution - an unlikely scenario - it could potentially reduce devastating floods rather than harm India’s water supply. This underscores India's resilience, self-sufficiency, and strategic independence,"" he said.","Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma demolished latest Pakistani scaremongering after India decisively stepped away from Indus Waters Treaty.

PUNE: Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan said that ""on 10 May at about 1am, Pakistan aimed to bring India to its knees in 48 hours"" but ""their operation, which they thought would continue for 48 hours, folded up in about eight hours"".""Then they picked up the phone and said they wanted to talk,"" Gen Chauhan said.He said Operation Sindoor was the first time India had engaged in non-contact warfare. ""We didn't see each other. We saw it either through radar or at different ranges, except for what was happening on the LoC. It was a mixture of kinetic and non-kinetic war. When I say non-kinetic, that happened in the information domain and cyber domain. And, of course, there were kinetic operations where destruction was being caused. It was also nonlinear in nature. So there's something happening on the LoC and something happening as far back as Sargodha.""He spoke about how India networked all its air defence architecture and was using AI for predictive analysis.So better and faster information was available to our side. We also tried to kind of network our counter UAS system, which was countering drones.And in the 7-15 days, we were able to do that,"" Gen Chauhan said.The CDS, delivering a special lecture organised by Savitribai Phule Pune University's department of defence and strategic studies on the ""Future of War and Warfare"" on Tuesday, also touched upon data-centric warfare, which will be based on data analysis deciding cognitive or decision superiority. ""Similar green shoots of that were visible in Op Sindoor,"" he said.He also explained how, through Op Sindoor, India raised the bar and redrew new lines for military operations in response to terror.Referring to his previous media statements about India suffering losses, Chauhan said, ""You should be able to understand what went wrong, rectify your mistakes, and go out again despite the initial setbacks. That is a hallmark of a professional force. And that's the kind of thing we displayed. What I said in a couple of my interviews - that losses are not important, it's the outcome which is important."" Chauhan likened it to Test cricket, where, when one side wins by an innings, there are no questions about how many balls or players played.Gen Chauhan said they would share data on the result of Indian strikes based on technical parameters like electronic intelligence and signal intelligence at some point. Stating that it was Pakistan's strategy to bleed India by a thousand cuts, Chauhan said Gen Asim Munir (now field marshal) had spewed similar venom against India and Hindus a few weeks before Pahalgam. ""But these decisions can be retracted as Pakistan is faced with a different kind of prospect, that it faces military action in case we find terror happening against us. So we have kind of raised the bar. We have connected terror to water and we have drawn out new lines for military operations against terror.""When Pakistan did ask for talks and de-escalation, Gen Chauhan said India accepted, but not immediately. According to the CDS, Pakistan's decision to talk stemmed from two facts: ""They must have assumed that if they continued in this mode, they were likely to lose much more. And the second, since they struck us on multiple fronts, they still did not have the benefit of understanding what they struck and they wanted to talk. It is only after one or two days that they realised that all their attacks against us had failed.""Revealing details of the night of the first airstrikes on May 7, the CDS said, ""We did it from 11.05pm to about 1.30am, and five minutes later we rang the director general of military operations to say that we've done this, we hit only terror targets, that military establishments are out of the purview of the strikes, and we ensured that there was no collateral damage to civilians. We need to talk to each other.""The CDS said war has expanded into space, cyberspace, the electromagnetic domain, etc. ""A lot of activities took place between both of us for four days in the electromagnetic domain. Interactivity also took place in the cyber domain. We also had a lot of activity in the domain of perception management, information, or maybe you can call it cognitive warfare, in which shaping the mind of the people is more important than the landscape. ""","India's Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan said Pakistan aimed to bring India to its knees in 48 hours. But ""their operation, which they thought would continue for 48 hours, folded up in about eight hours"" He said Operation Sindoor was the first time India had engaged in non-contact warfare.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121607264,imgsize-1202618,width-400,resizemode-4/121607264.jpg"

"Quad ministers set to meet soon, clear decks for summit India will host",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-ministers-set-to-meet-soon-clear-decks-for-summit-india-will-host/articleshow/121606215.cms,"Quad foreign ministers are likely to meet soon in Washington as India gears up to host the summit later this year. It’s learnt that discussions are underway to have the meeting of the informal strategic group involving Australia, India, Japan either in late June or early July, depending upon the availability of the ministers.The meeting of the foreign policy chiefs, if it happens, will lay the ground for the summit that will see US President Donald Trump, Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese travelling to India. With the US keen on hosting it, the meeting will again underscore the Trump administration’s unwavering commitment to the group Trump helped revive during his first term - and which has evolved rapidly to work towards a free, open, inclusive, prosperous and resilient Indo-Pacific – in the middle of Washington’s efforts to improve trade ties with China.The Trump administration’s diplomatic engagements in fact kicked off with a meeting of the Quad foreign ministers on January 21 this year, a day after the president was sworn in for the second time. Quad has remained ring-fenced from differences that partners have had with the US over trade and tariff issues and, in the case of India, the unease here over some of the claims made by the US about its role in the India-Pakistan military clash last month.The meeting will also provide an opportunity for external affairs minister S Jaishankar to review India-US cooperation with his counterpart Marco Rubio in a bilateral meeting, including the ongoing efforts for a bilateral trade agreement.While Russia and China continue to see Quad as an exercise in containment, India believes the grouping’s agenda is constructive and practical, focused as it is on infrastructure, debt sustainability, healthcare, critical and emerging technologies, UN reforms, climate change and humanitarian assistance. And that focus will remain unchanged even as India’s ties with China improve considerably.Counterterrorism is also an important focus area for Quad and a strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack can be expected from the meeting. In the past, Quad leaders have condemned the Mumbai and Pathankot terrorist attacks and also called upon all States to uphold international standards on anti-money laundering and combating terror-financing, in line with FATF recommendations.While the date for the Quad summit has not been finalized yet, it will probably take place within months of the scheduled meeting of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) leaders in China in late August or early September. PM Narendra Modi has neither accepted nor rejected the invitation for the SCO summit but it’s unlikely that the event will not see participation at any level by India as working concurrently with these groups allows it to amplify its strategic autonomy. In addition to that, India is also hoping to host Russian President Vladimir Putin for the annual summit this year.","The meeting of the foreign policy chiefs, if it happens, will lay the ground for the summit that will see US President Donald Trump, Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese travelling to India.

"AAP disengages from INDIA bloc, says alliance was only for 2024 LS polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-disengages-from-india-bloc-says-alliance-was-only-for-2024-ls-polls/articleshow/121605557.cms,"NEW DELHI: AAP on Tuesday disengaged itself from the INDIA bloc, saying the opposition grouping was formed only for the 2024 Lok sabha polls. It also alleged BJP and Congress had entered a “secret, corrupt deal”.The statement came as Congress and 15 other opposition parties wrote to PM Narendra Modi demanding a special session of Parliament on developments following the Pahalgam terror attack. AAP made the same demand separately.AAP national media in-charge Anurag Dhanda said on X , “The real alliance is between BJP and Congress behind the scenes. Rahul Gandhi says only that which benefits Modi politically. In return, Modi saves the Gandhi family from going to jail. Neither of them is interested in providing basic facilities like schools, hospitals, electricity and water to the countrymen.”“To clean Indian politics, we must end this behind-the-scenes collusion. Rahul Gandhi and Modi may appear as opponents on stage but the truth is that they’ve become guarantees of each other’s political survival. Congress’s weak politics empowers BJP, and BJP’s rule hides Congress’s corruption,” Dhanda alleged in a statement issued by the party later.Asserting that the INDIA bloc was formed specifically for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Dhanda said, “The alliance ensured that opposition parties secured 240 seats – this is a significant achievement.” He drove home the point that the alliance as far as AAP had lived its purpose and the party was not part of the bloc anymore. “AAP will contest every state election on its own. We will be contesting all seats in Bihar later this year, “ Dhanda told TOI.“In Parliament, however, our MPs will support the opposition’s position based on what is best for the country and our MPs will vote accordingly in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,” Dhanda said.AAP and Congress have had a turbulent equation even as INDIA bloc partners. After much to and fro on seat sharing talks and much resistance to the alliance from the Congress’s Delhi unit, the two parties finally did fight as allies in Delhi and also in Gujarat and Haryana in the Lok Sabha polls but were pitted against each other in Punjab.Later last year, the two parties failed to reach a consensus on seat-sharing in the Haryana assembly polls and fought against each other. In the Delhi assembly elections earlier this year too both parties fought a bitter battle that had put a big question mark on how both AAP and Congress would carry off as allies in the INDIA bloc.","AAP national media in-charge Anurag Dhanda said on X, “The real alliance is between BJP and Congress behind the scenes” The statement came as Congress and 15 other opposition parties wrote to PM Narendra Modi demanding a special session of Parliament on developments following the Pahalgam terror attack.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121605697,imgsize-883581,width-400,resizemode-4/121605697.jpg"
2.5 crore 'bogus' IDs solve case of vanishing tickets on IRCTC site,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-5cr-bogus-ids-solve-case-of-vanishing-tickets-on-irctc-site/articleshow/121606882.cms,"NEW DELHI: If you have been baffled by how and why railway tickets in certain trains disappear within minutes of the booking window opening even 60 days before the scheduled journey, IRCTC has detected those behind creating this artificial crisis. Only in the past five months, it detected 2.9 lakh suspicious PNRs while analysing ticket purchases done within just five minutes after booking commenced for both general and Tatkal tickets.Top railway officials said between Janand May, they have deactivated 2.5 crore suspected user IDs for booking tickets and put 20 lakh user IDs under revalidation as a part of a special drive. ""A total of 134 complaints have been registered with the national cyber crime portal and over 6,800 disposal email domains have been blocked.

The fraudsters have been resorting to these tactics to book tickets and charge more from unwary passengers.Sources said the problem of all tickets getting booked quickly is confined to certain routes and trains.""So, the focus is on weeding out users who are beating the system. Passengers can't be blamed as there is a genuine shortage of confirmed tickets. So, the effort has been to increase capacity and to run more trains, particularly during peak travel seasons,"" said an official.Officials claimed that IRCTC has taken ""systemic measures"" including engagement of leading content delivering network and anti-BOT applications - security techniques used to distinguish between genuine human users and automated bots or scripts - with cutting edge technology to ensure a smooth booking process for genuine travellers.The officials added that the railways' ticketing and catering arm achieved its highest ever per minute booking of 31,814 tickets on May 22, 2025 at 10am.""Attempt versus booking ratio has increased from 43.1% to 62.2% between Oct 2024 and May 2025,"" said an official.

'What if China stops Brahmaputra water?': Himanta Biswa Sarma shuts down 'Pakistan's new scare narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-if-china-stops-brahmaputra-water-himanta-biswa-sarma-shuts-down-pakistans-new-scare-narrative/articleshow/121584347.cms,"Poll Do you believe India’s water resources are secure despite external concerns? Yes, India’s water is secure No, more precautions are needed

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday hit back at Pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative, calling it a “baseless attempt” to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.Responding to a viral claim, “What if China stops the Brahmaputra’s water to India?”, Sarma issued a fact-driven rebuttal in a strongly worded post on X.His response came as India had suspended the Indus Waters Treaty in a diplomatic move following the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.“After India decisively moved away from the outdated Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan is now spinning another manufactured threat,” Sarma wrote on X.“Let’s dismantle this myth, not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,” he added, emphasising that the Brahmaputra is an Indian river that gains strength downstream, not one diminished by upstream influence.Sarma highlighted that China contributes only around 30 to 35 per cent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, primarily from glacial melt and limited rainfall over the Tibetan plateau. In contrast, 65 to 70 per cent of the river’s volume is generated within India, thanks to monsoon rains and tributaries in the Northeast.Using hydrological data, the chief minister noted that while the river’s flow at the Indo-China border (Tuting) ranges between 2,000 and 3,000 cubic metres per second, it swells dramatically to 15,000–20,000 m³/s in Assam during monsoon season. This, he said, proves India’s dominant role in sustaining the river.“The Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream. It is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory,” Sarma said.He further argued that in the unlikely event China did attempt to reduce the river’s flow, it could even benefit India by reducing the annual floods in Assam that displace hundreds of thousands.Sarma also pointed out that China has never officially threatened to weaponise the Brahmaputra and dismissed such speculation as fear-mongering.Taking a direct swipe at Pakistan, he said that the country, which has long relied on the Indus Waters Treaty, is now “panicking” as India asserts its water sovereignty.“Brahmaputra is not controlled by a single source. It is powered by our geography, our monsoon, and our civilisational resilience,” he said.The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river that originates from the Mansarovar region near Mount Kailash in southwestern China. It flows through Tibet, enters India in Arunachal Pradesh, and continues through Assam before making its way into Bangladesh, where it eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal.",Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma hit back at Pakistan’s latest water- related scare narrative.

Every country except Turkey called India after Pahalgam terror attack: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-country-except-turkey-called-india-after-pahalgam-terror-attack-bjp/articleshow/121605873.cms,"TOI correspondent from London: After the Pahalgam terror attack perpetrated by Pakistan, “except Türkiye, the entire whole called to convey their solidarity, including China”, BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad told a press briefing in London on Tuesday.Prasad is leading the Operation Sindoor parliamentary delegation to Europe to communicate India’s concerns about terrorist infrastructure and activity emanating from Pakistan.“The nuclear bluff of Pakistan has been called out; as far as India's nuclear strategy is concerned, we are very clear: no first use. We are a responsible, democratic country and a responsible nuclear power and we have conveyed that to everyone, but if Pakistan undertook an adventure of nuclear size, we are capable of responding,” said Prasad.In London the delegation met ministers, political party leaders, parliamentarians and think tanks. “We acquainted them with the entire terror infrastructure of Pakistan, where the distinction between the military leadershipand terror network is no more in existence and the terrorists do the bidding of the army, and the audience was very appreciative.Pakistan should be made to pay costs. It has taken a loan 25 times from the IMF.There needs to be accountability on where the money is going. India as a sovereign country has the right to save its citizens from terrorism,” he said, ahead of the delegation heading to Brussels.He said 75 years after Independence, India was now the fourth-biggest economy in the world and India’s digital services “were something the world was talking about”. In Pakistan, meanwhile, “unelected generals controlled power”.“Terrorism is a tool of state policy in Pakistan,” he said, adding “we are not against the people of Pakistan. They are fed up with the generals.”PM Narendra Modi went to the wedding of former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif’s granddaughter’s and in response “got Pulwama, Uri, Pahalgam,” he said.“Osama bin Laden was ultimately captured in Pakistan. A journalist’s throat was slit and the one who killed him has been killed by India’s precise strike on terror camps.”He said Op Sindoor was only “paused” — not stopped — “subject to the good behaviour of Pakistan.” “We believe in peace. We don’t permit a situation where innocent Indians are killed with impunity by terrorists. This is not acceptable.”A BBC journalist asked what evidence India had that the Pahalgam attack was directly linked to Pakistan or its govt.He responded that a proxy of the Pakistan-based terror group LeT, The Resistance Front, had claimed responsibility for Pahalgam. He pointed out that Pakistan army generals and police officers were present at the funeral of a terrorist killed in Op Sindoor and a wreath was sent by the Pakistan Chief of Army Staff. “This is not the first terrorist attack emanating from Pakistan on India. You cannot ignore this disturbing record of terrorism in Pakistan. People involved with the Mumbai terror attacks are in safe houses in Lahore, 52 terrorists have been designatedby the UN in Pakistan. Terror camps are there within Pakistan yet there are none in India and none in the UK,” he said.On Chinasupplying weapons to Pakistan, he said: “India also has a relationship with China. We have a dialogue with them (China), but where you give Pakistan weapons and they are being used for terrorism, for killing people, not in a conventional war, these are important issues and I'm quite sure China will understand ultimately, all the investment and projects in Pakistan are also getting disturbed because of this extremism, radicalisation and terrorism. ”","Prasad is leading the Operation Sindoor parliamentary delegation to Europe to communicate India’s concerns about terrorist infrastructure and activity emanating from Pakistan. “The nuclear bluff of Pakistan has been called out; as far as India's nuclear strategy is concerned, we are very clear: no first use,” said Prasad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121605921,imgsize-820619,width-400,resizemode-4/121605921.jpg"

Impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court judge Yashwant Varma in Monsoon session,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/impeachment-motion-against-allahabad-high-court-judge-yashwant-varma-in-monsoon-session/articleshow/121601764.cms,"Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: The Centre set to introduce an impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court Judge Justice Yashwant Varma in the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament, expected to commence in mid-July.Govt sources on Tuesday confirmed motion to be introduced in the upcoming session.The move follows a Supreme Court-appointed inquiry panel’s indictment of Justice Varma over allegations of unaccounted cash discovered at his official residence in Delhi after a fire on March 14, 2025.Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju is set to hold consultations with all political parties to build consensus for the unprecedented motion, which, if passed, would mark the first-ever impeachment of a High Court judge in India.Govt sources said that there is a process of forming a panel to investigate the charges against the accused judge before an impeachment motion. However, that formality is not needed since the Supreme Court has already completed the exercise.The controversy erupted when emergency services, responding to the fire at Justice Varma’s residence, recovered a substantial amount of burnt currency notes, reportedly stacked as high as 1.5 feet in a storeroom.A three-member panel, constituted by then-Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna on March 22, 2025, and comprising Justices Sheel Nagu, G S Sandhawalia, and Anu Sivaraman, found credence in the allegations of misconduct.The panel’s report, submitted on May 4, stated that Justice Varma failed to explain the source of the cash, deeming the misconduct serious enough to warrant impeachment proceedings.Justice Varma, who was transferred from the Delhi High Court to the Allahabad High Court following the incident, has denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy. Despite the Supreme Court’s recommendation to resign, he has refused, prompting the government to initiate the impeachment process.Under the Constitution of India and the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, an impeachment motion requires the support of at least 100 Lok Sabha or 50 Rajya Sabha members to be tabled. It must then pass with a two-thirds majority in both Houses. The government, keen on ensuring bipartisan support, has tasked Minister Rijiju with engaging opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, and DMK, to back the motion.The Allahabad High Court Bar Association has welcomed the move, emphasizing the need to uphold public trust in the judiciary.The case has sparked debates on judicial accountability and the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive. Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar stressed the importance of legal due process, stating, “Judicial independence must not preclude accountability.”","The Centre set to introduce an impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court Judge Justice Yashwant Varma in the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament.

SRINAGAR: Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and J&K LG Manoj Sinha joined hundreds of Kashmiri Pandits Tuesday at Mela Kheer Bhawani, an annual fair at an eponymous shrine in Ganderbal’s Tulmulla, marking the largest gathering since the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and raising hopes of the displaced community’s return to the Valley.LG Sinha interacted with people and extended warm greetings on the occasion. The shrine is known as Kheer Bhawani as devotees offer milk and(milk pudding) to a sacred spring there which, the legend has it, changes colour. Pandits from across the country travel to the temple fair, around 35km from Srinagar, each year.“Devotees in large numbers is a good sign. I think after the heinous (Pahalgam) terror attack on April 22, it is the first time that people in such large numbers have assembled at one place in Kashmir. May Mata Kheer Bhawani keep showering her blessings on J&K people,” Sinha said, vowing to make the pilgrimage safe and hassle-free.Sinha also announced that preparations were in full swing for the annual Amarnath Yatra this year from July 3 to Aug 9. “We have made all arrangements for the security of yatris. I request pilgrims from across the country to come for the yatra,” Sinha said.PDP president Mehbooba cited the large Pandit throngs at Kheer Bhawani temple to reiterate her belief that guns were not the solution to Kashmir’s issues.“Kashmir issue cannot be resolved through military force or militants’ guns. Political solution is the only way forward. There should be a political process. That process cannot be completed until our Kashmiri Pandit brothers and sisters return with due respect and settle in the Valley,” Mehbooba said.Farooq, president of J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), echoed the views as he was greeted warmly at the fair. He stressed the “urgent” need for return and resettlement of Pandits in the Valley, calling for land as well as proper housing facilities. He recalled that NC had during its past stints in office attempted such rehabilitation and expressed hope the situation would improve enough for Pandits to live in Kashmir as they once did.Kheer Bhawani temple was built by then monarch Pratap Singh in 1912. The spring there has held religious sanctity for Pandits over centuries, with many claiming its origin to Lord Rama’s times.","Hundreds of Kashmiri Pandits gather at Mela Kheer Bhawani, an annual fair at an eponymous shrine in Ganderbal’s Tulmulla.

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.The Sikh separatists last week called upon the Carney government to not invite the Indian PM, citing India’s alleged reluctance to cooperate in the investigations into the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau blamed the Indian government for the murder without backing up his claim, as Indian has repeatedly said, with any evidence. The diplomatic row that followed saw the relationship hitting an all-time low as both sides expelled each other’s diplomats for activities hostile to the host nation.Carney has so far not explicitly spoken on the Nijjar issue but, while talking about his plans to use trade to reset ties, has said that Canada is not responsible for the strain on the relationship with India. India is hoping that Carney will act more responsibly than Trudeau in his handling of the case and has said it is ready to work with Ottawa based on mutual trust and sensitivity. India wants Canada to ensure foolproof security for Indian diplomats and also crack down on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities.",PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17.

The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population. But if you have these sorts of restrictive practices (bilaterals), it doesn't make much sense when you look at the other aspects of Indian economy which are expanding,” he said.He said since the existing bilaterals have been exhausted, there is no possibility of Emirates starting flights to the upcoming airports in India like Navi Mumbai and Greater Noida.",Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its Dubai hub from flights to and from India getting impacted by the expansion of Air India.

Centre OKs 85% quota for locals in jobs in Ladakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-oks-85-quota-for-locals-in-jobs-in-ladakh/articleshow/121607045.cms,"Ladakh Autonomous Council to reserve 33% of seats for women

NEW DELHI: Conceding the longstanding demands of Ladakhi people for safeguarding their economic rights as well as cultural and linguistic identity, the Centre on Tuesday introduced new reservation and domicile policy for the Union Territory, guaranteeing 85% quota to locals in jobs while also reserving one-third seats for women in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils.English, Hindi, Urdu, Bhoti and Purgi languages were notified as official languages of Ladakh, with new regulation also requiring boosting institutional mechanisms for promoting native languages like Shina (Dardic), Brokskat (Dardic), Balti and Ladakhi.Centre's move seeks to assuage the sentiments of Ladakh's native population that had been demanding constitutional safeguards to protect their language, culture and land after the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K, which included Ladakh, under Article 370 was abrogated in 2019, and Ladakh hived off into a separate Union Territory. Though short of their demand for Ladakh's inclusion in Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, the 85% reservation for local Ladakhis in govt jobs and seats in professional institutions, was worked out in consultations held by a high-powered committee led by junior home minister Nityanand Rai, with civil society organisations from Ladakh.The safeguards for Ladakh finally implemented on Tuesday, are contained in a set of three separate regulations promulgated by the President of India on Monday.The UT of Ladakh Reservation (Amendment) Bill Regulation, 2025 amends provisions of the parent J&K Reservation Act, 2004, to raise the cap on total reservation in jobs and professional institutions in Ladakh to 85%, excluding the 10% quota for economically weaker sections.The Ladakh Civil Services Decentralisation and Recruitment (Amendment) Regulation, 2025, defines the conditions for domicile status: anyone who has resided in Ladakh for 15 years, or who has studied for seven years and appeared in Class 10 or 12 examination in a school located in UT, or whose parents are central govt officers who served in UT for 10 years. Children or spouses of Ladakhis fulfilling the 15-year domicile condition will also get domicile status. The procedure for grant of domicile certificate, notified in a separate set of rules, makes tehsildar the competent authority to issue domicile certificates; an officer appointed by the UT administrator will do the same for the children of central govt officers with 10-year service in Ladakh.The Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC) Regulation 2025, notified on Tuesday, states that ""not less than one-third of the total number of seats in the council shall be reserved for women and such seats may be allotted by rotation to different territorial constituencies"". The move is in line with spirit of the Nari Shakti Vandan Act, which provides for 33% quota to women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies.Ladakh has two autonomous hill development councils - one each for Leh and Kargil.Centre had assured a delegation from Ladakh in Dec 2023 that it was committed to fast-tracking the development of UT and meeting aspirations of the people in the region. Subsequently, an HPC for Ladakh was constituted under Nityanand Rai. In Aug 2024, Centre created five new districts in Ladakh - Zanskar, Drass, Sham, Nubra and Changthang.","Ladakh Autonomous Council to reserve 33% of seats for women.

TMC assault on BJP backers attack on democracy: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-assault-on-bjp-backers-attack-on-democracy-sc/articleshow/121607037.cms,"'Cancellation of bail requires a higher threshold than grant of bail'

NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers for targeting Hindu families and their women for supporting BJP during the 2021 assembly elections in alleged complicity with West Bengal police, Supreme Court has cancelled the bail granted to six TMC workers and said such incidents were ""grave attacks on the roots of democracy"".It allowed an appeal against Calcutta HC's orders granting bail to Sekh Jamir Hossain, Sekh Nurai, Sekh Ashraf, Sekh Karibul and Jayanta Done.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said, ""The concerted attack on the (Hindu) complainant's house was launched on the day of election results with the sole objective of wreaking vengeance because he had supported the saffron party. ""This is a grave circumstance which convinces us that the accused persons, including the respondents herein, were trying to terrorise members of the opposite political party whom the accused respondents were supporting. ""Aware that cancellation of bail requires a higher threshold than grant of bail, the bench said, ""Having regard to the facts enumerated above, we feel that the present one is a case wherein the allegations against the accused respondents are so grave that the same shake the conscience of the court.""Writing the judgment, Justice Mehta said, ""The reprehensible way the incident was perpetrated shows the vengeful attitude of the accused persons and their avowed objective to subdue supporters of the opposite party into submission by hook or by crook. The dastardly offence was nothing short of a grave attack on the roots of democracy.""The judgment recorded that the complainant's wife was viciously pulled by the hair and disrobed. The accused persons were about to assault her sexually when the woman gathered the courage to pour kerosene on herself and threatened self-immolation upon which the accused persons ran away, it said.Justices Nath and Mehta said, ""There is no possibility of a fair and impartial trial being conducted if the accused respondents are allowed to remain on bail. Thus, on both counts - nature and gravity of the offence which is nothing short of an attack on the roots of democracy, and the imminent likelihood of the accused adversely affecting a fair trial - the bail granted to the accused respondents must be cancelled.""This was the second time in recent days that attacks on Hindus by TMC members had the judiciary's attention and intervention. Earlier, a fact-finding team set up by Calcutta HC held that a party MLA and a corporator had identified houses of Hindus which were later targeted by a violent mob protesting against the new waqf law in Murshidabad. Two people were killed in the attack.Asking the trial court to conclude the trial within six months, SC directed the West Bengal home secretary and the director general of police to ensure that proper protection was provided to the complainant and all witnesses so that they could freely appear and depose at the trial. The SC warned that if any violation of these directions was reported by the CBI, it would take suitable action. Immediately after the 2021 assembly elections, in the Muslim majority village of Gumsima, TMC workers wreaked vengeance on a Hindu family for supporting BJP. The head of the family had earlier lodged a police complaint that he was not being allowed to carry out his religious rituals.The evening after election results were declared on May 2, 2021, an armed mob of 40-50 people led by Sekh Mahim threw bombs at the Hindu family's house, looted belongings and disrobed the complainant's wife and molested her. The mob relented only when she poured kerosene on herself and threatened self-immolation. The entire family fled the village to save their lives and dignity.On May 3, 2021, the family approached Sadaipur police station to lodge a complaint. The officer-in-charge did not accept the complaint and advised the complainant to leave the village to save himself and his family. Several similar complaints were not recorded by the police. Calcutta HC on Aug 19, 2021, ordered CBI to investigate all such cases involving rape, murder or attempt to commit such offences. CBI had registered cases in Dec 2021.","Supreme Court has cancelled the bail granted to six TMC workers. Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said the allegations against the accused respondents are so grave that the same shake the conscience of the court. Calcutta HC had ordered CBI to investigate all such cases involving rape, murder or attempt to commit such offences in registered cases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121607044,imgsize-1701149,width-400,resizemode-4/121607044.jpg"

The order, issued by Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Sunita Sharma, calls for strict directions to officials in the matter. ""Medical representatives may be requested to share recent advances regarding any treatment, investigation or procedure by email or other digital media,"" the order states.Vinay Aggarwal, past national president of the Indian Medical Association, said the entry of medical representatives should be regulated and not banned. ""If some medical representatives adopted illegal means such as gifting to sell their products they should be acted upon, but I don't think it is wise to ban their entry altogether for simply talking about the products,"" he said.Pharmaceutical and medical device companies spend a lot of money on marketing their products. It has often been alleged that their representatives push for sales of their respective products by offering gifts and even opportunities to the doctors to travel abroad for conferences and workshops.","The health ministry has issued orders prohibiting medical representatives from entering the premises of Centre-run hospitals.

NEW DELHI: The launch of the Axiom mission, which will carry Indian astronaut-designate Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla to the International Space Station, has been postponed to June 10, it was announced on Tuesday.“The Ax4 crew is scheduled to launch to the International Space Station on June 10 at 8:22 AM EDT from Launch Complex 39A at NASAKennedy,” Axiom Space posted on X.The mission, part of Axiom Space's Ax-4 programme, was originally slated for take-off on May 29 and then rescheduled for June 8, but operational adjustments and quarantine protocols have now led to the launch date being pushed to June 10.During a virtual press conference, Shukla said the Ax-4 crew will interact with school students, educators and members of the Indian space industry. “For the people of India, this mission is a milestone and I request India to pray for its success. Even stars are attainable, Jai Hind,” he said, adding that he would be carrying Indian delicacies such as mango nectar, moong dal halwa and carrot halwa on the space flight.PM Narendra Modi is expected to interact with the Ax-4 crew during their 14-day stay at the ISS. “We will have one with an Indian VVIP,” Shukla said to a question on interaction with the PM from space.Shukla, who will serve as the mission’s pilot, is set to make history as the first Indian to visit the ISS and only the second Indian in space—following Rakesh Sharma’s iconic 1984 mission. The Ax-4 crew includes mission commander Peggy Whitson, a veteran Nasa astronaut, and specialists Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.Shukla will be the second Indian to travel to space four decades after Rakesh Sharma's iconic spaceflight onboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in 1984.On Tuesday, space minister Jitendra Singh announced that Group Capt Shukla will study physical, cognitive and physiological responses in space, as well as the impact of utilising continuous electronic displays in microgravity, an important issue for future long-duration space missions. Further, Shukla’s research will focus on skeletal muscle dysfunction in space and the evaluation of therapeutic strategies to counter these effects.The minister shared that the astronaut-designate will also carry out experiments on the revival, survival, and reproduction of extremophiles such as Tardigrades. These micro-organisms, known for their resilience in extreme conditions, will help advance scientific understanding of the sustainability of life beyond Earth.Speaking on India’s first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, Singh said its trial phases are currently under way, and the mission is scheduled for early 2027. Such ventures will be game-changers for India's space ecosystem, allowing the country to become truly Atmanirbhar in the domain. He highlighted that India's space economy is projected to grow five-fold from $8 billion to $44 billion in the near future.","The launch of the Axiom mission, which will carry Indian astronaut-designate Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla to the International Space Station, has been postponed to June 10.

Three child marriages foiled in a month in Jind; officials step in to protect minors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-child-marriages-foiled-in-a-month-in-jind-officials-step-in-to-protect-minors/articleshow/121603113.cms,".

JIND: The district administration along with a NGO stopped three stopped three marriages in a month, in which all three couples were minors.In a fresh case, the district administration successfully intervened a child marriage at the local Vishwakarma Chowk area in Jind in which the bride and groom both were minors. The boy was 18 years old while the girl was 16-years old. This is the third child marriage prevented in a month in the Jind district.The first child marriage was stopped at Brahmanwas village on April 30, in which the groom’s age was 20 and bride was 17. In this case, the boy had been selected in a government job in postal department, and the bride’s father was poor, and following his financial condition, he fixed the marriage of his younger girl along with his elder daughter on the same day to save marriage expenses. The second marriage was prevented at Kharak Gadia village of this district on May 12, in which the groom’s age was 18 and the bride was 13, said officials.In the fresh case, it came to light that preparations were underway and the groom’s procession was ready to proceed to complete further marriage rituals at the bride’s house at Narnaund town of Hisar district. The team members apprised the groom’s mother, a widow, and guests of the strict provisions of the Child Marriage Act 2006.For some time, she tried to mislead in showing birth certificates of her son, but after strict warning from the team members, she produced the certificates in which it came to light that the he was 3 years shorter than marriageable age. After this, the birth certificates of the brides were also demanded on WhatsApp, and after verifying the documents, the bride was also found to be just 16 years old.Later, the groom's mother recorded her statement before the police that she was illiterate and unaware of the provisions of The Child Marriage Act 2006, said Surender Singh Mann, head of MDD, an NGO which was involved with district administration in all three marriages.Maan said that under the aegis of Just Rights for Children (JRC), a national platform of 250 civil societies working in 416 districts in the country, his organization was working against child marriage in 14 districts of Haryana , including Jind. He further said though different social reasons forced parents to tie the knot of their minor children but independent choices of brides and grooms totally ignored, as parents treat them as their private property, which is an injustice to them.","In a fresh case, the district administration successfully intervened a child marriage at the local Vishwakarma Chowk area in Jind.

A team led by joint director (health) Dr V Gnanameenakshi, raided the hospital after receiving a tip-off. The district officials sent a notice to the dentist Arivazhagan, demanding an explanation within three days after they found that the clinic had changed its name and continued to operate under a new identity.The notice also warned that legal action would be taken if a response was not provided.

A show-cause notice was sent to the dentist, but his explanation was not acceptable. Therefore, the clinic has now been sealed. We have also reported the matter to the Dental Council and recommended further appropriate action,” Gnanameenakshi told a section of media people.","The dentist identified as Arivazhagan owned V D S Clinic in 2023.

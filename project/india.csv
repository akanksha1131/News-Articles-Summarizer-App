NEW DELHI: Ahead of Rahul Gandhi 's Amethi visit on Wednesday, posters were put up in the Congress MP's former Lok Sabha constituency targeting him and leaders of the party-led INDIA bloc for taking a ""pro-Pakistan"" stand amid escalating tensions with the neighbouring country over last week's terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam.Gandhi is on a two-day visit to Rae Bareli, which he currently represents in the Lok Sabha, and Amethi. He visited Rae Bareli on Tuesday.""INDI's hand is with Pakistan,"" one of the posters read. Hand is the Congress' symbol.The poster had comments from National Conference supremo Farooq Abdullah and Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar. It called Gandhi a ""sympathiser"" of terrorism (""Aatank ka saathi"").Similar banners were put up across the Uttar Pradesh town targeting the opposition INDIA group leaders for making statements ""favouring"" Pakistan.The Congress and other opposition parties have declared their complete support to the government as it plans India's response for the Pahalgam attack, carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists. However, stray remarks from its leaders forced the grand old party to distance itself from their comments.""Some Congress leaders have been speaking to the media. They speak for themselves and do not reflect the Congress' views. There should be absolutely no doubt whatsoever at this most sensitive of times that the CWC resolution, the views expressed by (Congress president) Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi and the views of authorised AICC office-bearers ALONE represent the position of the Congress (sic),"" Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.Last night, after much outrage, the party deleted a social media post in which it accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of going ""missing"" during the crisis. The image, which showed a headless PM, was captioned ""Gayab"" (missing).","Posters were put up in the Congress MP's former Lok Sabha constituency targeting him and leaders of the party-led INDIA bloc.

In the wake of Pahalgam terror attack , Indian students at the Harvard Kennedy School protested the upcoming visit of Pakistani delegates to the campus. In a letter to US secretary of state Marco Rubio , the students requested him to revoke the visas of Pakistani officials who will attend the Pakistan Conference 2025 at Harvard University.""We are students at Harvard Kennedy School, deeply disturbed by the recent targeted terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India, on April 22, 2025. Survivors confirm that attackers demanded religious identification and recitation of Islamic prayers--those who failed or identified as Hindu were killed. This was not an indiscriminate act of violence--it was a faith-based massacre,"" Indian students Surabhi Tomar and Abhishek Chaudhari wrote in the letter.The students condemned Pakistan's response to the attack, as many leaders issued threats towards India.""Even more troubling is the response from Pakistani state officials. While the Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued perfunctory condolences, other leaders have simultaneously issued veiled threats toward India and reaffirmed their support for Kashmiri insurgents, the ideological and logistical base for LeT,"" the letter added.The students noted that ""despite this, senior Pakistani government figures, some directly tied to these statements, are scheduled to attend the Pakistan Conference 2025 at Harvard University. These include Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and others representing institutions complicit in ideologically or materially enabling religiously motivated terrorism.""""Senator Rubio, we respectfully urge you to recommend that the US State Department revoke the visas of all Pakistani officials travelling to the United States for this conference,"" the letter added.In another letter to the leaders of Harvard, the students said that ""Harvard has always stood for equity, global justice, and human dignity. In recent years, the university has taken meaningful stances in support of communities affected by racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hatred.""""We now ask for the same clarity, courage, and compassion for Hindu and Indian students grieving the targeted killing of members of their faith.

Window opens for a reset with Canada as new Liberal govt takes over; PM Modi seeks to unlock opportunities with Carney,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/window-opens-for-a-reset-with-canada-as-new-liberal-govt-takes-over-pm-modi-seeks-to-unlock-opportunities-with-carney/articleshow/120742734.cms,"Canada’s Liberal Party headed by PM Mark Carney returned to power Tuesday riding a wave of strong anti-Donald Trump sentiment. PM Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate Carney and express willingness to unlock greater opportunities in ties, while underlining that India and Canada are bound by shared democratic values, a steadfast commitment to the rule of law, and vibrant people-to-people ties.For India and Canada, there’s an opportunity now to wipe the slate clean after 20 months of bitterness in ties as Carney talks of rebuilding what he sees as “incredibly important” ties with India. Aware of the dramatic turnaround in Liberal fortunes because of Trump’s policies, and given it held Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alone accountable for destroying the relationship, India had already been looking to rest ties with Canada under the Canadian PM since he assumed office in March but based on “mutual respect and sensitivity”.However, unchecked activities of Khalistan separatists will continue to act as a redline in the relationship for India. Of immediate interest will also be whether Canada invites Modi for the G7 summit it will host in June. Canada has so far not announced the name of any guest country for the event.“I look forward to working with you (Carney) to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people,’’ said Modi in a post on X. Modi’s message followed Carney’s declaration of victory even though he failed to get a majority that he had said would allow him to deal with Trump, who has unleashed a trade war on Canada and apparently even sought to annex the US’ northern neighbour, from a position of strength. A record 22 Punjabis were elected to the House of Commons but, importantly for India, pro-Khalistan leader Jagmeet Singh, a thorn in India’s side for years, lost from his own constituency and resigned from his position as the leader of the New Democratic Party.India’s ties with Canada took a body blow last year in October when the 2 countries expelled each other’s high commissioner, following the diplomatic row over the killing of Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in 2023. Even before that, with Canada accusing the Indian government of having masterminded the murder without apparently backing up the claim with evidence, India had expelled dozens of Canadian diplomats to ensure parity in diplomatic presence.As things look up, both sides are expected to negotiate the return of diplomats, particularly the high commissioners. Both sides have already identified senior diplomats for the top job, but India would want to make sure that the redlines it has drawn are adhered to by Carney’s government. These include a mature and responsible handling of the Nijjar issue as the case goes to trial - avoiding Trudeau’s sensationalism - foolproof security for Indian diplomats and a crackdown on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities. India continues to hold Trudeau and his indulgence towards Khalistan extremists responsible for the downturn in ties with a country where over 4 lakh Indian students are studying, and which is home to one of the largest Indian diasporas abroad - 1.8 million Indo-Canadians and another 1 million non-resident Indians. However, while India blames Trudeau, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which has investigated the Nijjar case, maintains he only acted based on the information provided by the agency. If India and Canada indeed take steps to normalise the relationship, they will have to see that the process is ring-fenced from the fallout of any damning revelations made during the trial.Carney, who has visited BAPS temple and Gurudwara as PM, has so far not explicitly spoken on the Khalistan or Nijjar issue but he was quoted as saying ahead of the elections there are strains on the relationship that “we didn’t cause to be clear, but there is a path forward to address those with mutual respect and to build out.” An economist by profession, he has identified trade as one of the areas the 2 sides can work on to rebuild the relationship. It is important for Canada to diversify its trade partnerships with other partners in the face of the Trump offensive and Carney, soon after his victory, said Canada stands ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries who share common values.",PM Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate Carney and express willingness to unlock greater opportunities in ties. India had already been looking to rest ties with Canada under the Canadian PM since he assumed office in March. Of immediate interest will also be whether Canada invites Modi for the G7 summit in June.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120742742,imgsize-989435,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"Congress portrays PM Modi 'headless'; 'Sar tan se juda' imagery, says BJP; Venugopal issues whip for leaders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-portrays-pm-modi-headless-sar-tan-se-juda-imagery-says-bjp-venugopal-issues-whip-for-leaders/articleshow/120742895.cms,"Stick to party stand: Congress



NEW DELHI: Congress' pictorial post on social media, seemingly portraying PM Modi without his head, caused a furore in BJP. The governing party said the image echoed the Islamist "" sar tan se juda "" call recently made by a Pakistan diplomat in London, who had mocked Indian diaspora with a throat-slitting gesture.Congress posted the image with ""gayab jimmedari ke samay (missing instead of taking responsibility)"" as the caption on its X handle by cropping Modi's head out of what appeared to be an old picture of the PM, with his trademark clothes forming the outline. It did not mention the PM's name.Congress defended the post through the day, arguing that it did not show anyone's name or face. However, with the image going viral on social media, the party deleted it in the evening.Significantly, it was only on Monday that the party, alarmed at its netas making controversial remarks like the one debunking the account of kin of Pahalgam victims that terrorists had marked out non-Muslims before killing them, had said only party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and LoP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi represented the party's stand.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said the post once again exposed sincerity of Kharge's and Rahul's claim of supporting govt in responding to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. ""This is not an innocent post by Congress. It is a sinister design to weaken the integrity of Bharat,"" he told at a presser.""On one hand, PM Modi and Army have taken a vow to destroy the power which has looked at India with an evil eye, while on the other, its the evil of terror demonic power... Pakistan's thinking and Congress's thinking,"" Bhatia alleged, mocking Congress as ""Lashkar-e-Pakistan Congress"".BJP IT dept head Amit Malviya said on X, ""Congress leaves little doubt with its use of 'sar tan se juda' imagery. This is not a political statement; it is a dog whistle aimed at its Muslim vote-bank and a veiled incitement against the PM.""Following the controversy over the 'Gayab' post, Congress on Tuesday instructed all party netas and workers to stick to the CWC resolution on the Pahalgam attack and said any deviation would be seen as a serious breach of discipline. It is learnt that AICC general secretary KC Venugopal has written to all state units and party functionaries in this regard.Congress also took down the 'Gayab' post amid a feeling within the party that BJP's campaign alleging ""sar tan se juda"" had undercut the mileage the party had sought to generate through letters to the PM seeking a special session of Parliament on the terror hit.The party was also disappointed that the post, with allegations of being ""distasteful"", dented the positive feedback about the party's stand extending support to the govt over the terror attack.The delayed response in taking down the post was said to be due to the leadership's late focus on the issue. Earlier, AICC social media chairperson Supriya Shrinate defended the post, with a detailed video of how Modi has been ""missing"" since the attack.","Congress posted the image with ""gayab jimmedari ke samay (missing instead of taking responsibility)"" as the caption on its X handle.

'What's wrong in use of spyware to track terrorists?' asks SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-wrong-in-use-of-spyware-to-track-terrorists-asks-sc/articleshow/120742802.cms,"NEW DELHI: ""What is wrong in govt having spyware to track terrorists and enemies of the country?"" Supreme Court on Tuesday put this question to petitioners clamouring for making public the court-appointed committee's report on Pegasus spyware and alleging that it was used to ""snoop on citizens"".""The kind of situation we are facing now, wemust be very careful. We cannot compromise on security and safety of country,"" a bench of justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said in what appeared to be a reference to the Pahalgam atrocity.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan and Dinesh Dwivedi flagged a US district court order to claim that WhatsApp had admitted about its system being hacked by Pegasus in India and other countries and repeatedly requested the bench to make public the Justice R V Raveendran committee report and seek Centre's response on whether it had bought the military-grade Israeli spyware.When the Pegasus controversy broke out in 2021, SC had set up a committee under Justice Raveendran to examine the allegation of use of the spyware to surveil on politicians, including a couple from the ruling party, journalists and others.The committee, which was appointed on Oct 27, 2021, had informed the court that only a few people who had claimed that their phones were hacked using Pegasus had submitted their mobile phones for verification by the committee. It found no conclusive evidence of the misuse of Pegasus, though it found signs of suspected interception of conversations and messages in a few cases.For petitioners, who included N Ram, John Brittas and Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, the advocates said the Centre had not denied using the spyware.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, stuck to the Centre's consistent stand and said, ""Government of India does not answer questions concerning sovereignty and security of the country in motivated petitions.""The bench said the US district court order was of little use as SC had passed a detailed judgment and a report had been submitted by the high-powered committee. ""You tell us the name of the petitioner who suspects his phone was hacked. We will check in the report and then tell you whether the apprehension is true. But we cannot make the report public as we do not want it to be a document for discussion on the street,"" it said.When Divan said the spyware was used by the govt to ""snoop on its citizens"", Mehta reiterated that sovereignty and security of the country could not be the subject of debate in the court and alleged that the petitioners were using the forum for some purpose other than the cause they had publicly espoused. ""Terrorists and those who want to cause disturbance in the country cannot claim the right to privacy,"" the SG said. The petitioners said the court could redact sensitive information from the report and then give it to them to understand the process of scientific examination and the findings.","Supreme Court asks petitioners for making public committee's report on Pegasus spyware.

UK govt says ‘India has full support to go after perpetrators’ of Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uk-govt-says-india-has-full-support-to-go-after-perpetrators-of-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120741977.cms,"TOI correspondent from London

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack. As we understand it, international agreements have been put in abeyance, rather than being rescinded,” Falconer said.","India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack), UK govt says.

The sharp exchange of allegations has deepened the India-Pakistan rift, raising concerns about a broader confrontation.Chaudhry revealed the arrest of Abdul Majeed near Jhelum on April 25, alleging he was trained in India to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan. Authorities recovered a drone, an IED, and Rs 25,000 (approximately $90) in cash from Majeed, which Chaudhry claimed was proof of India’s covert operations. “India is actively supporting terrorist networks on Pakistani soil,” he alleged, challenging New Delhi to substantiate its claims about Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack. “Seven days have passed, and India has failed to provide a single shred of evidence,” he added.However, Pakistan’s evidence lacks detailed substantiation, raising questions about its weight.India, too, has accused Pakistan of orchestrating the Pahalgam attack without publicly disclosing evidence. In response, India announced the suspension of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, closed the Attari and Wagah borders, and recalled its defence attachés from Islamabad. Pakistan rejected India’s treaty suspension, closed its airspace to Indian flights, and warned that disrupting its water rights would be an “act of war”.Analysts warn that the current standoff risks spiralinginto a broader conflict. The Indus Waters Treaty, a rare success in India-Pakistan diplomacy, has survived previous tensions, and its suspension could have catastrophic consequences for Pakistan, a lower riparian state dependent on the Indus river system.Pakistan’s allegations of Indian-sponsored terrorism, while serious, also demand scrutiny. The evidence presented – centered on Majeed’s arrest – lacks granular detail, and Islamabad’s narrative risks being dismissed as tit-for-tat rhetoric. Both nations’ reliance on public accusations over backchannel diplomacy underscores the erosion of trust.","Pakistan rejects India’s accusations linking it to the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists.

India slammed Pakistan at UN on Monday, calling it a ""rogue state fuelling global terrorism"". Yojna Patel, India's deputy permanent representative to UN, said in New York, ""The whole world has heard Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif admitting and confessing its history of supporting, training and funding terrorist organisations in a recent interview. This open confession surprises no one and exposes Pakistan as (the one) destabilising the region. The world can no longer turn a blind eye.""It is unfortunate that one particular delegation (Pakistan) has chosen to misuse and undermine this forum to indulge in propaganda and make baseless allegations against India,” Patel said as she delivered a strong ‘right of reply’ at a hybrid launch event for ‘Victims of Terrorism Association Network’ (VoTAN) of UN Office of Counter-Terrorism in New York.Pakistan’s delegate not only made a reference to the Pahalgam terror attack, but also reportedly said that it had credible evidence about the Jaffar Express train attack in Balochistan in March being sponsored by “its regional adversaries”.Patel referred to a recent interview of the Pakistan defence minister to buttress her point. Asif had said, “Well, we have been doing this dirty work for the United States for about three decades, you know, and West, including Britain” to a comment that he admits that Pakistan has had a long history of backing, supporting, training and funding these terrorist organisations.Patel said that the “strong, unequivocal” support and solidarity extended by global leaders in the wake of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam is a testimony to the international community’s “zero tolerance” for terrorism.“The Pahalgam terrorist attack represents the largest number of civilian casualties since the horrific 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008,” Patel said. “Having been a victim of cross-border terrorism for decades, India understands the long-lasting impact such acts have on victims and their families ,” she added.India also termed the establishment of VoTAN as a significant step, saying it will create a structured, safe space for victims to be heard and supported.","India slammed Pakistan at UN on Monday, calling it a ""rogue state fuelling global terrorism"" Yojna Patel, India's deputy permanent representative to UN, said in New York, ""The whole world has heard Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif admitting and confessing its history of supporting, training and funding terrorist organisations""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120743897,imgsize-775919,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The heavy agenda for the members of the Union Cabinet for Wednesday also appeared to be putting across a “business-as-usual” reassurance.","PM Narendra Modi has given complete operational freedom to the armed forces to decide on the mode, targets and timing of response to Pakistan.

First sighted with the embedded snare in 2022, and rediscovered in Dec 2023, the tigress stunned forest officials who, as they prepared to dart her for rescue, witnessed her carrying a cub gently in her mouth - a moment that suspended the operation and reframed the story they thought they were about to tell.From the beginning, her case defied expectation. The metallic loop had lodged itself deep in her lumbosacral region, an area crucial for mobility and balance. Yet, despite the physical restrictions - and the internal damage that experts later suspected - she moved through her habitat with enough stealth and strength to hunt, mate, conceive, and rear a litter. Drone surveillance launched after the interrupted rescue attempt confirmed what seemed almost improbable: four cubs, nursed and nurtured, thriving in her care.Today, three of those cubs, now around sixteen months old, roam the forest with their mother, who continues to hunt and provide for them with a tenacity that belies the injury written into her body. To the team observing her, and to the wider circle of wildlife biologists, her survival - and that of her cubs - has become a living case study in endurance, adaptation, and the hidden margins of possibility in the wild.At the Wildlife Institute of India, where a detailed plan for her future is under discussion, Dr Parag Nigam told TOI that the need to rescue the tigress remained urgent. ""The metallic snare poses serious physical and spinal risks that could worsen with time,"" he said, adding that her images would be sent to WII's tiger cell to cross-reference her history with national tiger databases.Veterinary experts studying her case noted the narrow anatomical escape that had allowed her to survive and reproduce. Dr R K Singh, former veterinary head of Kanpur zoo, explained that the snare's position likely spared her kidneys and ovaries, trapping mostly the intestinal loops instead.","A tigress whose lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare continued to survive and give birth to healthy cubs.

The mission, which is jointly being undertaken by Nasa and Isro, will be launched from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.Group Capt Shukla will be accompanied by Peggy Whitson, a former Nasa astronaut, mission commander Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. Once docked, the astronauts are scheduled to spend up to 14 days aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting a mission comprising science, outreach and commercial activities. Shukla's trip to space comes four decades after Rakesh Sharma’s iconic spaceflight onboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in April 1984.“Private astronaut missions are an important component of Nasa’s strategy for enabling a robust and competitive commercial economy in low Earth orbit. Private astronaut missions also serve as pathfinders in demonstrating the demand for future commercial space stations,” the US space agency said on X while confirming the launch date.Isro has shortlisted seven microgravity research experiments proposed by Indian principal investigators from various national R&D labs or academic institutions for implementation on the ISS by the Indian astronaut. These include studying 'water bears' — microscopic organisations — to understand how living things adapt to microgravity. According to Isro, the experience will nurture a microgravity research ecosystem back home, leading to the induction of advanced experiments that make up India's space programme.Space minister Jitendra Singh said Shukla will focus on 'space technology, space bio-manufacturing, and bio-astronautics' during his ISS mission.“We have a sprouting experiment which tries to sprout green gram or moong and methi or fenugreek seeds, which are believed to have medicinal properties,” Tushar Phadnis, group head for microgravity platforms and research, said at the virtual press conference organised by Axiom. “The idea is not just to stop sprouting it there. The idea is also to see how these India-specific sprouts behave when they come back. They will undergo a lot of analysis in the labs of the respective PIs (principal investigators),” Phadnis said.Overall, Axiom-4 has a research complement of around 60 scientific studies, including the seven from India. Lucie Low, chief scientist, Axiom Space, reiterated that this will be the most research and science-related activities conducted on an Axiom Space mission aboard the ISS to date.Experience from the ISS mission will give momentum to India’s first human spaceflight programme ‘Gaganyaan’ and also future manned missions to space.Director of international govt business at Axiom Space, Pearly Pandya, who is an Indian-American and was born in Ahmedabad, informed the media in Delhi recently that Shukla and his backup, Group Captain Prashanth Nair, are being trained to operate payloads and conduct scientific research in microgravity. The ISS project is an end-to-end commercial mission for Axiom, which will take care of astronaut training, medical operations and help conduct space experiments, she added.The Ax-4 mission is a significant collaboration between India and the US, announced by PM Narendra Modi during his visit to the US last year.","IAF Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will fly to the International Space Station on May 29.

SRINAGAR: National Conference MLA Sajad Shafi alleged Tuesday that the mother of Shaurya Chakra awardee Mudasir Ahmed Sheikh , the J&K Special Operations Group constable who died fighting terrorists in 2022, was among those escorted out of their villages in Uri as part of the govt-ordered exercise to deport citizens of Pakistan or PoK.Baramulla Police contested the allegation, saying “reports circulating on social media regarding the alleged repatriation of the mother of Shaheed constable Mudasir Ahmad @ Bindaas are false, baseless, and categorically denied”.Shafi, who represents Uri in the J&K assembly, said he was shocked to find Shameema Akhtar’s name on the list of prospective deportees. “She gave a brave son to this country,"" he said. “Many other women of my constituency have been asked to return to Pakistan without delay.”Shameema, who travelled to Delhi along with her husband in 2023 to receive their son Mudasir’s posthumous Shaurya Chakra from President Droupadi Murmu, has been living in J&K for 40 years. Her parents were from PoK, locals said.Mudasir had been part of a joint anti-terror operation with the Army in north Kashmir’s Baramulla on May 25, 2022, in which he helped gun down three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists before being fatally shot.Another woman on the deportation list, Aliza Rafiq, said she moved to Kashmir from PoK in 2013 under the rehabilitation policy introduced during CM Omar Abdullah’s first term in office. She settled in Bandipora’s Nadihal, her husband Mohammad Rafiq Bhat’s ancestral village in north Kashmir, with their two children. A third daughter was born in J&K.Rafiq had crossed over to PoK in 2003 – he was 18 at the time – for arms training. He married Aliza and lived there for a decade before choosing surrender and rehabilitation.""I have received a notice asking me to leave the country with my two older daughters,” Aliza said. “The notice states that any child born here must be left behind. How can I abandon my third daughter, who is 10?”The rehabilitation policy, announced in 2010, had been billed as a major confidence-building measure for J&K. It enabled former terrorists who had settled in PoK to return via four approved routes: Poonch–Rawalakote, Uri–Muzaffarabad, Wagah (Punjab) and Delhi airport.Although widely publicised, the policy lacked clear implementation guidelines. Of the more than 1,200 applications, only about 350 were approved, according to officials. Most returnees, including Rafiq, used the Nepal route to enter India based on a purportedly informal understanding between Delhi and Islamabad.PDP president and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti said the post-Pahalgam govt directive to deport all Pakistani nationals from India was riddled with “humanitarian concerns”, particularly in J&K. “Many of those affected are women who came to India 30-40 years ago, married Indian citizens, raised families, and have long been part of our society. We urge the govt to reconsider this decision, adopting a compassionate approach regarding women, children and the elderly,” she said.CPM’s M Y Tarigami, too, called for a rethink. “Deporting women from Pakistan and PoK who came here after the govt rolled out the rehabilitation policy in 2010 is inhumane. These women, married to local Kashmiri men, have built their lives here, living peacefully since their arrival,” he said.","Mother of Shaurya Chakra awardee Mudasir Ahmed Sheikh was among those escorted out of their villages in Uri as part of the govt-ordered exercise to deport citizens of Pakistan or PoK.

He added that it’s time for unprecedented opportunities for youngsters while mentioning that the International Monetary Fund has said India will remain the fastest-growing major economy.The PM said in recent times, the production and exports have achieved new milestones, particularly in the automobile and footwear industries, sectors that provide substantial employment to young people. Highlighting the achievement in transportation of cargo through inland waterways, Modi said goods transport through inland water transport has surged to 145 million tonnes (MTs) from 18 MTs before 2014.On women taking the lead in every field, Modi cited the recent UPSC results where the top two positions were secured by female candidates, and three out of the top five toppers were women. “Women are reaching new heights in fields ranging from bureaucracy to space and science. Our govt is focused on empowering rural women through initiatives like self-help groups, Bima Sakhis, Bank Sakhis, and Krishi Sakhis, which have created new opportunities,” he said.Earlier, personnel minister Jitendra Singh said that nearly 28% of the new recruits (14,796) are women.","PM Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.

As she was leaving the venue, a gunman fired at her and then detonated a suicide bomb, fatally injuring Bhutto.While the Pakistani government blamed the Pakistani Taliban and militant leader Baitullah Mehsud for the attack, serious suspicions have persisted about the involvement of elements within Pakistan’s military and intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Zardari, who is a former Pakistani foreign minister, threatened India days after New Delhi formally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, following the deadly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.""India has accused Pakistan of the Pahalgam incident, with Modi making false allegations to conceal his own weaknesses and deceive his people.

Dolphins’ new quarterback choice signals a bold shift in long-term strategy



Tua Tagovailoa’s journey highlights the balance between resilience and risk



Backup quarterback’s seven-figure loss reflects deeper emotional stakes

The Miami Dolphins have sparked major conversation across the NFL landscape after drafting a new quarterback from the Texas Longhorns, a move signaling potential change at the most critical position. As a result, current starter Tua Tagovailoa finds himself navigating a wave of uncertainty, with both emotional and financial consequences rippling through the team.In an unexpected but calculated move, the Miami Dolphins' front office made it clear they are thinking beyond the present by investing in a young quarterback prospect. This decision doesn’t just add competition—it signals the beginning of a strategic transition. With fresh talent entering the locker room, the message is unmistakable: the franchise is determined to secure its future, even if it means re-evaluating relationships with established stars like Tagovailoa.Tua Tagovailoa’s career with the Dolphins has been a testament to both brilliance and adversity. After battling through a series of injuries, especially concussions, Tagovailoa showed resilience time and again. Yet, the physical toll of the game has never been far from mind for both the player and the organization. The recent draft move forces a tough reality into focus—balancing loyalty to a battle-tested leader with the practical need to protect the team’s long-term viability.Adding to the drama, the team’s backup quarterback reportedly suffered a jaw-dropping seven-figure financial loss in the wake of the draft move. This sudden hit is not just about dollars—it captures the often harsh business side of professional sports, where roles and futures can pivot overnight. It also underscores the emotional challenges athletes face when roster decisions upend carefully laid career plans.In steering the team through this delicate phase, head coach Mike McDaniel has approached the situation with measured precision and deep empathy. Recognizing the strong bonds that have formed within the team, McDaniel’s handling of the quarterback competition aims to blend tactical necessity with human understanding. The Dolphins' leadership knows that while performance metrics matter, preserving team culture is equally vital during times of change.Also Read: Mike Tomlin's cryptic comments on Aaron Rodgers fuel rumors of a Steelers move—Is Pittsburgh desperate for a QB? As the Miami Dolphins navigate this pivotal moment, they stand at a crossroads that could redefine their future.

In professional sports, change is inevitable, but with change comes opportunity—for reflection, growth, and ultimately, renewed success.","The Miami Dolphins have sparked major conversation after drafting a new quarterback from the Texas Longhorns.

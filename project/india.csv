NEW DELHI: Flight operations at Srinagar were temporarily suspended on Friday due to snowfall, with both arrivals and departures put on hold.In an advisory to passengers, the airline said the suspension could lead to extended wait times, both onboard aircraft and at the airport, as weather conditions continued to affect operations. It added that boarding formalities may be completed in advance so that flights can depart immediately once clearance is granted.The airline said it was closely monitoring the situation and assured passengers that efforts were being made to minimise inconvenience. Travellers have been advised to check the latest status of their flights before heading to the airport, as operations will resume only after weather conditions improve.Cold conditions tightened their grip across Kashmir on Thursday as minimum temperatures dipped further at most locations, with officials warning that an approaching western disturbance could bring fresh snowfall later in the day.Night temperatures fell below the freezing point across the valley. In Srinagar, the minimum temperature dropped by one degree from the previous night to settle at minus 3.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday night.The coldest spot in the valley was Sonamarg in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, where the mercury plunged to minus 6.1 degrees Celsius, compared to minus 5.5 degrees Celsius a night earlier. North Kashmir’s ski resort of Gulmarg recorded a minimum of minus 4 degrees Celsius.In south Kashmir, Pahalgam, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath Yatra, registered a low of minus 4.4 degrees Celsius, down from minus 3.8 degrees Celsius the previous night.Officials said Qazigund recorded a minimum of minus 3.8 degrees Celsius, while Kokernag settled at minus 2.6 degrees Celsius and Kupwara at minus 3.7 degrees Celsius.According to the meteorological department, two strong western disturbances are expected to affect Jammu and Kashmir this week. The first system is likely to impact the region on Thursday, followed by another on January 26. Under their influence, widespread light to moderate rainfall and snowfall, including in the plains of the Kashmir Valley, is forecast, with peak activity expected on January 23 and January 27.","Flight operations at Srinagar were temporarily suspended on Friday due to snowfall.

77th Republic Day Parade to Witness Debut of DRDO’s Hypersonic Anti-Ship Missile

.

NEW DELHI: At the Rashtriya Rangshala Camp in Delhi Cantonment, the days leading up to Jan 26 are marked by constant activity. The smell of fresh paint hangs heavy in the air as the sound of construction echo across the parade ground. Artisans climb makeshift stairways, painters add final touches and workers carefully align massive structures.Amid this controlled bustle, Republic Day tableaux are taking shape, with every frame, colour and detail preparing to tell captivating stories on Kartavya Path.This year's Jan 26 parade marks 150 years of Vande Mataram, and its spirit runs through every creation. On Thursday, TOI witnessed around 30 tableaux in different stages of completion, each reflecting India's past, present and its aspirations. Nearly 10,000 people will soon watch them roll along Kartavya Path, while 2,500 artistes are set to perform, capping the visual spectacle on wheels.One of the most striking displays is a tableau titled 'Operation Sindoor: Victory Through Jointness', which highlights India's military strength, with Rafale jets and Akash missiles on display. Nearby, Gujarat's tableau traces the journey of India from 1906 to 1947 under the theme of 'Vande Mataram', its structure anchored by a towering figure of Mahatma Gandhi.Delhi's tableau pays tribute to the Prime Ministers' Museum while showcasing the capital's transformed skyline, featuring the new Parliament, Bharat Mandapam, Signature Bridge and Yashobhoomi as symbols of a changing nation.Other states, too, have brought their landscapes and legacies vividly to life. Bihar's tableau follows the journey of makhana - from pond to plate. ""It took one month to make this whole thing,"" a carpenter said. Himachal Pradesh is honouring its 1,203 gallantry award winners and Punjab is reflecting the spiritual courage of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur through their tableaux.Ladakh showcases the engineering feat of Shyok Tunnel, Uttarakhand displays its traditional instruments and utensils, while J&K recreates the charm of a houseboat.

Jharkhand's tableau showcases the state's natural beauty and aims at attracting tourists, said Neha Agarwal, a state representative.Karnataka's tableau, From Millets to Microchips, tells a story of holistic growth through scenes of a farmer family with millets, silicon crystals, a robot and a giant microchip - linking agriculture with technology and innovation. Assam has transformed terracotta into visual poetry. Chhattisgarh's tableau pays homage to tribal heroes like Veer Gunda Dhur and Veer Narayan Singh.Union ministries have added their own narratives. The education tableau traces the evolution of India's knowledge from Aryabhatta's shunya (zero) to PM Shri schools. ""All my team members and I are from different Kendriya Vidyalayas,"" said Elix Singh, a Class XI student.A unique tableau designed by filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali for the ministry of information and broadcasting depicts the evolution of storytelling - from its oral tradition to cinema. The panchayati raj tableau in the vicinity highlights the SVAMITA scheme.On Republic Day, these individual pieces will come together to form a moving portrait of India, diverse in expression and united in purpose.","This year's Jan 26 parade marks 150 years of Vande Mataram, and its spirit runs through every creation.

Triple talaq-halala FIR puts focus on legal grey area,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/triple-talaq-halala-fir-puts-focus-on-legal-grey-area/articleshow/127206877.cms,".

NEW DELHI: When police in UP registered an FIR on Dec 9, 2025, it was not just another complaint under the 2019 Triple Talaq law. The allegations were shocking and went further, into a grey zone the law has never squarely addressed: What happens to women after talaq is pronounced.According to the FIR filed in Amroha’s Said Nagli, the woman, after being divorced through instant triple talaq, was pressured by her husband, her brother-in-law and clerics to undergo “ halala ” multiple times so she could be returned to the marriage. An exception that permits a divorced Muslim couple to remarry, the practice of halala often involves planned, short-term marriages — even arranged one-time encounters — to facilitate consummation of the woman with another man, enabling the former couple to reunite.The woman’s complaint detailed the ordeal. She said she was “gang-raped under false pretenses of halala carried out under threats, intimidation and coercion”.Police have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq — sections 3 and 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. Multiple provisions and relevant sections of BNS that deal with rape, aggravated hurt, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy, have also been added.In the initial FIR, there are three accused: Her husband, his cousin and a hakim (traditional healer.) Since then, police have added more accused to the list.Amroha police told TOI that one accused — her husband — had been arrested so far. “The FIR has been registered on the basis of a written complaint. Further action will depend on corroboration and evidence,” SHO Vikas Sahrawat said. Amroha police are on the lookout for others on the run, he added.This week, based on Zubaida’s (name changed) age at the time of her marriage, police added multiple provisions of the Pocso Act to the FIR, expanding its scope. (The move, incidentally, also brings into focus an unresolved legal grey area, as Muslim personal law is not codified and does not prescribe a minimum age, instead linking marriageability to puberty. The issue remains unsettled by the Supreme Court so far, with courts in different states taking conflicting positions. )The FIR covers several years of alleged abuse, assault and rape. Zubeida told police she was forcefully married off in 2015 at the age of 15, and subjected to pronouncements of instant triple talaq twice — once in 2016, and again in 2021, followed by three coerced reconciliation attempts through halala.“I felt like I was being handed over every time. I was too ashamed to come out with what had happened to me. I didn’t want my daughter to grow up reading about it,” Zubaida told TOI. A former student of one of Aligarh’s top schools, Zubaida comes from a family with a history in public service — her grandfather was DSP in UP police and her father a lawyer.After the first triple talaq in 2016, she said she was told she could return to her husband only after undergoing halala, a process that, according to her complaint, involved sexual assault by someone introduced as an “intermediary”.In Feb 2025, she said she was told she would need to follow the halala process twice as her marriage had broken down twice by then. Zubaida’s complaint said after years of being a single mother and financial difficulties, she had once again fallen for the accused’s false promise of remarriage. “It was after a long time that I realised what had happened to me was wrong,” Zubaida said.With her husband now behind bars, Zubaida said she was struggling to keep life going for her daughter.Her husband, meanwhile, has alleged that he was harassed and threatened by Zubaida and her relatives. In his written complaint, dated Nov 26, 2025, he claimed that Zubaida “tried to forcibly enter his house and threatened him with false criminal cases”.Earlier in 2021, according to documents, Zubaida’s divorce was finalised through a family court’s decree, with the court placing the daughter’s custody with the father at the time.Halala finds no mention in Indian statutory law. The 2019 Muslim Women Act criminalised instant triple talaq, making its pronouncement a punishable offence, but it did not — and does not — recognise halala.According to activists, halala cases rarely leave a paper trail. Fear of stigma, economic dependence and concerns about children often keep victims silent.“In many cases, women don’t even know that what is being done to them is wrong,” said Zakia Soman, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan founder. “Halala is not mentioned in the Quran. It survives through misinterpretation, patriarchal control and silence. There is a hush-hush around it. For a woman to come forward takes extraordinary courage.”Soman added that the practice survived in pockets, operating through informal and largely invisible set-ups. “Triple talaq was criminalised on paper, but the ecosystem that sustained it was never dismantled. Without regulations, halala survives as an unpoliced, underground arrangement,” she said.Soman cited cases where clerics themselves offered to “perform” halala, and others where women were passed between men to settle personal disputes, family feuds or even debts — arrangements that remain largely hidden unless a woman breaks ranks and approaches the police. Soman said practices such as halala, child marriage and puberty-as-marriage-age thrive in a legal grey zone.Experts point to structural gaps that make such cases hard to prosecute. One is the absence of mandatory registration of Muslim marriages and divorces. “Nikahs are largely undocumented,” said Naish Hasan, a Lucknow-based activist who has worked with halala survivors for over two decades. “When there is no paper trail, the burden of proof falls entirely on women.”She said the practice remained alive, particularly among poor and marginalised women. “For years, cases kept surfacing before we even had language for it,” she said.Hasan said her fieldwork included around 40 detailed case studies from Lucknow district alone. “Justice should reach every last woman,” she added. Petitions challenging the practice of halala, including one filed by Hasan in 2021, have been pe-nding before Supreme Court.","Police in Amroha, UP, have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq.

"Patent rejected for MNC’s cancer drug, generics to follow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patent-rejected-for-mncs-cancer-drug-generics-to-follow/articleshow/127206094.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: In what could be good news for patients, Indian Patent Office (IPO) has rejected MNC AbbVie’s patent application for its blockbuster cancer drug Venetoclax citing lack of inventive step. AbbVie markets the drug under the brand, Venclexta, in India. The company holds another patent on a composition of Venclexta, which is facing opposition in courts.IPO’s Delhi office declined to grant a patent on Venetoclax used in treatment of certain blood cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. The decision, if not challenged, paves way for entry of affordable generics in country, legal experts told TOI. The application faced sustained opposition at pre-grant stage, with seven parties filing challenges between 2018 and 2025. The patent office held that the claimed invention was “obvious” and lacked inventive step, a violation of Section 3(d) of Indian Patent Act.Section 3(d) bars patents on new forms or derivatives of known substances unless they demonstrate a significant enhancement in therapeutic efficacy, a provision aimed at preventing “evergreening” of pharmaceutical patents.It is the same provision under which Swiss firm Novartis lost patent on its blockbuster cancer drug, Glivec, in 2013. The order, accessed by TOI, said “claims of complete specification is not patentable under the Act, does not describe the invention”, and added it offered “no enhancement in therapeutic efficiency”, and hence, is a case of evergreening.Further, applicants have failed to give data of better therapeutic efficacy of compounds claimed in the present application over compounds disclosed in the prior art document, it added. “In absence of any biological data for all claimed compounds in the present specification, it cannot be decided whether the claims actually have the claimed anti-cancer activity or not. Hence, applicants have completely failed to establish any pharmacological activity and/or therapeutic efficacy for all the millions of claimed compounds,” the order said.","Indian Patent Office (IPO) has rejected MNC AbbVie’s patent application for its blockbuster cancer drug Venetoclax.

"HC: Apart from refunds, how will you compensate flyers?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-apart-from-refunds-how-will-you-compensate-flyers/articleshow/127204742.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court directed IndiGo on Thursday to clarify how it intended to compensate flyers affected by the mayhem of cancellations last Dec, saying issuing refunds wasn’t quite the same as doing right by those who bore the brunt of the crisis.“Apart from refunding fares, what are the civil aviation rules for compensation? Please file an affidavit about compensation,” the bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia told the counsel for the airline after he informed that the carrier had processed refunds for cancelled flights.The counsel submitted that for flights that were “most severely impacted”, IndiGo was offering vouchers worth Rs 10,000 to each passenger. He said a website has been set up for them to claim compensation. “You know who the flyers are; why do they need to claim compensation?” the bench responded. “Anyway, you file an affidavit to this effect in two weeks.”The court was hearing a PIL by advocates Akhil Rana and Utkarsh Sharma, seeking directions to Centre to provide support and refunds to passengers affected by cancellation of hundreds of flights by IndiGo during that period.They argued that compensation must be in the form of money instead of vouchers.The petitioners pointed out that IndiGo had issued travel vouchers to stranded passengers with a time limit for utilisation. When the airline’s counsel said the vouchers were valid for 12 months, the judges noted the time frame appeared reasonable. They sought to know if there were options for flyers who did not use the vouchers within that period.Civil aviation ministry and DGCA informed the court that steps have been taken by authorities to prevent a recurrence of the crisis.Based on the inquiry committee’s report, IndiGo’s senior vice-president for operations was asked to step down, and a penalty of Rs 22 crore was slapped on the airline for its failure to adhere to the new flight roster norms, Centre’s counsel said.He said the airline was directed to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 50 crore to ensure compliance with regulatory directions and long-term systemic corrections, while warnings had been issued to the chief operating officer, director, deputy head of flight operations and a resource analyst.The inquiry report was submitted to court in a sealed cover. Between Dec 3 and 5, IndiGo cancelled 2,507 flights while 1,852 were delayed, impacting over three lakh passengers across country. The inquiry found out that the airline was not adequately prepared to implement the new flight duty norms for pilots.",Delhi high court directed IndiGo to clarify how it intended to compensate flyers affected by the mayhem of cancellations last Dec.

Meitei visiting Kuki fiancee shot dead on camera,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meitei-visiting-kuki-fiancee-shot-dead-on-camera/articleshow/127203749.cms,"PTI file photo

IMPHAL: A Meitei man visiting his Kuki fiancee in Manipur's hill district of Churachandpur was abducted and shot dead on camera Wednesday evening, a killing that jolted the state with graphic footage, street protests and an order for an NIA probe.M Rishikanta, 31, was allegedly dragged away by armed miscreants from his fiancee's home at Tuibong village in Churachandpur district southwest of Imphal around 6.30pm. Police said his body was found hours later near Natjang village in the same district. A case has been registered and search operations launched.Rishikanta worked as a technical engineer in Nepal, family members said. He had arrived before Christmas and had been staying in Churachandpur since Dec 19. The couple had sought permission from Kuki National Organisation, an umbrella group of Kuki insurgent outfits, for his stay. KNO denied knowledge of the visit and any role in the killing.A video circulated widely on social media showed his final moments, with the gunmen shooting him twice despite his pleas. The clip carried a message reading: ""No Peace, No Popular Government.""An autopsy was conducted Thursday in Churachandpur.Family members identified the body over a video call, unable to travel to the hill district amid security concerns. Kakching police facilitated the process, and the body was to be handed over later in the day.Manipur has remained deeply fractured since ethnic violence erupted in May 2023 between Meiteis and Kuki-Zo tribal communities, leaving communities effectively sealed off from one another. Even now, civilians rarely cross into areas identified with rival groups. Periodic flare-ups such as the one in Churachandpur keep the state on edge.Protests erupted Thursday at Kakching Khunou, Rishikanta's native village in Kakching district, where residents blocked an arterial road. To douse tensions, Governor AK Bhalla told a delegation of a Joint Action Committee led by Lok Sabha MP Angomcha Bimol Akoijam that the case would be handed to NIA for a ""thorough and impartial"" inquiry, according to an official release.The governor further said that intensive combing operations were under way ""on a war footing"", with coordinated deployment of state and central forces to track those responsible.JAC urged steps to prevent similar killings, called for intensified action against armed Kuki militants in the hills, and sought disciplinary action against Churachandpur's police chief and central forces deployed there, alleging failure to take preventive measures.","M Rishikanta, 31, was allegedly dragged away by armed miscreants.

Airport response







BENGALURU: A South Korean businesswoman has accused an airline ground-handling employee of sexually assaulting her at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport, allegedly under the pretext of “manual frisking”.The 32-year-old woman was returning to South Korea on Monday when the incident occurred in the international departures area of Terminal 2, shortly after she had cleared immigration and security checks.According to the woman’s complaint, the incident took place around 10.45am.A man approached her after she had completed Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) frisking and immigration formalities, identified himself as airport staff and asked to see her boarding pass.He then claimed there was a problem with her checked-in baggage, saying a beeping sound had been detected and that resolving the issue would take time.He allegedly suggested an alternative — what he described as “manual frisking” — and asked her to accompany him.Police said the woman was taken to an area near the men’s washroom. There, under the guise of inspection, the man allegedly touched her chest multiple times, asked her to turn around and then touched her private parts.When the woman objected, he allegedly hugged her, thanked her and told her she could leave.The Kempegowda International Airport police said the accused has been identified as Mohammed Affaann Ahmed, 25, a ground-handling staff member.Police said he had no authority to physically inspect passengers.According to investigators, the woman later reported the incident to airport security staff, who immediately detained the accused and alerted airport police. CCTV footage from the terminal is said to corroborate key aspects of her account.A case has been registered against Ahmed under Section 75 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deals with sexual harassment. He was arrested and remanded to judicial custody, and has been lodged in Central Jail at Parappana Agrahara.Airport authorities said frisking and physical checks are conducted only by authorised CISF personnel and in the case of female passengers, by female staff.AISATS spokesperson said, ""An unpardonable incident was reported at Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru. The employee involved was immediately terminated and handed over to the authorities for further legal action. We deeply regret the emotional distress caused by the incident and have extended all necessary support to the guest. A comprehensive inquiry is underway to strengthen safeguards and prevent any recurrence.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

India batting star Rohit Sharma was at the centre of a major security scare recently after a woman allegedly grabbed his arm while he was entering the team hotel during the third ODI against New Zealand in Indore. A video of the incident, which has since gone viral on social media, shows the woman breaching the security cordon and approaching an unsuspecting Rohit, who appeared visibly startled by the sudden encounter.The clip later features the woman explaining her actions, claiming she was driven by desperation to seek help for her daughter, who is allegedly battling a serious illness and requires an expensive life-saving injection costing Rs 9 crore.“My name is Sarita Sharma. My daughter, Anika, is suffering from a serious illness, and to save her, we need an injection that costs Rs 9 crore and has to be imported from America. We have been organising small camps to raise funds, and so far, we have managed to collect Rs 4.1 crore. We are running out of time,"" she said in the video.The woman further revealed that she had been trying to reach out to Indian cricketers during the match in the hope of receiving assistance.“Yesterday, during the India-New Zealand match, we tried to reach out to cricketers in the hope of getting some help.

Silver market jitters: ETFs see steep 20% drop; what’s causing the sudden drop?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-jitters-etfs-see-steep-20-drop-whats-causing-the-sudden-drop/articleshow/127124650.cms,"Representative image

Indian silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witnessed a sharp sell-off on Thursday, plunging up to 20% in early trade as investors rushed to exit amid heightened volatility in precious metals.The steep fall wiped out the unusually high premium at which these ETFs were trading compared to international prices and physical silver markets.Nippon India Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF and Kotak Silver ETF fell between 19% and 20% during morning trade.As per ET, the funds slipped below their indicative net asset values (iNAVs), turning what was earlier a steep premium into a discount. The sell-off was largely limited to ETFs, highlighting the risks associated with sharp price dislocations in these products.In contrast, silver prices in other markets saw relatively modest declines. Global spot silver was trading around $92.27 an ounce, just days after touching a record high of $95.87 earlier this week.On the domestic front, MCX March silver futures slipped about 2% in morning trade, far less severe than the ETF correction.Market experts pointed to extreme volatility as a key factor behind the move. Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart said investors should avoid fresh positions in precious metals for now.“We are experiencing very high price volatility in both precious metals,” Jain was quoted as saying by ET, advising traders to wait for stability.The correction came as global risk appetite improved and the US dollar strengthened, reducing demand for safe-haven assets.Sentiment also eased after US President Donald Trump ruled out using military force over Greenland and signalled restraint on tariffs against European nations.Despite the turbulence, some analysts remain constructive on silver’s broader outlook. Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said COMEX silver remains firm near $92–$93, supported by strong industrial demand and tight global supply.However, he cautioned that near-term swings could remain sharp, especially in ETF prices, given their tendency to trade at premiums or discounts during volatile phases.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

NEW DELHI: SC Thursday refused to restrain ED from accessing information from the mobile phone of I-PAC functionary Jitendra Mehta, which was seized during a search on Jan 8 at the political consultancy firm's Delhi office. Mehta has been summoned for questioning at the ED headquarters on Friday.Appearing before a bench headed by CJI Surya Kant, senior advocate C A Sundaram said allowing Enforcement Directorate to open the phone would violate Mehta's privacy and pleaded that ED be restrained from doing so till the next date of hearing on Tuesday. But the bench asked him ""why are you so afraid"".Sundaram said the apex court should intervene to protect his fundamental right, but the bench said, ""We know how to protect an innocent citizen"".

NEW DELHI: The Bombay high court on Thursday came down sharply on the Maharashtra government, questioning whether the rule of law prevails in the state and asking if the chief minister was too ""helpless"" to act against a cabinet minister whose son has been evading arrest for weeks.The remarks were made by Justice Madhav Jamdar while hearing applications linked to a violent clash during the Mahad Municipal Council elections in Raigad district, news agency PTI reported.The case involves Vikas Gogawale, son of Shiv Sena minister Bharat Gogawale, and Shreeyansh Jagtap, son of former MLA Manik Jagtap and a leader of the NCP.Violence had erupted on December 2 during the civic polls between supporters of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP, both allies in the BJP-led government. Cross FIRs were registered following the clash.Vikas Gogawale and his cousin Mahesh, key accused in the case, were denied pre-arrest bail, while Shreeyansh Jagtap was granted interim protection from arrest in December. Applications opposing Jagtap’s anticipatory bail were filed by Vikas and Mahesh Gogawale.Taking note of the police’s failure to arrest the minister’s son after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by a sessions court, Justice Jamdar asked, ""Is the state’s chief minister so helpless that he cannot say anything against even one minister? Ministers’ children commit crimes and roam freely ... they remain in touch with their parents, yet the police cannot find them?”The judge added that while there may be pressure on the police, “there is no pressure on the court,” and questioned whether law and order was being effectively enforced.Following the court’s rebuke, the government assured compliance. Advocate General Milind Sathe told the bench that the minister would ensure his son’s surrender within a day. The court accepted the assurance, directed Vikas Gogawale to surrender before the next hearing, and posted the matter for Friday."," Bombay high court questions whether rule of law prevails in Maharashtra.

JAMMU: Ten Army soldiers were killed and 11 wounded around noon Thursday when an armoured troop carrier skidded off a narrow mountain road in J&K and plunged nearly 200ft into a gorge. The six-wheel truck was heading to a counterterrorism operation in the upper reaches of Doda district, a remote, forested area in the Jammu region, when it lost traction near Khanni Top — a 9,000ft-high pass on Bhaderwah–Chamba interstate road that links J&K with Himachal Pradesh.An Army-police joint rescue effort began immediately after the crash, which occurred in bad weather on a steep stretch of road carved into the mountains. “The vehicle carrying troops for an operation slipped off the road while navigating treacherous terrain in bad weather,” White Knight Corps said in a post on X.Four soldiers died at the crash site. Others died of injuries while being evacuated or after reaching hospital, officials said. At least 10 of the injured were airlifted to the Army’s Northern Command Hospital in Udhampur. One injured soldier remains under observation at a sub-district hospital in Bhaderwah town, about 190km northeast of Jammu city, and is reported to be stable.The troops were traveling in a bulletproof Casspir — also known as Casper — a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle designed to shield soldiers from land mines and roadside bombs.PM Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Lt governor Manoj Sinha, CM Omar Abdullah and Northern Command GoC-in-C Lt Gen Pratik Sharma expressed grief and condolences to the families of the dead, and wished a speedy recovery to the injured.“Deeply anguished by the mishap in Doda, in which we have lost our brave army personnel. Their service to the nation will be remembered forever. May the injured recover at the earliest. All possible support is being provided to those affected,” Modi posted on X.The crash adds to a series of fatal accidents involving military vehicles in the mountainous terrain of J&K and Ladakh, where narrow roads, sharp bends and frequent landslides pose constant risks. Thursday’s accident took the toll to 30 since 2023.In July 2025, a Lt Col and a soldier were killed when a boulder struck a convoy vehicle in eastern Ladakh. In Jan last year, four soldiers died after their truck rolled down a hillside in Bandipora district of north Kashmir. Five soldiers were killed in Dec 2024 when a truck plunged into a gorge in Poonch district near the LoC.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir Valley and Pir Panjal regions in J&K may witness major snowfall from early Friday, with India Meteorological Department (IMD), Srinagar, forecasting that back-to-back western disturbances will impact the region’s weather pattern for almost a week.Authorities have stepped up preparedness at the district level. Kulgam Deputy Commissioner Athar Aamir Khan said as a precautionary measure, 232 pregnant women expected to deliver in the district this week had already been hospitalised to ensure uninterrupted medical care during the harsh winter spell.With a rainfall deficit of 96% this month, J&K has witnessed an arid winter, leading to forest fires and the drying up of rivers and streams. IMD Srinagar director Mukhtar Ahmad on Thursday said weather conditions would change early Friday onwards, with moderate to heavy rainfall and heavy snowfall likely in parts of south Kashmir. North Kashmir may see moderate to heavy snow.Ahmad warned that the weather situation would disrupt traffic and trigger landslides on major highways, including Srinagar–Leh highway; Mughal Road, which connects Kashmir Valley to Poonch district in Jammu division, and Razdan Pass, a high-altitude mountain pass connecting north Kashmir’s Bandipora district with the scenic Gurez Valley on the LoC.The changing weather conditions could also affect air traffic on Friday, Ahmad said, adding that high-altitude areas — including Zojila Pass, Gulmarg and parts of Kupwara — were expected to receive two to three feet of snowfall.With another western disturbance likely to affect the region from Jan 26, Ahmad advised farmers to postpone agricultural activities till Jan 28. He said light rain was expected on Jan 24-25, and another active phase will commence from Jan 26 when moderate rain and snowfall was expected at most places across Kashmir Valley.J&K traffic department issued an advisory urging people to plan travel carefully. It requested commuters to confirm road conditions with traffic control units in Srinagar, Ramban and Jammu before embarking on the journey.

The party asked them to instead work together to ensure Congress return to power in the upcoming 2027 assembly elections.The order came during a three-hour meeting convened by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at his residence in New Delhi, which was also attended by Rahul Gandhi, amid reports of infighting within the state unit, news agency PTI reported.Punjab goes to the polls in early 2027, and Congress is aiming to reclaim the state from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Party leaders were asked to refrain from making statements against one another and were assured that there would be no immediate change in the state leadership. The high command, they were informed, would take decisions on candidate selection and campaign strategy in due course.AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal said Kharge and Gandhi reviewed the political situation in Punjab and heard the views of state leaders, describing the discussions as ""very fruitful"".“The party has directed all leaders to refrain from making public statements on internal matters.Everyone may have their own views, but these should be raised only within party forums. Going to the media or spreading such issues on social media will not be tolerated,” Venugopal told reporters.He said the leadership had given a “very clear direction” and that all leaders present had unanimously agreed to it. On speculation about a leadership change in Punjab, Venugopal said there was “no question of it at present”.Addressing concerns raised by some leaders over representation of weaker sections, Venugopal said the Congress remained committed to ensuring adequate representation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs and economically weaker sections, including in Punjab. However, he stressed that such issues must be raised internally.“We have told the state leadership not to make statements in public. From tomorrow onwards, you will see the Congress united. We will fight the elections together and win Punjab,” he said.On reports of some leaders writing jointly to Rahul Gandhi seeking a separate discussion, Venugopal said individual requests were acceptable but “group activities” would not be tolerated. “If anyone wants to meet Rahul ji, they can write individually,” he said, adding that Kharge and Gandhi were planning a visit to Punjab soon.","The order came during a three-hour meeting convened by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at his residence in New Delhi.

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

Tamil Nadu governor's walkout

Karnataka governor's walkout

Kerala governor cuts short address

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Thursday said his party DMK would consult like-minded opposition parties to move a constitutional amendment to end the practice of the governor’s address at the start of the first assembly session.This comes after a series of confrontations in Opposition-ruled states where governors refused to read state government-approved speeches.Reacting to recent walkouts and curtailed addresses in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, Stalin accused governors of acting like “party agents” and undermining elected governments. In a post on X, he said the pattern was “clear and deliberate” and argued that abolishing the Governor’s address was now the only solution.“First Tamil Nadu. Then Kerala. Now Karnataka. The pattern is clear and deliberate. Governors refusing to read the speech prepared by state governments and behaving like party agents, undermining duly elected state governments,” Stalin wrote.He added, “As I stated earlier, the only solution now is to end the practice of commencing the first annual Assembly session with the Governor’s address. DMK will consult like-minded opposition parties across India and pursue a constitutional amendment in the very next parliamentary session to abolish this obsolete and irrelevant practice.”Stalin’s remarks come two days after Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the Assembly before delivering his inaugural address, alleging disrespect to the national anthem and claiming his microphone was switched off.The episode led to sharp exchanges inside the House, with Speaker M Appavu urging the governor to follow established Assembly conventions.Raj Bhavan later issued a statement defending the walkout and alleging that issues such as atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women were omitted from the government’s speech. Opposition AIADMK leaders also staged a walkout over law and order issues.A similar standoff unfolded in Karnataka today, when Governor Thawarchand Gehlot delivered only two lines of his customary address and walked out of the joint sitting of the Assembly and Council, refusing to read the full Cabinet-approved speech.The shortened address triggered chaos in the House, with Congress members raising slogans and accusing the governor of violating constitutional norms.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said the governor’s conduct amounted to a breach of the Constitution and that the government was considering legal options.Explaining the government’s stand, Siddaramaiah said the address prepared by the Cabinet had included objections to the Union government’s decision to replace MGNREGA with the Viksit Bharat–Rozgar aur Ajeevika Mission (Rural), a move his government strongly opposes.In a detailed statement on X, Siddaramaiah said, “By not reading the address prepared by the Cabinet at the first joint session of the year, the Hon’ble Governor of Karnataka has violated the Constitution. This act amounts to an affront to the House of elected representatives.”He added that under Articles 176 and 163, the governor is bound to read the address prepared by the Council of Ministers and has no authority to substitute it with a speech of his own.The Karnataka CM also linked the confrontation to substantive policy differences, particularly over rural employment. He said the new law replacing MGNREGA diluted guaranteed employment, removed decentralised decision-making powers of gram sabhas and panchayats, and disproportionately affected women, Dalits, workers and small farmers.“By refusing to read the Cabinet-prepared address, the Governor has violated constitutional provisions and insulted the Legislature,” Siddaramaiah said, adding that the Congress government, along with legislators, would protest the move and examine legal remedies, including approaching the Supreme Court.In Kerala, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan drastically curtailed his customary policy address to the Assembly at the start of the Budget session, delivering what became the shortest such speech in the House’s history. The address lasted just one minute and 18 seconds, with the governor reading only the first line and the concluding paragraph of the original 62-page speech.By doing so, Khan technically fulfilled his constitutional obligation, but his action raised serious questions over whether differences with the elected government should extend to the Assembly, which represents the will of the entire state. The entire exercise, including the national anthem, concluded in under five minutes, after which the governor left the House.The back-to-back confrontations have reignited a wider debate on the limits of administrative discretion. Constitutional experts have warned that refusing to deliver a Cabinet-approved address could invite judicial scrutiny, observing that while governors may express reservations, the Constitution mandates that the address be delivered to the House.","Stalin accuses governors of acting like ‘party agents’ and undermining elected governments.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday acquitted former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in two cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate over his failure to appear before the agency in the Delhi excise policy probe.The order was passed by additional chief judicial magistrate Paras Dalal at the Rouse Avenue Courts. The Enforcement Directorate had approached the court in February 2024, seeking action against Kejriwal for not complying with summons issued under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The agency said Kejriwal had not appeared despite being summoned five times in connection with its investigation.The money laundering probe stems from a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation on August 17, 2022, over alleged irregularities in the Delhi excise policy for 2021–22.The CBI case was based on a complaint filed by Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena on July 20, 2022. Following this, the ED registered its own case on August 22, 2022, to investigate the money laundering angle.Kejriwal was later arrested in the main excise policy case.He was eventually granted bail by the Supreme Court.The excise policy was scrapped in 2022 after lieutenant governor ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities and corruption involving its formulation and execution. According to CBI and ED, irregularities were committed while modifying the excise policy, and undue favours were extended to licence holders.AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan was also acquitted on Thursday in one case and discharged in another related to his alleged non-compliance with summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate in the Delhi Waqf Board Money laundering case.","A Delhi court on Thursday acquitted former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

'Where Were Your Ancestors?' Gogoi Mocks BJP, Blasts Modi's Nehru Remark During Vande Mataram Debate

On Gaurav Gogoi and national security

Vision for Assam’s growth

Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Thursday that he was a ""victim"" of an alleged rift between Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi during his time in Congress party Speaking to NDTV, Sarma, who spent 22 years in the Congress before joining the BJP , said ""Rahul doesn't want Priyanka in Kerala. I was in Congress for 22 years. I also have some inner information. He doesn't want to disturb KC Venugopal and his axis, and Priyanka is an outsider to that axis. That's why he transferred her to Assam. An MP from Kerala has not been assigned responsibility in Kerala. How else do you interpret this?"" he added.Taking a swipe at the Gandhi family, Biswa called them the ""world's biggest flop family"" and added, ""I think my family is better than theirs. We grew up struggling.""The CM denied any personal rivalry with Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi, saying it was his duty to alert the central government about links to what he called an ""enemy country"". He reiterated accusations against Gogoi and his wife of having connections with the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI.""But when the link is to an enemy country, and I do not forward it to the Government of India, then as a chief minister, I will be doing a disservice to the Constitution and people. Pakistan is an enemy country and a hostile neighbour. Links with Pakistan cannot be compared with a corruption charge,"" Sarma said. Quoting the Hindi spy thriller Dhurandhar, he added, “If you catch a spy, will you not expose him?”Sarma also voiced apprehensions over changing relations with Bangladesh, crediting former PM Sheikh Hasina’s regime for assisting Assam in tackling extremism.He warned that any hostility from Dhaka could allow militants to establish a base across the 800 km border.On economic matters, Sarma outlined his vision to transform Assam beyond hydrocarbon industries, eyeing opportunities in the semiconductor sector. ""India is a diverse country. We must take care of every state. If one part becomes developed only to cater to the global ecosystem, and there's nothing on the other side, then the country will collapse,"" he said. He described Assam as “landlocked and tucked away near the border” but “one of the fastest-growing big states”.Touching upon identity and demographic concerns ahead of state elections, he said, ""In Assam, we need development. For us, national security and the identity of the Assamese people are paramount. The demographic change is a huge concern. We are fighting for both our identity and development.""Sarma also took a dig at West Bengal, claiming Assam remains a relatively peaceful state, “with no fear of stones being thrown.”","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said he was a ""victim"" of an alleged rift between Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi during his time in Congress party. Biswa called the Gandhi family the ""world's biggest flop family"" and added, ""I think my family is better than theirs.

You’re 'not addicted' to screen: What is doomscrolling and why it feels impossible to stop?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/youre-not-addicted-to-screen-what-is-doomscrolling-and-why-it-feels-impossible-to-stop/articleshow/127096913.cms,"Late-night scrolling through distressing news, known as doomscrolling, is a stress response, not a lack of discipline. Our brains, wired for survival, interpret constant negative information as a threat, leading to anxiety and sleep issues. Understanding this helps shift focus from self-blame to managing stress and practicing digital hygiene for peace

The impact of increased usage of social media

You are doomscrolling

News about violence, war, disasters, and crime

Political conflict and outrage

Social media arguments and abuse

Videos that trigger fear, anger, or helplessness

Endless updates that never seem to end

.

The survival instincts

Why it feels compulsive

Why has this become worse recently

.

Why saying 'just stop' doesn't work

The emotional cost

Understanding changes everything

.

Doomscrolling is a signal, not failure

It’s late at night. The house is quiet. You are tired but not sleepy. Your phone is already in your hand. You tell yourself you will just check one thing. One headline. One update.Thirty minutes pass. Then an hour.You feel worse than before. Your chest feels tight. Your mind is racing. You are angry, anxious, or numb. You put the phone down, but sleep still does not come easily.The next morning, you blame yourself.“I need better discipline.”“I should stop this habit.”“I am addicted.”Doomscrolling is the act of repeatedly consuming negative or distressing news online, even when it begins to affect your mood and mental state. It usually happens without planning. You open your phone to check one update, and then keep scrolling through bad news, angry posts, or frightening information long after it stops being useful.It usually includes:People often describe it as “mindless scrolling”. But it is not mindless at all. Your mind is actually very alert. Too alert. Doomscrolling happens when your brain believes there is danger and feels the need to stay informed to survive it.That is not laziness. That is not a lack of control. That is stress.When humans feel unsafe, the brain shifts into survival mode. This is not new. Long before phones existed, our brains were wired to scan the environment for threats, pay more attention to bad news than good, and remember danger more clearly than safety. This is how humans survived for thousands of years. When there was a threat nearby, knowing more meant staying alive.Today, the “threat” is no longer a wild animal or a nearby enemy. It is a constant stream of information telling us the world is unsafe. The brain cannot tell the difference between a real danger in front of you and repeated stories of danger on a screen. So it keeps scanning, keeps scrolling, and keeps looking for answers that never come.According to Medical News Today, a 2023 study found that people who already feel anxious about the future are more likely to engage in doomscrolling. A separate study published in 2024 suggested that the modern news media’s strong focus on negative events may fuel doomscrolling and deepen people’s existential worries.Doomscrolling often happens at night. That is when distractions are gone, the mind finally slows down, unprocessed stress surfaces, and phones become an easy way to avoid sitting with difficult thoughts.The brain chooses: “Let me focus on this external crisis instead of my own anxiety.” But this keeps the nervous system active when it needs rest. That is why sleep feels harder after scrolling, not easier.People often say, “I don’t even enjoy it. I don’t know why I keep scrolling.” That confusion comes from misunderstanding what is happening. Doomscrolling is not about pleasure. It is about control.When things feel uncertain, the brain wants more information to reduce that uncertainty. It believes that if it knows more, it can prepare.But modern news and social media do not offer closure. They offer endless updates. There is no clear ending.No final answer. No moment where the brain feels safe enough to stop.So the scrolling continues.Not because you want to.Because your brain thinks it has to.Doomscrolling existed before smartphones. People always worried about the news. But it became far more intense because of three things:24/7 news cycles: There is no pause anymore. No morning paper, no evening bulletin. Bad news updates arrive at all hours.Social media algorithms:Platforms push content that triggers strong emotions. Fear and anger keep people engaged longer.Global uncertainty: Pandemics, wars, economic stress, climate anxiety, political instability. Many people feel the future is unpredictable.The phenomenon of doomscrolling named one of the Oxford English Dictionary’s words of the year in 2020 became widely recognised during the pandemic, when disrupted daily routines drove people to constantly check updates on Covid 19 cases and deaths.When stress becomes constant, the brain stays in survival mode for longer. Doomscrolling is one result of that.If doomscrolling were just a habit, simple advice would work. “Put your phone away”, “Have self-control"", “Do a digital detox”. But most people have tried these things. They may work for a day. Or a week. Then the scrolling returns.That is because stress responses cannot be switched off with willpower alone. Telling someone under stress to “just stop” is like telling someone anxious to “just calm down”. It sounds logical. It feels dismissive. And it often increases shame. Shame makes stress worse. And stress fuels doomscrolling.According to Psychology Today, young adults often find it especially hard to put their phones down. This is partly because the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps with impulse control and decision-making, is still developing during this stage of life. As a result, breaking cycles like doomscrolling becomes more difficult.Dr. Manoj Kumar Sharma, a clinical psychologist and coordinator of NIMHANS' SHUT Clinic, co-authored studies that observed that during Covid‑19, compulsive “doomsurfing” and “doomscrolling,” driven by cognitive biases and poor mood regulation, led to anxiety, sleep problems, low motivation, and distress, highlighting the need for digital hygiene and offline coping strategies.Doomscrolling slowly changes how you feel about the world and yourself. People report feeling constantly on edge, angry at strangers, emotionally exhausted, hopeless about the future, guilty for not “doing enough” or numb to real joy.This happens because the brain is not designed to process suffering at a global scale every day. Seeing pain without the ability to act creates helplessness. Helplessness is deeply stressful. Over time, the nervous system stays activated even when there is no immediate danger.Doomscrolling is also often a sign of care. This part is important. Many people who doomscroll care deeply. They care about injustice, they care about others. Their scrolling is not apathy. It is concern without an outlet. But caring without boundaries becomes emotional overload. And the brain responds by staying alert instead of resting.Mayo Clinic Press talks about checking your mood while scrolling, setting time limits, and using reminders to manage screen time.When you understand that doomscrolling is a stress response, your relationship with it changes. You stop asking:“What is wrong with me?” And start asking: “What am I reacting to?” This shift matters. Because you cannot heal what you keep blaming.The first step is not cutting down screen time. The first step is recognising stress. Ask yourself: What am I worried about right now? What feels uncertain in my life? What am I trying to prepare for? You may not have clear answers. That is okay. The goal is not solutions. It is awareness. When the brain feels seen, it does not need to shout as loudly.Instead of forcing control, support regulation.Your scrolling is telling you something. It is saying: “I am overwhelmed.” “I am trying to understand.”“I do not feel safe enough to rest.” Listen to that message instead of fighting it.The goal is not to become uninformed. It is to become regulated. You can care without drowning. You can stay aware without staying anxious.If you are doomscrolling, you are not broken. You are responding to a world that feels heavy. Your brain is doing what it was designed to do — protect you. But protection should not come at the cost of peace.Be gentle with yourself. Lower the noise where you can. Rest is not ignorance. It is survival too. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is put the phone down and choose to breathe.","Late-night scrolling through distressing news is a stress response, not a lack of discipline.

Prosperity without responsibility is unsustainable. The RNI seeks to encourage ethical governance, humane development and global stewardship,"" he said.","Singapore ranked first and India 16th in the Responsible Nations' Index (RNI) launched by former president Ram Nath Kovind.

India Pushes Urgent Security Council Reform At UN, Says Status Quo Is Fueling Conflict And Misery

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday and reviewed progress in the India-Brazil strategic partnership, while also underlining the significance of bilateral cooperation for the Global South. Modi also told Lula - who, in the middle of a tariff spat with the US last year, had said that he was going to visit India in early 2026 -- that he was looking forward to welcoming him soon.Lula, who dialled Modi, will visit India from Feb 19 to 21. He is also expected to take part in the AI summit during his visit.In the 45-minute conversation, the leaders pledged to work together for UNSC reforms and reaffirmed their commitment to peace in Gaza and to multilateralism.""Glad to speak with President Lula. We reviewed the strong momentum in the India-Brazil Strategic Partnership, which is poised to scale new heights in the year ahead. Our close cooperation is vital for advancing the shared interests of the Global South. I look forward to welcoming him to India soon,"" said Modi in a post on X.India and Brazil are both founding members of BRICS, and Lula is expected to visit India again later this year for the summit that India will host under its presidency.Like India, Brazil was slapped with 50% tariff by the Trump administration last year after a diplomatic falling-out between the two sides.Both countries have so far not accepted President Donald Trump's invitation to join his Board of Peace for ending the Gaza conflict and ensuring lasting peace.A vocal critic of Trump's tariff policies, Lula accused the US president this week of trying to rule the world through social media.The Brazilian president had called Modi in August last year to discuss ""imposition of unilateral tariffs"" and the need to defend multilateralism.""The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen the India-Brazil Strategic Partnership and take it to even greater heights in the year ahead,"" said the Indian govt in a statement.""Recalling their meetings last year in Brasilia and South Africa, the two leaders noted with satisfaction the significant progress achieved across diverse areas of bilateral cooperation, including trade and investment, technology, defence, energy, health, agriculture and people-to-people ties,"" it added.The leaders also exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest.They also underscored the importance of reformed multilateralism in addressing shared challenges, according to the Indian readout.","PM Narendra Modi spoke to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday.

'They Exist Because Of Pakistan': Canadian Journalist Exposes Brutal Truth About Khalistan Movement

NEW DELHI: Members of terrorist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) trespassed and vandalised Indian embassy in Zagreb and tried to replace the Tricolour with a ""Khalistan flag"", drawing strong condemnation from Indian govt.Govt on Thursday said it had raised the issue with Croatian authorities both here and in the Croatian capital and asked them to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""We condemn the incident of trespassing and vandalism at our embassy in Zagreb, Croatia, by anti-India elements,"" said MEA in a statement, adding under Vienna Convention, diplomatic premises are inviolable and must be protected.It said such actions also speak of the character and motives of those behind them, and law enforcement authorities everywhere would do well to take note of them. ""Accordingly, we have taken up the matter strongly with Croatian authorities, both in New Delhi and in Zagreb, and asked them to hold the perpetrators accountable for their reprehensible and illegal actions,"" said the ministry.Looking to target India ahead of its Republic Day, the separatists tried to take down the Indian flag and replace it with a ""Khalistan flag"". They also raised anti-India slogans. This was one of the few occasions where the separatists targeted an Indian mission outside of the ""five eyes countries"" - US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand - where they are mostly based.India has been looking to ramp up its ties with Croatia, a member of EU, and PM Modi had visited the country last year on his way back to India from G7 summit in Canada.In a statement, SFJ claimed the act was timed to coincide with the lead-up to Republic Day. ""Ahead of EU leaders' participation in Republic Day, Indian Tricolour was removed and destroyed, while Khalistan flag was raised at the Indian embassy in Zagreb, Croatia..."" SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said.Continuing his anti-India rhetoric, Pannun claimed that the act was the first such incident in past 40 years.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday fast-tracked proceedings on the legal dispute over the religious character of the Bhojshala Saraswati Temple cum Maulana Kamal Maula Mosque in Dhar in Madhya Pradesh which has been a bone of contention between the Hindu and Muslim communities, lifting the stay it had ordered on the case pending with MP high court.The court also decoupled it from the larger issue of a challenge to Places of Worship Act. In the meantime, SC allowed Hindu and Muslim communities to perform Basant Panchami and Friday prayers respectively within the compound in separate demarcated areas.As Saraswati Puja will be celebrated on a Friday this year, a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul Pancholi appealed to both communities to show tolerance and mutual respect while holding their prayers and also cooperate with the district administration to maintain law and order in the area.With the Hindu side pleading with the court that they should be allowed to hold puja throughout the day as Saraswati puja is a day-long ritual and the Muslim side saying Juma Namaz can happen only between 12.30 pm and 3.00 pm, the bench decided to allow them to perform their rituals at the same time in the compound but in different corners. The court passed the order after additional solicitor general K M Nataraj, appearing for the state, assured that all necessary arrangements would be put in place to maintain law and order.The bench then asked senior advocate Salman Khurshid, appearing for the Muslim side, to brief the state govt on the number of people who would be offering namaz on Friday so that proper arrangements could be made. The court clarified that the namaz would be allowed between 1pm and 3pm while Basant Panchmi celebrations would be allowed all day.“A fair suggestion was given that in the afternoon, for namaz within 1pm and 3pm, an exclusive and separate area within the same compound, including separate ingress and egress within the same compound, shall be made available so that namaz can be performed. Similarly, a separate space shall be made available to the Hindu community to hold traditional ceremonies on the occasion of Basant Panchami... Administration may, with a view to ensure the maintenance of law and order, issue passes for the visitors or may adopt any other fair means to ensure that no untoward incident happens,” the bench said. “We appeal to both sides to observe mutual respect and trust towards each other.”The 11th century monument is at the centre of a dispute between Hindus and Muslims. Hindus believe it is a temple of goddess Vagdevi, an incarnation of goddess Saraswati, while the Muslim community calls it the Kamal Maula mosque.Advocates Vishnu Jain and Ashwini Upadhyay, appearing for Hindu side, pleaded with the court to expedite the hearing in Madhya Pradesh high court where the case arising from the dispute over religious character of Bhojshala Saraswati Temple cum Maulana Kamal Maula Mosque, has been pending. They told the court that proceedings in the case were not moving forward because of the apex court’s stay order even though the Archaeological Society of India (ASI) had filed its report in a sealed envelope.The bench thereafter asked the HC that the case be taken up by a division bench preferably headed by the Chief Justice or senior most judge and by opening the sealed envelope. It directed that the report be unsealed in open court and a copy to it be given to both sides. “Till the writ is finally decided, the parties shall maintain the status quo at the site,” the court said.","The 11th century monument is at the centre of a dispute between Hindus and Muslims.

Owaisi Calls SIR a ‘Backdoor NRC’ in Lok Sabha, Warns of Selective Religious Disenfranchisement

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday pointed out to Election Commission that its SIR order did not clearly state that the exercise was also about illegal immigration, an assertion that was accepted by EC's counsel, who said there was no express mention of the same in the order.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the SIR order did not state categorically that verification of citizenship was one of the reasons for conducting the exercise. Responding to the court's query, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said, ""It is not mentioned expressly.""Continuing with his submission, Dwivedi said that EC's special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls was a fair, just and transparent exercise. The drive cannot be said to be manifestly arbitrary, he held and questioned the motive of petitioners who had moved the apex court against the commission.""None of the 66 lakh persons whose names were deleted in Bihar SIR came to this court or high court or filed pleas with Election Commission. A roving and fishing inquiry cannot be permitted at the instance of ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms) and PUCL (People's Union for Civil Liberties) and a few parliamentarians,"" the senior advocate said.American notions of ""due process"" could not be imported into Indian constitutional law as contended by the petitioners, he said, adding that the US itself was not following due process.""US court judgments have been cited... Where is the US following due procedure of law? President (Donald) Trump can just pick up the president of Venezuela for trial. Where is the due process, and now he wants Greenland also. Here, the petitioners want to import that,"" he said.Emphasising transparency, Dwivedi said booth level agents conducted house-to-ho-use verification, over 5 crore SMS alerts were sent to voters and the process strictly followed procedural safeguards.On Wednesday, the bench had said EC could not have ""untrammelled"" power to conduct SIR of electoral rolls and the exercise must be subject to guidelines and procedures, including transparency and principles of natural justice.Pointing out that revision of electoral rolls could have serious civil consequences for individuals whose names were not included in the voters list, the CJI said, ""If something affects the civil rights of people, why should the process followed not be in accordance with sub-section (2)?"" The CJI was referring to Section 21 of the 1950 Act that governs preparation and revision of electoral rolls.",Supreme Court points out to Election Commission that its SIR order did not clearly state that the exercise was also about illegal immigration. EC's counsel said there was no express mention of the same in the order.

JAMMU: An intense gun battle broke out Thursday between security forces and holed-up terrorists in the dense forests of Singhpora in Chatroo belt, in the upper reaches of J&K’s Kishtwar district, even as searches continued on the fifth day of Operation Trashi-I.After a three-day lull, fresh contact was established with terrorists — believed to be three to four in number — on the run since Sunday’s encounter in Sonnar village near the LoC, in which a soldier was killed and seven more were injured. Heavy fire was exchanged between both sides before the ultras managed to escape further into the woods, officials said.Meanwhile, a cordon-and-search operation was launched in the border area of Akhnoor in Jammu district on Thursday morning, following the alleged sighting of terror suspects in Sumah locality the night before.Earlier on Wednesday, searches under Operation Trashi-I were intensified in Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora, and adjoining areas in Chatroo, even as additional forces were rushed to the operation site to fortify the cordon and block possible escape routes. Amid increased vigil ahead of Republic Day, joint teams of security forces conducted door-to-door searches in localities with a high concentration of Burmese (Rohingyas) and Bangladesh nationals in Bhatindi-Narwal-Rajiv Nagar areas on the outskirts of Jammu, as well as in Rajouri, Poonch, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Doda districts as a precautionary measure.On Tuesday, the cordon was strengthened with the help of aerial surveillance and sniffer dogs, following which, the troops busted a well-concealed terrorist hideout and recovered large quantities of rations, utensils, and consumables. Three-four locals from Sonnar village were detained for questioning, as officials suspected that running such a setup would not have been possible without local help from overground workers.Army Special Forces Commando, Havildar Gajendra Singh, who succumbed Monday, was the first security personnel to die in a counter-terrorism operation in the Union Territory in 2026. Operation Trashi-I is the third this year in Jammu division, following clashes earlier this month in Kahog and Najote forests of Billawar in Kathua, south of Pir Panjal range.Kishtwar, a remote district east of the Chenab and south of Kashmir Valley, saw intensified counter-terrorism efforts in 2025 as forces tracked Pakistan-based terrorists through steep terrain and thick forests. At least six gun battles were reported there over seven months. On May 22, an Army trooper was killed and two others wounded in Chatroo. Weeks earlier, three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were shot dead in the same area.Security officials said Kishtwar sits astride a traditional infiltration corridor, with terrorists crossing from Pakistan via Kathua and moving through Udhampur and Doda before heading towards Kashmir valley, using forest cover to evade detection.",Heavy fire was exchanged between both sides before the ultras managed to escape further into the woods.

14 Naxals Neutralized In Sukma And Bijapur As Security Forces Launch Anti-Maoist Operation

NEW DELHI: 16 Maoists were killed in a major gunfight with security forces during Operation Megaburu in Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum district. Top CPI (Maoist) leader Patiram Manjhi alias Anal Da, carrying a cumulative bounty of over Rs 2.35 crore, was among those killed.The encounter took place during a joint operation by the CRPF and Jharkhand Police in the Saranda forest area, one of the last Maoist strongholds in the state. Among those killed were five women and several senior leaders of the banned outfit.Giving details, union home minister Amit Shah said that the operation marked a significant breakthrough in the Centre’s push to eliminate Left-wing extremism.In a post on X, he wrote: “Today, in West Singhbhum, the ongoing joint operation by CRPF and Jharkhand Police has achieved a major success in the campaign to make the region free of Naxals, with the neutralisation of the notorious bounty-wanted Naxal Central Committee member ‘Anal alias Patiram Manjhi’… and 15 other Naxals so far.”Anal Da was carrying a total bounty of Rs 2.35 crore: Rs 1 crore announced by Jharkhand, Rs 1.2 crore by Odisha and Rs 15 lakh by the NIA.A resident of Giridih district, he had been active since 1987 and was involved in several high-profile attacks. This includes the 2006 assault on a CISF camp in Bokaro that killed five personnel, the killing of five security personnel in Seraikela-Kharswan in 2019 and the theft of five tonnes of explosives in Odisha in May 2025.Shah reiterated the government’s resolve to end Naxalism by March 31 this year and appealed to remaining Maoists to surrender.“We are committed to eradicating Naxalism, which has been synonymous with fear and terror for decades. I once again appeal to the remaining Naxals to abandon the ideology that connects to violence, terror, and arms, and join the mainstream of development and trust,” he said.Officials said around 1,500 personnel of the CRPF’s elite CoBRA unit were involved in the operation, codenamed Operation Megaburu, in the Kumdi area under Kiriburu police station limits. The exchange of fire began on Thursday morning following specific intelligence inputs about the presence of Anal Da and his squad.CRPF Inspector General Saket Kumar Singh said bodies of the Maoists had been recovered from the encounter site.“We have recovered the bodies of Maoists, including their top leader Patiram Manjhi alias Anal Da carrying a bounty of Rs 2.35 crore on his head. Eleven bodies have been identified and identification of the remaining four Maoists is underway,” he said. Singh added that this was the highest number of Maoist bodies recovered in a single encounter in Jharkhand.Singh also said that barring Misir Besra, all central committee members of CPI (Maoist) in Jharkhand have now been eliminated. “Only around 60–65 Maoists are left in the state, mostly confined to Singhbhum. The last round of battle is going on and we will end this soon,” he said, urging remaining cadres to surrender or face consequences.Another senior Maoist killed was Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee member Anmol alias Sushant, who was wanted in 149 cases and carried a Rs 90 lakh reward.Other slain cadres included regional committee member Amit Munda, sub-zonal committee members Pintu Lohar and Laljeet alias Lalu and several area committee members.Inspector General of Police (Operations) Michael Raj S said five of the Maoists killed were women. Senior CRPF officials, including Director General Gyanendra Pratap Singh, had reviewed the situation in Chaibasa earlier this week.Reacting to the development, BJP leader and Jharkhand opposition leader Babulal Marandi termed it a major success against “red terror.”In a post on X, he said, “All the personnel involved in this operation have demonstrated indomitable courage, valor, and dedication to duty… the Central Government is steadfastly moving forward with the resolve to eradicate Naxalism from its roots by March 2026.”According to official data, between 2001 and 2025, more than 11,000 Maoists have been arrested, around 250 killed and over 350 surrendered before security forces across Jharkhand.","Top CPI (Maoist) leader Patiram Manjhi alias Anal Da, carrying a cumulative bounty of over Rs 2.35 crore, was among those killed.

India’s hi-voltage transmission network crosses 5 lakh ckm mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-hi-voltage-transmission-network-crosses-5-lakh-ckm-mark/articleshow/127177524.cms,"Yogi's Davos Push: Uttar Pradesh Signs Landmark MoU For One Gigawatt Green AI Hub In Greater Noida

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over inadequacy of the grid to evacuate power from renewable energy projects, the govt on Thursday said that India’s high-voltage (220 kV and above) power transmission network had crossed the 5 lakh circuit kilometre (ckm) mark with the addition of 628 ckm in Rajasthan earlier this month.With India targeting 500 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030, strengthening the high-voltage inter- and intra-state transmission network is crucial for evacuating green energy and ensuring grid stability. Sources said the govt has planned to expand the high-voltage transmission network to 6.5 lakh ckm by 2032. It has added 2.1 lakh ckm since April 2014. However, it failed to achieve the annual target in the 2024–25 financial year and the figure has been considerably short of target in the ongoing fiscal as well.Officials said that in FY25, only 8,830 ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned, as against a target of 15,253 ckm, reflecting a 42% shortfall, while 6,961 ckm have been added till Dec, as against a target of 15,382 ckm for FY26.According to officials, the world’s largest synchronous national grid crossed the 5 lakh ckm milestone on Jan 14 with the commissioning of a 765-kV transmission line for evacuation of 1,100 MW of green energy from Bhadla, Ramgarh and Fatehgarh solar power complex in the Rajasthan renewable energy zone.The ministry of power, in a statement, said that 40,000 ckm of transmission network is currently being built under inter-state transmission projects, while 27,500 ckm of intra-state transmission projects are under implementation. These are expected to enhance grid reliability and power evacuation capability. While transformation capacity has increased to 1,407 gigavolt ampere (GVA), officials said it is expected to reach 2,345 GVA by 2032.A senior power department official said further strengthening of the transmission network is among the key issues being discussed at a two-day ‘chintan shivir’, a brainstorming session of ministers and senior officials from the Union ministry and state power departments and related public sector undertakings, which began on Thursday at Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh. Officials said the financial health of power discoms, the final draft of the Electricity Amendment Bill, installation of smart meters, challenges in the generation sector, energy goals and security and new technologies will also be discussed at the Shivir.Nearly 65 state-run and private power distribution companies posted a combined PAT (profit after tax) of ₹2,700 crore in FY25. However, officials said that ₹6.9 lakh crore of accumulated losses and nearly ₹7.2 lakh crore of outstanding debt remain a major cause for concern and will come up for discussion, along with high cross-subsidies, the need for cost-reflective tariffs and improvements in billing and recovery efficiency.Ministers and officials are also likely to discuss comments received from various stakeholders on the draft Electricity Amendment Bill, which is expected to be tabled in Parliament during the upcoming Budget session.","India’s high-voltage (220 kV and above) power transmission network had crossed the 5 lakh circuit kilometre (ckm) mark with the addition of 628 ckm in Rajasthan earlier this month.

“I Too Want to Help Develop an India Where We Listen…” Rahul Gandhi During Student Interaction

New Delhi: Recalling how the “united resistance” mounted by farmer led protests forced the Central govt to roll back the three farm laws, leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday called out to MGNREGA workers to take the path shown by the farmers by putting up a united fight to demand the withdrawal of the new law - Viksit Bharat - Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act.Referring to the BJP and the Central govt, Gandhi said, “Here is the only way to stop them, workers have been shown the way by farmers. I know these people, they are cowards. If we all stand together, they will be forced to restore MGNREGA,” he said, citing the example of farm laws. He was speaking at the 'MGNREGA workers convention' organised by the opposition party at Jawahar Bhawan in Delhi that brought together workers and activists from various states.Gandhi alleged the idea of BJP behind the new law that replaced MGNREGA was to dismantle “the “guaranteed right to work and right to demand work” and enable “centralisation” where the “Central government will decide where the money will be allocated, and naturally, the BJP-ruled states will get more and the Opposition-ruled states less”.“These people want to take India back to pre-independence days where one King used to decide everything,” he alleged.At the meet, Gandhi along with Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and other senior leaders stood in solidarity with workers who shared their concerns and fears about the new law and raised slogans. Adorning the traditional labourer's 'gamchha' on their head and holding spades on their shoulders, Kharge and Gandhi also posed with workers who in a symbolic gesture brought soil from their respective MGNREGA worksites and added it to tree saplings in what was seen to convey a message of unity and collective struggle.The Congress plans to build on the message by reaching out to gram sabhas and hold larger outreach programmes under its ongoing ‘MGNREGA Bachao Sangram”.Kharge alleged that the dismantling of MGNREGA by the Modi govt was part of a “conspiracy to erase Mahatma Gandhi’s name from public memory”and an attempt to turn the oppressed and downtrodden people of the country into “bonded labourers”. He said the party will raise the issue during the upcoming Budget session of Parliament.Gandhi claimed that scrapping of MGNREGA amounted to an attack on the Constitution, the same way the Modi govt had attacked it by bringing in “three black farm laws, demonetisation and the flawed implementation of the GST” and this new law now. “What is the name of this new law ....I don't know,"" Gandhi said. In response some in the audience spoke out saying “VB-G RAM G”.",Gandhi was speaking at the 'MGNREGA workers convention' organised by the opposition party at Jawahar Bhawan in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Thursday defended its decision to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the Supreme Court and asked it to dismiss petitions challenging the process in Bihar.Appearing for the poll panel, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told the bench of chief justice Surya Kant and justice Joymalya Bagchithat that the exercise was “fair, just and reasonable”, and a “roving and fishing enquiry” into the revision could not be allowed at the instance of a few NGOs and politicians.“None of the 66 lakh persons, whose names were deleted in Bihar SIR, came to this court or high court or filed pleas with the Election Commission,” the poll panel argued.The commission said it invoked its powers under Section 21(3) of the 1950 Act, the manner of conducting a special revision was left to its discretion. “There is no compulsion under Section 21(3) that every SIR must be identical in nature,” it said, adding that the provision operates independently of routine revisions under Section 21(2).EC further said that Bihar had not seen an SIR for nearly 20 years and the exercise was needed due to changing demographics, including urbanisation and population movement.The chief justice, however, observed that if the Election Commission’s claim of unfettered discretion under Section 21(3) was accepted, “the case would end there”.EC also relied on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, saying it introduced stricter requirements to establish citizenship.Justice Bagchi questioned whether the amended citizenship law was the trigger for the present SIR, pointing out that the Election Commission’s order did not refer to cross-border or illegal migration. “The word ‘migration’ ordinarily refers to lawful movement. Inter-state migration is a constitutional right,” the judge said.EC replied that the amendment had not been operationalised earlier and that the current SIR offered a chance to account for the changed legal framework.",Election Commission on Thursday defended its decision to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the Supreme Court.

‘Protecting Rohingyas And Bangladeshis’: BJP MP Sambit Patra Slams Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday directed to register an FIR against Trinamool Congress MLA Monirul Islam for alleged vandalism at the Farakka Block Development Office (BDO) in West Bengal last week.The poll body asked the district administration to file the FIR by 5 pm, after observing that an earlier case did not name the MLA.A senior Election Commission official said Islam, accompanied by supporters, had staged a protest outside the Farakka BDO office against alleged “harassment of the public” during the SIR exercise, following which the office was vandalised.The Commission took cognisance of the incident and spoke to West Bengal Director General of Police Rajeev Kumar, directing that an FIR be lodged.While an FIR was initially registered, it did not name the local MLA as an accused, prompting the EC to order a fresh FIR specifically naming Islam, as reported by news agency PTI.According to the official, the unrest was triggered by protests from a section of Booth Level Officers (BLOs), who alleged that citizens were being harassed during the SIR process.The situation escalated when protesters led by the MLA marched to the BDO office, raising slogans against the exercise and the protest allegedly turned violent.The incident dates back to June 14, when the Farakka BDO office in Murshidabad district was allegedly raided during an ongoing SIR hearing.A written complaint filed by BDO Junaid Ahamed stated that around 1.30 pm, a group of unidentified individuals stormed multiple official rooms and vandalised government property in the presence of BLOs, the Joint BDO, the OC Election and other Assistant Electoral Registration Officers (AEROs). During the chaos, one AERO reportedly sustained injuries while trying to protect himself.A case was registered at the Farakka police station under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act and two arrests were made.The incident also triggered sharp political reactions. BJP MLA Gouri Sankar accused TMC MLA Monirul Islam of leading the vandalism and targeted chief minister Mamata Banerjee over the violence.Speaking to ANI, Sankar said, “Today, Farakka MLA Manirul Islam vandalised the block office. How can a public representative vandalise property? Who gave him the right to do so? Are they not Indian citizens, or are they Bangladeshis who think they can vandalise a block office in India?”He added, “The public is ready to give them a befitting reply. In the 2026 elections, whether it’s Manirul or someone else, they will get their answer from the public.”The BJP further alleged that the violence was politically instigated. “Mamata Banerjee is instigating her party cadres across the state to riot, commit violence, and destroy property. All these actions are carried out under Mamata Banerjee’s instructions,” the party said, alleging that corruption and destruction in the state occurred under the chief minister’s watch.","Election Commission directed to register an FIR against Trinamool Congress MLA Monirul Islam.

Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

Is Bihar really a win for women?

14% represent the 50%

The fight for a seat in the Parliament...goes on and on and on

Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam

Like 'Pradhaan-patis', will reservation Act lead to 'MP-patis'?

Around the world, story not very rosy

Women in Politics: 2025

Are men still writing laws?

The Bihar Assembly elections were widely celebrated as a democratic milestone. With an overall voter turnout of 66.91%, the highest since 1951, and women turning out in unprecedented numbers, the state appeared to signal a quiet transformation.Female voter turnout stood at an impressive 71.6%, far surpassing male turnout at 62.8%. On the surface, this looked like a clear victory for women’s political participation. But a closer look at who actually wields power in Bihar raises uncomfortable questions about whether this enthusiasm translated into real political gains.Despite women driving the electoral surge, representation in the Assembly remains limited. Of the 243 elected MLAs, only 29 are women, just under 12%. This mirrors a long-standing pattern: women show up decisively at the ballot box but struggle to cross the gatekeeping barriers of party nominations and electoral success.The picture becomes even starker in the executive. The Nitish Kumar cabinet has only three women ministers out of 27, amounting to just 11%. In effect, women voters powered a historic election, but men continue to dominate the institutions that shape policy and governance.The candidate landscape explains part of this imbalance. According to ADR data, only 254 women, around 10% of all candidates, contested the 2025 Bihar elections, compared to 2,344 men. This figure has barely changed from the 2020 elections, where women also made up just 10% of candidates. Structural exclusion at the nomination stage ensures that even high voter turnout cannot significantly alter outcomes. Representation of the third gender remains almost nonexistent, with only two candidates contesting.""Once the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam is implemented, parties will have to give tickets to women. That is how women’s representation has increased in other countries,"" said Zoya Hasan, Professor Emerita, Jawaharlal Nehru University.Equally troubling is the quality of political choices on offer. Ninety-four candidates declared cases related to crimes against women, including five accused of rape. That such candidates continue to secure tickets highlights the disconnect between women’s electoral participation and the political system’s responsiveness to women’s safety and dignity.The parliamentary numbers reveal the scale of democratic under-representation women continue to face. While women constitute nearly half the population, they occupy only about 14% of seats in the Lok Sabha. The journey has been one of slow and incremental change. In 1957, women made up just 3% of candidates contesting general elections; by 2024, that figure had risen to 10%. Electoral success has improved, but modestly. From 22 women in the First Lok Sabha and 27 in the Second, the number increased to 78 in the 17th Lok Sabha and stands at 75 in the 18th—still a fraction of proportional representation.The Rajya Sabha shows a similar pattern. Women members increased from 15 in 1952 to 42 today, accounting for around 17% of the Upper House. These gains, while notable, underline how access to Parliament remains structurally limited for women, especially when compared to their electoral participation and demographic weight.In 2023, India took a significant legislative step toward addressing gender imbalance in politics with the passage of the Constitution (One Hundred and Sixth Amendment) Act, popularly known as the. The law mandates the rotational reservation of one-third of seats for women in the Lok Sabha and all State Legislative Assemblies, including that of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Framed as a historic corrective to decades of underrepresentation, the amendment seeks to institutionalise women’s presence in legislative decision-making across the federal structure.However, the reform’s impact remains deferred. The legislation is scheduled to come into force only after the publication of the next national census, the timing of which is yet to be announced. Once implemented, the reservation will remain in effect for 15 years. Notably, the amendment excludes the Rajya Sabha, India’s upper house of Parliament, where women currently account for just 13% of members, underscoring the partial nature of the intervention.At the time the bill was passed, women constituted around 14% of the Lok Sabha, the highest proportion since Independence but still well below global benchmarks. According to a United Nations report, the global average for women’s representation in national parliaments stood at 26.5%, while Central and Southern Asia averaged 19%, highlighting India’s lag despite incremental gains.""Panchayats operate at a different level of governance altogether; the logic that has enabled proxy representation or Pradhan-Patis there cannot be transposed to higher legislatures,"" Hasan said.Hasan further noted that the ""political arena"" in which the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha function is ""fundamentally different, leaving little scope for phenomena such as 'MP-patis.'""India has about 14.5 lakh elected women representatives in Panchayati Raj Institutions, forming nearly 46% of all local representatives, an achievement unmatched globally. Twenty-one states have gone further, reserving 50% of PRI seats for women, exceeding the constitutional minimum of 33%. Yet this grassroots success has not translated upward, reinforcing a paradox at the heart of Indian democracy: women lead locally but remain marginal nationally.Recent global assessments suggest that progress has not only stalled but slightly reversed. The Global Gender Gap Report 2025 ranks India 131st, with an overall gender parity score of 64.4%, a drop of three places from the previous year. Political empowerment remains a key area of concern.Female representation in Parliament declined from 14.7% to 13.8% in 2025, while the share of women in ministerial positions fell from 6.5% to 5.6%—continuing a downward trend from the 2019 peak. Against this backdrop, the women’s reservation law represents both a long-awaited promise and a test of political will, with its eventual implementation likely to shape India’s gender parity trajectory in the years ahead.Despite decades of advocacy and incremental reform, women remain significantly underrepresented in political power structures across the world.Themap, released by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and UN Women, offers a snapshot of the global gender gap in political leadership as of January 1, 2025, underscoring how male dominance in decision-making continues to slow progress toward political equality.According to the data, women serve as heads of state or government in just 25 countries, reflecting the narrow reach of female leadership at the highest executive levels. In national legislatures, women account for 27.2 per cent of MPs worldwide—an improvement over previous decades, but still far from parity. The imbalance is even more pronounced within executive branches: globally, fewer than one in four cabinet ministers are women, with women holding only 22.9% of such positions.The distribution of power within cabinets further highlights structural inequities. While women are more likely to be assigned portfolios related to human rights, gender equality, and social protection, men overwhelmingly control ministries that shape national security and economic direction, including foreign affairs, finance, home affairs, and defence. This gendered division of political labour reinforces longstanding hierarchies, limiting women’s influence over core policy domains.Findings from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and UN Women, released in early 2025, showed that men continued to dominate political leadership worldwide, despite three decades having passed since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action laid out a global roadmap for women’s rights.At the start of 2025, men outnumbered women by more than three to one across executive and legislative positions. Women’s representation in national parliaments had inched up only marginally, reaching just over a quarter of all lawmakers globally. In contrast, women’s presence in government roles moved in the opposite direction, reflecting how gains in legislatures have not consistently translated into executive power.Female political leadership at the highest level remained the exception rather than the norm. Only a small number of countries were led by women, with Europe accounting for the largest share. While 2024 marked several historic firsts, more than half the world’s countries had still never had a woman head of state or government.Hasan pointed out that one of the reasons behind rise in female representation in politics in Europe and the States, has been their increased representation in decision-making roles within political parties.""In Europe and the United States, efforts to increase women’s representation in legislatures have followed a two-pronged approach. One strategy has focused on enhancing women’s presence in decision-making roles within political parties, which in turn has contributed to a rise in the number of women parliamentarians,"" the JNU professor noted.Cabinet-level representation offered a similarly mixed picture. Fewer than one in four cabinet ministers globally were women, and the number of countries with gender-equal cabinets had declined compared to the previous year. Regional disparities were stark, with Europe and the Americas showing higher levels of representation, while large parts of Asia, Central Asia and the Pacific continued to record very low participation by women in executive leadership.","The Bihar Assembly elections were widely celebrated as a democratic milestone. Despite women driving the electoral surge, representation in the Assembly remains limited. The Nitish Kumar cabinet has only three women ministers out of 27, amounting to just 11%. In effect, women voters powered a historic election, but men continue to dominate the institutions that shape policy and governance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127149019,imgsize-1267402,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

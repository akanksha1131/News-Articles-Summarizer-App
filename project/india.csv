NEW DELHI: Calling the imposition of Emergency on India ""the darkest chapters in India’s history,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the values enshrined in the Constitution were set aside, and several people were jailed at that time; it was as if the Congress at that time placed democracy under arrest.On the completion of 50 years of the Emergency, which was imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on June 25, 1975, PM Modi said no one can ever forget the manner in which the spirit of the Constitution was violated and the 42nd Amendment is a prime example of Congress's shenanigans.""Today marks fifty years since one of the darkest chapters in India’s democratic history, the imposition of the Emergency. The people of India mark this day as Samvidhan Hatya Diwas. On this day, the values enshrined in the Indian Constitution were set aside, fundamental rights were suspended, press freedom was extinguished and several political leaders, social workers, students and ordinary citizens were jailed. It was as if the Congress Government in power at that time placed democracy under arrest!"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""We salute every person who stood firm in the fight against the Emergency! These were the people from all over India, from all walks of life, from diverse ideologies who worked closely with each other with one aim: to protect India’s democratic fabric and to preserve the ideals for which our freedom fighters devoted their lives.It was their collective struggle that ensured that the then Congress Government had to restore democracy and call for fresh elections, which they badly lost,"" he also added.He also reiterated the commitment to strengthen the principles of the Constitution and working together for the vision of a Viksit Bharat. ""May we scale new heights of progress and fulfil the dreams of the poor and downtrodden,"" he said.On the 50 years of Emergency, BlueKraft presented a new book: The Emergency Diaries - Years that Forged a Leader. According to the BlueKraft, the book delves into the compelling role that PM Modi, then a young RSS Pracharak, played in the fight against Emergency.""This book is a tribute to the grit and resolve of those who refused to be silenced, and it offers a rare glimpse into the early trials that forged one of the most transformative leaders of our time,"" BlueKraft said.Talking about the ‘The Emergency Diaries,’ PM Modi said that it has the compilation of his journey during the Emergency years. The Prime Minister also said that he called upon all those who remember those dark days of the Emergency or those whose families suffered during that time to share their experiences on social media. It will create awareness among the youth of the shameful time from 1975 to 1977.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said that Fifty years ago, a nefarious attempt was made to strangle Indian democracy through the imposition of Emergency.""By sidelining the Constitution, the manner in which the Emergency was imposed on the country is a glaring example of the misuse of power and dictatorship. All opposition leaders were thrown into jail. There was no constitutional institution left that was not misused. Yet, the democratic traditions of this country could not be erased by the then government, no matter how much they tried,"" Rajnath Singh said in a post on X.""Today, democracy is alive in India, and for this, those who struggled during the Emergency, endured imprisonment, and suffered hardships have made an immense contribution. The future generations of India can never forget their contribution.Prime Minister Shri Modiji has decided to observe June 25 as ‘Constitution Assassination Day’ so that every citizen remembers how dictatorship attempts to murder democracy,"" he added.Union health minister JP Nadda als criticised the Congress governmnet and said that imposition of Emergency on India murdered the Constitution. and claimed that the oldest party continues to operate with the same mindset.""India is the world’s oldest and largest democratic country. Yet, there have been instances where attempts were made to tamper with the very soul of the Constitution. The nation remembers such moments as dark chapters in the history of its democracy. On this very day, 50 years ago, the then Congress Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, declared a state of Emergency — an act that was not merely a political development, but a direct assault on democracy, a brutal blow to its foundation,"" he said in a video.""At midnight on June 25, 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency on India under the pretext of internal disturbance, effectively murdering the Constitution. Even 50 years later, the Congress party continues to operate with the same mindset. Its intent remains dictatorial to this day,"" he added.The Union health minister said during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had barred its leaders from appearing in programmes of some journalists.If in power it files cases against journalists and boycotts them when in opposition, he added.Recalling the jailing of opposition leaders, including from the Jana Sangh, the forerunner to the BJP, during the period, Nadda noted that Modi as an RSS functionary had then defied the government and spread awareness among people about the excesses of the Congress.Nadda also urged people to read the book, 'The Emergency Diaries - Years that Forged a Leader, which highlights Modi's role in fighting the Emergency.External affairs minister S Jaishankar recalled a painful chapter of independent India’s history, when institutions were undermined, rights were suspended and accountability was set aside.""It also remains a powerful reminder of our collective duty to safeguard constitutional values and uphold the resilience of Indian democracy,"" he added in a post on X.The Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar stated on Tuesday that the Emergency period, which lasted nearly two years, represented the bleakest chapter in India's history. Its severity has led to the day of its proclamation being commemorated as 'Samvidhan Hatya Diwas'.Speaking as the principal guest at the foundation day event of L N Mishra College of Management in Muzaffarpur, North Bihar, he shared his thoughts on this significant historical event.""The date June 25, falling tomorrow, was a black day (kaala diwas) 50 years ago. Democratic values had been trampled upon under the dark shadow of the Emergency... It has been decided to observe June 25 as 'Samvidhan Hatya Diwas' (the day on which democracy was murdered). Boys and girls, that is an occasion for you to know about the barbarity committed during Emergency, the darkest period of Indian history,"" he said.The Vice President acknowledged Bihar's crucial role, noting that the transformative movement originated here through Jay Prakash Narayan's call for 'Sampoorn Kranti'. He expressed his pleasure at visiting this historically significant region.Union home minister Amit Shah criticised the Congress government on Tuesday for the imposition of the Emergency and said, “We overcame a dark chapter like the Emergency because our nation never bows down to dictatorship"". He was addressing a gathering at an event marking the 50 years of the Emergency at the Pradhanmantri Sanghralaya.""Today is the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Emergency... There may arise a question why something that happened 50 years ago is being discussed now... When 50 years of any national event are completed, good or bad, its memory fades away in society. If the memory of an event like the Emergency that shook the democracy fades away, then that is harmful to the nation,"" said the union home minister.Amit Shah said that the Modi government has decided to observe June 25 as ‘Samvidhan Hatya Diwas’ annually so that the ""country remembers how a nation suffers when its leaders turn into dictators"". He said that the Samvidhan Hatya Diwas should be observed so that the youth remembers how the “constitution was once silenced”.","On June 25, 1975, Indira Gandhi declared a state of Emergency in India.

MUMBAI: At least 11 persons, including six cabin crew members, felt dizzy and nauseated on an Air India flight from London to Mumbai on Monday, said sources. Air India confirmed the incident but said only five passengers and two crew members took ill.The flight AI-130 was operated with a Boeing 777 aircraft. The aircraft that's under increased scrutiny following the Ahmedabad accident is Boeing 787 Dreamliner.The cause for the illness is under probe. Poor oxygen supply, which can lead to hypoxia, can cause nausea and dizziness on flights, as can food poisoning.""On board flight AI-130 from London Heathrow to Mumbai, five passengers and two crew reported feeling dizzy and nauseous during different phases of the flight,"" said Air India in a statement. ""The flight landed safely in Mumbai where our medical teams were ready to provide immediate medical assistance. After landing, two passengers and two cabin crew, who continued to feel unwell, were taken to the medical room for further examination and were later discharged. We are investigating the incident and have duly notified the regulator.""A source said a cabin depressurisation problem could cause lower levels of oxygen in the passenger cabin, but then oxygen masks drop from the overhead panel, which didn't happen during this flight.""So, drop in cabin pressurisation is not likely to be the cause."" Food poisoning appears to be the more likely cause, said the source.The pilots of the flight were not affected. ""Pilots get their meal after the passengers have been served.

INDORE: New CCTV footage that surfaced on Saturday in Raja Raghuvanshi murder case shows prime accused Raj Kushwaha holding a white shroud and a floral garland while standing outside the victim's residence on the day of his funeral.The footage, captured on June 4 when Raja's body was brought to his Indore home, shows Raj not only participating in the rituals but also consoling Sonam Raghuwanshi's father, Devi Singh. Raj is seen placing his hand on Devi Singh's shoulder and remaining close to him throughout the mourning.While pictures of Raj consoling Sonam's father had gone viral on social media earlier, this footage has raised suspicion as it shows him making repeated phone calls during the funeral. Investigators suspect he may have been relaying real-time updates from the house, possibly to Sonam.Officials are now trying to determine whom Raj was communicating with during the funeral and whether the calls were connected to a larger conspiracy behind Raja's murder.

Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini.

Poll Do you think the extension of the deadline for opting into the Unified Pension Scheme is beneficial for employees? Yes, it provides more clarity. No, it delays the decision.

NEW DELHI: After a campaign for assured pension, there is only a small proportion of central govt employees who have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme , offering assured 50 per cent pension, with several seeking further clarifications to exercise the one-time option.As a result, govt has extended the June-end deadline by three months. Employees want to be absolutely sure about the terms of the agreement before deciding to switch to UPS.A concern for employees who joined national pension system from 2004 is the lack of clarity on death benefits. While an assurance was given last week, there are still a few issues that are to be resolved.Under the UPS, while an employee will contribute 10 per cent of his or her salary towards pension, a matching contribution will be made by the Centre, which was 14 per cent under NPS. Under the new scheme, apart from the 10 per cent pension payment, another 8.5 per cent contribution is to be made by the Centre which will not reflect in the balance of the subscriber’s account. While most employees understand the change, there are some who believe that the payout may be lower.Further, some of the all India service officers want to know about the difference in contribution between the Centre and states, which don’t have a scheme yet.An IAS, IPS or Indian Forest Service officer spends time in the state with some of them also opting for central deputation. While the rules are quite clear, some of the officers have raised doubts.Meanwhile, fund managers, who have been asked to conduct outreach programmes, are smelling a rat and allege that some private players are sowing doubts as they stand to lose out on the annuity business under UPS.Employees now have time to exercise the switching option up to the end of September. The option can be exercised by 23 lakh government employees.",Only a small proportion of central govt employees have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme.

Poll Do you believe that language should be a criterion for labeling individuals as illegal immigrants? Yes, it should be considered. No, it should not be considered.

Centre steps up crackdown on illegal Bangladeshis

Centre vs state over illegal Bangladeshis

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged on Tuesday that Bengali migrant workers speaking their native language outside the state were being ""labelled as Bangladeshis and sent to Bangladesh"".Accusing the BJP of ""playing politics over language"", the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief said many such cases come to her notice and that her government has brought the workers sent to Bangladesh back.""People from every section live in our country. This is India’s secular tradition... but the BJP is doing politics based on language... The migrant workers from Bengal are taken to other states for work because of their skills, but when they speak in the Bengali language among themselves, they are labelled as Bangladeshis and sent to Bangladesh. Many such cases have come to us, and we have brought them back (from Bangladesh),"" the West Bengal CM was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.She futher said: ""Another such case has come from Rajasthan, where 300 to 400 people have been labelled as Bangladeshis. What is happening? They are not Bangladeshis, they have their own identity, they are residents of West Bengal, and West Bengal is a state of India.""Last month, as many as 121 suspected Bangladeshi nationals were apprehended in a week and sent to a detention centre in a fresh, widespread crackdown to curb illegal immigration.The 121 had allegedly crossed the border illegally a few years ago and were working as ragpickers or doing odd jobs in Delhi.During the investigation, police also detained five Indians who provided the suspected Bangladeshis accommodation on rent. These people were questioned to determine their role in facilitating the illegal stay of the foreigners.Last week, thirty-six people, believed to be Bangladeshis residing in Delhi illegally with no travel documents, were held in Bharat Nagar in the north-west of the city. The Delhi police said mobile phones that contained banned messaging apps, which allowed them to communicate with relatives in Bangladesh, were found on them.In January this year, Mamata Banerjee had accused BSF of allowing illegal border-crossing by Bangladeshis into the state as part of a ""central government blueprint"", alleging the infiltration was politically motivated to discredit her government.""The border is not guarded by TMC or police; it is guarded by BSF,"" she said.""They are facilitating infiltration, allowing criminals to cross the border, commit murders, and escape. I will write a strong letter to Centre about this issue.""In response, BSF expressed disappointment over the allegations but refrained from escalating the matter. ""We are a responsible force performing our duty at the border. Statements like these dent our morale,"" said Nilotpal Kumar Pandey, spokesperson for BSF's South Bengal Frontier.Later in March, Union home minister Amit Shah, while replying in the Lok Sabha on the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, accused the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government of obstructing border security efforts by not providing land for fencing and showing mercy to infiltrators.He said, ""The fencing work of 450 km is pending because the West Bengal government is not giving land for it... Whenever the process of fencing is done, the ruling party workers indulge in hooliganism and religious sloganeering. The fencing work of 450 km of border has not been completed because the West Bengal government is showing mercy to the infiltrators.""","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged on Tuesday that Bengali migrant workers speaking their native language outside the state were being ""labelled as Bangladeshis and sent to Bangladesh"" The Trinamool Congress chief said many such cases come to her notice and that her government has brought them back.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122047630,imgsize-31156,width-400,resizemode-4/122047630.jpg"

The accused, who was reportedly in a relationship with the victim, is currently on the run.According to a police source, the victim had discovered that the man was marrying someone else, which led to a heated argument between the two on Monday morning. The man, wearing a burqa to conceal his identity, had entered her fifth-floor home posing as a friend, after which an argument broke out between them.“Following which he pushed her off the balcony of her home,” the source said. The victim later succumbed to her injuries during the treatment, an official reported on Tuesday.The incident was reported around 8.30 am at Jyoti Nagar police station.

2 Air India Flights Cancelled, One Mumbai-Bound Plane Grounded In Kolkata Over Engine Snag

NEW DELHI: Air India said on Tuesday that airlines would ""progressively resume flights"" to West Asia as airspace gradually reopens in parts of the conflict-hit region.The airlines, however, said that most operations to and from the Middle East will resume from June 25.""Flights to and from Europe, previously cancelled, are also being progressively reinstated from today, while services to and from the East Coast of the US and Canada will resume at the earliest opportunity. Some flights may experience delays or cancellations due to consequential impacts and extended re-routings/flight times, but we are committed to minimising disruptions and restoring our schedule integrity. Air India will continue to avoid airspaces assessed as unsafe at any given time,"" the Air India Spokesperson said.The decision to resume operations comes hours after Israel and Iran accepted a ceasefire plan proposed by US President Donald Trump to end their 12-day war that has roiled the West Asia. The agreement followed Tehran’s retaliatory limited missile attack on a US military base in Qatar.Both sides accepted the deal after Tehran launched a final onslaught of missiles targeting Israel, killing at least five people early Tuesday morning.In response, Israel carried out a blitz of airstrikes on sites across Iran before dawn.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had agreed to a bilateral ceasefire with Iran in coordination with Trump.Netanyahu told Israel’s security cabinet on Monday night that Israel had achieved all of its war goals in the 12-day operation against Iran. These, he said, included ""removing the threat of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.""He added that Israel also damaged Iran’s military leadership, struck several government sites, and ""achieved control over Tehran’s skies.""The Israeli PM, however, warned that Israel would respond ""forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire”.",Most operations to and from the Middle East will resume from June 25.

Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is all set to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday. He will lift off from Nasa 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday at 12:01pm IST as part of the Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4).This mission marks India's return to space nearly 41 years after Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian in space.Shukla, born in 1985, is an Indian Air Force pilot who grew up inspired by Sharma's journey. Now, he is carrying not just scientific instruments but also some personal items close to his heart.While astronauts are usually advised to pack light, Shukla is taking specially-prepared Indian sweets with him. At a press conference, he revealed he will carry mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa into space. He said he plans to share these with his fellow astronauts aboard the ISS.""There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halwa (gajar ka halwa) and moong dal halwa with me,"" as BBC quoted him from press conference.He is also taking a secret souvenir for Rakesh Sharma, who he considers a mentor. ""He has been advising me on many things, including how to prepare for this mission,"" Shukla said.He did not reveal what the souvenir is, only saying it will be a surprise when he returns.Joining the Axiom-4 crew on the spacecraft is a small white toy swan named Joy. The swan will act as the mission’s zero-gravity indicator, floating once the capsule enters space. The crew chose it for its cultural significance. It symbolises wisdom and is the vehicle of Saraswati, the goddess of learning. In Poland, it represents purity and resilience, while in Hungary, it stands for loyalty and grace.The Ax-4 mission is being carried out by Axiom Space, a private company, in collaboration with Nasa, Isro, and the European Space Agency.The crew will fly aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule launched by a Falcon 9 rocket.

Then he betrayed it. Sold its secrets to China. Decades later, the same B-2 stealth bombers he helped perfect unleashed bunker busters on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 22.Noshir Sheriarji Gowadia, now 81, sits behind bars in Colorado's Florence, serving a 32-year sentence handed down on Jan 24, 2011. The former Northrop engineer helped design B-2 stealth bomber's propulsion system, held top-level security clearance, and taught classified aeronautics. He was convicted of espionage after passing classified information to Beijing.Born April 11, 1944, to a Parsi family, Gowadia reportedly earned the equivalent of a PhD by 15. At 19, he left for US to study aeronautical engineering and became a naturalised American on July 25, 1969. A year later, he joined Northrop, where he was instrumental in developing the B-2 Spirit's infrared-shielded propulsion system.""The entire geometry came from me,"" Gowadia said. His internal codename: ""Blueberry Milkshake"". Northrop secured the B-2 contract in 1981, the bomber's defining breakthrough being its radar-elusive profile.Gowadia's work reduced visual, infrared, and radar signatures - vital to B-2's stealth edge.He left Northrop to start his own defence consultancy in Albuquerque. He advised on CIA aircraft and nuclear weapons at Los Alamos, and in 1999, launched NS Gowadia Inc. But mounting expenses drove him to look abroad for clients - a search that ended in China. Gowadia made three trips to China, providing details on stealth propulsion. Beijing used the information to build an undetectable exhaust system for cruise missiles. His payment: $110,000. Years later, satellites picked up what looked like a B-2 clone drone at a Chinese air base.On Oct 13, 2005, FBI agents knocked on Gowadia's Hawaii home. Seeing handcuffs, Gowadia muttered: ""No."" The agent tucked them away. On Oct 26, he was arrested and charged with one count of sharing national defence secrets with a foreign nation. On Oct 22, 2005, he wrote his final confession: ""On reflection what I did was wrong to help the PRC make a cruise missile. What I did was espionage and treason because I shared military secrets with the PRC. ""Gowadia was convicted on 14 counts under Espionage Act and Arms Export Control Act. His son Ashton said the jury was barred from seeing exonerating documents and vowed to appeal. Now, the engineer's betrayal resurfaces in the shadow of bombs falling over Iran.

""The EP route continues to be a key enabler in bridging urgent capability gaps and ensuring timely induction of vital operational equipment,"" an official said.Among the systems contracted include an additional lot of Russian-origin Igla-1S very short range air defence systems (VSHORADS) with launchers and missiles, which have interception ranges of up to 6km.The Army has been inducting these man-portable Igla-1S systems, which are assembled in India by Adani Defence, in batches over the past couple of years.Another contract was for about a dozen integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (IDDIS) with much-improved capabilities than the existing ones.

But it was followed by MPs asking if the code was being followed in letter and spirit, as they raised several controversial issues pertaining to judges like post-retirement jobs, political statements in public, association with ideological outfits, accountability, declaration of assets. Some members also stated that relatives of judges were still practising in the same courts, which should not be allowed.It was asserted that judges should not take up govt assignments within five years of retirement.

""EROs shall treat the electoral roll of 2003... as probative evidence of eligibility, including presumption of citizenship unless they receive any input otherwise,"" the poll panel said.All other voters in Bihar must, in addition to the pre-filled enumeration form, furnish a declaration that they are above 18 years of age and ordinary resident of the relevant assembly constituency/parliamentary constituency (AC/PC), besides listing their citizenship status and proof through 11 eligible documents.The document submitted will be uploaded on the EC portal.In line with provisions of Citizenship Act and rules, the declarations require new and shifted voters to declare if they were born in India prior to July 1, 1987, in which case they must choose from a list of 11 documents to establish their date and place of birth. If born in India between July 1, 1987, and Dec 2, 2012, they must also provide a listed document for their father or mother. If born after Dec 2, 2004, they must provide their own and their parents' proof of date and place of birth. If either parent is non-Indian, they must provide a copy of the parent's valid passport and visa at the time of their birth.The declarations also require eligible electors or applicants to attach proof of birth registration issued by an Indian mission abroad if born outside India; or the certificate of registration of Indian citizenship if acquired by registration/naturalisation.""This is a historic step. Strictly in accordance with Article 326, only Indian citizens above 18 years of age and ordinary residents can vote from today onwards,"" a senior EC functionary told TOI.As per SIR guidelines, a pre-filled enumeration form will be printed by the electoral registration officer for all existing electors and distributed by the booth level officer through house-to-house visits. The form will have fields like an updated photo, date of birth, Aadhaar (optional), mobile number, and parents/spouse name and EPIC number. The BLO will collect these forms and documents in a subsequent house visit; elector/applicant can also upload these via ECINET app. The forms will be scrutinised by the ERO/asst ERO and in case of doubt about eligibility of a proposed elector, ERO/AERO will conduct a field inquiry and pass a speaking order on his inclusion/exclusion, before the final roll is published.Such special intensive revisions have been carried out 13 times since 1952, with the last taking place in 2004.","New and shifted voters must declare if they were born in India prior to July 1, 1987, in which case they must choose from a list of 11 documents.

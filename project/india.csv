‘Kochi Biennale challenges the practice of putting certain artists on a pedestal’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kochi-biennale-challenges-the-practice-of-putting-certain-artists-on-a-pedestal/articleshow/126100494.cms,"Nikhil Chopra

You were one of the OGs of

performance art

in India, back when it wasn’t even widely accepted as art. You’ve done things like eating and sleeping at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to trace the legacy of colonialism. As curator, the Biennale feels like it’s part of your attempt to expand the definition of art. Was that your aim?

Your curatorial team at HH Art Spaces brought together established artists like Marina Abramovic and our own Gulammohammed Sheikh alongside artists who don’t even have gallery representation. That’s unusual, isn’t it?

The Biennale also challenges the idea of art as something static or framed. There is Belgium-based Nigerian artist Otobong Nkanga who is growing a garden at Aspinwall and Argentine artist Adrián Villar Rojas who stuffed decaying food into obsolete fridges.

The theme is ‘For the Time Being’. What does ephemerality mean to you in this context?

Kochi itself feels deeply embedded in many of the works. Ghanaian artist Ibrahim Mahama was talking about how he sourced local sacks with the stamps of trade to turn a Mattancherry warehouse—a relic of its mercantile past—into a Parliament of Ghosts. How important was it that artists work closely with the city?

The Biennale positions itself outside the commercial art market, yet collectors are clearly keeping an eye out for promising artists. Are you surprised by that?

I’ve bumped into many locals and tourists here who admit they’ve never been to a gallery before, and many don’t have an ‘arty’ vocabulary. But you’ve spoken about how it’s okay if audiences don’t understand everything.

Finally, what do you think is the function of a Biennale for someone encountering contemporary art for the first time?

There were some grumbles about the spaces opening while many works were still in process. Did that unfinished state bother you?

The Kochi-Muziris Biennale has never been about polished spectacle. Instead of wine and cheese, there are fried banana fritters, a curator dressed in shorts, with some works unfinished and others still finding their rhythm. Neelam Raaj spoke to curatoron why he wanted to blur hierarchies and invite viewers to experience contemporary art as something dynamic rather than fixedWhat interested me here was working with forms that don’t sit neatly in one category. Take the performance of French artist Uriel Barthélém. He is a drummer and composer but his was not just a music performance, it was also an experimental percussion and visual work. The drum kit is programmed to generate visuals, creating a multidimensional, multisensory experience. For me, it was almost like watching a live painting unfold.It was very much about dismantling hierarchy. We wanted to stop working with a pyramid structure where certain artists are placed on pedestals. By placing emerging artists alongside figures with established practices, the intention was to level the playing field and push back against gatekeeping.It allows younger voices to see their own work and research in dialogue with art history and excellence, and to recognise the strength of their own journeys.Yes, art here is meant to be dynamic. Take Otobong’s garden, for example. It’s freshly planted now, but it will grow and change over the course of the Biennale. Time becomes a material. We have three months to cultivate this exhibition, almost like a garden, and that duration allows works to transform.It’s a series of moments. The Biennale has a beginning and an end, an entry and an exit. We’re acknowledging that we’re passing through time and place. Many of us have been living in Kochi for months, treating it as a residence rather than a temporary site. That kind of immersion is essential.Very much so. Many artists sourced materials locally, worked with students, carpenters, craftspeople, and technicians here. We’re crediting everyone involved, and their names will appear alongside the wall texts and in the catalogue. This exhibition was made collectively, with the city.Artists need to sustain their lives. If art can become an agency for them, there’s nothing wrong with it. For me personally, as a performance artist, I never initially thought about my relationship with the market. Over time, drawing became a sustainable practice that fed my performances, and the performances fed the drawings. It became a symbiotic relationship.That openness is crucial. Someone told me they didn’t understand everything, but they understood what they liked, and that was enough. Local residents, international visitors, first-time viewers, and specialists, everyone is invited to experience it on their own terms.This Biennale, in many ways, is about demystifying making, watching, and interacting with art. It’s about instilling faith in the idea that art and poetry are essential to people’s lives. Contemporary art has the ability to poetically approach difficult conversations— about caste, gender, patriarchy, sexuality—within a space that feels safe and open. The aim is to allow people in, to break away from the white cube of galleries, and to make art feel lived, shared, and human.From the beginning, our curatorial note made it clear that we weren’t afraid of inviting people into that process. Some works were still being adjusted, some artists hadn’t fully completed their installations, and that was fine. People could walk through, see what was there, and also sense that things were still being fixed and tuned. Soon, everything will find its place, but the exhibition itself functions as an activation space over time.",The Kochi-Muziris Biennale runs from September 26 to October 1. The theme is ‘For the Time Being’ and the theme is ephemerality.

'Vote Chori Is The Biggest Anti-National Act': Rahul Gandhi Slams BJP In Lok Sabha

SRINAGAR: Days after J&K CM Omar Abdullah described the “vote chori” as an issue of the Congress alone and said the INDIA bloc had “nothing to do with it,” the party on Saturday said being in alliance does not negate a constituent’s political ideology.“Omar Abdullah was present in various meetings of the INDIA bloc, whether they took place in Kolkata or elsewhere. The alliance was very successful in the parliamentary elections, though we have not achieved 100 percent success,” Congress’s Salman Khurshid said responding to question whether Omar is drifting away from the alliance.“Alliance is not a negation of independent political parties. They don’t write off their own identity and own ideology,” Khurshid said at a press conference here.On Dec 15, J&K CM distanced himself from the “vote chori” issue raised by the Congress and said the “INDIA bloc has got nothing to do with it”.Early this week, he repeated the statement in New Delhi.Khurshid said Jammu and Kashmir ’s demand for statehood was a fight for its very existence, describing statehood as an identity that had been taken away.He also questioned the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from the rural employment law MGNREGA . “What was the need to change the name of the scheme?” he said, adding that it is an emotive issue for the Congress.Omar echoed his comments, saying no one could erase Gandhi’s legacy, irrespective of whether his name remained attached to the scheme. “Mahatma Gandhi lives in the hearts of the people of India,” he said, describing the original scheme as far-sighted. He accused the NDA government of attempting to weaken the MGNREGA by shifting its financial burden on the states, saying the Centre ultimately wanted to do away with it altogether.","Omar Abdullah was present in various meetings of the INDIA bloc, whether they took place in Kolkata or elsewhere. “Alliance is not a negation of independent political parties.

‘Who named G-RAM G Bill?’



SRINAGAR: J&K Omar Abdullah Saturday praised the Centre for being generous in allocating funds to J&K, but said the same magnanimity had not been shown in the matter of restoring statehood.Omar said he had no hesitation in acknowledging and thanking the Centre’s efforts where it had delivered. “I am not among those who practise politics by deceiving people. Whenever the Centre extends support, I acknowledge it; and wherever there are shortcomings, I also speak about it,” he added.The CM was responding to media persons’ queries about the opposition’s accusations that he praised BJP in Delhi, but criticises it in Kashmir. At a meeting in New Delhi recently, Omar had said the Centre had been generous to J&K, even though, if it wanted, it could have brought his govt to its knees. Opposition parties in Kashmir widely criticised him for the statement, referring to him as “good boy” and alleging that he spoke in different voices in Delhi and Srinagar.Rejecting the criticism, Omar said he did not make statements to please anyone. “I do not say one thing in Delhi and another in Kashmir. I say this (praising Union govt over funds allocation) everywhere --- in public meetings, in official interactions and even on the floor of the Assembly,” he said.Omar said the Centre had left no scope for complaint on issues other than statehood restoration, a commitment it has not fulfilled.Criticising the new rural employment guarantee Bill that has been brought to replace MGNREGA , Omar said the Centre had shifted the financial and administrative burden of the programme on the states.The CM was in Srinagar to review the winter preparedness of the administration.Omar Abdullah poked fun at the renaming of MGNREGA as ‘Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin), or VB-G RAM G, Omar Abdullah said the acronym sounded like a Bollywood movie’s name.“First of all, I am surprised where this name came from,” he said. “I am sorry, but a Bill should have been named after giving it some thought. It reminds me of an old Bollywood movie, ‘Ji Mummy Ji’. I don’t know if you have seen it or not, my nephew has,” he added. “Who named the bill as G RAM G?” he asked. He also criticised the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from the scheme.","Omar said he had no hesitation in acknowledging and thanking the Centre’s efforts where it had delivered.

India T20 World Cup:

Chief selector Ajit Agarkar on Saturday announced India’s squads for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup and the five-match T20I series against New Zealand. The T20I series will begin on January 21 in Nagpur and will serve as India’s final assignment in the format before the global tournament, scheduled from February 7 to March 8.India have been drawn in Group A for the T20 World Cup, alongside Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and the United States. The hosts will open their campaign against the USA on February 7 in Mumbai.Despite a lean run with the bat in the recently concluded T20I series against South Africa, which India won 3–1, Suryakumar Yadav has been entrusted with the captaincy for the marquee event. In 20 matches and 18 innings this year, Suryakumar has scored 213 runs at an average of 14.20, striking at just over 125, without registering a single half-century.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanSuryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanIndia’s T20 World Cup squad sees some major changes. Notably, Shubman Gill , who was India’s vice-captain in the T20 setup, has been dropped, with all-rounder Axar Patel named as the new vice-captain.Gill had struggled to find form since opening the innings. Brought back into the playing XI as part of the management’s long-term leadership plan, his performances remained underwhelming. In 15 T20 matches since his comeback, Gill has scored 291 runs at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of 137, failing to register a single fifty.Meanwhile, Sanju Samson, who had performed exceptionally well, including scoring three centuries as an opener, was moved down the order. His Asia Cup performance was mixed, though he finished as India’s third-highest run-scorer with 132 runs, behind Abhishek Sharma (314) and Tilak Varma (213). A solitary outing in Australia at No. 3 yielded little impact, after which Samson was dropped from the playing XI.In the last T20 against South Africa, Samson opened the innings again and scored a solid 37 off 22 balls, giving India a good start. The team management now plans to return to their original composition of playing a wicketkeeper at the top. Consequently, Jitesh Sharma has been dropped, and Ishan Kishan has been drafted as the second keeper.Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out. Kishan comes off a stellar domestic season in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he captained Jharkhand to their maiden T20 title. He finished the season as the highest run-scorer, amassing 517 runs in 10 games at an average of 57.44 and a strike rate of 197.","Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out.

Why the Mumbai Maidans are being ignored? | Bombay Sport Exchange

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya produced a blistering display of power-hitting to lead India to a commanding 30-run victory over South Africa in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad on Friday, sealing the five-match series 3-1. Pandya’s explosive knock set the tone as India piled up a daunting 231 for 5.Pandya smashed a 16-ball half-century — the second-fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals — on his way to a stunning 63 off just 25 deliveries. His innings was laced with five boundaries and five towering sixes.The carnage was complemented by Tilak Varma, who continued his rich vein of form with a fluent 73. Together, the duo stitched a punishing 105-run partnership for the fourth wicket that completely wrested momentum away from the visitors.One of Pandya’s massive sixes led to an unexpected moment off the field when the ball struck a cameraman stationed near the boundary.Showing concern beyond the contest, Pandya immediately walked up to check on the cameraman’s well-being after his innings, ensuring he was attended to and even helping apply an ice pack.Pandya also hugged the cameraman, a gesture that quickly went viral and earned widespread praise from fans.In reply, South Africa began positively and remained in the chase as long as Quinton de Kock was at the crease. The left-hander scored a fighting 65, but once he was dismissed, the innings unravelled rapidly. Varun Chakravarthy spun a web around the middle order, claiming four wickets as South Africa lost seven wickets for 81 runs to finish on 201 for 8.Pandya’s all-round impact and match-defining innings earned him the Player of the Match award.""Winning games is what you play for and it’s always exciting when your contribution helps the team get over the line. No, I actually didn’t know (he has the second fastest fifty for India) until I got out and went back. Our social media guys told me I was the second-fastest,"" Pandya said.Watch the video here ""My first reaction was, “Ah, I missed the top spot!” But happy that Yuvi pa holds that record. Today I just felt it. I actually told my partner beforehand that I was going to step out first ball and try to hit it for six.

NEW DELHI: A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district on Thursday night following allegations of blasphemy, BBC Bangla reported, amid continuing unrest in the country and growing concerns over attacks on minorities and media institutions.The incident took place in the Dubalia Para area of Square Master Bari in Bhaluka upazila. Police identified the victim as Dipu Chandra Das, who worked at a local garment factory and lived in the area as a tenant.“A group of agitated people caught him and beat him up around 9 pm on Thursday for insulting the Prophet. Then they set his body on fire,” Ripon Mia, duty officer of Bhaluka police station, told BBC Bangla. He said the attackers tied the body to a tree before setting it ablaze.Police reached the spot after receiving information and brought the situation under control. The body was recovered and sent to the morgue of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital for autopsy. No case has been filed so far. “We are searching for his relatives.

There is no space for such violence in new Bangladesh. The perpetrators of this heinous crimine will not be spared,"" the statement read.The killing comes amid a broader wave of violence across Bangladesh following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a 32-year-old student leader and key figure in last year’s uprising.

Prothom Alo executive editor Sajjad Sharif said the attack was “an attack on freedom of the press, expression, dissent and diversity of opinion”.The violence has drawn international concern. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed and urged Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety of journalists and hold those responsible accountable.In New Delhi, a parliamentary standing committee on external affairs said the situation in Bangladesh was “complex and evolving” and flagged continued attacks on minorities, media groups and intellectuals. “The political events of August 2024 have created significant instability and uncertainty with incidents of violence, attacks and intimidation of minorities, tribal communities, media groups, intellectuals, journalists, academicians, etc. , becoming the norm,” the panel said in a report presented in Parliament.The ministry of external affairs told the committee that India remains concerned about extremism and attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, even as it continues engagement with the interim government and seeks to insulate bilateral ties from recent political developments.Police in Bangladesh have launched a manhunt for Hadi’s attackers and announced a reward for information leading to their arrest, as authorities struggle to contain unrest that has raised fresh questions about law and order and minority safety in the country.","A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor at the centre of the recent hijab row after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lifted her naqab during an event did not join duty on Saturday, officials confirmed to news agency PTI. They also reported no contact with her or the family members.Patna civil surgeon Avinash Kumar Singh confirmed that Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.“I have been informed that the last date of joining has been extended beyond December 20. It remains to be seen whether Parveen joins on Monday or not,” he said, without specifying the new deadline.The controversy erupted earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna. The video circulated widely on social media, capturing the moment Nitish Kumar questioned Parveen’s naqab when she came forward to receive her appointment letter along with other Ayush doctors.Also Read: Hijab row: SCBA issues 'strongest condemnation' over Nitish Kumar's act; seeks unconditional apology from Giriraj Singh, Sanjay Nishad Civil surgeon Singh said he was not aware of the reason for Parveen’s delay, as he “had no contact with her or the family members.”Vijay Kumar, a surgeon at Sabalpur PHC in Patna Sadar, where Parveen was supposed to join, also confirmed she had not reported for duty.“Around five-six people have joined today, and Parveen is not among them... Her name is in the list but we have not received her appointment letter from the civil surgeon office in Patna,” he said. As per protocol, candidates must first report to the civil surgeon’s office before joining their assigned workplace.Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan expressed disappointment over the controversy.“It pains me to hear the word ‘dispute’ in this case. Can there be any row between a father and a daughter?” he asked.“What have you people made out of it? This man (Nitish Kumar) considers female students as his daughters,” he added while speaking to reporters in Patna.Earlier, Mahfoozur Rahman, principal of Government Tibbi College & Hospital (GTCH), where Parveen is a second-year student, also suggested the joining deadline had been extended “in this special case”.“Ayush doctor Nusrat Parveen has not joined yet, and there is no update on her future course of action,” Rahman said.According to him, the family wants to avoid media attention. “Her family said that they want to escape media coverage, and that the woman doctor will rethink whether to join or not,” he said.Rahman also dismissed rumours that the family had shifted to Kolkata. “They have themselves rubbished such false news reports,” he said, quoting Parveen’s husband as saying the family is not upset with Nitish Kumar or the government.He added that “the family is disappointed with the row stirred by the media.”Rahman said Parveen last attended college on December 17 or 18 and noted that she still has the option to either join duty or pursue higher education.","Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day’ closed.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Saturday issued a letter expressing its “strongest condemnation” of the recent incident in Bihar in which CM Nitish Kumar pulled down the hijab of a woman doctor during a public ceremony.The incident, which occurred on December 15 at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna during the distribution of appointment letters to newly recruited AYUSH doctors, was captured in a video that quickly went viral.The clip showed Nitish questioning the woman’s naqab, saying “what is this?” and then attempting to remove it, leaving the doctor visibly flustered. Deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary appeared to intervene to restrain him.In a post on X, RJD wrote: ""What has happened to Nitish ji? His mental state has now reached a completely pitiable condition, or has Nitish Babu become 100% Sanghi now?""In its letter, the SCBA condemned the Bihar CM’s action as an infringement on the woman’s autonomy, religious freedom and personal dignity.It stated, “Besides infringing on her autonomy, agency and religious freedom, it is a reflection of the depraving attitude against women in general.”The association also condemned “the vile comments made by union minister Giriraj Singh and Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad,” saying such remarks further undermined the dignity of women. Signed by SCBA secretary Pragya Baghel, the letter demanded an unconditional apology from the chief minister and others involved.The controversy escalated after union minister Giriraj Singh defended Nitish, describing the incident as “nothing wrong” and framing it as a procedural act.Singh said it was up to the woman to refuse the government job or “go to hell” and argued that the act should not be seen through a religious lens.He drew parallels to other official procedures, stating, “When you go to get a passport, do you not show your face? When you go to the airport, do you not show your face? People talk about Pakistan and Englishtan, but this is India. In India, the rule of law prevails.”Similarly, Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad’s remarks defending Bihar CM were widely criticised. Nishad initially supported Nitish’s action but later said his comments were misunderstood due to translation issues and offered to withdraw them if they had hurt sentiments.Despite this, opposition leaders continued to demand an unconditional apology from both ministers.",Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) condemns Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's act.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s helicopter could not land at the Taherpur helipad in West Bengal on Saturday due to low visibility caused by dense fog, an official said.The Prime Minister’s chopper hovered over the helipad for some time before making a U turn and returning to Kolkata airport, the official added. There were no reports of any untoward incident.As of the last update, PM Modi was waiting at the airport for further information on the weather conditions. It was not immediately clear whether he would travel to the venue by road or make another aerial attempt if visibility improves, the official said.Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister arrived in Kolkata at around 10.40 am and proceeded by helicopter to Taherpur in Nadia district. He is scheduled to attend an administrative programme to launch highway projects in West Bengal, followed by a BJP rally titled Parivartan Sankalpa Sabha.People gathered at Taherpur Netaji Park in Ranaghat, Nadia district, on Saturday, waving national flags and chanting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name ahead of his public address and the inauguration of development projects worth Rs 3,200 crore in West Bengal.The projects include a 66.7 km four lane stretch of the Barajaguli Krishnanagar section of National Highway 34 and the laying of the foundation stone for the four laning of the Barasat Barajaguli section of NH 34, aimed at improving connectivity between Kolkata and Siliguri.According to the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Modi was scheduled to reach Ranaghat at around 11.15 am. The visit was part of an administrative programme to launch highway projects, followed by a BJP rally titled Parivartan Sankalpa Sabha.Ahead of the visit, the Prime Minister criticised the Trinamool Congress government in a post on X on Friday, saying people in West Bengal were benefiting from the Centre’s development initiatives but continued to suffer due to what he described as “misrule of the Trinamool Congress in every sector.”“Tomorrow, on the 20th of December, at noon, I will deliver a speech at the BJP public meeting in Ranaghat. The people of West Bengal are receiving the benefits of the central government's multifaceted projects. However, at the same time, due to the misrule of the Trinamool Congress in every sector of the state, they are becoming victims of suffering. The looting and intimidation by the Trinamool have crossed all limits. That is why today, the BJP is the only hope and trust of the people,” PM Modi said in the post.The West Bengal visit comes amid an intensifying political contest between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress ahead of upcoming electoral battles in the state.After his programme in West Bengal,PM Modi will travel to Assam for a two day visit on December 20 and 21. He is scheduled to reach Guwahati around 3 pm on Saturday, where he will inaugurate the new Bamboo Orchids terminal at the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, unveil an 80 foot tall statue of Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi, and lay the foundation stone for a 12 lakh metric tonne capacity fertiliser unit at Namrup in Dibrugarh district.During his Assam visit, the Prime Minister will address public rallies in Guwahati and Namrup and visit the Assam state BJP headquarters. On December 21, he will interact with 25 meritorious students as part of Pariksha Pe Charcha during a programme on a cruise on the Brahmaputra river and pay tributes to 860 martyrs of the Assam Movement at Swahid Smarak.Authorities have deployed extensive security arrangements across Guwahati and other key locations to manage the Prime Minister’s schedule and ensure public safety during the visit.","The Prime Minister’s chopper hovered over the helipad for some time before making a U turn and returning to Kolkata airport.

NEW DELHI: The external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a “very significant change,” suggesting that India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.Addressing the convocation of an institute in Pune, Jaishankar said the cumulative impact of recent global developments has altered the international pecking order.“The cumulative result of all these happenings is that the global economic and, thereafter, political pecking order has actually undergone a very significant change,” he said, according to ANI.Pointing towards the shifts in the international labour market, the minister said India is increasingly becoming a driver of the global workforce.“We have started to surge in trained human resources at the very time when many developed nations are struggling to find them,” he said, adding, “Since demand and supply invariably develop their own equation, we have entered an era of mobility.”The minister also mentioned that this growing cross-border mobility now places new responsibilities on governments. “We need to ensure welfare, including in conflict situations, and the politics of this mobility needs to be managed,” he said, referring to India’s efforts to protect its citizens abroad.Reflecting on the post-colonial global order, Jaishankar said control over national destinies has shifted back to sovereign states, making policy choices a decisive factor. He noted that while China has “gained the most” since decolonisation, India has “done well, especially in the post-reform era,” and even more so over the past decade.In contrast, he criticised the Western economic model, linking current discontent to past decisions.“Western elites consciously chose to shift production to maximise profits. Their competitiveness has eroded over the years, accelerated by their lifestyle,” he said. “Much of the Western world now feels that they have stagnated, a sentiment that has increasingly come to acquire a political meaning.”Concluding his address, Jaishankar told students that national progress is shaped by leadership and governance. In India’s case, he said, “leadership and governance have led to ups and downs in various phases in our economic growth and in our social transformation,” urging them to see themselves as contributors to a “Viksit Bharat” that is increasingly shaping, not just participating in, the global order.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a ‘very significant change’ He said India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092509,imgsize-487596,width-400,resizemode-4/s-jaishankar-file-photo.jpg"

I have come to attend the meeting… Congress has taken a decision to contest the elections alone,” Chennithala said.The announcement comes amid one of the most striking political developments in Mumbai ahead of the polls, the growing proximity between Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena supremo Raj Thackeray .Once bitter rivals, the cousins now appear aligned in their belief that losing Mumbai would significantly weaken the broader Thackeray political legacy.For Uddhav Thackeray, winning control of the BMC may be the last major opportunity to reassert political relevance after the 2022 split in the Shiv Sena . For Raj Thackeray, the election is being framed as a battle to safeguard Marathi identity, with the MNS presenting itself as the custodian of Maharashtra's linguistic and cultural character.While no formal announcement has been made yet, the Sena (UBT) and MNS are expected to declare their alliance for the BMC polls next week.Notably, the Congress is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance in Maharashtra, alongside Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP - SP).In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections, the MVA suffered a major setback, losing heavily to the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance, which secured a landslide victory.Polling for BMC's 29 municipal corporations, 32 zilla parishads and 336 panchayat samitis will be held on January 15, with results to be declared the following day on January 16.","The Congress on Saturday announced that it will contest the upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections alone.

After the last landing: Where do planes go to die?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-the-last-landing-where-do-planes-go-to-die/articleshow/126091800.cms,"When planes get stuck

The afterlife of wings

The second act



Civil jets and combat flyers



What is a plane worth?



Do you remember the first time you noticed an aircraft overhead? A metal giant cutting through the sky, growing smaller until it vanished from sight. For some, the feeling never quite leaves.But an aircraft’s story does not end at the horizon.Long after it disappears from view, the plane will fly hundreds, sometimes thousands, of times. And then will come a day when it will not take off in the sky again. The giant, after years of service, carrying people miles and possibilities to the sky, reaches the end of its life.But what happens then?Do planes have a grave, as we humans do? Is it dismantled piece by piece or kept in a museum like a relic from another era?In aviation, an aircraft's death has an official name - decommissioning.But does a plane stop flying, and how do we know it's the end?Aviation expert Harsh Vardhan explains that there are two factors that determine when a passenger aircraft is decommissioned.The first is economic. When the cost of maintenance overtakes the profit an aircraft can generate, it no longer makes financial sense to keep it flying. The second is regulatory. If an aircraft fails to meet mandatory safety standards, it cannot legally remain in service.Once either threshold is crossed, the aircraft’s flying days are over. What follows, however, can take many unexpected paths.In 2023, an unusual sight caught national attention when an aircraft being transported on the back of a truck got stuck under a bridge in Bihar's Motihari. The scrapped Air India aircraft was being moved from Assam to Mumbai. What followed was the crowds of people gathering to make videos, take selfies.This was not an isolated incident. In another case, an Air India plane got stuck under a foot overbridge near Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport in 2021, prompting widespread confusion over how a plane ended up on a city road. Air India later clarified that it was a sold-off decommissioned aircraft being carried away by its rightful owners.Sometimes, decommissioned planes don’t even leave the airport.In November, a forgotten aircraft at Kolkata airport finally met its end after lying abandoned for 13 years. Airport authorities flagged its presence to Air India, and in an internal post to employees, CEO Campbell Wilson revealed that the airline had been unaware of the aircraft’s existence.The plane was eventually moved to Bengaluru, where it will now be used to train maintenance engineers.Not all decommissioned aircraft are this fortunate.For most aircraft, decommissioning leads to dismantling.Expert Harsh Vardhan explains the process of salvaging usable components before the rest is scrapped.He says, ""The people who maintain inventory for old aircraft, they buy that scrap. They buy those components from the scrap aircraft. These are usually bought by specialised scrap dealers for the value of scrap because there are metals, valuable metals, and other parts. So, to the extent, the components that can still be reused later are taken out. They're taken out and bought by these logistics.""What remains is largely unusable.""The rest becomes the hull, which cannot be used in any form. So it is taken by the scrap dealers to scrap it. Since they have valuable metals, they'll be taken and used for different purposes,"" Vardhan adds.Yet, not every fuselage is destined to be melted down.Aircraft bodies often find a second life far removed from runways. Film sets, training facilities, museums, restaurants, and even children’s parks have all housed retired aircraft.Remember the music video of Shah Rukh Khan's 'Gerua' from Dilwale? Or countless Hollywood scenes featuring planes frozen in dramatic stillness? These are often retired airliners repurposed for storytelling.""Some shelves are used for innovative ideas, creating a restaurant or a children's park to display items,"" Vardhan says.Civil and military aircraft serve vastly different purposes in the sky, but their journey after decommissioning follows similar principles.Group Captain Kaushik Sinha explains that the fighter jets of Air Force are retired based on strict technical limits.""Decommissioning is of two types. One is when the engine life of the aircraft ends. Another is based on the airframe hours of the aircraft. Airframe means the body of the aircraft,"" he says.""They also have a certain age. Once they are mature, they can no longer fly. So they are decommissioned,” Group Captain Kaushik Sinha adds.What happens next is carefully regulated.""We have different policies. We send it to a museum where all the young generations can come and see it, so they get motivated for the future. Or if some government or the private sector wants to put it in their place for a display, we have policies in the MoD by which it is approved,"" he says.For decades, these silent machines have sparked ambition in countless young minds.""Some of these policies are for future generations, so that they should get motivated to join the armed forces, the Navy, Air Force, and Army,” the Group Captain adds.The emotional value of an aircraft is impossible to quantify. Its financial value, however, is carefully calculated.Group Captain Sinha explains the process for military aircraft.""Generally, air force aircraft are not sold. They are either donated to museums or a state government takes them to put them on display, at some important road crossing or civil airports, etc. On an occasion where some private entity wants it, then the aircraft fuselages are auctioned,” he says.He adds that India does not follow a uniform scrapping policy: ""In India, we don’t have any standard scrapping policy for aircraft. Since not many Jet aircraft are decommissioned in India, it is decided on a case-by-case basis.""Civil aviation follows a different route.""Most of them are done through the specialised auction agencies. There are international agencies that do this. But some airlines like Air India, etc, have their local departments that do the scrap selling,” aviation expert Harsh Vardhan says.The resale price of a civil aircraft can go up to about $100,000, or roughly Rs 91 lakh.The contrast with manufacturing costs is stark.""It varies,"" Vardhan says. ""For (Boeing) 737, 378, 100, Neo or Indigo, you are talking about $250mn (more than Rs 2,200 crore) list price today. And 787 could even be around $450mn (more than Rs 4,000 crore).""But do the planes have graveyards like us?Yes.In the United States, the Arizona desert serves as a final resting place for thousands of retired aircraft. The dry climate slows corrosion, allowing planes to remain intact until their fate is decided.""Generally, big nations have graveyards for decommissioned aircraft as they scrap many aircraft in a year. These are large tracts of land in a dry area, which prevents corrosion of the airframe of aircraft till the disposal is decided,"" Sinha explains.Harsh Vardhan adds, ""If you see the Arizona Desert, it is full of all the defence and retired aircraft, even civilian aircraft. So not all can be salvaged.""India’s reality is different.“But here, scrap aircraft are either sold by the operator. And many times, if it is just parked and the parking charges are not paid, then airport authorities auction them,” Vardhan says.Whether India needs a similar graveyard remains a debated topic. While Sinha views it as a tribute akin to war memorials, Vardhan believes current systems suffice, given land constraints.After the final landingWhen an aircraft stops flying, it does not simply vanish.It becomes metal, memory, training equipment, museum artefact, or scrap. It becomes a reflection of economics, policy, pride and time.Aircraft are built to conquer gravity, but even they cannot outrun age.Long after their engines fall silent, they continue to carry meaning. And even grounded wings, it turns out, leave trails behind.","In aviation, an aircraft's death has an official name - decommissioning. When the cost of maintenance overtakes the profit an aircraft can generate, it no longer makes financial sense to keep it flying. If an aircraft fails to meet mandatory safety standards, it cannot legally remain in service.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092108,imgsize-1033799,width-400,resizemode-4/where-do-planes-go-to-die.jpg"

'Global Order Has Changed Forever, No Single Nation Can Dominate All Issues': Says EAM Jaishankar

'

India's talent

, skill has shaped our national brand': Jaishankar

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Saturday said he merely carries out the “vision” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , likening his role to that of Lord Hanuman carrying out Lord Ram’s mission.At an event in Maharashtra's Pune, Jaishankar, a former diplomat, was asked if only “one Jaishankar” is enough for India. He ""corrected"" the question, replying, 'You actually should have asked me 'there is one Modi.'”The EAM said, “That was the question you should have asked me because ultimately, the diplomats… after all, Shri Hanuman finally serves (Lord Ram). So bear it in mind.”Showering praise on PM Modi, Jaishankar added, “Countries are defined by leaders, countries are defined by vision. There are people who execute it. But ultimately today, it is that vision, the leadership, the confidence. That is what makes a difference.”Jaishankar, who served as India’s foreign secretary from January 2015 to 2018, has been the country’s external affairs minister since May 2019, following PM Modi’s second consecutive term win.The BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member was in Pune to attend the 22nd convocation of Symbiosis International (Deemed University).He told the graduating students, “The old stereotypes about India are steadily being put behind. But this evolution in our image is an undeniable reality. Hard figures vouch for this transformation. Among them, the growing number of global capability centres in India, the increasing demand for Indian talent and skills abroad, and the individual successes of people. And this extends equally to us as a collective. Perhaps more than others, India is today defined by its talent and by its skill. All that has helped to shape our national brand.”The minister also called for “doubling down” on the Make in India initiative so that Indian products can make a mark beyond the country’s shores.“Add to that design in India, research in India, innovate in India, or deliver from India, and the same holds true for services as well. We have to upgrade our infrastructure, develop our human resources, and adopt and pursue the right policies. But more importantly, it requires vision, it requires leadership, and it requires execution, all of which we fortunately have today,” he remarked.Students from over 40 countries graduated at the ceremony, and Jaishankar wished them success in their future endeavours.", External affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar likens his role to that of Lord Hanuman carrying out Lord Ram’s mission.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.

Rahul Gandhi Demands Unified National Response As Parliament Debates India’s Air Pollution Crisis

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had joined hands with “anti-India forces” during his visit to Germany.Party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia asserted that the Congress MP was part of a larger conspiracy against the country. The BJP also linked Gandhi to US billionaire investor George Soros, repeating earlier allegations of foreign influence.Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters, Bhatia alleged that Gandhi met individuals hostile to India while abroad.“If anyone meets anti-India forces and insults Bharat from foreign soil, it’s none other than Rahul,” Bhatia charged. He added, “George Soros and Rahul Gandhi are two bodies but one soul.”The BJP spokesperson displayed a purported photograph of Gandhi with Cornelia Woll, president of the Berlin-based Hertie School, claiming it as evidence of his interaction with “anti-India forces in Germany”.Bhatia alleged that Woll is a trustee of the Central European University, which he said is funded by Soros’s Open Society Foundation.Questioning Gandhi’s foreign visits during parliamentary sessions, Bhatia asked, “What kind of anti-India agenda is it that the Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi is hatching a conspiracy against Bharat by joining hands with such anti-India forces?”He further claimed that Gandhi frequently travels abroad during or ahead of Parliament sessions and meets people who are “jealous of India and attack its integrity”.Bhatia also alleged that this was not the first such instance, accusing Gandhi of defaming India during previous foreign visits.“This is not the first time Rahul Gandhi is indulging in such anti-national activities,” he said. “Rahul Gandhi has become Mir Zafar,” the party spokesperson asserted.The BJP reiterated its claim that Soros makes “anti-India statements” and provides funds to create unrest in the country.“George Soros is not an Indian; he is a foreigner. But Rahul Gandhi has taken the oath of protecting the Constitution,” Bhatia said. He added, “These snakelets within India need to be treated. People of the country are demanding it.”The BJP’s remarks come amid Rahul Gandhi’s ongoing visit to Germany, where he toured BMW’s headquarters in Munich. During the visit, Gandhi criticised the Centre over manufacturing, saying India needs to “produce more” and that manufacturing in the country was “declining”.In a video shared by the Congress, Gandhi said India needs to focus more on production-led growth.“Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies. Sadly, in India, manufacturing is declining. For us to accelerate growth, we need to produce more—build meaningful manufacturing ecosystems and create high-quality jobs at scale,” he said.In another video clip from the visit, Gandhi remarked, “India needs to start producing. Production is the key for the success of any country. And our manufacturing is declining which actually should be going up.”The BJP strongly objected to Gandhi’s remarks, accusing him of running down the country from foreign soil at a time when Parliament was in session.BJP MP and party spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Leader of Opposition carries a “huge responsibility” and must act with restraint while travelling abroad.“The LoP has a huge responsibility. The LoP has to behave in a really responsible manner, especially when the LoP is on foreign soil. Parliament is in session here, several Bills are being discussed in the House and Rahul Gandhi is in Germany to address the Indian diaspora,” Patra said.Referring to Gandhi’s visit to the BMW plant, Patra alleged that the Congress leader praised German manufacturing while portraying India negatively.“Today, we saw Rahul Gandhi visiting the BMW factory in Munich and there, he appreciated their manufacturing and said that he is sad that manufacturing is poor in India,” he said, rejecting Gandhi’s claim and citing official data to assert that India’s manufacturing sector was on a growth path.The BJP’s latest attack also revives allegations made earlier this year, when party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia accused the Congress and Rahul Gandhi of working with foreign forces to destabilise India.In February, Bhatia had claimed that organisations linked to George Soros were involved in “anti-India activities” and alleged that funding to certain NGOs during the Congress-led UPA government was significantly higher than under the current BJP government.At the time, Bhatia had accused Gandhi of collaborating with foreign forces to weaken India, citing alleged links to Soros-funded organisations.","The BJP has alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had joined hands with “anti-India forces” during his visit to Germany.

Our commerce minister Piyush Goyal Ji has assured me that he is trying his best and it will be done. It is just a matter of time,” Radhakrishnan said.He was speaking at an event organised by the Apparel Export Promotion Council to felicitate exporters. The US levied an additional 25 pr cent tariff on India earlier this year, bringing total tariffs to 50per cent. India’s merchandise exports to the US registered over 22 per cent growth in November despite steep tariffs. India’s textile and apparel exports were recorded at $37.75 billion in the last financial year, registering an annual growth of nearly 10 per cent.Radhakrishnan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi aimed at transforming the sector into a “global powerhouse”, with a target of achieving $100 billion in textile exports by 2030, with the apparel sector contributing 40 per cent.He added that India was now facing competition in textiles and apparel from countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Laos, and that FTAs were important to stay ahead. “We tasted success with the free trade agreement with the United Kingdom and I am sure we will have another FTA with the European Union soon. I am sure you will be doubling your exports in the next three years,” the Vice President said.","Vice President CP Radhakrishnan said that the Centre was working hard to achieve a trade deal with the US.

Sonia Gandhi Criticises PM Modi Over VB-G RAM G Bill And MGNREGA Rollback

What is VB–G RAM G?

NEW DELHI: Congress Rajya Sabha member Sonia Gandhi, reacting to the VB-G RAM G Bill, criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing the central government of attacking the interests of the poor by ""running a bulldozer over MGNREGA "".Sonia Gandhi alleged that the Modi government, over the past 11 years, has ""consistently tried to weaken MGNREGA by neglecting the interests of the rural unemployed, the poor and the marginalised, even though the scheme proved to be a lifeline for these sections during the Covid crisis"".""While the Congress played a major role in bringing MGNREGA into existence and implementing it, the scheme was never about a political party. It was about national interest and public welfare. By weakening this law, the Modi government has attacked the interests of crores of farmers, workers and landless rural poor,"" the former Congress chief claimed.The Rajya Sabha MP further said: ""The Congress had a major contribution in bringing and implementing MGNREGA. It was a scheme connected to the interest of the country and the people. The Modi government has attacked the interests of the poor through this.""'VB-G Ram G' bill, which awaits the President's nod, was passed amid fierce protest by the opposition, particularly the INDIA bloc during the Winter Session of the Parliament.On Thursday, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, speaking in favour of the bill, claimed that the legislation improves substantially on MGNREGA, which was ""riddled"" by corruption and inefficiency.The opposition was demanding that the bill be sent to a parliamentary committee for scrutiny and assailed the government for removing Mahatma Gandhi 's name from the rural employment guarantee scheme.As Chouhan began his reply after Congress MP KC Venugopal's demand for sending Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission-Gramin (VB-G RAM G) Bill to the committee went unheeded, opposition members trooped into the well, tore its copies and continued their protest till the House passed the bill.The government has repealed the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025 represents a major overhaul of MNREGA. Under the proposed law, the government ""establishes a modern statutory framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047, guaranteeing 125 days of wage employment per rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work,"" as per a statement released.","Sonia Gandhi criticises PM Modi over VB-G RAM G Bill and MGNREGA Rollback.

NEW DELHI: The government has ordered a probe into the case of an Air India Express pilot beating up a passenger at Delhi Airport’s Terminal 1 on Friday. The two had a verbal spat between two before Captain Virender Sejwal assaulted the passenger, Ankit Dewan. Why no one, including CISF personnel posted at the entrance, intervened in time, and the matter escalated to such an extent, is being examined.“The ministry of civil aviation has taken serious cognisance of the incident and directed the airline to ground the pilot with immediate effect. A formal enquiry has been ordered. Detailed reports have been sought from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF),” the ministry said on X Saturday. No police complaint has been lodged so far in this case.The Air India Express was “dead heading” to Bengaluru — travelling as a passenger to another place to operate a flight from there — on IndiGo. Dewan was travelling with his family on SpiceJet. After the fight, they went to their destinations. AI Express grounded Captain Sejwal, and he didn’t operate the flight he was rostered to from Bengaluru.What allegedly happened: While Captain Virender Sejwal was at the staff entry gate, CISF personnel directed Dewan to this gate as he was travelling with young children and baggage.He was on one side of the entrance, and the pilot was on the other. “Captain Sejwal was going ahead of his side of the queue being a crew member. Dewan started questioning this in a not very decent language or tone. The CISF personnel asked him not to speak like that. When he did not stop, the captain hit him. The personnel on duty immediately separated them,” said CISF sources.“Our personnel asked Dewan if he wanted to file a police complaint so that they could take him to the airport police station. He gave in writing that he did not want to do so. Both the pilot and Dewan with his family went to their destinations,” CISF sources added.On reaching his destination, Dewan, “a credit card & miles enthusiast”, said on X Friday night: “…one of (AI Express) pilots, Captain Virender Sejwal, assaulted me physically at T1, Delhi Airport. Me & my family were guided to use the security check that the staff uses, because we had a 4-month-old baby in a stroller. The staff was cutting the queue ahead of me. On calling them out, Captain Virender, who himself was doing the same thing, asked me if I was anpadh (uneducated), and couldn't read the signs that said this entry was for staff. A verbal scuffle broke out. Not able to exercise restraint, the AI Express pilot proceeded to physically assault me, leaving me bloody.”Dewan added that he had to “see a doctor” and that his “7-year-old daughter, who saw her father get assaulted brutally, is still traumatised & scared.” “I have no clue how DGCA and Air India Express can allow such pilots to fly. If they can't keep their cool in a scuffle, can they be trusted with the lives of hundreds of people in the sky? How can Delhi Airport get away with such mismanagement, combining staff entry with passengers carrying infants, creating chaos at a sensitive security area? I thought airports were safe places!”An AI Express spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident at Delhi Airport involving one of our employees, who was travelling as a passenger on another airline, and had an altercation with another passenger. We unequivocally condemn such behaviour. The employee concerned has been removed from official duties with immediate effect, pending investigation. Appropriate disciplinary action will be initiated based on the findings of the inquiry. Air India Express upholds the highest standards of conduct and professionalism, and remains committed to ensuring that its employees act responsibly at all times.”Dewan added on X: “I was forced to write a letter stating that I will not pursue this matter further. It was either write that letter, or miss my flight and throw the 1.2 lakh holiday bookings down the drain. Delhi police, why can't I file a complaint after coming back? Must I sacrifice my money too, to seek justice? Will the CCTV footage disappear in the two days till I make it back to Delhi?""","The government has ordered a probe into the case of an Air India Express pilot beating up a passenger.

The family reported that initial calls to emergency services went unanswered, and the investigation only gained momentum after the father contacted a personal acquaintance in the Noida police department.Providing details, additional district govt counsel (ADGC) Varun Kaushik, said, ""Forensic evidence, including semen traces matching the convicts, played a crucial role.""""The court convicted Zuber alias Parvez (35), Mohd Sajid (37) both from Kannauj, and Dharamveer Singh (36), Sunil Kumar (35), Naresh Kumar (46), from Farrukhabad district. Saleem Bawaria (45) - the gang's kingpin - died during the court trial in Dec 2019,"" he added.The ADGC added that ""all the convicts were unable to secure bail and remained in jail since the incident."" ""Their bail was even rejected by the Supreme Court,"" he said. An FIR was registered on the afternoon of July 30, that year, under sections 394, 395, 397 (aggravated forms of robbery and dacoity), 376-D (gangrape), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, and 5/6 of the Pocso Act.""The next day, police arrested Mohd Riyazuddin, Mohd Shahwez and Jabar Singh from Haryana. They were, however, later given clean chit by CBI and let-off,"" Kaushik said. The gravity of the incident led to a CBI probe ordered by the Allahabad high court and resulted in the suspension of several high-ranking police officers for ""negligence"".Notably, the apex court also reprimanded then-UP cabinet minister Azam Khan for calling the incident a ""political conspiracy by the Opposition"". Khan later tendered an apology in court. TOI's extensive coverage at that time exposed the vulnerability of the travellers on desolate stretches of the UP highways, some of them without adequate road lights.Twenty-five witnesses provided testimony during the trial. Of the 11 individuals implicated, the legal outcomes varied - two suspects died in police encounters, one passed away in custody due to illness and three were acquitted for lack of evidence. Saturday's conviction by additional district and sessions judge-III, Omprakash Verma, concluded the lengthy legal process.","A court in Bulandshahr convicted five men for the gruesome crime on Saturday.

"Man carries baby's body in bag, takes bus 70km home",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-carries-babys-body-in-bag-takes-bus-70km-home/articleshow/126098328.cms,"JAMSHEDPUR: Fog hung low over the road as a young father stepped out of a govt hospital in Jharkhand's Chaibasa with nothing left to save. Inside a plastic grocery bag pressed close to his chest lay the body of his four-month-old son. No ambulance was ready. No money remained. So he turned towards a public bus and began a 70km journey home.Dimba Chataumba, a villager from Baljori - a remote settlement under Noamundi PS limits in West Singhbhum district of southern Jharkhand - had come to Chaibasa sadar hospital hoping doctors could keep his infant alive. Instead, by Friday evening, he was forced to carry Krishna's body back himself after the govt-run facility said it could not arrange a vehicle in time.Hospital staff told him to wait more than two hours. Their only working ambulance was far away, near Manoharpur, roughly 80km from Chaibasa, district headquarters of West Singhbhum. Chataumba nodded. Then he disappeared.He returned quietly, bought a thick grocery bag from a nearby shop, placed the 3.6kg body of his son inside and left without informing anyone, choosing a public bus over an uncertain wait.Krishna had been admitted a day earlier, suffering from high fever, loose motion and breathing trouble.Blood tests confirmed malaria. Doctors said the child was anaemic and critically ill, needing ventilator support beyond the hospital's capacity.""The infant was anaemic and was in a critical condition. He required ventilation support. Thursday evening, we asked the boy's father to take him to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College & Hospital in Jamshedpur for further treatment,"" said district civil surgeon Dr Bharti Gorreti Minz.Jamshedpur, 70km from Chaibasa, has advanced referral facilities. Reaching it, though, costs money Chataumba didn't have. He pleaded for treatment to continue at sadar hospital. He told doctors he could not afford transport. Oxygen and medicines were given, but by Friday afternoon, Krishna died.Grief quickly turned into urgency. Chataumba asked for a shav vahan, a hearse ambulance, to carry the body home. With only Rs 100 in his pocket, hiring a private vehicle was impossible. Officials asked him to wait. What happened next unfolded without witnesses.""Nobody at the paediatric ward, nor the hospital guard, was informed by the father about carrying his son's body in the bag. He quietly left the hospital. We all were in the dark,"" Minz added.By the time Chataumba reached home, neighbours gathered as he recounted the ordeal, his words spreading shock across the village.An inquiry ordered by the administration later concluded that the father had left hastily. Chaibasa sub-divisional officer Sandeep Anurag Topno's report said Chataumba could not be contacted when the ambulance eventually arrived because he did not own a cellphone.Scenes like this continue to surface across India, laying bare deep gaps in public healthcare and transport for the poor. In Sept 2024, a Maharashtra couple walked through a muddy forest path with the bodies of their two sons after fever claimed their lives and no vehicle came. In June 2025, a tribal man in Nashik travelled 90km by bus with his newborn's body in a bag after a civil hospital refused an ambulance.Jharkhand has seen its own share of such moments. This year, HC sought explanations from the state after videos showed a man carrying his sick wife on his shoulder when no ambulance arrived. The memory of Odisha's Dana Majhi - who walked 12km with his wife's body in 2016 - still lingers, a case that drew global outrage.Yet, on Friday evening in Chaibasa, those lessons felt distant. Baljori village lies amid forested hills and mining belts near the Odisha border, where public transport is sparse and private vehicles expensive. For families like Chataumba's, a hospital visit already means debt. A referral to a city hospital can mean surrender.","Dimba Chataumba, a villager from Baljori - a remote settlement under Noamundi PS limits in West Singhbhum district of southern Jharkhand.

NEW DELHI: A Congress MP heading a parliamentary committee has called its meeting on Dec 29 to discuss the 'VB G RAM G' bill and to compare it with the UPA-era MGNREGS, a move being seen as an escalation of political battle over the proposed law and which has drawn protest from the members of governing NDA.The agenda of the standing committee on rural development and panchayati raj includes briefing by the rural development ministry on the subject 'Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission-Gramin (VB G RAM G) Bill' and its comparison with the MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme).Congress MP Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka heads the committee.What has surprised BJP MPs of the panel is that the bill, which was passed by Parliament Thursday, is still awaiting Presidential assent. It will become a law only after its gazette notification subsequent to the nod by the President.BJP MP Vivek Thakur, a member of the panel, was unambiguous in questioning the decision, saying it betrays non-application of mind. It is yet to be notified as a law, he noted.BJP-led NDA members, who are in a majority in the committee, may take up the matter with Speaker Om Birla, who wields overriding powers as it is a Lok Sabha committee.Another BJP member said the committee cannot discuss a bill which was only days before debated and passed by Parliament, and that it can only scrutinise its implementation and make recommendations.He said the move to compare the bill with the UPA-era scheme seems to be deliberate politicisation of the issue, with Congress and other opposition parties one in slamming the new measureThe new law will replace the legislation that underpinned the rural employment guarantee scheme named after Mahatma Gandhi, whose name has now been removed.Ulaka had in Lok Sabha said during the discussion over the bill that it be sent to his committee for scrutiny, a consensus demand by opposition parties and which was turned down by the govt. Ulaka has now also written to the LS Speaker saying that the bill should be sent to his commitee.This is not the first time that the committee's agenda, often a prerogative of the panel's chairman, has drawn protest from BJP members.Its decision to invite activist Medha Patkar and actor Prakash Raj, both of whom are vocal critics of BJP's policies, as witnesses during its meeting in July this year to review the implementation of land acquisition law had sparked angry reaction from members of governing party.BJP MPs were especially upset with Patkar's presence, as they called her ""anti-national"" for her campaign against ""development"" works and had stormed out of the meeting, which came to an abrupt end.","The bill, which was passed by Parliament Thursday, is still awaiting Presidential assent.

BAREILLY: A 30-year-old ward boy at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College in Meerut was terminated after allegedly mistaking spirit for water while refilling the oxygen chamber of a nebuliser meant for a four-year-old boy. Other staff members noticed Singh's negligence in time, preventing the spirit from reaching the child.College principal R C Gupta told TOI Saturday that Avinash Singh was inebriated at the time and had a history of reporting for duty in a drunken state. ""He was removed immediately after the matter came to my notice. We have instructed ward in-charges and heads of departments to take action against such staff,"" Gupta said.Another ward boy, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that ""Singh was removed twice earlier by ward in-charge over negligent work but would return as the principal was not cognisant of it."" He said that Singh got into a verbal spat with the child's parents after the incident, following which staff members intervened and took him away. No police case was registered as the parents did not file a complaint.This was the second incident involving misconduct by outsourced staff at the medical college in a week. Last week, two female ward attendants and a ward boy were terminated after they were caught on CCTV assaulting a deaf and mute woman in the 'lawaris' (unclaimed) ward. The footage showed them inserting a stick into the mouth of the mentally challenged woman allegedly following a misunderstanding.","Avinash Singh, 30, mistook spirit for water while refilling the oxygen chamber of a nebuliser meant for a four-year-old boy.

SIM-linking stays but government may up auto logout time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sim-linking-stays-but-government-may-up-auto-logout-time/articleshow/126098316.cms,"file photo

NEW DELHI: While the govt is firm that department of telecommunications' (DoT) Nov 28 direction mandating continuous SIM-binding of messaging apps like WhatsApp is a critical security intervention to check cyber crime and misuse of the apps by foreign intelligence agencies to exfiltrate information from India without traceability, there are indications that it may be open to raising six-hour auto-logout limit for web sessions.The six-hour auto-logout norm - which many messaging apps are resisting on ground that ""logging every 6 hours would cause unacceptable inconvenience"" - is exclusive to web or desktop versions of the messaging apps.According to DoT directions, the web service instance of mobile apps must log out periodically not later than six hours, allowing users to relink devices via QR code. ""This specifically targets the long session vulnerability used in cross-border scams, forcing periodic re-authentication that proves control of the device and SIM. Most banking and UPI apps successfully use this auto-logout security feature,"" said an official.Also, the argument of messaging apps that SIM binding will force users to buy international roaming services from Indian telecom service providers every time they travel abroad, seems rather flimsy considering the same users are willing to spend liberally on airline tickets and hotels abroad, said an officer.Govt sources said the six-hour auto logout limit for web versions can be revisited and raised to 12 or 18 hours, but not beyond 24 hours.A third objection - that DoT cannot issue directions to apps like WhatsApp as they are covered under the IT Act - is also weak as these apps are hosted on mobile networks run by the telecom service providers who are also the primary Internet service providers.With cyber fraud losses having exceeded Rs 22,800 crore in 2024 and some defrauded persons being driven to suicide, govt agencies are unanimous that DoT directions are ""proportionate measures to prevent misuse of telecom identifiers, ensure traceability & protect citizens' trust in India's digital eco-system"".Officials said the DOT direction followed warnings from security establishment, with National Security Council Secretariat having raised the issue in Dec 2024 along with directions to DoT to study SIM-binding requirements for instant messaging applications.MHA formed a technical sub-group in Sept 2024 comprising members from DoT, Delhi Police, MHA, MeitY, IB and TRAI, which recommended binding social media and OTT services to mobile numbers. In April 2025, MHA directed IT intermediaries to implement the technical measures including SIM binding and geo-fencing for communication apps like WhatsApp, to mitigate cybercrime threats.""DoT field units too independently echoed these concerns with law enforcement agencies. Also, cellular operators association of India requested SIM binding implementation in Aug 2025, to surb cross-border frauds and ensure national security,"" a security official told TOI Saturday.","The six-hour auto-logout norm is exclusive to web or desktop versions of the messaging apps.

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in recent reports, flagged how railways failed to boost its non-fare revenue despite holding vast stretches of vacant land and how dues amounting to Rs 4,087 crore from 269 private siding owners remained unrecovered by different zones till March 2023, pointing to weak monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.CAG audit focussed on two activities of RLDA, the railway entity for development of its surplus land for commercial use and revenue generation, commercial development of vacant railway land and construction of multi-functional complexes (MFC), from 2018-19 to 2022-23. It found that as of March 2023, railways owned 4.88 lakh hectares of land, of which 62,740 hectares was lying vacant, with only 997.8 hectares (1.6%) having been entrusted to RLDA. During this period, the Railway Board had received 188 proposals for 657 hectares, and it entrusted 59 of the 188 proposals to RLDA, following which RLDA awarded 35 sites to developers.It found that despite availability of such quantum of land, RLDA, as of March 2023, could award only 8.8% (87.76 hectares) of land entrusted to it for development. It noticed that several sites were entrusted to RLDA despite unresolved land title issues, encroachments and other encumbrances, resulting in non-monetisation of such sites.It identified systemic and operational issues that had adversely affected timely monetisation of railway land and realisation of revenue.It observed that Railway Board, while processing proposals for entrustment of land to RLDA, should have ensured that the land parcels were free from encroachments and other encumbrances, noting that weak inter-agency coordination in Indian Railways had contributed significantly to delays. ""Alarmingly, none of the awarded commercial sites were developed as of March 2023,"" the report added.In another report, it detected the failure of railway zones to recover dues outstanding from private siding owners.

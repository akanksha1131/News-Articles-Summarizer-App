NEW DELHI: Gitanjali Angmo, wife of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk , moved the Supreme Court on Friday seeking his release.This comes two days after she reached out to President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday to seek her intervention for the release of the climate activist, who has been lodged in Jodhpur jail in Rajasthan since being taken into custody following the September 24 violent clashes in Ladakh.In a three-page letter addressed to the President Murmu, Angmo alleged ""witch-hunt"" against her husband for espousing the cause of the people over the past four years and said she is completely unaware about her husband's condition.Wangchuk was detained under National Security Act (NSA) on September 26, two days after violent clashes in Leh town left four persons dead and scores of others injured.The violence broke out during the protests in support of the demands, including statehood for Ladakh and the the region's inclusion in Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.Gitanjali J Angmo, who is also the CEO of Himalayan Institute of Alternatives (HAIL), on Thursday also slammed the Centre and alleged police torture against the people of Ladakh after the September 24 violence in the Union Territory.Comparing the current situation in Ladakh to that during British India, she said that the Union Home Ministry is ""misusing"" the Ladakh Police.""Is India really free? In 1857, 24,000 Britishers used 135,000 Indian sepoys to oppress 300 million Indians under orders from the Queen.

Idol immersion: JCB deployed to pull out trolley

INDORE: Vijayadashami celebrations ended in a tragedy as 11 people, mostly teenagers, drowned on Thursday evening when a tractor-trolley carrying devotees who had gone for Durga idol immersion overturned in a pond in Ardala village of MP’s Khandwa district. The accident took place when the tractor-trolley, carrying about 20-25 people, lost balance and toppled into the water.Officials said a local kotwar had cautioned the driver against taking the tractor-trolley into the water body, but the warning was ignored. The vehicle, while reversing, likely hit a stone and overturned, throwing all occupants into the pond. Many managed to swim to safety, but 11 could not be rescued, said DIG Bahuguna.CM Mohan Yadav expressed grief over the loss of lives and announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased. Khandwa DIG Siddharth Bahuguna said seven of the deceased were females and that there were eight minors among the dead.Three others were admitted to hospital. One remains critical while the other two are out of danger,” Khandwa DIG Siddharth Bahuguna said. Rescue operations began immediately, with police, administration and local teams rushing to the spot. A JCB machine was deployed to pull out the trolley. By 6pm, 10 bodies had been recovered, and after a three-hour search, the body of the last missing child — an eight-year-old girl — was found around 8.45pm.","A tractor-trolley carrying devotees who had gone for Durga idol immersion overturned in a pond in Ardala village of MP’s Khandwa district.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

Govt using police to silence victims, oppn: Bhim Army chief

MEERUT/BAREILLY: Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon amid fears of unrest on Friday when people will gather to offer juma namaz. According to a govt notification, internet services will remain suspended in Bareilly from 3 pm on Oct 2 to 3 pm on Oct 4.Security has been tightened across four districts in Bareilly division, with heavy deployment of forces on streets and drones in air. Some sensitive areas in the city looked like fortresses, and many roads and lanes in localities remained deserted.City magistrate Alankar Agnihotri said, “Internet will remain suspended for 48 hours, considering the sensitivity of the situation.” The precaution follows last week’s clashes during a procession after Friday prayers over ‘I Love Muhammad’ row. Police resorted to lathi charge to control the situation. So far, over 80 people, including local cleric and Ittehad-e-Millat Council president Tauqeer Raza Khan, his close associates Dr Nafees Khan and Nadeem Khan, have been arrested.On Thursday, Ala Hazrat Association urged the people to offer Friday namaz peacefully and return home promptly.From the Sunni Markaz at Dargah Ala Hazrat, Jamaat Raza-e-Mustafa national vice-president Salman Hasan Khan appealed to imams and the public to maintain peace, avoid rumours and cooperate with authorities. He also requested special prayers during Friday sermons for harmony.In Muslim-majority areas fears of impending action by the administration prevailed. Teams from Bareilly Development Authority are surveying properties to identify violations. Structures without approved maps or violating building regulations will face notices, sealing and demolition.The authority’s vice-chairman Manikandan A said, “Action is being taken at every level against those accused of rioting and their supporters. Every illegal brick will be accounted for. This drive will serve as a lesson to accused and a warning to others who break the law”.In Saharanpur, Chandrashekhar Azad was put under house arrest as he was planning to meet families of those affected in last week’s violence. Azad accused govt of “using police to silence victims and opposition voices” and demanded an impartial probe into the violence.“Following a letter from Bareilly district magistrate, police force from Fatehpur and Dehat police stations were deployed outside Azad’s house in Chhutmalpur area of Saharanpur. His presence in Bareilly might lead to law-and-order issues in that city,” Saharanpur SSP Ashish Tiwari told TOI.On Wednesday, two Congress leaders — Saharanpur MP Imran Masood and former MP from Amroha Kunwar Danish Ali —were put under house arrest to stop them from visiting Bareilly.","Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath Singh warns Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region.

Why Indira didn’t let Rajiv attend two proposed meetings with Bhindranwale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indira-didnt-let-rajiv-attend-two-proposed-meetings-with-bhindranwale/articleshow/124278925.cms,"Indira Gandhi

NEW DELHI: The year 1984 is a defining moment in Sikh history but could events have taken a different course? A new book suggests there were windows of opportunity to control militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, but these were squandered because “politics and politicians came in the way of conflict resolution”.In the months leading up to Operation Blue Star , then PM Indira Gandhi wanted her son Rajiv to secretly meet and negotiate with Bhindranwale. Two meetings were even set up by then Congress MP Amarinder Singh between 1982-84 but they never materialised because Indira was worried that her son’s life might be in danger.The last-minute cancellation of the meetings infuriated Bhindranwale, who later moved into the Golden Temple in Amritsar, setting the stage for Operation Blue Star, Gandhi’s assassination and the 1984 riots, making the year among the bloodiest in India’s political history.“I set up the meeting twice. The first time [in 1982], I picked up Rajiv and we drove to the Safdarjung airport where a special aircraft was to fly us to the Ambala Air Force station, where Bhindranwale was already waiting for us. We were recalled before we could reach the airstrip. I had to make up a story and told Bhindranwale that we couldn’t make it because the plane had developed a technical snag,” Singh says in an interview to journalist Harinder Baweja in her book ‘They Will Shoot You, Madam: My Life Through Conflict’.The book says, “Within a fortnight, Amarinder picked up Rajiv Gandhi again. They were to, once again, go to the Ambala Air Force station where Bhindranwale had already reached. This time, Amarinder was sure they would make it for the meeting. They were airborne, and on their way, but the pilot got a radio message asking him to return.”According to Singh, the second meeting was aborted because Gandhi had been told by then Punjab CM Darbara Singh that there were plans to ambush Rajiv. He claims Rajiv shared this with him. The book says, “Amarinder also suspects that Darbara Singh, who had favoured Bhindranwale’s arrest, wanted to get back to his bête noire, Zail Singh and that he was the one who told Mrs Gandhi to not let her son walk into the trap.”Another lost opportunity was in 1981. Bhindranwale was arrested for the murder of Punjab Kesari editor Lala Jagat Narain, but released within weeks after home minister Zail Singh told Parliament there was no evidence against him. “Once free, Bhindranwale went to Delhi to celebrate. He was accompanied by close to a hundred supporters who openly brandished their weapons.Home Minister Zail Singh made no attempt to rearrest him; nor did Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,” writes Baweja. “The seniormost politicians of the country catapulted Bhindranwale into a hero. The genie was now out of the bottle.”",A new book suggests there were windows of opportunity to control militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.

NEW DELHI: A scuffle broke out between ABVP and Left-affiliated outfits and charges and counter-charges were traded in JNU over a Ravan Dahan and a Durga immersion on Thursday.The Leftist outfits alleged that an effigy of former students Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam - who are facing trial in a 2020 Delhi riots case - along with Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, was burnt during a Ravan Dahan. They accused ABVP of communal propaganda. ABVP, on the other hand, alleged that its Durga immersion procession was attacked.Videos from the campus showed groups of students raising slogans and flashing slippers, while security personnel formed a chain to prevent an escalation.TOI was unable to independently confirm the details of the two events.ABVP said the effigy burning was symbolic of the end of ""Naxalism, Leftism, Maoist violence and anti-national ideologies"". Khalid, Imam, Guru and Naxal movement leaders Charu Mazumdar and Kanu Sanyal had replaced Ravan's heads. ABVP, on the other hand, said the Left groups threw stones and abused students at the Durga Visarjan. JNUSU joint secretary Vaibhav Meena, who is from ABVP, said it was a ""direct assault on the cultural harmony of the university"" and ""the soil of JNU will no longer be the centre for glorifying Naxalism and Leftist mentality"".ABVP's statement said that the Left groups ""attacked"" the immersion procession near the Sabarmati T-Point around 7 pm"". It said several students were injured, PTI reported.The Left-affiliated outfits rejected the claim. They asked why Nathuram Godse or Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh were not depicted as Ravan. ""JNU rejects the politics of hate and Islamophobia,"" they said.","A scuffle broke out between ABVP and Left-affiliated outfits and charges and counter-charges were traded in JNU on Thursday.

Poll Should there be stricter regulations on how schools discipline students? Yes, to protect student rights. No, schools need the freedom to manage behavior.





CHANDIGARH: The principal and driver of a private school in Sonipat have been arrested for brutally thrashing a class 2 student.

'Pakistan Could Not Kill Him But...': Father On Kargil War Veteran Killed In Ladakh Clashes

Poll Do you think Ladakh should have more local governance powers? Yes, more autonomy is needed No, current administration is sufficient

LEH: At Martyrs’ Park, about 1km from the Ladakh Hill Development Council (LAHDC-Leh) office, the gate stood open during curfew relaxation. Inside, chairs were stacked and a tent was dismantled. Labourers were quietly loading chairs, tent covers and iron rods into a vehicle, their faces grim.It was here that environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh. “We provide tents on rent. They called us to take it back,” a worker said. Startled at the sight of a reporter, he said, “Please go away, cops will come and we will be in trouble.”A woman entered with her child. “I was on hunger strike on Sept 24 when the situation worsened outside,” she said. “Out of fear, some of us ran in different directions. My husband later picked me up. I came back to collect my belongings.”On Sept 24, security forces opened fire on protesters demanding Sixth Schedule status, killing four and injuring dozens. Wangchuk called off his hunger strike hours later. Authorities said the police fired in self-defence after protesters tried to set ablaze a vehicle carrying security personnel.Police also claimed that without CRPF deployment, “the whole of Leh would have burnt”.Outside the park, another woman voiced her anger. “Why were people fired upon? Four people are dead. Will they give us Sixth Schedule?”About 1km away BJP’s Ladakh office, which was set on fire, was under heavy guard with spools of concertina wire around it. Cops prohibit photography of the building.At the LAHDC-Leh office, the main gate was open but there was no one there. “Since Sept 24, chief executive officer Tashi Gyalson and others haven’t come to office. In fact, no one comes,” a peon said.Mustafa Ladakhi, 36, a PhD from JNU, is among a growing number of Ladakhis at the country’s top universities concerned about home. At a hotel near Leh airport, he said the region is still in shock.“On Sept 24, my mother was on a hunger strike led by Wangchuk. There was chaos when she called me. I found her in the middle of the road. I will never forget the pain that day brought to Ladakhis,” he said. “No official has stepped down. There is no empathy. There is no apology. Instead, we are accused in the national media of destabilising the central govt... How can we be a threat when we have paid with our lives for the nation?”He argued that UT status without statehood had buried local governance under bureaucracy. “Instead of empowering local govt, we have the lieutenant governor’s office and its bureaucracy, commissioner secretaries, the DC’s office, and the police bureaucracy. They have nothing to do in Ladakh. All we see is pomp and a show of bureaucracy... Allow us to govern ourselves,” he said.“When we were part of J&K, AFSPA was never extended to Ladakh because govt knew we were Indian nationalists. Why this labelling now?” he asked.Ladakhi’s friend, a hotel owner, said, “I don’t want to talk about tourism. This is a colossal tragedy. Four deaths in a place like Ladakh are like 400 in Delhi. Sept 24 will remain etched in our memory.”In Upper Tukchal area of Leh, Rigzin Wangmo Lachic, president of All Ladakh Hotel and Guest House Association, echoed similar sentiments and demanded a judicial inquiry. “The events have shattered us and left a wound on our collective soul,” she said.At a hotel serving Kashmiri wazwan on Oct 1, during curfew relaxation, the receptionist from Doda said he no longer felt safe. “I’ve been here 10 years and never faced hostility. But after the lieutenant governor described workers from Doda and Nepal as ‘external forces’ responsible for the crisis, we are not stepping out much.”As curfew returned, shops shut ahead of the 6 pm deadline. “We comply with every direction. But govt must fulfil our four demands, including Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Gelek Punchok, 42, a member of Leh Apex Body, said. Punchok was outside the district jail, with many others, to receive around 26 prisoners released Thursday after they were given bail. Many of the released detainees said they had nothing to do with the Sept 24 violence but stated that they were with the “peaceful” struggle for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.","Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh.

NEW DELHI: Trading company Wintrack Inc has levelled serious allegations of corruption and harassment against customs officials in Chennai and announced that it is halting exports and imports from the country, prompting the revenue department to initiate a probe by a senior official.In an eight-minute video posted on X on Thursday, the company’s CEO, Prawin Ganeshan, who described himself as a first-generation entrepreneur sourcing goods from China, has enumerated a series of events starting in Jan, when he first raised a red flag over a bribery demand of Rs 8 lakh from customs officials for a $1,300 package. He alleged an official from Delhi faceless assessment unit had made the demand, but the issue was resolved after he raised it on X. The posts were deleted subsequently, he said.Then in May, when three of his consignments were held up, he paid a bribe of Rs 3 lakh to two units, though not to those working in the “shed”, he alleged. Despite paying the bribe his goods were released after three weeks, he added. Things deteriorated from June when officials in the “shed” refused to clear goods and demanded a bribe of Rs 1.5 lakh, citing payments made to other departments.Since then, Ganeshan alleged, the officials had been raising issues and lodging complaints with seniors.He then floated a company in his wife’s name, and the first consignment was cleared. “When the second shipment came, the officer in the shed refused to examine the shipment and it is still pending,” Ganeshan said in the video and accused a deputy commissioner in the “shed” of threatening his company representatives. “I heard that they are planning revenge, planning to raid and affect my personal life,” he said.The video was posted a day after Chennai Customs, on its official X handle, described the earlier allegations as false. While taking note of the Chennai Customs’ response, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs stepped in, promising necessary action. The finance ministry said a detailed investigation by a senior revenue department official had been ordered.","Trading company Wintrack Inc has levelled serious allegations of corruption and harassment against customs officials in Chennai.

Taliban minister's visit will help explore new areas of cooperation

NEW DELHI: The stunning turnaround in India’s ties with Taliban in the past few years on the back of its humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan is set to intensify further with a likely visit by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India on Oct 9-10.He is expected to meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar on the second day of the first trip to India by a senior Taliban official since the group took over the reins of Afghanistan in 2021.New Delhi had been in touch with Kabul since Aug for Muttaqi’s visit. As he faces a UNSC travel ban, India approached the Council for a waiver. It’s understood the request has now been granted, allowing the Centre to finalise the dates.The unprecedented visit by the senior Taliban minister will cap a landmark year in India’s ties with Taliban that saw India shedding inhibitions of the past to upgrade its engagements with the regime in Kabul, despite not recognising it officially.This was done through a meeting between foreign minister Muttaqi and foreign secretary Vikram Misri in Dubai in Jan and the first political contact in the form of a phone call between Jaishankar and the Afghan minister in May.Backing India’s decision to host a Taliban minister, the Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI last month high-level visits are required to upgrade and strengthen ties. Shaheen had also said the visit will pave the way for exploring various fields of cooperation.In their meeting in Dubai, Misri assured Muttaqi India would consider engaging in development projects soon, in addition to continuing its ongoing humanitarian assistance programme.",Acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi set to visit India on Oct 9-10.

India-China cooperation Will Make The 21st Century a Genuine Asian Century: Chinese Envoy Xu Feihong

NEW DELHI: In the middle of Dussehra festivities, India Thursday announced resumption of direct air services with China from late Oct, marking another significant step in efforts to normalise the relationship that saw PM Narendra Modi visiting Tianjin last month for the SCO summit and also having a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping.This is the second major step taken by India to facilitate regular exchanges between the two countries, after govt resumed tourist visas for Chinese nationals.Govt said in a statement that the agreement between civil aviation authorities would further ease people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges, and economic cooperation.Direct flights remained suspended since early 2020, initially because of the pandemic and later because of military and political tensions. India’s efforts to normalise the relationship have acquired a greater sense of urgency because of its recent experience with the Trump administration. Both countries had agreed in principle to resume air services in Jan during foreign secretary Vikram Misri’s visit. Since then, said MEA, civil aviation authorities had been engaged in technical-level discussions on resuming direct air services and on a revised Air Services Agreement.Shortly after MEA’s announcement, IndiGo said it would start a daily nonstop between Kolkata and Guangzhou from Oct 26. The airline will fly between Delhi and Guangzhou, the date for which will be announced shortly. Air India is likely to resume China flights with a nonstop between Delhi and Shanghai by the year-end, say sources.IndiGo said its “familiarity with local partners” enabled it to resume these flights swiftly. IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said: “This will once again allow seamless movement of people, goods, and ideas, while also strengthening bilateral ties between two of the world’s most populous countries and fast-growing economies...” The flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou will open for sale from Friday.","Direct flights remained suspended since early 2020, initially because of the pandemic and later because of military and political tensions.

NIRF to begin negative marking for dishonesty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirf-to-begin-negative-marking-for-dishonesty/articleshow/124278793.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Centre is rewriting the rulebook for India’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), in what could be the sharpest overhaul of the country’s higher education rankings since their inception in 2015. For the first time, penalties are being formally stitched into the ranking methodology, signalling a tougher stance on research malpractice and misrepresentation of data. The negative marking system will soon be declared.This year, the framework docked some marks from an institute’s overall score if published papers were retracted by academic journals. From the coming year, though, the consequences will be deeper and wider. Not only will universities be penalised for retracted work, but even citations of such tainted papers will draw heavy deductions in the research score — effectively broadening the circle of accountability.The change is aimed at curbing what officials describe as a “weakness” in India’s research ecosystem. Papers withdrawn for plagiarism, duplication or manipulated data often continue to be cited, giving them a false academic afterlife.“Retractions damage the credibility of the system.And when retracted papers are cited, they really hold no meaning. And hence, such instances need to be doubly punished with harsher negative marks,” said professor Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the ranking committee. By extending penalties to citations, he explained, govt is signalling zero tolerance towards dishonesty in academic output.The revised rules will also push institutions to institute stronger internal checks. Universities that persistently accumulate lapses may face the ultimate penalty — being struck off the rankings altogether. “While the final decision to debar institutes that continue to deliberately misrepresent has not yet been taken, the committee is serious about such cases and is likely to consider harsh measures,” added Sahasrabudhe.“Rankings are signals to students, employers, investors of faith in an institution. To be rubbed off the table would mean more than a bruise to reputation; it may mean a shut door to opportunity,” said an official.NIRF evaluates institutions across five broad parameters: teaching and learning, graduation outcomes, research, outreach and perception. With over 8,700 institutions participating in the 2024 cycle, its results have become a widely referenced barometer for students, recruiters and policymakers.Experts point out the higher education sector is at a crossroads: on the one hand, the country seeks a larger global footprint in research and innovation, and on the other, it must work to weed out malpractice that risks damaging credibility. Sharper rules, they argue, are a warning and an opportunity. Universities need to invest in ethics training, plagiarism detection systems & transparent review mechanisms, lest a single tainted citation pull down their standing, said Sahasrabudhe.","For the first time, penalties are being formally stitched into the ranking methodology.

This is the second mosque to face demolition in Sambhal within four months.Sambhal SP KK Bishnoi said notices under Section 67 of UP Land Revenue Code were issued on Sept 2, giving owners 30 days to remove the structures. “When no action was taken, authorities proceeded with the demolition.”The hall was razed using bulldozers under heavy police and PAC presence, while the mosque committee sought four days to clear the encroachment, which has already begun. Drone surveillance was used, and villagers were advised to stay indoors.Authorities said the structures, including a madrassa, were on gram sabha and pond land. Residents claimed the marriage hall was built with donations and requested alternate land.","Sambhal district administration Thursday demolished a mosque and a 30,000-sq-ft marriage hall.

Money trail traced to cities

NEW DELHI: ED has launched a massive nationwide drive against cybercrimes through its offices in more than 28 cities. It has identified proceeds of crime (PoC) worth over Rs 28,000 crore and attached assets of more than Rs 8,500 crore in ongoing investigations.Sources said all zonal offices have been roped in to investigate cybercrime cases where state police or other agencies have already registered FIRs for scheduled offences under PMLA. The special task force and two headquarters investigation units (HIUs) in Delhi have also been tasked with probing high-value cases. So far, ED has arrested at least 106 accused persons and suspects.A two-day coordination meeting in Srinagar last month, chaired by ED director Rahul Navin, reviewed the spread of cybercrime and its impact on vulnerable sections of society. A study presented at the meeting revealed how masterminds of scams and ponzi schemes operate from abroad, siphoning funds through hawala or crypto channels. Involvement of online payment gateways is also under probe.The paper highlighted major cases: Raipur zonal office is probing the country’s largest cybercrime case against illegal betting platforms with PoC of Rs 8,000 crore; Mumbai offices are handling cases worth Rs 6,000 crore; the two Delhi HIUs, Rs 5,300 crore; and Hyderabad, Rs 2,600 crore.In the Mahadev Online Betting App case, ED traced laundering of over Rs 8,000 crore. More than 160 searches yielded Rs 19 crore in cash, valuables worth Rs 17 crore, and freezing of bank/DEMAT accounts holding Rs 2,311 crore. Thirteen arrests have been made, and extradition of the masterminds from the UAE is being pursued.The app allegedly enabled illegal betting on cricket, card games and even elections."," ED has identified proceeds of crime (PoC) worth over Rs 28,000 crore.

Reds hack villager to death in Bastar



RAIPUR: In a boost to Chhattisgarh govt’s surrender policy and a setback for banned CPI (Maoist), 103 Naxals, including 49 carrying a cumulative reward of Rs 1 crore, laid down arms before senior police and paramilitary officials in Bijapur district of Bastar division Thursday.Each surrendered cadre was given a cheque of Rs 50,000 as immediate assistance under the surrender and rehabilitation policy.“This is not merely a surrender of weapons, but the defeat of a Maoist ideology sustained for decades through violence,” said Dantewada range DIG Kamlochan Kashyap, who, along with CRPF Bijapur DIG B S Negi and Bijapur SP Jitendra Kumar Yadav, presided over the ceremony.SP Yadav said the rehabilitation scheme offers Maoists and their families a chance to live peacefully in the mainstream. Revolutionary people’s committees, once Maoists’ parallel governance structure, are collapsing as members return in large numbers. The killing of senior commanders in encounters and the surrender of top cadres have deepened the leadership vacuum, forcing lower-level members to give up arms, Yadav added.Appealing to remaining Maoists still active in jungles, the SP urged them to avail themselves of the policy.Since Jan 1, 410 Maoists have surrendered, 421 arrested, and 137 have been killed in Bijapur.A group of Maoists barged into a villager’s house, dragged him out, and hacked him to death in front of his family and relatives, accusing him of being a police informer, in Bijapur dist of Chhattisgarh’s Bastar division Wednesday night.Villagers alerted police, who rushed to the village and sent the body of Madkam Bhima for autopsy. Cops described the killing as another instance of Reds targeting innocent villagers to spread fear, particularly as security ops intensify in Bastar.","103 Naxals, including 49 carrying a cumulative reward of Rs 1 crore, laid down arms before senior police and paramilitary officials.

NEW DELHI: Crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for starting the revival of 'khadi' from the time he was chief minister of Gujarat, home minister Amit Shah said the sales of khadi and village industry products have jumped five-fold from Rs 33,000 crore to over Rs 1.7 lakh crore in the past 11 years of Modi govt at the Centre.Sharing this information during a visit to the Khadi India showroom in Connaught Place here on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti , Shah appealed to the people of the country to make the khadi and swadeshi campaigns successful by having each family resolve to purchase khadi products worth at least Rs 5,000 rupees annually. ""This will provide employment to millions of people and bring light into their lives...when we adopt the vow of swadeshi, we also align ourselves with the ambitious campaign to take India to the top position in the world by 2047,"" he stated.

""We should make these campaigns a part of our nature and pass them on to our future generations,"" he suggested.Shah said Mahatma Gandhi had recognized the soul of India and awakened the common people to stand against the British.He said Gandhiji had woven many elements into the freedom movement that continue to shape the map of India's future, and it is from these elements that khadi and swadeshi had emerged. He said the khadi and swadeshi were synonymous with the freedom movement and Mahatma Gandhi, by giving these two concepts to the country, not only accelerated the freedom movement but also positively changed the lives of many poor people in the country.Stating that the ideas of khadi and swadeshi were ""forgotten"" for a long time, he said Narendra Modi, during his tenure as the Gujarat chief minister, launched a focused campaign to revive khadi in 2003. ""That marked the beginning of the movement to revive khadi. Khadi has once again become an item of common use among people,"" he said.Shah mentioned how the prime minister, through his 'Mann Ki Baat' program, has been promoting the idea of Swadeshi, inspiring the people of the country to connect with economic development and the ' Make in India ' campaign.

Cody Bellinger’s Free Agency Decision

Pete Alonso Enters the Market

Implications for MLB and New York

The 2025 MLB offseason is shaping up to be one of the most exciting in recent memory, particularly for fans in New York. Two of the city’s biggest stars - Cody Bellinger of the New York Yankees and Pete Alonso of the Mets - are both expected to hit the open market. With MVP résumés, strong recent seasons, and major contract decisions looming, the coming months could define the direction of New York baseball and the broader league landscape.Cody Bellinger, who joined the New York Yankees after signing a three-year, $80 million deal with the Cubs, has reestablished himself as a premier offensive and defensive force. In 2025, he delivered a strong season, slashing .272/.334/.480 while adding 29 home runs and 97 RBIs. His versatility in the outfield and improved consistency at the plate have made him one of the New York Yankees’ most valuable contributors alongside Aaron Judge.However, Cody Bellinger’s contract includes an opt-out clause, and all signs point toward him exercising it. League insiders believe he is aiming for a much larger deal this winter, with projections suggesting he could command upwards of $180 million.While Bellinger has expressed interest in staying with the New York Yankees due to their championship aspirations, his free agency will likely generate heavy competition. The Yankees’ front office faces the challenge of balancing their already massive payroll, which ranks among the top three in baseball, with the need to retain a player who has become central to their offensive attack.Meanwhile, Pete Alonso - the Mets’ beloved “Polar Bear” - has officially opted out of the final year of his two-year, $54 million deal. The first baseman is coming off another powerful season, smashing 38 home runs, driving in 126 RBIs (the second-highest total in the National League), and posting a .272 batting average with an .871 OPS. Beyond the numbers, Alonso’s improved Statcast data, including his exit velocity and hard-hit rate, underline his continued dominance as one of the game’s premier power hitters.Alonso also enters free agency without draft-pick compensation attached, boosting his appeal to prospective suitors. His offensive production and status as a fan-favorite cornerstone make him one of the most coveted players available. A long-term, high-value contract is all but guaranteed, and while the Mets will undoubtedly attempt to re-sign him, the competition for his services is expected to be fierce.The simultaneous free agency of Cody Bellinger and Alonso sets the stage for one of the most compelling offseasons in years. For the New York Yankees, the priority lies in keeping Bellinger to ensure their lineup remains among the league’s most potent, especially after missing out on big-name targets last offseason. His presence alongside Judge gives New York a formidable middle order, but the financial weight of a new deal may complicate negotiations.For the Mets, Alonso’s decision forces the franchise to confront tough questions about its future core. Losing their most consistent power threat would create a major void, not just on the field but also in terms of fan engagement. At the same time, Alonso’s free agency will drive up the market for first basemen, influencing other clubs’ plans and adding further intrigue to the winter ahead.As the curtain falls on the 2025 MLB season, attention shifts squarely to a free agency period defined by two stars: Cody Bellinger and Pete Alonso. Both are opting out of their current contracts in pursuit of long-term, high-value deals, and their decisions will reverberate throughout the league. For fans in New York, this offseason carries heightened stakes, as the futures of two franchise-defining players hang in the balance.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Toronto Blue Jays All-Star Shortstop Predicted to Land $180 Million Contract With bidding wars on the horizon and teams eager to land elite talent, the stage is set for a dramatic and high-stakes winter.

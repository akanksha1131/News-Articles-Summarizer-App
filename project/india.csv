NEW DELHI: BJP leader and West Bengal's leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Thursday 'felicitated' the three men arrested for allegedly assaulting two chicken patty vendors at a Gita recital event in Kolkata, shortly after they were released on bail.Adhikari, once a close aide of chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee , posted photos of the event on Facebook.""I want to tell Mamata Banerjee that you cannot suppress ‘sanatanis’ by unleashing your loyalist police on them. The fight to protect religion will continue, and in this fight, I stand with every Hindu, along with countless supporters of Hindutva,"" the Nandigram MLA wrote.Later, speaking to reporters, Adhikari remarked that “the voice of justice still prevails silently in India.” Referring to Banerjee’s earlier comments on the controversy, he alleged that the chief minister had “arrogantly” claimed credit for the arrests.""Who is she to decide arrests?"" he asked.He emphasised that while he is a legislator, leader of the opposition and BJP member, his identity as a Hindu comes first. “If my Hindu brothers and sisters are in trouble, my primary duty is to protect my dharma. That is what the Gita has taught me,” he asserted.Adhikari also took credit for the trio’s release, noting that he had sent his legal team to the Maidan police station—where the case was registered—and coordinated with several lawyers who worked together to secure their bail.The three were released by the Bankshall court on personal bonds of Rs 1,000 each.The vendors had complained that a group of youths assaulted them for selling non-vegetarian food at the religious event and forced them to do sit-ups while holding their ears. Police intervened after a purported video of the incident went viral on social media.","BJP leader and West Bengal's leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari 'felicitated' the three men arrested for allegedly assaulting two chicken patty vendors at a Gita recital event in Kolkata.

'We will have to do something now': Supreme Court moves on passive euthanasia plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-will-have-to-do-something-now-supreme-court-moves-on-passive-euthanasia-plea/articleshow/125923481.cms,"Supreme Court

We can't allow 31-yr-old to live like this, that's for sure, says SC

NEW DELHI: The choice is between an artificially sustained painful life and peaceful death. As a medical board of four specialised doctors told Supreme Court about the condition of 31-year-old Harish Rana who has been living with 100% disability in a permanent vegetative state for 13 years and stressed the negligible chance of his recovery, the court Thursday decided to set in motion the next stage of the process for passive euthanasia A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan asked the director of AIIMS Delhi to set up a secondary medical board, the second step as per the procedure laid down by the apex court in 2018, and simplified in 2023, on euthanasia pleas. The plea was filed by Harish's father, Ashok Rana.Going through the report of the primary medical board set up by Noida District Hospital, the bench noted there was no hope of recovery. ""The bare reading of the letter would indicate Harish is in a pathetic condition. He was found to be lying on a bed with tracheostomy tube for respiration and gastrostomy for feeding. The photographs attached with the letter would indicate he has suffered huge bed sores. The team of doctors are of the opinion that the chance of his recovery from the present state is negligible. Harish appears to be in this vegetative condition for the past 13 years.In such circumstances...we should now proceed to the next stage in the process,"" the bench said.As per the apex court's guidelines, a secondary medical board comprising one registered medical practitioner nominated by the chief medical officer (CMO) of the district and at least two subject experts with at least five years' experience in the specialty concerned has to be constituted after a primary medical board approves withdrawing artificial life support for a patient in a vegetative state. Though advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, appearing for the petitioner, said that there was no need for a secondary board as the CMO was involved in the primary medical board itself, the bench decided to adhere to the procedure.It said this would be in accordance with the decision of the SC in the 'common cause' case. ""We request the director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi to constitute a secondary board, as referred to above, and give us a report by next Wednesday, ie Dec 17. Let the matter come up for hearing on Thursday,"" the bench said.At the end of the hearing, the court remarked, ""We will have to do something now. We can't allow him to live like this. That's for sure.""Harish's case will be the first to see a court monitor the process on a euthanasia plea since SC framed guidelines and the procedure to allow it. In 2018, the court legalised passive euthanasia by allowing withdrawal of life support for terminally ill patients and ruled that the ""right to die with dignity"" is a part of the fundamental right to life.The court subsequently modified its order in 2023 to simplify the process and put in place two-tier medical board to take the call on a plea for passive euthanasia and also allowed the kin of the patient to move the high court concerned in case of denial of the same.Harish had fallen from the fourth floor of his paying guest accommodation on Aug 20, 2013, while he was pursuing a B Tech degree at Punjab University. He was treated at various hospitals, but his condition did not improve. His father had first moved Delhi HC, which refused his plea to refer the case to a primary medical board.Challenging the HC order, the father said Harish's existence in his current state is a violation of his fundamental right to dignity, and the HC had erred in not adhering to apex court guidelines.","Harish Rana, 31, has been living with 100% disability in a permanent vegetative state for 13 years.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

PM-Trump call signals greater India-US willingness to engage

NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing efforts by India and the US to finalise a bilateral trade deal, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation while also discussing regional and global issues.The conversation came within a week of Modi's summit with Russian President Putin and in the middle of renewed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on the back of Trump's peace plan.The two sides are looking to arrive at a common understanding on issues amid indications that US is still seeking access for its farm products like corn and soybean, among other issues. The two sides have been in talks for a bilateral trade pact since March.""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Modi posted on X.PM Modi is learnt to have reiterated India's position that it will support all international efforts for peace.""Modi and Trump reviewed the steady progress in India-US bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments,"" said an Indian readout. This was the first conversation between the two since they had a call days after Diwali.Thursday's telephonic conversation signals a greater willingness on both sides to engage as there has been progress in most areas, barring trade, for which Trump has imposed 50% import duty on Indian products, comprising 25% reciprocal tariff and another 25% secondary tariffs for purchasing Russian oil and defence equipment.The move has hit several Indian exports, including textiles, leather, gems and jewellery and shrimps. While negotiators from the two sides have been engaging in a dialogue to resolve the issue, the Trump administration is yet to ease the tariffs, despite an acknowledgment by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the offer on the table is the best received so far.The conversation follows recent efforts by both sides to revive bilateral engagements after the trade-related impasse. US also joined India and other Quad nations in condemning the Red Fort terror incident in a Quad counter-terrorism dialogue. Both sides also separately held their own terrorism dialogue.India and US held foreign office consultations this week with a focus on key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, defence, the TRUST initiative for cooperation in critical technologies, energy, including civil nuclear collaboration, and critical minerals.According to US, the meeting was an opportunity to translate President Trump and PM Modi's vision from their Feb meeting this year into ""concrete progress that enhances US security, jobs and competitiveness, while supporting India's long-term goals"".""The Under Secretary emphasised US' aim to deepen cooperation in defense, energy, technology, space, and trusted supply chains and the value of US-India cooperation that fuels US innovation while supporting India's rise as a global technology leader,"" a US embassy spokesperson said.While the US statement did not mention the Indo-Pacific, an Indian readout said that the discussions also covered regional and global developments of mutual interest, with both sides underscoring their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.","PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation.

It has been acccused of engineering the disruption to force, leveraging its market dominance, the ministry to roll back the Flight Duty Time Limitation regulation as implementing them would have required it to hire more pilots.

NEW DELHI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai Police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies, sources said. The duo was wanted after fleeing the country following last week’s blaze that claimed 25 lives. They were detained from a resort in Phuket.They had fled to Phuket, Thailand. The Thailand Police on Thursday released pictures showing the brothers in their custody. They will be deported and handed over to the Indian authorities. A team has already reached there, sources said.Goa Police had requested the Interpol through MEA and CBI for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by the Interpol.A blue notice is typically issued to gather additional information about a person’s identity, whereabouts or activities in connection with a criminal investigation.Goa Police said it would help trace the accused and also prevent them from migrating to any other country from their present destination. A senior Goa police officer said while a blue corner notice typically takes about a week to process, in this case, it was issued within two days of the incident with the support of central agencies.India and Thailand signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force on June 29, 2015. Goa CM Pramod Sawant told TOI a team will be sent to Thailand to bring back the accused.The regional passport office, New Delhi, has, meanwhile, issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days.On Sunday, a Goa Police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. “Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa Police,” a Goa Police officer said.The Bureau of Immigration in Mumbai later informed investigators that the brothers boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 to Phuket at 5.30am Sunday, just hours after the blaze.A lookout notice was also issued against the owner of the property, UK national Surinder Kumar Khosla, and the Luthras’ partner, Ajay Gupta.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa Police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, the guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai Police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies.

NEW DELHI: India's batting sensation and ODI World Cup-winning vice-captain Smriti Mandhana said that one truth has become clearer to her than anything else over the past 12 years as a professional cricketer — there is nothing she cares about more deeply than the game of cricket.India’s most accomplished left-handed batter in women's cricket looked back on her journey, from her international debut in 2013 to helping India lift the ICC ODI World Cup last month for the first time in their history, while speaking at the Amazon Smbhav Summit on Wednesday. Mandhana spoke openly about what fuels her commitment each day as an India cricketer. “I don’t think there is anything I love more than cricket. Putting on the India jersey is the biggest motivation. No matter what you’re going through, that one thought helps you block everything out,” she said.Even as a child, she knew exactly what she wanted after growing up. “The obsession with batting was always there. People around me didn’t really get it, but in my head I wanted only one thing — to be known as a world champion.”She described the ODI World Cup win as the result of years of hard work and disappointment.“This trophy was the outcome of everything we’ve been fighting for.I’ve played for more than a decade, and so many times things didn’t fall into place. Before the final, we pictured that moment over and over again. When it finally appeared on the screen, it genuinely gave us goosebumps. It was emotional in every way.”The occasion was even more overwhelming with legends Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami watching from the stands. “We desperately wanted to win it for them too. Seeing tears in their eyes felt like the whole of women’s cricket had achieved something. It was a victory for everyone who came before us.”Mandhana shared the biggest lessons she carried from the triumph: “You always start from zero, regardless of what you scored previously. And never play for yourself — that’s something we kept telling one another.”This event also marked Mandhana’s first public appearance since she confirmed the cancellation of her wedding with musician Palash Muchhal .",India's ODI World Cup-winning vice-captain Smriti Mandhana spoke at the Amazon Smbhav Summit on Wednesday.

Also, a decision has been taken in the cabinet not to forcibly recover the financial benefit amount from beneficiaries who have been excluded voluntarily or for any other reason,” Tatkare said in her reply.In July, Tatkare had said her department had undertaken scrutiny of the scheme by seeking information from all govt departments. The IT department reported that approximately 26.3 lakh beneficiaries availed of benefits despite being ineligible.“It has been found that some beneficiaries were availing benefits of multiple schemes. Some families had more than two beneficiaries. And in some cases, men applied for the scheme,” she had said on X.

Around 2.2 crore eligible applicants received the stipend for the month of June.The Laadki Bahin scheme provides a stipend of Rs 1,500 per month to married, divorced, widowed, deserted, and destitute women, aged between 21 and 65, whose annual family income is below Rs 2.5 lakh and who are domiciled. One eligible unmarried woman from each family is also considered. The Laadki Bahin scheme was among the factors which powered the Mahayuti to a landslide win in the 2024 assembly polls.Soon after he took charge in Dec 2024, CM Fadnavis announced beneficiaries would be scrutinised. By Feb 2025, the state dropped five lakh ineligible beneficiaries. This included those who had crossed the age of 65 and beneficiaries under the Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana, which also provides a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship for individuals and corporations willing to make large financial contributions.Announcing the rollout on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""The United States Government’s Trump Gold Card is here today! A direct path to citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. So exciting! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""A website accepting applications went live soon after, as Trump unveiled the program in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, joined by business leaders.Trump said the funds raised through the initiative would ""go to the US government,"" adding that the program could generate ""billions"" for the Treasury Department ""where we can do positive things for the country.""""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government.... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even,"" he told reporters further talking about the initiative.The Trump Gold Card is a new US visa-residency programme that costs $1 million for individual applicants. The Trump Gold Card programme effectively provides a pathway to permanent legal residency, similar to a green card but, as Trump claims, ""with big advantages.""""It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States…"" Trump added.It is intended to replace the existing EB-5 investor visa programme, subject to vetting by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The card resembles a luxury credit card, featuring a gold background along with Donald Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with ""Trump Gold Card"" embossed on the left.The Trump Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor one or more foreign employees. Corporations must pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS fee per employee, and the programme requires a $2 million gift per sponsored employee after vetting is completed.Companies can apply for multiple employees simultaneously.A notable benefit of the corporate version is that companies may stop sponsoring one employee and use the same previously paid $2 million contribution to sponsor a new employee without paying another gift amount.""The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small, 1% annual maintenance fee and a 5% transfer fee, which includes the cost of a new DHS background check. Small additional fees to the US Department of State may also apply depending on each employee’s circumstances, the website noted.Individual applicants must make a one-time, non-refundable $1 million gift, whereas corporate sponsors pay $2 million per employee. Both require the same DHS processing fee of $15,000.Applicants must first pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS processing fee. Once the vetting process is complete, the required $1 million ""gift"" from an individual (or $2 million for a corporation per applicant) serves as proof that the applicant will ""substantially benefit the United States.""Additional small fees may be charged by the US Department of State depending on individual circumstances. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for petition approval and visa adjudication will take place on an expedited basis, assuming applicants submit any additional documents or fees in a timely manner.The $15,000 processing fee can be paid by credit card or ACH (US accounts only). The $1 million or $2 million contribution must be sent via ACH debit or SWIFT wire transfer after vetting.For Visa-related fees - The applicant will receive information directly from the US Department of State on how to submit the visa application fee and payments for the required medical examination.Like other American permanent residents and citizens, Trump Gold Card holders are required to pay US taxes, including on income earned outside the United States.Applicants must be eligible for lawful permanent resident status, admissible to the United States, and have a visa available under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories.Yes. Spouses and unmarried children under 21 can be included in the initial application. Each family member must pay an additional $15,000 DHS fee and a $1 million gift, with the same expedited processing benefits.""This will ensure that these family members receive all of the privileges conferred by the Gold Card Program, including expedited processing,"" the website said.Yes. Since the Trump Gold Card functions as a visa, it can be revoked on grounds of national security concerns or significant criminal activity.Here is the simplified step-by-step process, based on the details provided on the Gold Card website:The programme promises an expedited timeline, with processing expected to take a few weeks, provided applicants respond promptly to interview requests and document submissions, the website said.The upcoming Trump Platinum Card will allow individuals to live in the US for up to 270 days a year without paying US tax on non-US income, eliminating the need for additional travel visas.It is priced at $5 million, plus the $15,000 DHS fee, and has not yet been launched. A waitlist has opened, and applicants are being encouraged to secure their place early.The design for the Trump Platinum Card has not yet been revealed, but the website encourages users to join a waitlist, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.The website warns that the $5 million Platinum Card contribution ""may not remain"" at the current price, leading many to join the waitlist early.""Foreign nationals can sign up now and secure their places on the waiting list for the Trump Platinum Card. When launched, and upon receipt of a $15,000 DHS processing fee and $5 million contribution, they will have the ability to spend up to 270 days in the United States without being subject to US taxes on non-US income,"" the website added.The Platinum Card cannot be obtained by anyone who has previously been subject to US tax on foreign income, such as ""US citizens or resident aliens,"" they said.The Trump Gold Card comes with several limitations that raise questions about its accessibility and long-term impact. Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the new programme has no job-creation requirement for investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also made no mention of annual caps, leaving uncertainty around oversight, scalability and how the scheme fits into broader US immigration policy.For businesses, the card does not guarantee lower costs. Each corporate card applies to only one employee, meaning expenses rise with every additional hire. Companies needing to retain multiple foreign-born graduates may end up paying millions.This makes the programme more suitable for wealthy individuals or well-funded corporations, offering little relief to smaller firms facing talent shortages.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

GOA: In the aftermath of the devastating December 6 fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, which claimed 25 lives, the North Goa district administration on Thursday banned fireworks inside nightclubs, hotels, and other tourist establishments.BJP’s coalition partner in the government, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), on Wednesday called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state to promote “good tourism.” Since 2014, the MGP has opposed pubs, public bikini swimming, massage parlours, and illegal casinos. The party is Goa’s oldest regional political outfit.“Nightclubs do not sync with Goa’s culture. It is the worst culture. Nightclubs should be stopped,” MGP president Deepak ‘Pandurang’ Dhavalikar said.Dhavalikar said that it is his personal opinion and the same would be discussed at the MGP meeting.The culture of pubs, swimming in bikinis on beaches, massage parlours, and illegal casinos is against ‘Bharatiya saunskruti’ (Indian culture) and should be banned, then PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin Dhavalikar had said in 2014.On Wednesday, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had convened a high-level meeting with senior officials and key tourism stakeholders to reinforce safety measures ahead of the upcoming Christmas and New Year season.During the meeting, the government issued strict directives to prevent any repeat of the tragedy.Licences of tourist establishments in Goa that lacked fire safety compliance were set to be cancelled. The government also prohibited the sale of liquor after 11 pm across the state to curb late-night violations. Tourists were advised to avoid swimming in danger zones, particularly along beaches identified as high-risk by lifeguard agencies. While the tourism season was to continue as planned, it was to operate under heightened monitoring and stricter compliance checks.Six people had been arrested in connection with the Arpora nightclub fire as authorities intensified their crackdown on illegal operations and safety lapses.Officials said the government would conduct surprise inspections of nightclubs, shacks, and high-footfall venues while reviewing all licences and safety certifications to ensure full compliance.The meeting was held against the backdrop of the December 6 fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, which claimed 25 lives, according to sources.“The chief minister briefed those present at the meeting about various measures taken to ensure such a tragedy did not recur in the state,” a senior officer privy to the meeting said.He added that the state government had issued multiple orders and formed committees, including a high-level magisterial inquiry panel and a fire safety audit committee, after the incident.“The chief minister ordered all departments to ensure there was no laxity, especially considering Goa would be seeing a large number of tourists during the Christmas and New Year festivities,” the officer said.(With agency inputs)","BJP’s coalition partner in the government, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), on Wednesday called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation on Thursday and reviewed the progress of the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the steady strengthening of bilateral cooperation across a broad range of areas.According to an official statement, the two leaders discussed ways to sustain momentum in efforts to enhance bilateral trade.They also exchanged views on expanding cooperation in critical technologies, energy, defence and security, and other priority sectors linked to the implementation of the India–US COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce and Technology) for the 21st century. PM Modi and Trump also spoke about key regional and global developments. They agreed to work closely to address shared challenges and advance common interests in the evolving geopolitical landscape.Also Read: Goyal reacts to Trump admin’s ‘best ever’ offers view; says America should sign agreement The two leaders agreed to remain in touch as both sides continue to deepen the strategic partnership.The conversation between both leaders takes place days after Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in New Delhi for a high-stakes two-day summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.It was Putin's first state visit to India since the Ukraine war began in February 2022.During the Russian president's visit, a carpooling picture of PM Modi and Putin even found a place at the US Congress discussion on India-US ties.""This poster is worth a thousand words,"" said US representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove, pointing towards the image, as she went on to slam the Donald Trump administration's foreign policy towards India.""Trump's policies towards India can only be described as cutting our nose to spite our face... Being a coercive partner has a cost. And this poster is worth a thousand words,"" she said.""You do not get a Nobel Peace Prize by driving US strategic partners into the arms of our adversaries,"" Dove said in a pointed attack at Trump's demands for the peace prize for what he has repeatedly claimed for having stopped eight wars, including India and Pakistan.""We must move with incredible urgency to mitigate the damage that this administration has done to the US-India partnership and return to the cooperation that is essential to US prosperity, security, and global leadership,"" she added.These comments were delivered during the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia’s hearing on 'The US-India Strategic Partnership: Securing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific'.Trump has already slapped 50% tariffs on most Indian exports in August 2025 amid wider trade tensions and worries over India’s imports of Russian oil.A US trade delegation was in India on December 10–11 for discussions that have so far made little headway. The talks have been bogged down by disputes over market access and tariff policies, further straining the trade relationship.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation on Thursday.

Mass visa chaos: H-1B families stranded in India for months after US consulates cancel interviews,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mass-visa-chaos-h-1b-families-stranded-in-india-for-months-after-us-consulates-cancel-interviews/articleshow/125910898.cms,"Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children — are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who traveled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: “Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.”Rajiv S. Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labeling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children — are stranded in India.

NEW DELHI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra co‑owners of the Goa nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane, have been detained by Thai authorities in Phuket and are set to be deported to India to face investigation in connection with a deadly fire that killed 25 people last week.Indian law enforcement agencies, working through diplomatic and international policing channels, coordinated the operation after the brothers left India shortly after the blaze. A police team has already reached Thailand as the deportation process is underway.The tragedy occurred late on December 6 at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, where a fire erupted amid a crowded event, killing 25 people, including five tourists and twenty staff. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered to determine the cause and responsibilities in the incident.Within hours of the fire, the Luthra brothers were reported to have booked and boarded an IndiGo flight to Phuket, with ticket records showing they left at about 5:30 am on December 7 - while rescue efforts were still underway.Goa Police quickly expanded the probe beyond India’s borders, issuing a lookout circular and securing an Interpol blue corner notice on December 9 to locate the duo.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) responded by suspending the Luthras’ passports on December 11, preventing further travel, and alerting Thai authorities.On December 10 brothers moved to Delhi’s Rohini court seeking four weeks of transit anticipatory bail, claiming they are willing to return to India and cooperate with the investigation into the nightclub blaze.Despite their initial plea seeking bail and claiming they had travelled to Thailand “for work,” the court declined interim relief on December 11.Police refuting the claims made by brothers told the court the brothers booked their tickets after the fire broke out and left on December 7, contrary to their assertion that they were on a business trip and had left on December 6, an action officials described as “incriminating.”Thai immigration authorities nabbed the brothers on December 11 and released pictures of brothers handcuffed at a resort in Phuket, taken into custody on the basis of requests from Indian agencies. Authorities in Thailand are now processing their deportation back to India under existing legal frameworks. India and Thailand have an extradition treaty, and the offense of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, among other charges they face, meets the criteria for surrender under the treaty terms.The investigation in India has also led to the arrest of six others connected to the nightclub’s operations. Among them is Ajay Gupta, described as an operational partner.Goa Police traced him to a private hospital in Delhi after he reportedly sought to avoid arrest by faking illness; he was subsequently taken into custody.With the Luthra brothers detained and deportation underway, Indian authorities are expected to formally take them into custody on return and proceed with the legal process. The broader inquiry continues into fire safety compliance at the club and potential lapses by operators and regulators.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co‑owners of the Goa nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane, have been detained by Thai authorities in Phuket.

NEW DELHI: Delhi court on Thursday denied transit anticipatory bail plea of Saurabh and Gaurav Luthras, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa where a massive fire last week killed at least 25 people.The brothers sought four weeks of transit anticipatory bail on Wednesday, seeking protection from immediate arrest after their return to Delhi from Thailand. The brothers were detained by Thai police early on Thursday at the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. According to officials, their deportation from Thailand has also been initiated.Additional Sessions Judge Vandana reserved the order till 5 pm after hearing the arguments of the advocates who appeared for the Luthras.One of the counsels for the applicants argued that they were willing to return immediately and face the investigation, and urged the court not to “punish them at the threshold”.He said the brothers had approached the Delhi court at the earliest opportunity and undertook to join the probe without delay. “If I land in India tonight and the investigating officer (IO) tells me to appear at midnight, I will be there,” he said.The counsel said that transit bail was not a determination on merits but a limited protection to ensure safe access to the right court.Also Read: Goa nightclub fire: Luthra brothers misled police - what cops told court He cited a Supreme Court order permitting an accused abroad, against whom Blue and Red Corner notices were contemplated, to return to India with temporary protection. “I only seek protection for a few days to reach the court safely.

He said the law does not aid those who refuse to submit to summons or warrants.Referring to judicial observations, the counsel said, ""Once it is shown that a person is attempting to evade the process of law, the court should not come to his aid at all.”He added that anticipatory bail is a discretionary relief and cannot be granted to those who have “created obstacles in the execution of warrants or concealed themselves”","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthras, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa where a massive fire last week killed at least 25 people.

Rahul Gandhi's 'Open Challenge' To Amit Shah In Lok Sabha Over SIR Gets 'I Will Decide' Reply

Amit Shah vs Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday repeated his claim that Amit Shah appeared ‘nervous’ and used ‘foul language’ during the Union home minister's Lok Sabha speech the previous day.“He (Shah) used foul language. His hands were trembling. Mentally, he is under pressure, and it was seen in Parliament. Whatever I had asked, he gave no replies and provided no proof. I challenged him openly to discuss over my press conferences, but nothing happened. Everyone now understands the reality,” Gandhi told reporters.Hitting back, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal asked why Gandhi and the opposition INDIA bloc ""ran away"" when the home minister was speaking.""Then why did he leave? People who flee, abandoning the field, the country watches them. During the two-day discussion, he (Shah) held a mirror against all the questions raised on electoral reforms and SIR... When people went to the Supreme Court against SIR, the Supreme Court also said there is no reason to stop SIR... So how long will they keep blaming the Election Commission, voter list, EVM for their defeat?"" Pal said.During his address on electoral reforms, Shah clashed with Gandhi over the Congress leader’s repeated claims of vote chori’ (theft)” by the Election Commission and the ruling BJP.The Lok Sabha leader of opposition, who has held three press conferences on the issue, challenged the home minister to a debate based on those briefings. In response, Shah remarked that the “House will not function according to his (Gandhi’s) wishes.”The heated exchange erupted when Gandhi interjected during Shah’s address in the Lok Sabha on electoral reforms. Criticising the opposition over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, the senior BJP leader argued that he had responses to all their accusations, including those raised in Gandhi’s three press conferences.“In his press conference, the LoP claimed the voter list is flawed and needs correction. That is exactly what SIR is — a process to clean up the rolls. Yet he opposes it. Your defeat is certain; the voter list has nothing to do with it. Double standards won’t work in a democracy. When you win, the EC is great; when you lose, the EC is biased. I have answers to all these allegations — those three press conferences included,” Shah remarked.Gandhi then interrupted and challenged him to a debate. “Yesterday, I asked why Election Commissioners were given full immunity. We want to understand the reasoning behind it. He (Amit Shah) mentioned Haryana, but there are many other examples — including 19 lakh fake voters. Let’s debate my press conferences. Amit Shah ji, I challenge you to a debate on all three,” the Rae Bareli MP asserted.Shah responded that Gandhi could not dictate the order of his speech and should remain patient. “You cannot run Parliament through obstinacy. I will decide the order of my address. The House won’t function like this. He should be patient. I will respond to every point,” he countered.Opposition MPs walked out of the Lok Sabha during Shah’s reply to the discussion on electoral reforms.","The heated exchange erupted when Gandhi interjected during Shah’s address in the Lok Sabha on electoral reforms.

Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

NEW DELHI: The United States on Thursday clarified that its consular officers will reject tourist visa applications if they determine that the primary purpose of travel is to give birth in the country in order to secure US citizenship for the child.Officials said such travel is not permitted and will result in a visa denial.A State Department advisory notes that adjudicating officers are required to assess the applicant’s intent, and if they believe the visit is planned for childbirth to obtain citizenship, the visa cannot be granted.The rule is part of the US government’s broader policy to curb what it considers misuse of visitor visas for birth tourism.Earlier this year, US department of state said, ""“It is unacceptable for foreign parents to use a US tourist visa for the primary purpose of giving birth in the United States to obtain citizenship for the child, which also could result in American taxpayers paying the medical care costs.”“This is known as birth tourism and US consular officers deny all such visa applications under US immigration law. Those who abuse our immigration system through birth tourism may be ineligible for future visas or travel to the United States. This is one more way the US department of state is serving and protecting American taxpayers and communities,"" US department of state in a April, 2025 social media post added.(More details awaited)",The United States on Thursday clarified that its consular officers will reject tourist visa applications if they determine that the primary purpose of travel is to give birth in the country.

What the Luthras claim

NEW DELHI: Goa Police on Thursday told the court that Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, wanted in the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire that killed 25 people - had “misled” investigators and shown “no cooperation” during the probe, according to statements made in court.Gaurav Luthra and Saurabh Luthra, co-owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa, had moved Delhi’s Rohini court seeking anticipatory bail, and the hearing continued for the second day.Opposing their anticipatory bail pleas, police said the brothers left for Phuket shortly after the December 6 blaze and inaccurately claimed they had departed India earlier than records show.“There is no cooperation on the part of Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, which disentitled them for extraordinary protection by this court. They have no business in Thailand. They left the country on December 7. Though, they said that they had left on the night of December 6. Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra misled the court, misled the authorities and left the country,” police submitted, as per ANI.Investigators told the court that both brothers, along with partner Ajay Gupta, were signatories of the club’s operations. They added that the Panchayat licence for the venue had lapsed and had not been renewed at the time of the incident.The blaze broke out during a musical night attended by nearly 100 people. Videos from minutes before the incident showed performers dancing as electric firecrackers were set off, a likely trigger. The club’s extensive flammable decor, lack of functional fire-safety equipment and a narrow access road that left fire engines stranded about 400 metres away worsened the situation.Twenty-five people, five tourists and 20 staff members, died, most from inhaling toxic smoke while trapped in the basement.Four staffers were arrested soon after the incident, while the Luthra brothers left for Thailand hours after booking their tickets as the fire was still being extinguished. Their partner Ajay Gupta was arrested in Delhi and later moved to Goa for questioning. Both Saurabh and Gaurav have since been detained in Thailand and are expected to be deported.In their bail petition, the brothers argue they are licensees, not owners, of the building, and insist they travelled to Thailand for a business meeting rather than to evade investigators. They have sought four weeks’ transit anticipatory bail to avoid immediate arrest upon arrival.The court will continue hearing their pleas as the investigation into one of Goa’s deadliest nightclub fires proceeds.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa, had moved Delhi’s Rohini court seeking anticipatory bail.

22 Feared Dead As Truck Falls Into Gorge In Arunachal Pradesh

GUWAHATI: At least 22 labourers from Assam are feared dead after a mini truck fell into a deep gorge in Arunachal Pradesh’s Anjaw district near the Indo‑China border. The accident occurred on Monday night along the high‑altitude Hayuliang–Chaglagam road.The incident came to light only on Thursday night when a lone survivor, severely injured, managed to climb out of the gorge and walk about 4 km to reach a Border Roads Organisation camp. He alerted officials to the mishap.Anjaw district deputy commissioner Millo Kojin told TOI that an Army team reached the wreckage but could not retrieve any bodies due to the treacherous terrain.“The NDRF team from Assam is reaching the site with specialised equipment tonight, and search and rescue operations are expected to begin tomorrow. The injured survivor has been shifted to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh,” he said.He added that details of 18 individuals are known so far and efforts are on to collect the information of the other four.Defence PRO Lt Col M Rawat said that Indian Army launches search and rescue operation in higher reaches of Arunachal Pradesh.He said that after four hours of intensive search and rope descent on Thursday, the truck was spotted around 200 metres below the road near KM 40 in a re-entrant, inaccessible and not visible from helicopters or the road due to dense tree cover and thick foliage and 18 bodies have been spotted so far.“The accident site, approximately 12 km short of Chaglagam, lies in difficult terrain with limited connectivity and had not been reported by any local agency, contractor or civil representative until the survivor’s arrival,” the PRO said.","A mini truck fell into a deep gorge in Arunachal Pradesh’s Anjaw district.

NEW DELHI: In a boost to Indo-US space cooperation, Isro will launch its heaviest American commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne BlueBird-6, from the Sriharikota spaceport on Dec 15. Isro’s ‘Bahubali’ rocket LVM3 will put the US satellite into orbit.AST SpaceMobile, a Texas-based company that has built the space-based cellular broadband network, said, “BlueBird-6, a US licensed satellite, is scheduled to launch on Dec 15. It is the first of AST SpaceMobile’s next-generation satellites. When launched, it will feature the largest commercial phased array in low earth orbit at nearly 2,400 sqft. This represents 3.5 times increase in size over BlueBirds 1-5 and supports ten times the data capacity. ”BlueBird-6 is a “Block-2” satellite and part of a larger plan by AST SpaceMobile to deploy a series of satellites to achieve non-continuous service, with further launches scheduled through 2026. Its aim is to bridge the “digital divide” by offering fast, unhindered direct-to-device mobile broadband service in areas with poor or non-existent terrestrial network coverage.The BlueBird satellites are designed to deliver a high amount of bandwidth, with each unit capable of up to 10,000 MHz. They operate by partnering with existing mobile network carriers to enhance their networks using licensed spectrum.The BlueBird-6 satellite arrived in India from the US on Oct 19. It was later transported by road to Sriharikota for integration with launcher LVM3, fuelling and final checks ahead of its launch.The liftoff is being handled by New Space India Limited (NSIL), Isro’s commercial wing. LVM-3 had recently put India’s heaviest CMS-3 satellite, weighing 4.4 tonnes, into its orbit on Nov 2. A three-stage launch vehicle, LVM3 rocket can carry payloads weighing up to 8,000 kg to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and 4,000 kg to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). The human-rated version of this vehicle will fly three Indian astronauts to space, as part of the Gaganyaan mission, which is planned for 2027.","Isro will launch its heaviest American commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne BlueBird-6, from the Sriharikota spaceport on Dec 15.

Amit Shah gives point-by-point rebuttal on 'vote chori' charge

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in the Lok Sabha turned heated on Wednesday as leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged home minister Amit Shah to an open debate, prompting a firm response from the minister: ""I will decide.""As Shah countered the opposition’s allegations of 'vote chori' and referred to Rahul Gandhi’s charge of ""multiple voters at one Haryana house,"" the Congress leader stood up, interrupting the speech.""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.""You tell us ... actually, let us have a debate on my press conference, very good idea, let us go, let us have a debate,"" he added.""Amit Shah ji, I challenge you, I challenge you to have a debate,"" Rahul declared in the House.Amid uproar, Shah responded, ""Speaker sir, I want to clarify first, I have been elected as an MLA or MP for the last 30 years. I have a long experience of the procedures.""Looking directly at Rahul Gandhi, he said in a stern manner, ""Parliament will not proceed according to your wishes.I will decide the sequence of my speech. The Parliament will not work like this.""""Speaker sir, he should have some patience to listen to my answer. I will reply to each and everything. But he will not decide the sequence of my speech, I will decide it,"" Shah reiterated.""This is a completely defensive response, a scared response,"" Rahul retorted.Resuming his address with a noticeably calm tone, Shah told Speaker Om Birla, ""I can see worry lines on your face. Do not worry, I will not be provoked by them. I will continue with my reply.""Shah then went on to address the 'vote chori' accusations, stating that such issues occurred during the tenures of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. He also referenced a case in the Delhi high court, alleging that Sonia Gandhi became a voter before becoming Indian.Amit Shah offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.During the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in the Parliament, Shah took a jibe at the Congress leader's ""nuclear bomb"" press conference said that his press conferences are not ""Constitutional provisions.""""Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi dropped a “nuclear bomb” in a press conference on 5 November 2025. In that ‘nuclear bomb’, he claimed that 501 votes had been cast from a single house in Haryana. The Election Commission has clarified that House Number 265 is no small dwelling, but rather a joint residence for multiple families built on a one-acre ancestral plot,"" the home minister said.""However, separate house numbers have not been assigned to each family, so their house number is simply listed as 265. And in one of those families, three generations are living together. This numbering has been in place since the Congress government was elected in Haryana. It is neither a fake house nor fake votes,"" he added.Shah also said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.""Congress has claimed that some individuals are registered in two different locations on the electoral roll. It is unfair to blame the people who appear twice, as this is often a result of systemic issues. Since 2010, the Returning Officer's authority to remove duplicate entries has been revoked, which has led to such discrepancies. In fact, there are several leaders whose names are registered in more than one place.

Hiren has moved to Surat with his wife Namrata and their three-year-old son Vaastu, abandoning seven years of life in London.

""We've met many who moved to the UK seeking opportunities but are now returning to India because they simply cannot afford to remain.""Among them is Mobbashera Vahora. Her husband Parvez and their four-year-old daughter Zuveriya died in the crash. Parvez held a full-time job with a major e-commerce company and worked part-time with multiple delivery platforms. He supported his parents in India while trying to secure a future for his young family in East London.Mobbashera was pregnant when the crash happened. Her baby is now five months old. ""We migrated for better prospects for our children,"" she said from her brother's home. ""We dreamed of building a life there, but all of that is lost now."" With UK immigration rules tightening, she sees no path back.For Harish Godhaniya from Devbhumi Dwarka, the decision was blunt. ""I have nobody there anymore,"" he said. He lost his wife Riddhi and three-year-old son Kriyansh. ""What would I do there? We emigrated with dreams of a better life. That day took my whole world."" He has not returned to work since coming home.The immigration struggle is sharpest for Mohammadmiya Mohammadasif Shethwala from Vadodara, who lost his wife Sadikabanu - the primary visa holder - and their daughter Fatima, who was born in the UK.

The worst part is that despite showing all documents, no one listened to us,"" she said, fighting back tears.The 26-year-old domestic worker from Paikar village in West Bengal's Birbhum district was detained during an identity verification drive in Delhi's Rohini in late June this year. Sunali said she and her husband, Danish Sekh, immediately produced every document they had - Aadhaar, PAN and ration card. ""I even quickly presented my in-laws' ID proofs arranged over WhatsApp the same night."" Nothing worked.We did everything in our power,"" Sunali said. ""We showed every single document. We kept telling them, 'We are not Bangladeshi. We are Indian.' Who will listen to people like us?""Within 48 hours, on June 26, after the Foreigners Regional Registration Office deportation order, police seized the couple's belongings from their Rohini jhuggi and took them and their eight-year-old son, Sabir Sekh, to Guwahati.From there, she said, they were pushed across the Bangladesh border in hot haste.The deportation was sudden and unexpected for the couple and their families back in West Bengal. For the next five months, Sunali was trapped in a maze of suspicion. What followed, she says, ""broke something inside her.""After filing a missing-person complaint at his local Palkar police station on 6 July 2025, Sunali's father, Bhodu Sekh, moved the Calcutta HC three days later. On 9 July 2025, his habeas corpus petition seeking production of his daughter, son-in-law and grandson was registered.With no information from authorities & fearing his heavily pregnant daughter might be left to deliver without medical help in an unknown country, Bhodu filed pleading for urgent intervention. In his petition, he, too, said family had supplied Aadhaar, voter IDs, PAN cards and land records to show their Indian roots, yet authorities deported them.Back in Bangladesh, the time there for Sunali and her family were a blur of hunger, fear and humiliation. ""We remained in hell. We didn't even have Rs 5 to feed our children,"" she said. ""We had a single set of clothes, my yellow kurta and blue salwar. My son his red T-shirt and black half-pants. For food & shelter, there was the mercy of strangers.""When they initially attempted to return a few days after entering Bangladesh, she says the Indian side beat them brutally despite their pleas. ""We were profiled simply because we were Bengali-speaking Muslims.""When produced before a Bangladeshi court, Sunali says she expected questions about who they were, how they crossed, why they were there. But it was over in minutes. ""They didn't ask us anything, just put us in jail,"" she said. ""Humne sirf bola hum Bharat ke hain. Documents hote hue koi kyun bhejega? Wo log bhi hairaan thhe. (We only said in court there that we are from India. Why will we run away from our own country when we possess valid papers. They, too, were surprised)."" Sunali described the months in the jail as ""mental torture"".Though she is home for now, Sunali says her heart is heavy with fear & foreboding. ""Are there any other documents we can get? What if we are shoved out again? I can't sleep thinking about that.""","Sunali Khatun was detained during an identity verification drive in Delhi's Rohini. She and her husband, Danish Sekh, were deported to Guwahati, Bangladesh. The 26-year-old domestic worker from West Bengal's Birbhum district is now nine months pregnant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125923331,imgsize-1086288,width-400,resizemode-4/kept-saying-were-indian-they-didnt-listen-sunali.jpg"

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other. India and Thailand had signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force in 2015.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said. The brothers have turned 'wanted' after fleeing the country following last week's blaze at their club in Goa that claimed 25 lives. They had fled to Phuket, Thailand and were staying at a hotel.Goa police had requested Interpol, through MEA and CBI, for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by Interpol.The regional passport office in Delhi had issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days. Their passports were subsequently declared invalid, easing the execution of Indian request for their detention.According to Goa police, the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on Dec 7, even as firefighting operations were under way. By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073.By morning, a Goa police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. ""Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa police,"" a police officer said.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday (Dec 6) during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies.

22 Feared Dead As Truck Falls Into Gorge In Arunachal Pradesh

GUWAHATI: A possibly lone survivor among 22 people on board a truck that plunged into a gorge in a remote location of Arunachal Pradesh Monday night clambered out of the wreckage, climbed 200m and trudged nearly 4km to reach a BRO camp late Wednesday to report the tragedy almost 48 hours later.The victims - 19 bodies had been retrieved until Thursday evening - were all labourers from Assam being ferried to a site in Anjaw district, bordering China, when the accident occurred along Hayuliang-Chaglagam Road. Army teams continue to search for the other two workers.It wasn't immediately clear if the critically injured survivor included the truck driver among the 22 that he said were involved in the crash, officials said. He has been shifted to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh, around 260km from Hayuliang.Nang Chingni Choupoo, in charge of the Anjaw district disaster management department, told TOI that Army teams used ropes to descend into the deep gorge and trace the wreckage. The 19 bodies found so far are still to be brought up.""Since the Army personnel do not have specialised equipment to carry the bodies, an NDRF team from Dibrugarh is being sent there with the required equipment.The operation will resume Friday morning,"" Choupoo said. ""For now, we are assuming there were 22 people, unless the driver wasn't counted. The mangled truck lies upside down and rescuers need to cut through the metal to determine if anyone is trapped inside.""The Assam govt has deputed a joint team of the Tinsukia civil and police administration to travel to the area and coordinate with Army and Arunachal Pradesh officials. The nearest camp, which the injured survivor reached, belongs to the General Reserve Engineer Force under which BRO operates.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said both states were working closely to rescue survivors, if any, and get the victims' bodies home.Defence PRO Lt Col M Rawat said multiple search and rescue columns of the Army, medical teams, GREF representatives, local police and NDRF personnel worked for hours to locate the wreckage and the bodies.Initial reports suggested the workers were from Tinsukia and travelling to Chaglagam for work.

Judiciary is expected to bring a smile on every litigant's face: CJI

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India Surya Kant on Thursday announced enforcement of a new time distribution regime to equitably allocate judicial time for poor litigants.""From January, there will be a time limit for each advocate to conclude his/her arguments. What is happening is absolutely unfair and unjustified. A poor litigant, who comes to the court for a motor accident claims case or for bail leaves the court disappointed as his case is not taken up because of these unending arguments from other advocates,"" the CJI said.CJI made the remark while hearing a bunch of PILs challenging the SIR of electoral rolls in Bihar and at a pan-India level. CJI Kant said some cases go on for days with unending arguments from (renowned senior) advocates and poor litigants who come to court on the scheduled date of hearing of their cases have to go back home disappointed as the cases are not taken up due to time constraints.The step will redress the long-held lament that the ""rich, powerful and influential"" get ahead of other litigants by engaging high-profile lawyers and can hurt the ""stars"" among the legal fraternity who argue for hours, pushing others farther down "" you are in the queue "" list.The resultant resentment is particularly directed against certain activist lawyers and chronic PIL petitioners who are known for rushing to SC with petitions over all sundry issues. The bar has long watched with dismay the refusal of benches to instantly accommodate such petitions being made a pretext to attack judges for ""insensitivity"".Acknowledging that ""privileged"" treatment, to use the popular bar parlance, for celebrities is creating a disbalance in the justice delivery system, CJI Kant said, ""There must be an equitable distribution of time. From January, every counsel will have to file a written submission and specify the time limit within which he/she must conclude his arguments. No adjournment would be granted by any court in SC in matters posted for final hearing. ""The CJI narrated a poignant story of delayed justice. ""A poor widow fought for 23 years to get compensation for the death of her husband on railway tracks. By the time SC finally granted her Rs 8 lakh compensation, she had lost hope in the system and in frustration vanished into oblivion. It took extra effort from a young counsel to trace her. It was found that she did not have a bank account, which was opened and the money was deposited. "" ""The smile that was brought on her face after 23 years was worth the effort and that is what the judiciary is expected to do - bring a smile on every litigant's face with timely adjudication,"" CJI Kant said.","CJI made the remark while hearing a bunch of PILs challenging the SIR of electoral rolls in Bihar and at a pan-India level.

NEW DELHI: A court on Thursday granted 15 days' interim bail to northeast Delhi riots conspiracy accused Umar Khalid, allowing him to attend his sister's wedding later this month.Additional sessions judge Sameer Bajpai noted that Khalid had already spent five years and three months in custody since his arrest in Sept 2020 and that the plea was specifically tied to a personal and significant family occasion. ""Considering the fact that the marriage is of the real sister of the applicant, the application is allowed and the applicant is granted interim bail,"" the court said.It added that the interim relief would remain effective from Dec 16 to 29. The former JNU student will be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 20,000 along with two sureties of the same amount. The court also emphasised that the interim bail was being granted within a limited and clearly defined timeframe.The court observed that the temporary release would also allow Khalid to briefly reunite with his parents, besides with his elder sister and her children, who stayed abroad and were expected to attend the wedding.The order, however, imposed several conditions. Khalid has been specifically barred from contacting any witness connected with the case, from using social media in any form and from travelling to any place other than visits to his parents and immediate close relatives.Opposing the plea, the prosecution argued that ""considering the act of the applicant, they do not deserve any relief"". It also pointed out that the actual ceremonies were scheduled only between Dec 25 and 27, lasting ""three days"", and questioned the necessity of granting a 15-day relief. The court, however, proceeded to allow the full period sought by Khalid.This is not the first instance in which the former JNU scholar has received limited-duration bail for family functions. Last Dec, he was granted interim bail for seven days to attend a wedding in his family.

The alleged incident happened in 2023.The court said if the IRS officer's plea is allowed, then it would cause several procedural and psychological barriers for the aggrieved woman, and create a situation where the woman would have to appear before the ICC at an alien workplace to pursue her remedy in law. SC, however, made it clear the action against the erring employee can be taken only by his department as per its rule on the basis of the report prepared by the ICC of the aggrieved woman's workplace.""The taboo around sexual harassment at workplace and the fear of stigma, which may be attached to the aggrieved woman as a consequence of a complaint regarding sexual harassment, already poses a massive psychological barrier for the aggrieved women, which actively dissuades them from pursuing their remedy in law."" ""In such view of the matter also, the intent of the legislature behind giving such a wide meaning to the word 'workplace' to go beyond the bounds of the traditional meaning implying location of office, cannot be brushed aside by narrow construction of other provisions of the POSH Act. It is for the aforementioned reasons that we are constrained to reject the argument of the appellant,"" it said. The bench said if an aggrieved woman has to approach the ICC constituted at the workplace of the 'respondent' for every third-party incident, it would fall short of the objective.""Any person against whom a complaint is filed by the aggrieved woman before the ICC constituted at her workplace under Section 9, is a 'respondent' under the Act, and as per the scheme of Section 11(1), if the 'respondent' is an 'employee', his service rules shall apply and in the absence of service rules, inquiry shall be conducted as prescribed, but the 'respondent' need not necessarily be an employee of the same 'workplace',"" the bench said.",Supreme Court clarifies procedure for inquiry into a sexual harassment at workplace complaint.

NEW DELHI: Textiles, apparel and hospitality could generate the strongest job growth by 2030, driven by higher investment in these sectors, according to a new report by economic policy think tank NCAER, which also called for measures to remove bottlenecks for faster expansion.Moderate growth in manufacturing and services output could raise jobs in textiles, garments and related industries by 53%, and employment in trade, hotels and similar services by 79% by 2030. While the economy displayed robust expansion in recent times, the report stated job quality did not keep pace as most employment gains came from self-employment (largely in agriculture) rather than from stable, salaried work.""India's employment strategy must go beyond setting aggregrate growth target to attaining calibrated mix of demand side and supply side measures that directly incentivise labour absorption,"" it said.On the supply side, it called for skill development through strengthened vocational programmes, credit portability to allow students to move across institutions, deeper industry partnerships and more investment in training quality.It stated India's labour force participation rate of about 50% was low compared to other nations with the same income level, and a major challenge for growth was dominance of the informal sector.","Textiles, apparel and hospitality are poised for significant job growth by 2030, a new report reveals.

NEW DELHI: Different global organisations, including environmental think tanks, may be ranking India on different green parameters, but the country prefers its own assessment for policy formulation instead of banking on ""external"" findings on pollution, sustainability and disaster resilience. Environment ministry made the country's stand over such global ranking clear through written responses to two different questions in RS on Thursday.Responding to a question on the recent Global Climate Risk Index that ranked India ninth among countries most affected by extreme weather events, the ministry said, ""Govt, however, does not recognise any external ranking as a basis for domestic policy formulation.""Global Climate Risk Index is an annual report published by Germanwatch. The latest report, released last month, analysed six indicators including fatalities and economic loss due to extreme weather events during 1995-2024, showing that India reported a loss of more than 80,000 lives and nearly $170 billion in 430 extreme weather events in past three decades.""A wide range of estimates exist regarding the economic losses and damages caused by climate impacts to the Indian economy.However, isolating climate component of total losses due to extreme weather events continues to remain a challenge,"" the ministry said.Similarly, in response to a question on India's global position in IQAir World Air Quality Ranking, WHO Global Air Quality Database & others, the ministry dismissed such a ranking saying the ""worldwide ranking of cities for pollution levels is not being conducted by official authority"".

The conflict

Why Section 125 became a flashpoint

Shah Bano : One woman, many anxieties

How politics diluted the judgment

Triple talaq: When a word becomes a weapon

What changed, and when

The unresolved ‘what now’

Back to the doorstep

Instant triple talaq isn't some abstract religious custom — it's a brutal power play that shatters lives in seconds. A husband utters three words, and a woman loses her home, income, and future.""Some marriages are 6 months old, but some are also 10 years old. It all ended in a moment,"" says Nazreen Ansari, national president of Muslim Mahila Foundation. “In one instance, a husband living in Saudi Arabia divorced his wife through an email message. The woman was uneducated and helpless — she had no means of seeking justice.”When a marriage ends impulsively, women bear the full blow. Joint accounts freeze, bills mount, and ""adjusting"" becomes code for suffering silently to avoid scandal.Even with adult children or parents, support often evaporates. Priyanka Sharma , counselor at Shanti Sahyog, shares: ""Who bears the blow of impulsive actions? The woman does. The man can break away, but her family may refuse to remarry her.""The real question isn't ""What does the law say?""—it's ""Where will she go?"" and ""Who will pay?""This isn't courtroom theater; it's a doorstep disaster.Picture a ration list slashed, a landlord pounding for rent, school fees piling up unpaid, and a phone buzzing with sympathy laced with judgment.At the centre of the churn is a simple idea that India has still not made emotionally uncomplicated: maintenance is not charity.It is the legal recognition that unpaid labour, shared households, and dependent lives do not disappear the moment a husband says the marriage is over.Yet time and again, a woman’s survival claim—food, rent, medicines, children’s fees—has been recast as a political dispute about identity, community autonomy and the state’s limits.The topic has forever garnered public attention, but with the release of the movie ‘Haq’, this discourse has yet again found its way to the people’s domain.In separation and divorce, the loss is immediate and material.Women in such disputes often describe a sudden stop in cash flow. The joint account that becomes inaccessible, the monthly expenses that remain stubbornly monthly, and the social pressure to “adjust” because litigation is seen as a public scandal.Even when adult children exist, they are not always economically stable; even when parents exist, they are not always willing or able to take a daughter back.“I remember one case where a woman faced triple talaq in anger. Her husband said it impulsively. Later, her parents insisted she reconcile, but she had suffered a lot. In such cases, women endure the most. They’re pressured by society and family alike,” Priyanka recalls.For many, the marital home is not just a place—it is the only affordable roof.“Who bears the blow of impulsive actions? The woman does, of course. The man in the relationship can break away from the marriage, but in many cases, the girl’s family do not even want her to get married to someone else,” explains Priyanka Sharma, counsellor and community mobiliser at Shanti Sahyog.While some families insist their daughters to reconcile, in other cases, the husband himself has a change of heart. Ansari shares the scenario for women who have to remarry their husbands.“If he later regrets it and wishes to return, the practice of halala becomes another form of exploitation for women,” Nazreen says.She further goes on to elaborate on the other side of the case.“Even after a marriage is ended completely, for how long can the woman sustain herself? Or for how long can her parents look after her and her kids?” Nazreen questions the fate of women who are then left with an uncertain future.That is why maintenance matters. For the woman who has not been earning, or earns too little to restart life overnight, maintenance is what stands between dignity and destitution.The politics begins when this basic safety net is framed not as a welfare-like protection in a modern republic but as an intrusion into personal law.Both Nazreen Ansari and Priyanka Sharma have had encounters with cases of women who had to go through triple talaq. Many cases came after the divorce; however, many also came before the divorce.“We first ask the women what they want—whether they wish to continue living with their families or not. Then, we call both parties for counselling sessions. Many families reconcile and continue living together after such sessions,” Sharma says, “If reconciliation fails, the cases are referred to CAW Cells or legal authorities for divorce proceedings.”Nazreen shares two cases she saw.“In the first case, a woman I knew personally was expecting her first child when her husband stopped speaking to her. His family pressured him to divorce her,” she says.“We intervened and guided her to approach the family court. Over time, the couple reconciled and is now living happily with two children — a son and a daughter,” Ansari shared the story of reconciliation.“In the second case,” she adds, “a woman who was abandoned by her husband had no means to support herself or her child.”In those cases, Ansari’s NGO help women counsel and guide them to get back on their feet.“Initially, she depended on her parents, but that wasn’t sustainable. We counselled her and helped her set up a small shop. Today, she is financially independent and raising her child on her own.”In the Indian legal system, Section 144 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), earlier Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, has often been described in plain terms as an anti-destitution measure. It is meant to prevent dependents—wives, children, parents—from being left without support.Its logic is secular: the state steps in so that private abandonment does not become public poverty.But when women from religious minorities invoke a provision that looks “uniform” in its application, the argument quickly leaves the home and enters the arena of identity.Critics see it as the state imposing a one-size-fits-all morality; supporters see it as the state finally doing what it is supposed to do—protect vulnerable citizens regardless of faith.The woman, meanwhile, is usually asking for something less philosophical. She asks for a sum that can keep a family afloat.The Shah Bano case became the national turning point because it placed these questions under the harshest light.Shah Bano Begum, an elderly divorced Muslim woman, sought maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The dispute moved through the courts until it reached the Supreme Court, which ruled in her favour—affirming, in effect, that a religion-neutral maintenance provision could apply and that the prevention of destitution was a constitutional and civic concern.The verdict did more than decide one case. It signalled that the language of equality and welfare could reach into domains governed by religious personal law.For many women’s rights advocates, it looked like overdue justice. For many within the community, it felt like a warning bell: if the state can do this on maintenance, what comes next?Those “what next” anxieties—never purely legal, always political—helped convert a maintenance dispute into a referendum on minority identity and state power.The backlash to Shah Bano was swift and loud.Protests, public mobilisation and political messaging turned the case into a pressure test for the government of the day: stand by a court’s expansive reading of women’s protection, or defuse community anger by narrowing the verdict’s effect.Parliament’s response—the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986—was widely read by critics as a rollback that diluted the Supreme Court’s reasoning. Supporters defended it as necessary to respect Muslim personal law.Courts, over time, tried to interpret the law in ways that did not abandon the goal of preventing destitution.But the damage to the larger idea was already done. It told the country that even the highest court’s gender-justice moment could be politically “managed” into something smaller.Decades after Shah Bano, the conversation returned through a different door: instant triple talaq—talaq pronounced thrice in one sitting, treated by some as an immediate end to marriage.For women, the complaint was not abstract theology; it was lived harm.A marriage could be terminated abruptly, often without due process, without meaningful negotiation, and with the woman suddenly pushed into economic and social free fall.The moral and political arguments split predictably. Reformers called it arbitrary and cruel. Defenders warned against state interference and majoritarian impulses. But again, the practical issue was urgent: in many cases, the instantness of the divorce multiplied vulnerability—especially where women had limited income, limited family support, and limited access to legal help.Legal change came in two steps.First, in 2017, the Supreme Court set aside instant triple talaq, holding that it could not survive constitutional scrutiny in the form it was being defended. In plain terms, the practice was invalidated: a pronouncement could not, by itself, instantly snap a marriage in a way that left women without protection.Second, in 2019, Parliament enacted a law that made the pronouncement of instant triple talaq void and illegal, adding criminal penalties.This is where a new—and politically charged—question emerged.Should a civil vulnerability be addressed through criminal law?Supporters argued that strong deterrence was necessary because women had been ignored for too long. Critics argued that criminalisation could create fresh risks. It could harden family conflict, it could be misused, and it could complicate the very maintenance and support women need by pushing the husband into the criminal justice system.The law on paper is only the beginning. The lived reality depends on access: whether a woman can find a lawyer, whether she can afford repeated court dates, whether the police station feels like protection or intimidation, whether family pressure forces an out-of-court settlement that leaves her short-changed, and whether a maintenance order is actually enforced.Politically, personal law reform remains high-voltage.Every intervention is interpreted through partisan lenses. Every verdict is packaged into slogans. And every woman who steps into the system is quietly asked to carry the weight of a national argument she did not start.The country’s big debates—personal law, religious law, minority rights—often arrive at a woman’s home in small, sharp ways: the neighbour’s whisper, the relative’s ultimatum, the landlord’s deadline.The question she lives with is not whether India will one day have uniform family law. It is whether her children will stay in school, whether she can afford medicine, and whether she has a bed to sleep on next month.In India’s personal-law battles, the loudest slogans are rarely the ones that keep a woman housed.","Triple talaq is a brutal power play that shatters lives in seconds. A husband utters three words, and a woman loses her home, income, and future. The real question isn't ""What does the law say?""—it's ""Where will she go?"" and ""Who will pay?""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128059675,imgsize-1039518,width-400,resizemode-4/128059675.jpg"

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his urgent intervention to direct the Ministry of Railways to expedite sanctioned projects in the state by releasing required funds and reviving those kept in abeyance.Stalin highlighted that the progress of several crucial railway projects is being hindered by ""delays in releasing funds by the Ministry of Railways"" and the practice of providing partial funding for individual projects.He noted that while the state government has granted administrative approval for acquiring 2,500.61 hectares for various federal railway projects, the Railway Department is yet to allocate funds for 931.52 hectares, an official release said.""The delays in releasing funds and the piecemeal allocation... have hindered the progress of railway projects in Tamil Nadu,"" the chief minister stated, adding that this has created a state of ""prolonged uncertainty"" for affected landowners.Stalin pointed out that land acquisition is 94 per cent complete for 19 major projects, with 1,198.02 hectares already handed over to the Railways. He specifically cited the 'Thiruvananthapuram-Kanniyakumari Broad Gauge Doubling' project as a case where 16.86 hectares of land acquisition remains stalled because the Railways has not yet released the necessary Rs 289.78 crore for compensation.The CM urged the Prime Minister to ensure that funds for sanctioned projects are released ""in full and on a priority basis"" to facilitate smooth land acquisition. He also requested the ""reconsideration and restarting"" of key projects currently in abeyance, including the Thoothukudi-Madurai (via Aruppukottai) and the Tindivanam-Tiruvannamalai broad gauge lines.Emphasising Tamil Nadu's role as India's second-largest economy, Stalin expressed concern over the ""relatively low"" allocation for new railway projects in the state in recent years. He called for additional projects commensurate with the state's ""economic stature and developmental needs"".""I am confident that, with your intervention and with the continued spirit of cooperative federalism, these concerns will be addressed promptly for the mutual benefit of the state and the nation,"" the letter said.Stalin assured the Prime Minister of the state government's full cooperation for the ""speedy execution"" of all railway projects.

US presses for new nuclear architecture



Push for three-way talks with China

NEW DELHI: The United States has accused China of conducting a covert nuclear explosive test on June 22, 2020, just days after the deadly Galwan Valley clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, saying the allegation underscores the need for a new global arms control framework following the expiry of the New START treaty.On June 15, 2020, a week before the alleged nuclear test, the Indian and Chinese troops clashed in Ladakh. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed, while reports at the time estimated Chinese casualties at over 35.US Under Secretary of State Thomas G DiNanno said China used techniques designed to evade international monitoring systems while carrying out yield-producing nuclear tests.""China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons… China has used decoupling – a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring – to hide its activities from the world.

Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clashes, while intelligence reports at the time estimated Chinese casualties at over 30.DiNanno’s remarks came as the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, formally expired this week, leaving the world’s two largest nuclear powers without binding limits on their strategic arsenals for the first time in more than five decades.""New START was signed in 2010 and its limits on warheads and launchers are no longer relevant in 2026 when one nuclear power is expanding its arsenal at a scale and pace not seen in over half a century and another continues to maintain and develop a vast range of nuclear systems unconstrained by New START’s terms,"" DiNanno said.He said the treaty imposed uneven constraints on nuclear powers.""…almost all of the U.S. deployed nuclear forces were subject to New START while only a fraction of Russia's much larger stockpile was… exactly zero Chinese nuclear weapons were covered by New START,"" he said.DiNanno said alleged covert testing by China, alongside Russian violations and the growth of global nuclear stockpiles, made it necessary to pursue a new arms control framework suited to present-day threats.""This confluence of factors – serial Russian violations, growth of worldwide stockpiles, and flaws in New START’s design and implementation – gives the United States a clear imperative to call for a new architecture that addresses the threats of today, not those of a bygone era,"" he said.He added that Washington was now in a position to strengthen deterrence while remaining open to meaningful negotiations.""No longer constrained by the political-military circumstances of 2010 and the treaty they yielded and in response to the destabilizing behavior of these other countries, the United States can now finally take steps… to strengthen deterrence on behalf of the American people and our allies,"" DiNanno said.The US has renewed calls for three-way nuclear arms control talks involving China and Russia following New START’s expiration. Washington has said any future agreement must include Beijing, a demand China has firmly rejected.China has denied the US allegations of covert nuclear testing and has said it will not participate in disarmament negotiations at this stage, arguing that its nuclear arsenal remains far smaller than those of the United States and Russia.US President Donald Trump had previously hinted at similar accusations without offering details. On October 31 last year, Trump said Washington would begin nuclear testing ""on an equal basis"" with Moscow and Beijing, without elaborating on the nature of such tests.Analysts have warned that the end of New START marks a turning point in global nuclear stability, with the absence of formal limits increasing the risk of a renewed arms race amid rising geopolitical tensions and mistrust.","US Under Secretary of State Thomas G DiNanno said China used techniques designed to evade international monitoring systems while carrying out yield-producing nuclear tests.

HAL Clarifies AMCA Status, Says It Will Bid For India's Fifth-Generation Fighter Jet In 2035 Phase

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","HAL has received five engines from GE as on date.

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

The impasse over the India-Pakistan T20 WC match showed no signs of being resolved, after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif weighed in on the issue, calling their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision”. It was a “considered stance” to support Bangladesh, he said.“We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won’t play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field. We have taken a very considered stance, and we should completely stand by Bangladesh, and I think this is a very appropriate decision. We are with Bangladesh,” the PM said.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Nazrul acknowledged Sharif’s decision. “Thank you, Pakistan,” Nazrul wrote in a social media post.As the start of this contentious World Cup nears, speaking at a pre-tournament captain’s press conferences from two different locations – Mumbai’s BCCI headquarters and from Colombo — both teams’ captains broke their silence on the issue.“We haven’t refused to play against Pakistan. They have refused. The mindset is pretty clear. We have not said no, it has come from them,” India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said.“The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue. Our flight is booked for Colombo and we are going,” he added.Salman Ali Agha, his Pakistani opposite number, said, “The India game is not in our control. It’s the govt’s and PCB’s decision and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we will do that.”“If we have to play them again in the semifinal or final, we will have to go back to them (govt) and act on their advice,” added the Pakistan skipper. The Indian captain acknowledged that the situation is “not easy” for those involved in the issue, including the ICC.“I feel it is not an easy job. It is not my call. I am sure they (the ICC) might be working out something as well but it has come from the other govt or the nation, how can they (the ICC) help as well? Their (Pakistan’s) decision is not in my control. I wish I could take their decisions, but then it is their call,” said Suryakumar.“We have been told that we have to play a game in Colombo on Feb 15th. We played them three times in the Asia Cup, we played some good cricket. We won (all the matches) and we were very happy. Similarly, if we get an opportunity in Colombo, we will definitely play,” he added.Earlier, Inter national Cricket Council (ICC) had expressed serious concerns over the Pakistan govt’s decision.“This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” it had said. “This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif calls their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision’ India captain Suryakumar Yadav: “The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127969189,imgsize-493153,width-400,resizemode-4/india-vs-pakistan.jpg"

India to Buy 114 Rafales: Why 4.5-Gen Fighters Still Matter I OPEN COLLAR I EPISODE 1

NEW DELHI: Ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to India for the Artificial Intelligence Summit from Feb 18 to 20, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh , is scheduled to meet in the second week of this month to consider big-ticket defence procurement proposals, a defence source told TOI. Most important of them all is the likely proposal to grant Acceptance of Necessary (AoN) next week to buy 114 Rafale fighter jets from France at a cost of Rs 3.25 lakh crore.The proposed project will entail procurement of 18 aircraft in fly away condition and the rest made in India with up to 60% indigenous content. About 80% of the 114 Rafales proposed to be acquired under the deal are planned to be manufactured in India. Sources said the IAF is going to get 88 single-seater and 26 twin-seater aircraft under the project, of which the majority would be built in India with the collaboration of Dassault and Indian private sector companies.The acquisition, which was already cleared by Defence Procurement Board last month, will head to the apex body for the next round of clearances, following which the formal process of technical and commercial negotiations will start. Deal may be given the final shape during Macron’s visit to India.The IAF is currently operating around 30 fighter squadrons, well short of its sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons, at a time when threat perceptions are rising from Pakistan and China.Defence analysts point to increasing strategic collusion between Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as Pakistan and China, as key factors that have heightened regional security concerns. Once the deal gets completed, IAF will have a fleet of 150 Rafales, along with 26 of the Indian Navy, which will have an aircraft carrier-compatible version of the French planes.Operation Sindoor has shown the significance of the ‘4.5-gen king’ Rafale in offensive operations as it is armed with deadly missiles like Meteor, scalp and laser-guided bombs. The Rafale project is expected to help the IAF meet its requirement for a 4.5-gen-plus multirole fighter aircraft for a long time.The deal is urgently required as India is unlikely to get the new fifth-generation fighter plane Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) any time in near future as the process to shortlist companies for building such an advanced stealth fighter is still going on and HAL’s Tejas MkIA production programme is moving at a snail’s pace due to its dependence on Tejas engine on American company GE.","The proposed project will entail procurement of 18 aircraft in fly away condition and the rest made in India with up to 60% indigenous content.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Sonia Gandhi Saturday described as ""politically motivated and frivolous"" a criminal revision petition before a Delhi court against a 2025 magisterial order that declined to order an FIR over alleged inclusion of her name in electoral rolls in 1980, three years before she acquired Indian citizenship.The petition before special judge Vishal Gogne of Rouse Avenue sessions court alleges that the Italian origin Sonia's name was added using forged documents. The Congress senior described the claims as ""wholly misconceived"" and the plea as ""abuse of the process of law"".The plea was filed by one Vikas Tripathi, challenging magistrate Vaibhav Chaurasiya's refusal on Sept 11 last year to order the FIR. Sonia had been sent notices on Dec 9, 2025, over the plea. Judge Gogne noted the reply on Saturday and listed the matter for arguments on Feb 21.In her reply, Sonia said the trial (magistrate) court had rightly held that issues of citizenship fall ""exclusively within the domain of the Central govt"", while electoral roll disputes are ""vested solely with Election Commission of India "". She argued that criminal courts cannot entertain private complaints disguised as IPC or BNS offences, as this would violate the doctrine of separation of powers and Article 329 of the Constitution, which bars judicial interference in the electoral process.Sonia added that a ""controversy raised in the media more than 25 years back"" was being recycled to file the revision plea, with allegations that were ""speculative and unsupported"" by authentic documents, and which failed to specify the documents allegedly forged or their source.Although the plea claims Sonia's name was ""re-entered"" in electoral rolls with a qualifying date of Jan 1, 1983, no supporting document was placed on record. ""It is incomprehensible on what basis it has been claimed that the respondent got her name re-entered,"" the reply states.","The petition alleges that the Italian origin Sonia's name was added using forged documents.

“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm

NEW DELHI: BJP corporator Ritu Tawde is set to become Mumbai’s next mayor after being elected unopposed, marking the party’s return to the post after 44 years and ending the Shiv Sena’s uninterrupted 25-year hold over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).The contest turned uncontested after the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) decided not to field a challenger against Tawde, effectively clearing her path to the mayor’s office. Though the mayor’s role is largely ceremonial, it carries strong political and symbolic significance in Mumbai’s identity-driven civic politics.Tawde’s elevation will be the BJP’s first mayoral win in Mumbai since Prabhakar Pai’s tenure in 1982–83. It also means the undivided Shiv Sena, which controlled the BMC from 1997 to 2022, will not hold the mayor’s post after nearly three decades.On the final day of nominations, the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, a BJP ally in the ruling Mahayuti, nominated Sanjay Ghadi as its candidate for deputy mayor. The party announced that the deputy mayor’s tenure would be split, allowing multiple corporators to serve during the term.A senior BMC official told PTI that only one nomination each was received for the mayor’s and deputy mayor’s posts before the 6 pm deadline. “We have received just one nomination from BJP’s Ritu Tawde for the mayor’s post and another from Sanjay Ghadi for the deputy mayor’s post,” the official said.Although opposition parties have not filed nominations, the election process will be formally completed on February 11, which is also the last day for withdrawal of nominations. The mayor’s post has been reserved for a woman candidate from the open category following a draw of lots by the Urban Development Department.Tawde (53), a corporator from Ghatkopar East, filed her nomination at the municipal secretary’s office in the presence of senior Mahayuti leaders, including minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha and BJP Mumbai unit chief Ameet Satam.Speaking to reporters, she said a safer and more developed Mumbai was her priority and that she wanted to work for citizens of the cosmopolitan city.The Shiv Sena (UBT) was expected to challenge the BJP nominee but decided against it after a meeting at party chief Uddhav Thackeray’s residence. Former Mumbai mayor and Sena (UBT) leader Kishori Pednekar said the decision reflected respect for Marathi identity.“The BJP had to accept that Marathi manoos is a Hindu. If the mayor of Mumbai is Marathi manoos, we won’t do anything that amounts to a bad omen. We have accepted the arithmetic and will play the role of a strong opposition and fight for Mumbai,” Pednekar said.The Sena (UBT) had raised the Marathi identity plank in last month’s BMC elections, where it contested in alliance with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats in the 227-member civic body. The ruling Mahayuti alliance, with a combined strength of 118 corporators, comfortably crossed the halfway mark of 114.Addressing a press conference earlier in the day, BJP’s Satam said that the city was set to get a BJP mayor after four decades. “We have the backing of 118 corporators and the support of more members. The Mahayuti will work to free the BMC from the clutches of corruption,” he said.Satam also said that the alliance had asserted from the beginning that Mumbai’s mayor would be Marathi and Hindu. “The city will now get a Marathi, Malvani, Konkani and Hindu mayor,” he added.Reacting sharply, the NCP (SP) criticised the BJP’s choice, saying selecting a former Congress leader as mayor had demoralised party loyalists. NCP (SP) spokesperson Clyde Crasto said, “By choosing a former Congresswoman as mayor, the BJP has insulted its own loyal corporators who have given their blood, sweat and tears for the party.”Tawde, who joined the BJP in 2012 after quitting the Congress, was elected as a corporator the same year. During her first term, she chaired the BMC’s Education Committee and raised issues related to infrastructure, water supply and public safety. She was also in the spotlight for raising objections to mannequins displaying objectionable clothing in shops.Ghadi, a corporator from Ward No. 5 who defected from Sena (UBT) to the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, will serve as deputy mayor for 15 months, party secretary Sanjay More said.The BMC, India’s richest civic body, has been under a state-appointed administrator since March 2022 following the end of the previous term. Its budget for 2025–26 stands at Rs 74,450 crore, higher than that of several Indian states.","BJP corporator Ritu Tawde is set to become Mumbai’s next mayor after being elected unopposed.

From Tamil Pride To Global Trust: How PM Modi Used Culture To Reset India-Malaysia Relations

KUALA LUMPUR/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday chose an Indian community event in Kuala Lumpur to shower praise on Tamil culture and highlight the presence of several Tamilians in key positions in India. The focus on Tamilians was, though, very much in order as they make up an overwhelming majority of people of Indian origins in Malaysia.Tamil literature is eternal and its culture global, he emphasised, noting that Malaysia is home to the second largest population of Indian-origin community in the world.In India, he said, Vice-President C P Radhakrishnan is a Tamilian and so are key members of his govt, EAM S Jaishankar and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. A junior minister L Murugan is from Tamil Nadu as well, he added.Though he has often voiced his admiration for Tamil language and culture, his generous praise at the event in Kuala Lumpur had political significance as well, as Tamil Nadu is headed for the assembly polls.At the 'Selamat Datang Modi Ji (welcome Modi)' event, Modi recalled that when he first visited Malaysia in 2015, India was in the 11th spot of the economic ladder and today, a decade later, in the top three.""With the world's largest digital public infrastructure propelling country's economy, creating third largest start-up hub in the world, the country is ensuring clean and green growth,"" he added, announcing that ""UPI would be available in Malaysia very soon. ""He announced India's decision to open its first consulate in Malaysia to strengthen ongoing cooperation between India and Malaysia and expand outreach to the Indian community in Malaysia.He said Tamil is India's gift to the world. Noting that Tamil diaspora has been present in Malaysia for many centuries, he said inspired by its history, India had established the Thiruvalluvar Chair at the University of Malaya and would now set up a Thiruvalluvar Centre to further strengthen shared heritage.The Prime Minister praised his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim for the warm welcome accorded to him and said it emphasised his love and respect for India and the Indian community.

"BJP mocks NC’s ‘special status’ call for J&K, says no return of Article 370",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-mocks-ncs-special-status-call-for-jk-says-no-return-of-article-370/articleshow/128046244.cms,"'Whole Of Jammu And Kashmir Should Be Reunited With India': British MP Bob Blackman

JAMMU: Governing National Conference’s (NC) insistence on restoration of J&K’s “special status” since forming the govt in 2024 drew on Saturday a sharp counter from BJP, which argued that there is no such term in the Indian Constitution while dismissing the call as “no status”.“Show me where the words ‘special status’ are written for J&K in the Indian Constitution. If they can find it, I am ready to face any punishment,” leader of opposition, BJP’s Sunil Sharma, said in the assembly.The dare came in response to NC legislator Javid Hassan Baig’s demand for special status while speaking on Friday’s budget presented by CM Omar Abdullah . Baig contended that the term was enshrined in Article 370 , which defined the constitutional relationship between the erstwhile J&K state and the Indian Union.Baig said Article 35A, which flowed from Article 370, was even more important as it safeguarded land rights and govt jobs for J&K’s people. He further argued that J&K’s Constitution existed under the Constitution of India, granting the region internal autonomy, while external sovereignty had been surrendered to the Union.Article 370, Article 35A, the J&K Constitution and J&K state flag, taken together, constituted what was known as “special status” and it is this NC wanted restored, Baig explained.Sharma countered saying NC’s demand must be backed by an explicit constitutional term while asserting that “Article 370 has been buried”. “What is special status? Where is it mentioned? It is mentioned nowhere. Many states seek special packages and incentives, which can include employment or development packages. They can be called special status,” Sharma said.Outside the assembly, Sharma reiterated that there is no reference to “special status” in the context of J&K’s accession or merger with India and accused NC of misleading voters.On Nov 6, 2024, soon after NC was voted to office, the assembly passed a resolution seeking restoration of “special status” but did not spell out what it meant by the term. In May last year, a key NC meeting chaired by president Farooq Abdullah adopted a resolution for restoration of special status and full J&K statehood. That resolution, too, stopped short of defining the phrase.Former CM Mehbooba Mufi’s PDP and Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference (PC) have earlier asked NC to clarify its position.","National Conference wants restoration of J&K’s “special status” since forming the govt in 2024.

Signal to Islamabad

NEW DELHI: As New Delhi and Washington announced the framework for an interim trade agreement on Saturday, a map of India released by the US trade representative’s (USTR) office drew attention.The map, shared alongside details of the trade deal framework, shows the entire Jammu and Kashmir region – including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) – as part of India.It also depicts Aksai Chin, a region claimed by China, within Indian territory. China claims the territory and has objected to India’s position, a dispute that has remained a sensitive issue in bilateral ties between New Delhi and Beijing.In a post on X US trade representative said, “From tree nuts and dried distillers’ grains to red sorghum and fresh and processed fruit, the US-India Agreement will provide new market access for American products.While India has consistently maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of the country and does not require external validation of its sovereignty, the depiction marks a departure from earlier US government maps, which typically showed the other claims as a part of the map.The timing of the map release is notable, coming as India and the US are moving to better the trade ties following months of speculation.Earlier this year, the Trump administration imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, including an additional 25% for Russian oil imports – the highest levied on a US ally – amid stalled trade negotiations. Under the interim framework announced, that tariff is set to be reduced to 18%, one of the lowest among Asian countries.Though the USTR did not comment on the map, it comes as an embarrassment for Pakistan, which claims PoK.The release also comes amid sustained diplomatic outreach by Pakistan to Washington in recent months, including multiple visits by Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif and army chief, Asim Munir, and meetings with President Trump.The interim trade pact, expected to be signed by mid-March, is aimed at easing trade tensions and providing relief to Indian exporters after months of uncertainty.","The US trade representative's office released a map of India on Saturday.

Supreme Court Stays Its Order On Aravalli Definition, Environment Minister Welcomes Move

An evolving movement

In the heat of Rajasthan ’s desert districts, a tree has become the focal point of a widening confrontation. Markets have shut, saints have gone on strike, political rivals have shared protest stages, and thousands have gathered under open skies to demand its protection.What began in Bikaner as a local objection to the alleged felling of khejri trees for solar power projects has since evolved into the ‘Khejri Bachao Andolan’, a statewide campaign pressing for stricter legal safeguards and an immediate ban on cutting the species.The movement has drawn support across party lines, producing a rare moment of political convergence.The khejri, botanically known asand recognised as Rajasthan’s state tree, occupies a distinctive place in the ecology of the Thar desert.Amid the ongoing protests, chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma, assuring the protection of the khejri, termed the tree as the state’s “” a wish-fulfilling tree in Indian tradition.In an arid landscape where survival is closely tied to ecology, the reference reaffirms the tree’s symbolic and practical importance. For many communities in western Rajasthan, the debate now extends beyond development policy into questions of history, identity and survival.The present phase of the movement intensified in early February, when over 360 saints and local residents began a hunger strike in Bikaner, demanding an immediate ban on the felling of khejri trees for solar power projects. The protest site was initially the Polytechnic College ground near the Collectorate before shifting to the Bishnoi Dharamshala, where the hunger strike continues.In Bikaner, markets remained closed for hours on Monday after a call by trader associations. Government and private schools in urban areas observed a half-day holiday in solidarity. Thousands gathered at the Polytechnic College ground before marching towards the Collectorate, where organisers announced an indefinite sit-in.Protesters came not only from different districts of Rajasthan but also from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Organisers said they had arranged food for nearly one lakh participants, with hundreds of volunteers handling logistics. Police deployed additional forces, erected barricades near the Collectorate and kept water cannons on standby. Despite the scale and tensions, the protest remained peaceful.Four protesters were admitted to Prince Bijay Singh Memorial Hospital as their health deteriorated during the hunger strike, while several others received medical assistance at camps set up near the site.Mokhram Dharaniya, one of the hospitalised protesters, said, “People are sitting on a hunger strike, including me. Our protest will continue until our demands are met.”At the centre of the agitation are allegations that large numbers of khejri trees have been cut to facilitate solar power projects in western Rajasthan. The region has emerged as a hub for renewable energy, given its high solar irradiance and availability of land. While solar development is central to India’s energy transition goals, protesters argue that project implementation has come at the cost of ecologically vital trees.Tensions escalated when the state government announced a restriction on felling khejri trees only in the Jodhpur and Bikaner divisions. Protesters rejected the move as inadequate, demanding a blanket statewide ban. During one address by a government representative, protesters reportedly took away the microphone, insisting on a written assurance.Minister for skill, employment and entrepreneurship KK Bishnoi and State Animal Welfare Board chairman Jaswant Bishnoi visited the Bishnoi Dharamshala and offered juice to the hunger strikers in an attempt to persuade them to break their fast.The minister said the government was ready to provide a written commitment and appealed to protesters to end the hunger strike. However, saints on the stage refused to withdraw without formal documentation.Agitation leader Parsaram Bishnoi said, “The hunger strike did not end. The government order was incomplete as it failed to cover the entire state.”Former minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati said: “All sections of society participating in the agitation decided to continue until a complete ban on cutting Khejri trees was imposed across Rajasthan.”The issue has resonated in the Rajasthan Assembly. Congress MLA Dungar Ram Gedar raised the matter during Zero Hour, accusing the government of failing to act despite a persistent two-year protest led by the Bishnoi community in Bikaner.“Khejri being the state tree, there is an urgent need for a strict law to protect it,” Gedar said.Independent MLA Ravindra Singh Bhati stated that the matter was already under discussion in the assembly. “Bhagat Singh (the Indian freedom fighter) said that sometimes a blast is needed to make the voice heard. If it takes gheraoing the Assembly to save khejri, I will be at the forefront,” he said.Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma told the assembly that his government was drafting a conservation law for the khejri tree, which he described as the state’s “Kalpavriksha”.“In August, saints from Bikaner, Phalodi, Jodhpur and Nagaur met me. Following that, I instructed officials to prepare the draft legislation. The process is under way, and it will soon be presented in the assembly,” he said.The chief minister also used the assembly session to defend his government’s broader record, speaking about economic growth, recruitment reforms and water supply projects.However, protesters have maintained that until a formal statewide ban is issued, the agitation will continue.Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot expressed support for the public movement, describing the indiscriminate cutting of khejri trees in the name of development as “extremely painful and unacceptable.”He recalled the historical sacrifice associated with the tree and said environmental protection must be prioritised.In a development seen as politically significant, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje publicly backed the movement that has put her own party, the BJP, in the dock.Sharing a photograph of herself worshipping a khejri tree, she wrote, “I also worship the Khejri tree. Rising above politics, we should all come forward to protect it. We must save it. I stand with everyone in the campaign to save the Khejri tree and the Oran (grazing land).” She also quoted a proverb revered in the Bishnoi community:(If a tree can be saved, even at the cost of one’s head, consider it a bargain).Observers have noted that her intervention has added to political pressure on the state government.Any discussion of the khejri in Rajasthan inevitably returns to the events of 1730 in the village of Khejarli near Jodhpur. According to historical accounts, 363 members of the Bishnoi community, led by Amrita Devi Bishnoi, sacrificed their lives to prevent the felling of khejri trees ordered for royal construction.The episode, often referred to as the Khejarli massacre, is widely regarded as one of the earliest recorded instances of environmental resistance. Amrita Devi is said to have declared that the loss of her head would be a small price to save a tree. Her sacrifice and that of the others form a cornerstone of Bishnoi identity and environmental ethics in the region.Protesters in the current agitation have repeatedly invoked this legacy. Even Ashok Gehlot referred to the sacrifice of 363 individuals, including Amrita Devi Bishnoi, and said their legacy should be honoured.The khejri is uniquely adapted to arid (extremely dry) and semi-arid climates. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater and survive prolonged drought. Unlike many other species, it does not compete aggressively with crops and is often grown in agricultural fields in a traditional agroforestry system.An agroforestry system is a land-use practice where trees are grown alongside crops or livestock on the same land to improve productivity and sustainability.Its leaves, known as “loong,” are used as fodder for livestock. Its pods, called “sangri,” are a staple ingredient in traditional Rajasthani cuisine, particularly in the dish. The wood is used as fuel and timber, while its bark and other parts have been used in traditional medicine.Ecologically, the tree improves soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, reduces desertification by stabilising sand dunes and provides shade in extreme heat. In regions where annual rainfall is minimal, it plays a crucial role in sustaining both human and animal life.Given these attributes, many in Rajasthan see the khejri not just as a tree but as a symbol of resilience and survival in a harsh environment.Currently, khejri trees are protected under various forest and environmental regulations, but protesters argue that enforcement is inconsistent and that ambiguities in existing laws create loopholes. Former Luni MLA Mahendra Vishnoi said, “Confusion exists in current laws concerning khejri conservation. The penalties must be precise and severe. Without a fear of the law, this destruction will persist.”Environmental activist Mokhram Dharniya alleged administrative inaction. “The administration has betrayed us repeatedly. Over the past year, we have held numerous protests, receiving assurances each time, while the trees continue to be axed. We will not permit the cutting of khejri anymore,” he said.One of the demands emerging from the agitation is a provision imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh for violations. Activists have also called for a temporary statewide ban on felling until a comprehensive conservation law is enacted.The agitation has extended beyond Bikaner. In Barmer, protesters gathered at the Collectorate, and some youths climbed the gate and raised slogans after police closed the premises. A memorandum addressed to the chief minister was submitted.The movement has also taken on a deeply personal dimension for some families. Following the death of environmental activist Radheshyam Bishnoi in a road accident last year, his mother Ratni Devi and wife Nirma Bishnoi have continued his work and are now on a hunger strike demanding protection for khejri trees.Meanwhile, reports of illegal logging in other parts of the state, including in the forest area of Bayana subdivision in Bharatpur district, have further fuelled concerns about enforcement.Activists said the issue concerns the entire desert belt, including Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Pali, Jalore, Phalodi, Sriganganagar, and Churu.Protesters alleged that thousands of khejri trees were felled in recent years, largely for infrastructure and solar power projects.Founder of the Khejri Bachao Andolan, Parasram Bishnoi, said the agitation would continue until the state enacts a specific law making the cutting of khejri trees a punishable offence.“Large tracts of desert land are being indiscriminately handed over to solar parks, destroying the local ecosystem. Without legal protection, the desert’s survival is at stake,” Bishnoi told TOI.He added that participation is swelling daily and asserted that the onus now lies on the state government led by chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma.Bishnoi alleged that khejri trees were uprooted across vast desert areas both in the name of renewable energy projects and by an illegal wood mafia, with little effective oversight.The unfolding debate reflects a broader tension between renewable energy expansion and environmental safeguards. Rajasthan is a key state in India’s solar mission. Large tracts of land are being allocated for solar parks, transmission corridors and associated infrastructure.While renewable energy is seen as essential for climate mitigation, local communities argue that development planning must take into account ecological realities and traditional land-use patterns. The khejri, embedded in agricultural and grazing systems, is not easily replaceable.For many protesters, the demand is not to halt development but to ensure that it does not erode the ecological foundation of desert life.As the Khejri Bachao Andolan entered its sixth day, its trajectory remains uncertain. The state government has indicated it is drafting legislation. Protesters insist on immediate written assurances and a comprehensive statewide ban.What is clear is that the agitation has tapped into a powerful historical memory and a deeply rooted cultural ethos. The khejri tree stands at the intersection of ecology, economy and identity in Rajasthan. Its fate has become a test case for how the state balances development with conservation in one of India’s most fragile landscapes.Whether the movement results in a new conservation law, stricter enforcement or a recalibration of project implementation, it has already reaffirmed the enduring symbolic power of a tree that many in Rajasthan consider their “Kalpavriksha”.","What began in Bikaner as a local objection to the alleged felling of khejri trees for solar power projects has since evolved into a statewide campaign. The movement has drawn support across party lines, producing a rare moment of political convergence. Markets have shut, saints have gone on strike, political rivals have shared protest stages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128031778,imgsize-121300,width-400,resizemode-4/stories-2026-02-07t171238357.jpg"

CHANDIGARH: Senior AAP leader Anurag Dhanda on Saturday accused the BJP government in Haryana of stopping about 37,000 players' diet allowance in the state for the past 10 months.He further slammed the ruling party for allegedly citing ""absurd"" reasons to refuse pension payments to over 75,000 elderly people in Haryana.Speaking to mediapersons here, AAP's national media in-charge Dhanda said Haryana has always been the land of sports, and most of the players who have raised the country's tricolour high in the Olympics, Commonwealth and Asian Games have come from this soil.""But today, those same players are asking whether the value of their hard work and medals is limited only to garnering applause on election platforms,"" Dhanda said.He attacked Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and said the players shed their blood and sweat on the field all day, and their parents, who earn their livelihood through hard work, work to help them win medals.Dhanda alleged that the state government had not paid the diet allowance of 37,000 players who practise in sports nurseries in the state for the past 10 months.The purpose of the sports nurseries was to enable grassroots players to get good training and nutrition so they could compete at the national and international levels, he said.He further claimed that the coaches training these players have not received their salaries either for 10 months.""Should the players focus on arranging their meals or preparing for their sport?"" the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader questioned.Dhanda alleged that the state government was closing the nurseries for two months every year. ""Does any athlete prepare for international medals by taking a two-month break?"" he asked.On the alleged suspension of pension payments to over 75,000 elderly people, he said, ""If a farmer receives Rs 1.50 or Rs 2 lakh in their account for their crop, they are being told that they have an income of Rs 3 lakh and therefore, they cannot receive pension. This means the Nayab government considers a farmer who sells crops worth Rs 3 lakh to be wealthy,"" he claimed.In some cases, pensions are being stopped by citing the total family income in the Parivar Pehchan Patra (family ID) and in some cases, due to mismatches in name, surname or age, he claimed.At many places, the entire family's income is being considered, even though the elderly person's income has no connection to the family's income, he added.Hundreds of elderly people and women are queuing up at government offices across Haryana, asking why their pensions have been cut, the AAP leader said.","Senior AAP leader Anurag Dhanda accused the BJP government in Haryana of stopping about 37,000 players' diet allowance in the state for the past 10 months.

Weeks After Noida Techie's Death, Delhi Biker Dies After Falling Into Pit Dug By Jal Board

Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has issued an eight-point safety framework to prevent Janakpuri-like accidents where a biker died after falling into a DJB dug pit, and sought a list of excavation sites in the city within three days.Taking a ""very strong"" view of the tragic accident reported in the Janakpuri area of west Delhi on Friday, the chief minister has ordered immediate, time-bound action across all departments and executing agencies to prevent any recurrence of such an incident, a Delhi CMO statement said.""Expressing deep concern over lapses in safety arrangements at excavation and digging sites, the chief minister has directed strict enforcement of safety norms and fixed clear accountability on officers and contractors,"" it said.The chief secretary, on the directions of the chief minister, has issued a memorandum listing an eight-point safety framework to be followed without exception at all construction, repair and maintenance works involving digging or excavation of roads, footpaths and underground utilities across the city.According to the eight-point directive, all work sites must display proper and adequate warning signage prominently and sufficiently in advance from all approaches.Reflector lights, blinkers and luminous tapes are to be mandatorily installed around excavated areas and barricades, especially during night hours and in low-visibility conditions.Asserting that loss of life due to negligence is unacceptable, Gupta asserted that public safety cannot be compromised under any circumstances. Accountability will be fixed, and strict action will follow wherever lapses are found, she said in the statement.""The chief minister has made it clear that the safety of citizens is paramount. No department or contractor will be allowed to cut corners, and enforcement on the ground will be closely monitored,"" the statement read further.The directive applies to all departments and agencies under the administrative control of the Delhi government, including Public Works Department (PWD), Irrigation and Flood Control Department (I&FC), Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), power distribution companies (DISCOMs) and all other executing agencies and contractors.The chief minister has also ordered that strong, continuous and clearly visible barricading be ensured around the entire work site by all departments to prevent accidental access by pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles.Barricades must be erected in a manner that eliminates the risk of accidents and ensures that no excavated material or open digging is visible to passersby or causes dust pollution.The directive fixes clear responsibility for compliance on both the concerned field officers and the executing agencies or contractors, the CMO said.Engineers-in-charge and field engineers have been instructed to conduct regular inspections of all such work sites and ensure that prescribed safety measures are maintained throughout the execution period.In a time-bound move, all departments and organisations have been ordered to carry out an immediate review of all ongoing and recently undertaken excavation and digging works within Delhi. A consolidated report detailing the locations of such sites, safety measures in place, and corrective steps taken wherever deficiencies are noticed must be submitted to the chief secretary's office within three days.The chief minister has made it unequivocally clear that any violation, laxity or non-compliance with these instructions will be viewed seriously, the statement noted.In the event of any accident, injury or loss of life attributable to negligence, strict disciplinary action will be initiated against responsible officers and agencies in accordance with rules, in addition to any other legal action that may be warranted.All departments have also been directed to immediately issue instructions to subordinate offices, field officials and executing agencies and to ensure regular monitoring and strict enforcement of these safety measures at all work sites, the statement added.","Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has issued an eight-point safety framework to prevent accidents.

CHENNAI: Diversity in judicial appointments, regional benches of the Supreme Court, increase in the retirement age of high court judges from 62 to 65 and the constitutional status for the collegium which selects and transfers judges — these are the salient features of a private member Bill moved by the DMK’s Rajya Sabha member P Wilson seeking necessary amendments to the Constitution. It seeks representation for candidates from SC/ST and OBCs in proportion to their population.Wilson proposed measures to bring greater transparency to appointments in the higher judiciary. The Bill called for the establishment of permanent regional benches of the Supreme Court in Chennai, New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.Other primary changes sought by the member included an amendment to Article 15 (prohibits discrimination) of the Constitution to allow state govts to make special provisions for socially and educationally backward classes, SCs, and STs, in proportion to their population as determined by a caste census.In matters of judicial appointments, the member proposed amendments to Articles 124, 217, and 224 to include new clauses to ensure representation of SCs, STs, OBCs, religious minorities and women proportional to their population in judicial appointments, mandating the Union govt to frame a Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) in consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) outlining appointment procedures.“State govts must be consulted when appointing judges to the HCs and the apex court.The Centre must act on collegium recommendations within 60 days, and within 30 days if reiterated,” Wilson said.This apart, the Bill proposed increasing the retirement age of HC judges from 62 to 65 years. Another main ingredient of the Bill was the proposal for changes to census powers under the seventh schedule of the Constitution.The Bill sought to modify the legislative powers relating to the census by removing the census from the Union list and adding it to the concurrent list of the Constitution, allowing both the Union and state govts to conduct census exercises.","DMK’s Rajya Sabha member P Wilson seeks necessary amendments to the Constitution.

Oil-smuggling syndicate exposed at sea: Coast Guard intercepts 3 vessels near Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oil-smuggling-syndicate-exposed-at-sea-coast-guard-intercepts-3-vessels-near-mumbai/articleshow/128037175.cms,"Image/X

NEW DELHI: The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on Friday intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai, busting an international oil-smuggling racket during a coordinated mid-sea operation carried out on February 5–6.The operation followed intelligence gathered through technology-enabled maritime surveillance. According to the Coast Guard, the vessels were involved in the illegal transfer of oil and oil-based cargo sourced from conflict-ridden regions, using mid-sea ship-to-ship transfers in international waters to evade customs duties owed to coastal states, including India.Sharing details in a post on X, the Indian Coast Guard said that the action was the result of a “meticulously coordinated sea–air operation.” It said the syndicate “exploited mid-sea transfers in international waters to move cheap oil from conflict-ridden regions to motor tankers, evading duties owed to coastal states.”Explaining how the operation unfolded, the ICG said that its technology-driven systems first detected a motor tanker showing suspicious behaviour within the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).This led to a digital investigation and data-pattern analysis, which identified two more vessels converging on the tanker, raising suspicion of an illicit oil transfer at sea.According to the Coast Guard, specialist boarding teams intercepted the three vessels and carried out sustained rummaging operations.“Electronic data corroboration, verification of documents and interrogation of crew exposed the modus operandi and a global handler network,” the ICG said in its post.Initial investigations revealed that the vessels frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states. The Coast Guard said that the racket was run by a network of handlers operating from multiple countries, coordinating the sale and transfer of oil cargo between seagoing vessels.The intercepted vessels are being escorted to Mumbai for further investigation and will be handed over to Indian Customs and other law enforcement agencies for legal action.Describing the broader significance of the operation, the Coast Guard said the crackdown reinforced India’s role as a “net provider of maritime security and guardian of the rules-based international order” in the region.",The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai.

'Sangh does not seek popularity or power': RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sangh-does-not-seek-popularity-or-power-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat/articleshow/128036223.cms,"Viewing ‘Sangh’ Through the Lens of the BJP Is a Huge Mistake, Says RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said that Sangh is was not founded as reaction or in opposition to any organisation and it does not seek power or popularity.While speaking at a program held as a part of the RSS centenary celebrations in Mumbai, Bhagwat said that those who want to know about RSS, must come should come within the organisation and observe it from close quarters.""The Sangh has not emerged in competition with any other institution or organization, nor as a reaction or in opposition to anyone. The Sangh does not seek popularity. The Sangh does not seek power.

In the history of our country, no Sangh like work occurred after Tathagat Buddha,"" He said.""The work of the Sangh is meant for the entire nation — Bharatvarsh,"" he added.Talking about the situation in the country that preceded the RSS's birth in 1925, Bhagwat the British founded the Indian National Congress as a “safety valve”, but the Indians transformed it into a powerful instrument in the struggle for independence.Referring to RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Bhagwat described the difficult circumstances of his childhood including the death of both his parents due to the plague at age 13 and the financial hardship he suffered subsequently.Hedgewar actively participated in various movements during the freedom struggle, including the Vande Mataram agitation in his school days, Bhagwat said.When he cleared the matriculation examination with a first class, some people in Nagpur raised funds to send him to Calcutta (Kolkata) for medical education, where he came in contact with revolutionary groups, Bhagwat said.Recalling an anecdote from that period, Bhagwat said Hedgewar operated under the code name ""Koken"", inspired by the name of a person called Kokenchandra. Once a police team which had arrived to arrest Kokenchandra instead detained Hedgewar, an incident documented in a book by Rash Behari Bose, he said.During the ceremony, noted guests such as film actor Salman Khan , Subhash Ghai and Prasoon Joshi were also present.The two-day lecture series titled '100 Years of Sangh Journey: New Horizons' seeks to reflect on the journey of RSS, its role in society, and the ideas and perspectives shaping its future.","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said that Sangh is was not founded as reaction or in opposition to any organisation. He said that those who want to know about RSS, must come should come within the organisation and observe it from close quarters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128036244,imgsize-777968,width-400,resizemode-4/rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat.jpg"

'Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar': Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 metro station gets new name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shree-ram-mandir-mayur-vihar-metro-station-mayur-vihar-pocket-1-gets-new-name/articleshow/128035820.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 Metro station in East Delhi has been renamed to Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar. The station is located on the Pink Line of the Delhi Metro The renamed station connects several key parts of the capital, including Anand Vihar Railway Station, Rajouri Garden, Lajpat Nagar and Delhi Cantonment, making it an important transit point for daily commuters.Explaining the reason behind the name change, Sanatan Dharm Sabha Mayur Vihar President RP Agarwal said that the demand had been pending for years.“Our committee has been working on this for the past three years. We had sent a letter to Virendra Sachdeva, who forwarded it to the Chief Minister. This is an important achievement for us. When the metro train moves forward from Mayur Vihar Phase 1, the announcement will be made that the next station is ‘Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar’. This will increase the popularity of our Ram temple,” Agarwal said.Highlighting commuter convenience, Sanatan Dharm Sabha patron and Delhi Senior Citizen Welfare Association Vice President Govind Singh Pawar said that the earlier name often caused confusion.“People used to get confused between Mayur Vihar Phase 1 and Mayur Vihar Pocket 1. The BJP government, which promotes Sanatan Dharma, has corrected this.The people are very happy with this decision,” he said.The renaming fits into a broader policy of revising metro station names to better reflect local identity and reduce confusion for passengers.Last year, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta announced the renaming of three metro stations to enhance passenger convenience. Pitampura Metro Station on the Red Line was renamed to Madhuban Chowk Metro Station, while two stations on the under-construction RK Puram–Janakpuri corridor will be called North Pitampura–Prashant Vihar Metro Station and Haiderpur Village Metro Station.Addressing the public at the time, Gupta said the changes were linked to local history and identity. She later wrote on X that the renaming was being done “for the convenience of passengers” and to clearly define neighbourhoods.","The station is located on the Pink Line of the Delhi Metro.

When music turns into prayer: Inside the world of 'bhajan concerts',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-music-turns-into-prayer-inside-the-world-of-bhajan-concerts/articleshow/128033433.cms,"AI-generated image (Picture credit: OpenAI via ChatGPT)



Imagine a musical gathering where there is no chaotic crowd pushing past you, no frenzy to get closer to the stage and no noise competing with the music.Instead, people sit in quiet anticipation, moving in rhythm, listening as much as they sing.Imagine a musical evening where the audience is not driven by spectacle, but by the steady beats of a harmonium, tabla and manjira.The sound from the speakers does not overwhelm. It settles gently, carrying chants and sacred names that seem to resonate somewhere deeper than sound itself.Here, the audience is not screaming. Some sit with their eyes closed, absorbing the melody. Others clap softly before slowly rising to their feet, singing and swaying together in an unspoken rhythm.The artist, too, remains seated. Calm, composed, guiding the music rather than performing for applause.There is an atmosphere that feels simple and sacred. Children sit beside grandparents, both equally immersed in the experience.And when the evening ends, the venue remains orderly but something within you feels quieter, as if an inner clutter has briefly come to rest.If this sounds unlike a concert, that is because it is. And yet, it is exactly what a bhajan or a kirtan concert feels like.Over the past few years, devotional and spiritual music gatherings have begun drawing noticeably larger and younger audiences across India and among the global diaspora.Large-scale kirtan and bhajan events are increasingly being hosted in auditoriums and convention centres rather than only temples or community spaces. This shift can likely be attributed to a growing search for experiences that combine music, community and emotional grounding in an otherwise fast-paced urban life.The growing visibility of such gatherings has also entered public discourse. In one of his recent Mann Ki Baat addresses, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the cultural significance of bhajans and collective devotional practices.“Large numbers of the youth are gathering in different cities across the country. The stage is decorated... there is lighting, music... there is all the pomp and show, and the atmosphere is no less than a concert. It feels like a huge concert, but what is being sung there is the resonance of bhajans sung with complete concentration, dedication, and rhythm. This trend is being called ‘bhajan-clubbing’ today, and it’s becoming increasingly popular, especially among Gen Z,” PM said.The reference indicated how devotional music, once confined largely to religious or local settings, is now being discussed in the context of social and cultural engagement at a national level.My introduction to this world came through the music of international spiritual artist Radhika Das.I had first encountered his work online a few years ago. His videos, blending traditional Indian kirtan with contemporary musical arrangements, stood out immediately.Watching chants of Radhe Radhe Govinda echo through spaces like London’s Union Chapel felt both familiar and unexpectedly global.The energy in those videos, where people sang and danced together in devotion, sparked a curiosity in me. I wanted to experience that atmosphere firsthand.At the time, it seemed unlikely. Das appeared to be largely based in the UK and I assumed attending one of his concerts would remain a distant possibility. When I later discovered he had toured India, I realised I had missed the opportunity. Disappointed but hopeful, I made a quiet promise to myself, the next time he returned, I would attend.A year later, life had moved on. College had given way to my first newsroom job. My usual days were spent scanning agency wires and chasing stories.One such routine afternoon, an entertainment wire, the kind that often resembles promotional material, caught my eye. I almost scrolled past it before a familiar name made me pause. Radhika Das. It was an announcement of his upcoming India tour.Within minutes, I was searching for tickets. The early bird window was open and without much hesitation, I booked one.Only later did I wonder whether any of my friends would be interested in attending a bhajan concert. After some persuasion and a few shared YouTube clips one friend agreed, more out of curiosity than conviction. The plan was set.Months later, the evening finally arrived.Like most evenings in Delhi, the plan to reach early remained only a plan. After navigating traffic and a hurried entry into the YashoBhoomi Convention Centre, the atmosphere began to shift even before the music started.Volunteers greeted attendees warmly, applying tilaks as people entered the hall. The auditorium slowly filled, carrying an air of anticipation rather than impatience.When Das and his team took the stage, the applause felt welcoming rather than frenzied. He began not with high energy, but with stillness, asking the audience to close their eyes and take a few deep breaths, as if preparing everyone to arrive fully in the moment.What followed was a gradual transformation. The chants of ""Namah Shivaya"" and later ""Sita-Ram"" spread across the hall, moving the audience from silence to participation.Without realising it, people who had begun the evening seated found themselves clapping, swaying and eventually dancing.Strangers smiled at one another, united by rhythm rather than familiarity. My friend, initially unsure of what to expect, was soon completely absorbed in the atmosphere.Between performances, Das spoke about the significance of chanting and the role devotion had played in shaping his own journey.His reflections were simple, often humorous, but resonated with the audience.At one point, he narrated a story about a devotee, playfully referred to as ‘Patel’, that drew laughter across the hall but also carried an unmistakable sense of recognition.In the story, the devotee is repeatedly invited by Krishna (the divine) to leave worldly life and return to the spiritual realm.Each time, however, he requests more time: first to complete his education, then to build a career, later to marry, raise children, and fulfil responsibilities. Years pass and the invitation keeps getting postponed.When the divine messenger finally returns, he learns that Patel has passed away — only to discover that he has been reborn as a household dog, still attached to worldly duties, still asking for more time.The audience laughed, but the humour carried an underlying message that many seemed to relate to.The story mirrored a familiar human tendency, the constant belief that spiritual reflection can wait until everything else is settled. In that shared laughter, there was also a moment of quiet self-awareness visible across the hall.As the evening progressed, the music intensified. The final performance, ""Bhajman Radhe Radhe Govinda"", became the emotional peak of the concert.Speaking about his recent visit to Vrindavan and his connection with India as his spiritual home, Das’s voice carried visible emotion. The audience responded in kind. Hands raised, eyes closed, voices merging into a collective chant. For a brief moment, the boundaries between performer and audience seemed to dissolve.Nearly two hours passed unnoticed. Concerns about late-night travel or early workdays faded into the background.When the music finally stopped, there was a lingering reluctance to leave, the familiar feeling of returning to ordinary life after an experience that felt unusually immersive.As we walked out, I asked my friend if it had been worth coming. He smiled and simply said, “I still have goosebumps.” It was perhaps the simplest summary of the evening.For me, the experience also reshaped what a concert could mean. Previous concerts I had attended were defined by crowd anxiety or performative spectacle. This felt different, less like entertainment and more like participation.Bhajan concerts may appear to be a modern phenomenon, but their roots run deep within India’s cultural traditions.The practice of naam sankirtan, popularised by saints such as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, has long brought communities together through collective singing and devotion.Whether in Maharashtra’s Warkari tradition, local jagrans or household kirtans, the essence has remained the same, music as a shared spiritual expression.This idea finds resonance in classical devotional literature as well. In the Ramcharitmanas, Goswami Tulsidas writes, “Kaliyug keval naam adhaara, sumir sumir nar utarahin paara,” suggesting that in an age marked by distraction and restlessness, remembrance through the divine name becomes a path to inner steadiness.Seen in that context, the contemporary bhajan concert appears less like an innovation and more like a continuation, a familiar tradition finding new form for a new generation.What seems to be changing today is the format. A younger audience is rediscovering these traditions through contemporary presentation, larger venues, and global artists who bridge devotional music with modern sensibilities.As I hurried towards the metro later that night, the chants of ""Radhe Radhe Govinda"" still playing in my head, it felt as though the concert had ended but something quieter had begun.The bridge to that experience may have closed with the final note but it had also revealed a path, one that each listener perhaps continues to walk on their own.","Over the past few years, devotional and spiritual music gatherings have begun drawing noticeably larger and younger audiences across India and among the global diaspora.

How Shashi Tharoor-Congress 'Hum Saath Saath Hai' moment gives UDF a timely lift before Kerala polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-shashi-tharoor-congress-hum-saath-saath-hai-moment-gives-udf-a-timely-lift-before-kerala-polls/articleshow/128032640.cms,"'No Rebellion, No Ambition': Shashi Tharoor Sends Unity Signal After Meeting Rahul Gandhi, Kharge

'All is good' at a critical moment

Tharoor’s voter magnetism

Countering LDF and BJP narratives

Risks contained, momentum regained

NEW DELHI: The recent patch-up and the 'all is good' moment between Shashi Tharoor and the Congress high command have given the Congress in Kerala much-needed momentum ahead of the April–May assembly elections. Tharoor's meeting with Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi, after weeks of speculations about his strained ties with the party, has ended what many within the Congress described as an ""awkward episode"" and positioned him as a central campaign face for the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF).At a time when the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) is battling incumbency fatigue and the BJP is testing the limits of its expansion in the state, the reconciliation gives the UDF a renewed sense of coherence and momentum.Also read | Congress vs Tharoor: A new beginning or temporary truce? The recent Tharoor–Congress thaw sends a strong signal of unity to cadres and allies alike at a crucial time. Tharoor reportedly had been upset over the treatment meted out to him by Rahul Gandhi at a Kochi event recently and attempts by some leaders to sideline him in Kerala.For a party often in crisis over factionalism in its state units, the optics in Kerala were damaging.The reconciliation addressed that head-on. The leader of the opposition in the assembly, VD Satheesan's faction, and leaders seen as sympathetic to Tharoor now have little room for parallel power centres.The warmth also saves Congress from embarrassment in front of its own LDF allies.Last year, as Tharoor had pointed out, ""absence of a leader"" in the Kerala party unit, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) chief Sadiq Ali Thangal had publicly asked the Congress to resolve internal differences, warning that visible discord would only benefit rivals.By bringing Tharoor back in confidence, that concern has now been allayed.This unity boost matters electorally.Since the late 1980s, Kerala voters have flipped governments every five years between the UDF and the LDF. However, this changed in the 2021 assembly polls, when the LDF failed to make gains and the LDF under Pinarayi Vijayan won a second consecutive term.The LDF improved its tally from 91 seats in 2016 to 99 in 2021, while the UDF dropped from 47 to 41 seats.In the 2021 assembly polls, the biggest drive for the LDF sweep came from the Travancore belt, which includes Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta and Kottayam. The LDF won a majority of seats in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, traditionally swing-heavy areas.Tharoor's Lok Sabha seat, Thiruvananthapuram, had also historically been a swing constituency, alternating between the Congress and the Left, and more recently becoming a BJP target seat. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fielded Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar against Tharoor, but the Congress leader retained the seat for the fourth time by over 16,000 votes. The UDF swept 18 of 20 Lok Sabha seats.Tharoor’s appeal has been particularly visible among educated, salaried and first-time voters, segments that have shown increasing volatility in recent state and local elections. This cohort has not consistently aligned with the Congress organisation and has, at times, been receptive to the BJP’s urban outreach or the LDF’s governance pitch. Tharoor’s sustained wins in Thiruvananthapuram suggest an ability to arrest that drift, even when broader party trends are mixed.At a strategic level, this gives the UDF a pathway to expand beyond its traditional social bases without alienating them. Urban centres such as Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode, where turnout fluctuates and margins are often narrow, are likely to play an outsized role in 2026. Tharoor’s presence allows the Congress to contest these spaces more credibly, particularly at a time when the BJP has signalled intent through incremental municipal gains and a recent mayoral victory.The Congress leadership’s decision to deploy Tharoor as a campaign spearhead, tasked with touring all 140 constituencies, adds star power to a contest that often hinges on narrative dominance. Tharoor’s oratory, media presence and ability to frame local issues within a national and global context give the UDF an edge in reaching undecided voters.The patch-up blunts rival narratives at once. For the BJP, which has repeatedly highlighted Congress infighting to project itself as a disciplined alternative (recently by also using Tharoor's name frequently), the reconciliation weakens the ""internal chaos"" line of attack.This comes at a moment when the BJP is seeking to capitalise on its recent mayoral win in Thiruvananthapuram municipal corporation, a symbolic breakthrough that signalled growing urban traction, even if assembly-level success remains elusive.Moreover, Tharoor's active presence on the campaign trail is likely to help the UDF attract the younger demographic, especially aspirants and educated youth. The Congress leader's credibility as an author, diplomat and global speaker also gives him unique traction among voters in Kerala, given the state's high literacy rate.Both the LDF and the BJP-led NDA have also often portrayed the Congress as dynastic and directionless. The image of Tharoor standing alongside Rahul Gandhi will undercut those claims, at least for now.Perhaps the most immediate benefit of the reconciliation is risk mitigation. Speculation that Tharoor might drift towards the LDF or even explore non-Congress platforms has been firmly quashed. His integration into the Congress election campaign gives a message of consistency.The memory of 2021 still looms large for Congress strategists. Despite favourable anti-incumbency indicators then, the UDF failed to convert opportunity into victory. The Tharoor patch-up is being seen as a corrective step, aimed at ensuring that organisational weaknesses do not once again squander political openings.By restoring unity, the Congress-Tharoor patch-up gives the opposition UDF a credible shot at turning the page after years of Left rule. Whether it translates into seats in elections will depend on execution, alliances and local dynamics, but for now with this 'Hum Saath Saath Hai' image, the UDF has scored an early and much-needed win before heading into the elections.","Shashi Tharoor's meeting with Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi has ended what many within the Congress described as an ""awkward episode"" The reconciliation gives the UDF a renewed sense of coherence and momentum.

'Frivolous and politically motivated': Sonia Gandhi opposes plea over 1980 voter list entry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/frivolous-and-politically-motivated-sonia-gandhi-opposes-plea-over-1980-voter-list-entry/articleshow/128027827.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Sonia Gandhi has opposed a criminal revision petition filed against her in the Rouse Avenue Court, calling it ""wholly misconceived, frivolous, politically motivated and an abuse of the process of law. "" She argued that matters of citizenship and electoral rolls cannot be turned into criminal proceedings four decades later.The reply, filed through her counsel before the court of special judge (CBI) Vishal Gogne, contests allegations that she was included in the electoral rolls before acquiring Indian citizenship.She urged that the plea be dismissed as baseless and speculative.According to her response, the complainant’s accusations rest on assumptions, media reports and personal presumptions and not on authentic government records.The reply further emphasises that no specific document has been identified as forged or fabricated, rendering the charges void of material substance. Matters of citizenship, it maintains, fall solely under the jurisdiction of the Central Government, while the Election Commission of India is responsible for maintaining electoral rolls.Arguing that criminal courts cannot assume jurisdiction in such matters, the reply states that entertaining the petition would amount to interference in the electoral process.It further denies that Gandhi’s name was ever re‑entered in the voter list based on any forged or improper application, saying the complainant has failed to produce any authentic document or effort to lawfully obtain one.Sonia Gandhi's reply also dismisses as “baseless” the assertions that fabricated identity documents were used or that Gandhi had voted in the 1980 general election. It also objects to the complainant’s reliance on decades‑old media reports, noting such sources carry no legal weight and cannot serve as a foundation for criminal proceedings.The response underscores that the complaint seeks to revive a matter from 1980–83—over four decades later—without foundational proof, making it both stale and legally untenable.Procedural objections have also been raised, alleging non‑compliance with mandatory requirements under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNSS), including the absence of a valid affidavit, which, Gandhi’s counsel argues, deprives the court of jurisdiction.The revision petition, filed by advocate Vikas Tripathi, challenges a September 2025 order of the Magistrate Court that had dismissed his earlier complaint at the threshold. The Magistrate had held that questions of citizenship and electoral registration fall within the purview of the Central Government and Election Commission, and cannot be adjudicated through a criminal complaint.","Congress leader Sonia Gandhi has opposed a criminal revision petition filed against her in the Rouse Avenue Court.

"Ola, Uber and other app-based taxi drivers to hold day-long strike – all you need to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ola-uber-and-other-app-based-taxi-drivers-to-hold-day-long-strike-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/128021472.cms,"NEW DELHI: App-based transport workers across India observed an All-India Breakdown on February 7 after unions representing gig drivers and delivery workers called for a nationwide shutdown to protest falling incomes, rising costs and what they described as increasing exploitation by platform companies.The protest was called by the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union and the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers, and involved drivers and delivery workers associated with major platforms such as Ola, Uber, Rapido, Porter and other app-based transport services. Unions said the agitation was aimed at pressing the Centre and state governments to implement minimum base fares under the Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines, 2025.According to the unions, the failure to notify base fares has allowed aggregator companies to continue fixing prices unilaterally, forcing workers to put in longer hours for declining earnings and bear operational risks without protection.Shaik Salauddin, founder president of TGPWU and co-founder and national general secretary of IFAT, said the lack of government action had worsened working conditions for gig workers.“The Aggregator Guidelines, 2025, clearly mandate consultation with recognised worker unions before fare fixation. However, governments have failed to act, enabling platforms to deepen exploitation,” Salauddin said.The shutdown coincided with a day-long nationwide strike by app-based taxi and autorickshaw drivers called by the Maharashtra Kamgar Sabha to press demands including action against what they termed illegal bike taxi services and grievances related to mandatory panic button installations.In a statement, the union said drivers were facing a financial burden due to repeated changes in panic button approvals.“While there are 140 panic button device providers approved by the Central government, the state government has declared nearly 70 per cent of these companies unauthorised. As a result, cab drivers are being forced to remove previously installed devices and spend approximately Rs 12,000 unnecessarily to install new devices, causing severe financial hardship,” the statement said.Speaking to PTI, Maharashtra Kamgar Sabha head Dr Keshav Kshirsagar said the strike began across Maharashtra and other parts of the country in the morning and received support from most autorickshaw and taxi drivers. However, taxis and autorickshaws remained available on app-based platforms such as Uber, Ola and Rapido in several areas despite the call to keep vehicles off the roads.The unions have also flagged concerns over loss of income due to an increase in autorickshaws under the open permit policy and alleged that victims of accidents involving illegal bike taxis are denied insurance benefits.The February 7 protest follows earlier nationwide strikes by gig workers, including a shutdown by platform-based delivery workers on December 31, when unions warned of service disruptions during peak hours over low wages, long working hours and lack of social security.“In today's time, Swiggy Zomato delivery boys, Blinkit Zepto riders, Ola Uber drivers, are a workforce on the back of which these big companies have become unicorns; they have got billion-dollar valuations. In this entire ecosystem that has been created, if there's one group of people who are oppressed and under immense pressure, it's the gig workers,” an AAP MP said in an interview with ANI.Amid the nationwide agitation, a delegation of transport and delivery gig workers met Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on Friday to press for central legislation and better implementation of regulations at the state level.Shaik Salauddin said the delegation raised long-standing concerns during the meeting. “This delegation included drivers and delivery workers from the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers. In Congress-ruled states, and even where we serve as the opposition, the election promises made to these workers have been acted upon. At the central level, the government is providing social-security schemes, but that is not a substitute for statutory law,” he said.Salauddin also praised the Karnataka government for enacting legislation for gig workers. “There was a detailed discussion. For about half an hour, the delegation described their problems one by one. We called on Congress governments in states where implementation has stalled to act promptly. We again congratulated Karnataka for being the first state to introduce a comprehensive law,” he added.Union leaders said protests would continue unless governments move to enforce fare regulations and provide statutory protections for gig workers in the app-based transport and delivery sector.",The protest was called by the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union and the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers. The shutdown coincided with a day-long nationwide strike by app-based taxi and autorickshaw drivers. Unions said the agitation was aimed at pressing the Centre and state governments to implement minimum base fares.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128022205,imgsize-48224,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

India-US Trade Deal Explained: What The White House Says On Tariffs, Markets And Tech Shifts

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Saturday took a “Dost dost na raha” jibe at PM Modi , referring to his and US President Donald Trump’s friendship, after the recently announced India-US trade framework.Ramesh criticised the deal, saying it benefits American farmers at the expense of Indian ones and raised concerns over India’s agreement to stop importing oil from Russia, confirmed by the White House.In an X post, Ramesh said, ""Nothing in the recently released US-India joint statement has been made clear regarding the details. But from what has come to light so far, it’s evident that: India will no longer import oil from Russia. Separately, the US has also announced that if India buys oil from Russia, directly or indirectly, a 25 per cent penalty could be reimposed.""""To help American farmers at the expense of Indian farmers, India will slash import duties by a huge margin. India’s annual imports from the US will triple, wiping out our long-standing surplus in goods trade. Uncertainty will persist over India’s exports of IT and other services to the US.India’s goods exports will face higher duties in the US than before.”Ramesh added that the ""photo-ops"" did not amount to much benefits for India.“All those hugs and photo-ops have yielded no special results. Namaste Trump has come down heavily on Howdy Modi. Dost dost na raha,"" he added.The Congress leader’s criticism comes in response to the framework announced by India and the US for an Interim Agreement on trade. The framework reaffirms the countries’ commitment to broader Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) negotiations, launched by Donald Trump and PM Modi on February 13.These negotiations are expected to include additional market access commitments and support more resilient supply chains.As per the joint statement, the US will apply a reciprocal tariff rate of 18 per cent on Indian-originating goods, including textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber, organic chemicals, home decor, artisanal products, and certain machinery.The US will also remove tariffs on certain aircraft and aircraft parts from India, previously imposed to address national security concerns.India, in turn, will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a wide range of food and agricultural products, including dried distillers’ grains (DDGs), red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits.India also intends to purchase $500 billion of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products, and coking coal over the next five years.","Congress MP Jairam Ramesh took a “Dost dost na raha” jibe at PM Modi after the recently announced India-US trade framework.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka Congress MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah signaled stable leadership ahead of upcoming civic polls, firmly dismissing speculation of a chief minister change and affirming that the party high command has ruled out any shift.Speaking amid preparations for local body elections in Bidar, he emphasised unity by noting multiple capable leaders within Congress while deferring final authority to Delhi.Responding to post-budget rumours of replacing CM Siddaramaiah, Yathindra said, ""They have been saying this, but the high command has clearly sent a message that there won't be any change in the leadership.""He further dismissed such claims, stating, ""I don't think there will be reason to speculate that there will be a change in the leadership.""Elaborating on his stance, he noted that while there are many capable leaders within the party, it does not automatically imply an impending change in leadership.He said, ""There are many leaders in Congress who deserve to, who can become chief minister. But the high command has to decide now. They have not told anything that there will be change in the leadership.

'Arrogant, Liar': Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Attacks CEC Gyanesh After SIR Meet In Delhi

NEW DELHI: All 14 IAS officers from West Bengal appointed by the Election Commission as central observers for the upcoming assembly polls in four states and a Union territory, including state home secretary Jagdish Prasad Meena, attended the observers' briefing organised by Election Commission here on Friday.One lady IAS officer from West Bengal was earlier granted exemption by EC on account of ""some unavoidable family circumstances"", sources in EC told TOI.As many as 1,444 central observers -- including 714 general observers, 233 police observers and 497 expenditure observers -- were briefed in three separate batches, including two on Thursday and one on Friday, regarding various aspects of upcoming polls in Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The third batch, which included IAS officers from West Bengal, was apprised on Friday on the preparation of electoral rolls, conduct of elections, poll expenditure, information technology and media-related matters. They were also given a demonstration of EVMs.Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, in his address to the observers, cautioned them that there is no scope of deviation fromthe electoral laws and ECI instructions. He also spoke about new initiatives being taken in the forthcoming assembly elections, while directing them to ensure free, fair and transparent conduct of polls.Election commissioner S S Sandhu told the central observers that they carry a big responsibility as representatives of EC in the field. He called upon the officers to observe the highest level of conduct and ensure a level playing field for all candidates and political parties.Addressing the observers, election commissioner Vivek Joshi asked them to promptly address the grievances and complaints received by them.

IFS/IAS appointees can’t reappear for 2026 Civil Services exam; IPS can’t choose IPS again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ifs/ias-appointees-cant-reappear-for-2026-civil-services-exam-ips-cant-choose-ips-again/articleshow/128019955.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at regulating repeated attempts at Civil Services Examination (CSE) by candidates selected for IAS , Indian Foreign Service (IFS) or IPS, the updated rules for the elite recruitment exam bar candidates already appointed to IAS or IFS, from appearing in CSE 2026.Even if such an appointment happens after 'prelims' 2026, the candidate will not be allowed to write the 'mains' exam or be considered for service from CSE-2026, as per the CSE 2026 rules notified on Wednesday.A candidate already appointed to IPS from an earlier CSE can apply for and appear in CSE-2026, but cannot relist IPS as his service preference. If a candidate is allocated IPS or any Group ‘A’ central service through CSE-2026, they will be allowed one improvement attempt in CSE-2027 by using a one-time training exemption. If a candidate selected through CSE-2026 neither joins training nor avails of exemption, his 2026 service allocation shall stand cancelled.Where a candidate selected through CSE-2026 reappears in CSE 2027 and obtains a better service, he must choose between 2026 and 2027 batch. If the candidate does not get any service in 2027 exam, he will be allowed to go back and join the service allocated based on CSE 2026. If the candidate does not join training of the finally chosen service (2026 or 2027), both the allocations shall get cancelled.After availing one improvement attempt (CSE-2027), the candidate cannot appear in CSE-2028 onwards unless he/she resigns from service. Candidates already in service from CSE-2025 or earlier, will have one chance to reappear in CSE 2026 or CSE 2027 without resigning. If they wish to appear for CSE 2028 and beyond, they must first resign from the allocated service. UPSC in its CSE 2026 notification has also done away with the cap on examination centre capacity for 'persons with benchmark disabilities' (PwBD) candidates , allowing them to be accommodated on priority. Initially, the existing capacity of each centre will be utilised by both PwBD and non-PwBD candidates. However, once a centre reaches full capacity, it will no longer be available for selection by non-PwBD candidates, while PwBD candidates will continue to have the option to select the same centre.CSE 2026 will also have more examination centres -- Meerut to decongest Delhi-NCR, Kanpur to ease pressure around Lucknow, and Bhubaneswar to supplement centres near Cuttack. It further allows candidates to indicate their preferred nearby cities from a dropdown menu, in addition to the notified examination centres. This data will serve as a survey of candidate preferences and may be used to identify locations for the creation of new examination centres, where feasible.","The updated rules for the elite recruitment exam bar candidates already appointed to IAS or IFS, from appearing in CSE 2026.

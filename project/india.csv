NEW DELHI: Indian delegation has ramped up efforts for United Nations listing of Lashkar-e-Taiba front The Resistance Front (TRF), according to news agency PTI, which cited sources.A team from India met United Nations under-secretary-general Vladimir Voronkov of the office of counter-terrorism (UNOCT) and assistant secretary-general Natalia Gherman of the counter-terrorism committee executive directorate (CTED) to discuss strengthening counter-terrorism cooperation.The meeting comes amid deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack , for which 'The Resistance Front' (TRF) had claimed responsibility. TRF is a front for the UN-proscribed Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba.On the visit of the Indian Technical Team at UN in New York, a spokesperson told ANI, the meeting revisited commitments made under the 2022 Delhi Declaration, which was adopted by the counter-terrorism committee under India's chairmanship.They also discussed the development of non-binding guiding principles, crafted with CTED's support, to address threats from unmanned aerial systems and the exploitation of new financial technologies by terrorist networks.Voronkov and Gherman extended their condolences to the delegation over the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. The terrorist attack prompted a sharp military escalation in the region.In response to the Pahalgam incident, the Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The operation led to the deaths of over 100 terrorists affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone strikes along the Line of Control. In a countermeasure, India launched coordinated attacks damaging radar systems, communication hubs, and airbases within Pakistani territory.The meeting in New York highlighted ongoing multilateral efforts to implement UN security council counter-terrorism resolutions and the UN global counter-terrorism strategy. Key areas of collaboration between India and the UN bodies include cybersecurity, countering terrorist travel , aiding victims of terrorism, and disrupting terror financing mechanisms.",Indian delegation has ramped up efforts for United Nations listing of Lashkar-e- Taiba front The Resistance Front (TRF) The meeting comes amid deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack.

SC reinstates elected man convicted for gambling and fined Rs 200,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reinstates-elected-man-convicted-for-gambling-and-fined-rs-200/articleshow/121174654.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside a Karnataka HC’s decision to disqualify a man elected to the board of directors of a cooperative society by securing highest votes on the ground that his conviction under the state police Act for roadside gambling constituted a misconduct involving moral turpitude.One Hanumantharayappa YC along with some others were allegedly playing cards on the roadside when they were caught by police, which levied a fine of Rs 200 without any trial.

There are so many forms of playing cards. It is difficult to accept that every form of such playing would involve moral turpitude, especially when it is played as a mode of entertainment and recreation.”“In fact, in most parts of our country, playing cards without an element of gambling or betting is accepted as a Poorman’s source of entertainment.

BIJAPUR: CRPF DG G P Singh on Wednesday said Operation Blackforest — which demolished a Maoist ‘bastion’ in Karregutalu Hills (KGH) on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border — saw the force try out cave interventions for the first time, for the hills housed a network of 250 cave formations used by the Maoists as convenient hideouts, arms manufacturing units and to dump explosives and rations.“CRPF has generally been doing house or vehicle interventions. For the first time, we tried cave interventions. We had use a technique and make sure that we do not suffer casualties but neutralise the Maoists who may be there,” he told a press conference here.Singh said the forces also learnt that Naxals are now using beer bottles to make IEDs, which involve the minimum use of metal. “This now requires ingenuity in detecting IEDs and we will be revising our SOPs accordingly,” he said.Around 450 IEDs were detected and deactivated, though 15 IEDs that went off caused some injuries to force personnel. Singh said the force has been upgrading its IED detection equipment and technology to whatever is the latest available in the world.The CRPF chief said the recovery of a whopping 818 barrel grande launcher shells (BGLs) and 450 IEDs during the operation is significant as most of the Maoist attacks on security camps so far were done using BGLs. “Also, most of our personnel out on operations are killed or injured by IEDs,” said Singh.",Operation Blackforest demolished a Maoist ‘bastion’ in Karregutalu Hills (KGH) on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border.

The President's 14 questions

Prez:

Deemed assent concept

alien to constitutional scheme

NEW DELHI: In a sharp response to the April 8 verdict of Supreme Court, fixing deadlines for the governor and the President to decide on state Bills in the Tamil Nadu govt versus governor case, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the Constitution had no such stipulations.Aware that a petition seeking review of the 415-page judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan would not yield positive outcome as it is ought be considered by the same bench in chamber, the Union govt invoked the President’s rarely used powers under Article 143(1) of the Constitution to seek SC’s opinion on a myriad contentious issues thrown up by the judgment, which it considers to be a clear overreach. Specifically, the President sought SC’s view on 14 questions.The President said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and President respectively, “does not stipulate any time frame or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a bill passed by an assembly.“The exercise of constitutional discretion by governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, respectively, are essentially governed by polycentric considerations, including federalism, uniformity of laws, integrity and security of the nation, doctrine of separation of powers,” she said, adding that she resorted to Article 143(1) in seeking the SC’s opinion as the apex court has in the past delivered conflicting judgments on the justiciability of presidential assent to bills .Article 200 mandates the governor, on presentation of a bill passed by an assembly, to grant assent or “as soon as possible” return the bill, excluding Money bills, for reconsideration by the House. The provision also lays down that the governor “shall not withhold assent” when the bill, after having been reconsidered, is sent to him .However, when a governor reserves a bill for consideration of the President, she under Article 201 is mandated to declare whether she assents to the bill or withholds it. The Constitution, however, does not prescribe a timeframe for the President to take a particular action once the bill , after having been reconsidered by the assembly, is presented to her again for assent.Without any express provision in the Constitution, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had set a three-month deadline for the governor to either grant or return the bill to the House.If the bill is re-passed by the House and resent to him, then the governor must grant assent within a month, SC had ruled. It had also fixed a three-month deadline for the President to decide whether to grant or refuse assent to a bill.Critical of the SC using its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 bills pending with the Tamil Nadu governor would be deemed to have been assented to, the President said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the governor”.The President also questioned the logic behind SC ruling that suggested that it would be better if the President seeks the opinion of the apex court in advance on whether to give assent to bills reserved for her by the governors.She said SC needs to give its opinion also contours and scope of provisions contained in Article 142 (which gives omnibus power to SC to do complete justice) “in the context of issues (assent to bills) which are occupied by either constitutional provisions or statutory provisions.In addition, she questioned the states increasingly using writ jurisdiction of the SC under Article 32 (which is meant for remedying violations of fundamental rights of citizens) instead of Article 131 (Centre-state dispute to be adjudicated only by the SC) to adjudicate issues “which by their nature are federal issues involving interpretation of the Constitution.”","President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the Constitution had no such stipulations. The President said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and President respectively, “does not stipulate any time frame or procedure” to be followed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121172131,imgsize-672813,width-400,resizemode-4/murmu.jpg"

It’s time a performance audit of HC judges is done: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-time-a-performance-audit-of-hc-judges-is-done-supreme-court/articleshow/121171904.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: High court judges taking breaks “unnecessarily” and too often found a mention in Supreme Court bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh on Tuesday, which called for their performance audits.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the top court was receiving several complaints against HC high court judges and it was a high time to assess the expenditure on them vis-a-vis their output.“There are some judges who work very hard but at the same time there are judges who are unnecessarily taking coffee breaks; this break or that break. We are hearing a lot of complaints about HC judges. This is a larger issue which needs to be looked into. What is the performance of HC judges? How much we are spending and what is the output? It’s high time we do a performance audit,” Justice Kant said.The remark came on a plea of four persons who had moved SC claiming Jharkhand HC had reserved its order on a criminal appeal against conviction and life sentence in 2022 but the judgment was not pronounced. Their counsel Fauzia Shakil said after SC’s nudge, HC on May 5 and 6 pronounced the verdicts, acquitting three of the four. The last case resulted in a split verdict and was referred to HC chief justice and the petitioner was granted bail.Shakil said that despite the verdicts, the acquitted persons were not released from jail and in the judgments, HC did not mention the date of reserving the orders.Taking exception, SC asked Jharkhand govt counsel to immediately release them before lunch break & posted the matter post 2pm. The counsel informed SC that the convicts were released. and it was due to the non-availability of release orders from the trial courts that delayed the process.The timeline prescribed earlier by this court for pronouncement of judgments will have to be adhered to along with mechanism which this court will propose, the bench said and directed the registry to collate data from HCs and posted the matter in July.",Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the top court was receiving several complaints against HC high court judges.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs after his T20 retirement? No, it's time to retire. Yes, he should.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I’ve done it; I’ve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I’m not taking any of this for granted. Don’t assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I’ll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I’m not able to do what I want to do on the field, I’ll stop playing. That’s for sure. But right now, I know that what I’m doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he’s shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit’s message is clear: he’s still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he’ll do it on his own terms.","India's white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals.

'New normal' for Congress? Shashi Tharoor's praise for PM Modi's policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-normal-for-congress-shashi-tharoors-praise-for-pm-modis-policies/articleshow/121167193.cms,"Poll Do you believe that India's approach to conflict with Pakistan has changed under Modi's government? No, it's consistent with previous policies. Yes, it's more aggressive.

NEW DELHI: Has Shashi Tharoor set a ""new normal"" for the Congress post India's "" Operation Sindoor ""? Well, it seems so. The Thiruvananthapuram MP has been unequivocal and unwavering in his praise of the steps taken by the Narendra Modi government against Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack . So much so, the BJP leaders have cited Tharoor's strong defence of the government to school and shame the opposition, including the Congress.While the Congress has heaped praise on the armed forces over the success of ""Operation Sindoor"", it has questioned the Modi government's decision to announce sudden ceasefire, which, ironically, was first announced by US President Donald Trump . While making the ceasefire announcement, Trump also claimed that India and Pakistan had agreed to talks at a neutral venue. Later, Trump went on to claim, not once but twice, that he used trade deal as a leverage to force India and Pakistan to agree to the ceasefire. While India did not react to Trump's claim publically, the external affairs ministry made it clear that trade was never a part of any discussions with the US. India also categorically declared that it was Islamabad that had approached us for ceasefire after the May 10 strike by our armed forces which destroyed many air bases in Pakistan.The Congress raised tough questions for Prime Minister Modi in the light of these US claims. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said: ""The Prime Minister did not speak one word on the claims made by President Trump minutes before his address to the nation. Has India accepted America's mediation? Has India agreed to hold talks with Pakistan at a neutral venue? Will India now accept US demand for opening of markets in automobile, agriculture and other sectors?"" Other opposition leaders also targeted the government over US claims of playing the mediator.However, Shashi Tharoor strongly defended the Modi government and called the US President ""a politician wanting to take credit for something."" Tharoor also justified India's decision to agree to a ceasefire.""Peace is essential. I am very glad, India never wanted a long-term war. India wanted to teach terrorists a lesson, I believe that lesson has been taught. The other details are awaited,"" Tharoor said in his first recation on ceasefire.For US President Trump's claims, Tharoor had a sharp retort.""I see it as a particular politician wanting to take credit for something and I can see that the government of India probably said 'let them take the credit if they want to', but from our point of view we have made it clear that the peace followed a request from the DGMO of Pakistan who called his Indian counterpart at 3:35 pm (Saturday) and we did not take very long to say yes because we had never wanted a long war,"" Tharoor said.Clarifying that he was speaking as an individual MP, Tharoor said he did not like Trump's social media posts on the issue.""You are making equivalent the victim and the perpetrator, which is really shocking. It is completely wrong to imply that as a result of this India is going to give some sort of negotiation to Pakistan. We will never negotiate to the point of a gun, we are never going to give the satisfaction to Pakistan of feeling that by unleashing a terrorist attack in Pahalgam they have somehow earned the right to negotiate with India,"" he said.""I don't think that Mr Trump should have in any way, shape or form implied that the Kashmiri dispute has been internationalised by the American involvement. We don't even accept that there is a dispute of that nature, Kashmir is an integral part of India ... we are not interested at all in internationalising the dispute,"" he added.Earlier also Tharoor was effusive in his praise for ""Operation Sindoor"" and had said: ""The operation was well-calibrated, well-calculated, and effectively executed. I am very impressed, from the naming of the operation to how it was presented to the world. We had to respond. We could not allow Pakistani terrorists to believe that they can walk into our country, kill civilians, and get away with it. They had to be punished. At the same time, an indiscriminate action on our part could have needlessly provoked an escalation and cost us the sympathy of the world.""The Congress MP also praised the government's messaging on the issue: ""We are doing all the right things so far. The nature of Operation Sindoor was right. The messaging of the press conference in which the foreign secretary, a Kashmiri Pandit, was flanked on both sides by women officers, one of whom was a Muslim, demonstrates a narrative against the one of Hindu-Muslim hostility being spread by the Pakistanis like silly general Munir. It sends a very good message.""And when some Congress leaders spoke of 1971 war and the role of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Tharoor had this message for his party leaders.""Today's Pakistan is a different situation. Their military equipment and the damage they can do are different. Bangladesh was fighting a moral cause to actually bring people to freedom and liberation. That was a completely different story. This is a different story. We would have ended up with much longer, protracted conflicts with a lot of loss of lives on both sides. Is this the biggest priority for India today? No, it is not.""While Tharoor heaped praised on Modi government's actions against Pakistan, he did not hesitate to slam the BJP when the safrron party put out a social media post criticising the previous UPA government and said the ""petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable"".Tagging the BJP's post on X, Tharoor said, ""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India. Jai Hind.""Tharoor, a leading opposition leader, gave the BJP enough ammunition to target the critics of the government and accuse the Congress of playing politics.""I am really surprised that Congress is not listening to what Shashi Tharoor is saying. He is a senior Congress leader and is very clear that let anybody take the credit, but India decided to have this understanding with Pakistan. We didn't want a war. It was an understanding based on our terms and conditions. But you (Congress) want to politicise everything,"" Tamil Nadu BJP vice president Narayanan Thirupathy said slamming the grand-old-party.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the Congress over his repeated praise for PM Modi and his policies.When Tharoor had first praised Prime Minister Modi for his US visit and then lauded India's role under the PM in the Russia-Ukraine war, the Congress had reacted very sharply to his remarks.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had then laid stress on discipline and had given a stern warning to the state leaders that strong action will be taken against those making comments that go against the party's interests.The Congress has officially not reacted to Tharoor's statements but Jairam Ramesh has made it clear that ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it does not reflect the views of the party."" Party sources say that Tharoor has crossed the 'lakshman rekha' with his repeated comments on the India-Pakistan conflict.(With inputs from agencies)","The Congress has heaped praise on the armed forces over the success of ""Operation Sindoor"" It has questioned the Modi government's decision to announce sudden ceasefire, which, ironically, was first announced by US President Donald Trump.

IAEA says no report of radiation leak from any Pak facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaea-says-no-report-of-radiation-leak-from-any-pak-facility/articleshow/121171115.cms,"Representative photo

DEHRADUN: There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday (IST), rejecting widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Sargodha during Operation Sindoor , triggering a radioactive incident.The clarification followed social media speculation and foreign media theories suggesting a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been hit during the airstrikes. Fredrik Dahl from IAEA’s press department in an email response to TOI’s query stated, “We are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.”The development came two days after Indian Air Force’s director general air operations, Air Marshal A K Bharti, denied that India had targeted Kirana Hills or any nuclear installation in Pakistan. When asked by the media, Bharti said, “Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We didn’t know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills and whatever is there.”The ministry of external affairs also rejected reports of a radiation leak. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during a press briefing on Tuesday, said, “Our military action was entirely within the conventional domain. Some reports were suggesting that Pakistan’s National Command Authority would convene a meeting, but those were later denied. In fact, Pakistan’s govt representatives have officially denied this on record.”IAEA’s statement sought to dispel speculation that a radiation leak led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Some foreign experts on global media platforms had amplified the theories, claiming the reports were accurate. The rumours intensified after some flight tracking platforms allegedly spotted a US department of energy aircraft—used in nuclear emergencies like Fukushima—near Pakistan.Another claim that an Egyptian military aircraft landed in Pakistan carrying boron, a chemical used to contain radioactive emissions, also circulated. Both these claims were unverified and dismissed by former military officials as baseless.",IAEA rejects widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Sargodha during Operation Sindoor.

Pak inked deal with crypto company in which Trump kin has 60% stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pak-inked-deal-with-crypto-co-in-which-trump-kin-has-60-stake/articleshow/121171400.cms,"US President Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump’s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between India and Pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the president’s family has 60% stake.The deal was signed between WLF and the hastily-launched Pakistan Crypto Council , which early last month appointed as its adviser Changzpeng Zhao (CZ) — founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance — with the ambitious objective of making Islamabad South Asia’s crypto capital.Though the Crypto Council was barely a month old, WLF sent its heavy guns, including Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump’s golf buddy Steve, to Islamabad where they were feted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, and more crucially, army chief General Asim Munir, who just days later “cleared” the mass killing in Pahalgam of tourists who were segregated on the basis of their faith.WLF’s stakeholders include Trump’s two sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr, who, along with their brother-in law Jared Kushner, have been scouring different parts of the world for lucrative business deals and have attracted allegations of leveraging their links to the White House.Witkoff, who, like Trump, is a real estate billionaire focused on New York, is seen as the “man-to-go” in Washington DC.

NEW DELHI: On Wednesday, the railways successfully ran its first “trial special train”, carrying soldiers on the strategically vital Katra-Qazigund section, in a move that signals how govt’s plan to run trains between J&K remains on track, unaffected by the ongoing Indo-Pak conflict . The train made the round trip with full security arrangements, TOI has learnt.The section, which includes the Chenab Bridge , is the final leg that connects Kashmir with the rest of India by rail. The train left Katra around 10am and returned by 6pm, they added.The trial run gains importance considering the ongoing Indo-Pak conflict and Operation Sindoor. PM Narendra Modi was scheduled to inaugurate the section last month, but was postponed due to bad weather.Sources said the special train on trial carried soldiers who were on leave and stuck due to cancellations of flights to J&K. “The train operation was limited to only the Katra-Qazigund section. Normal train operation is on between Qazigund and Baramulla,” said an official.Earlier, the railways had carried out the trial run of special Vande Bharat trains between Katra and Srinagar, but never carried passengers in them.Wednesday’s successful trial run of the train with passengers also gains importance considering that it will be an additional connectivity to Kashmir and for faster movement of men and machineries. Till now, there was only highway connectivity between J&K, and sometimes bad weather, including landslides, impacted movement.","The train made the round trip with full security arrangements.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday detailed how the Indian Air Force (IAF) bypassed Pakistan's China-supplied defence systems to destroy military targets in the country during Operation Sindoor . In a detailed statement, the government also confirmed that Pakistan's foiled attacks on Indian cities and military sites involved Chinese and Turkish-origin weapon systems, including PL-15 missiles and Bayraktar-style drones, all of which were successfully neutralised by Made-in-India defence technologies.The government's detailed press release mentioned that Operation Sindoor underscored not just the precision of India's military action but also its technological self-reliance, marking a milestone in the country’s defence doctrine.“Operation SINDOOR emerged as a calibrated military response to an evolving pattern of asymmetric warfare… India’s response was deliberate, precise, and strategic,” the statement read.By bypassing China-supplied defence systems, Indian fighter jets and loitering munitions struck key Pakistani military sites, including Noor Khan and Rahimyar Khan airbases, using indigenous platforms. According to the government statement, these strikes were completed in just 23 minutes.“Indian Air Force bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems, completing the mission in just 23 minutes, demonstrating India’s technological edge,” the government said.All strikes were executed without crossing the Line of Control or the international boundary, and no Indian assets were lost.Meanwhile, India’s multi-layered air defence successfully intercepted Pakistani attacks using a mix of legacy and modern indigenous systems:“These systems, built over the last decade with continuous government investment, proved to be force multipliers during the operation,” the statement said.Chinese missiles, Turkish drones recoveredThe government confirmed that wreckage from various foreign-supplied weapon systems used by Pakistan was recovered, including:These were deployed by Pakistan in cross-border attacks that targeted Indian military installations between May 7 and May 10.“Despite Pakistan's attempts to exploit advanced foreign-supplied weaponry, India’s indigenous air defence and electronic warfare networks remained superior,” the statement said.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) bypassed Pakistan's China-supplied defence systems to destroy military targets in the country during Operation Sindoor.

HYDERABAD: It's not just the country's western border that took heavy enemy fire during Operation Sindoor . India was attacked in cyberspace, too, by state-backed hackers and hacktivists from Pakistan, Turkiye, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with backing from China, according to cybersecurity experts.Apart from defence PSUs and their MSME vendors, critical infrastructure like ports, airports, power grids, transportation services like Indian Railways and airlines, telecom players like BSNL, fintech platforms like UPI, digital wallets, stock exchanges, and major Indian conglomerates with investments in infrastructure too came under attack, sources said. The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets. These groups reportedly deployed malware, conducted phishing attacks, and launched denial-of-service operations targeting critical sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, and public services.Zone-H, a website that tracks defacements, reported incidents involving Indian govt domains.

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday asserted it circumvented Pakistan’s air defence (AD) systems of Chinese-origin to carry out the strikes against the nine terror hubs without crossing the border on May 7, and then thwarted multiple retaliatory missile and drone attacks using a robust indigenous AD network during intense hostilities last week.“The IAF bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems (like the HQ-9 missile batteries and radars), completing the mission in just 23 minutes on May 7, demonstrating India’s technological edge,” a new govt statement said.Despite Pakistan’s attempts to “exploit advanced foreign supplied weaponry”, ranging from Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones, India’s AD and electronic warfare networks “remained superior”, it added.With PM Narendra Modi having drawn new red lines against Pakistan-backed terrorism, the Indian armed forces are currently on a hot standby, maintaining full operational readiness to foil any misadventure. “We are strictly adhering to the May 10 bilateral understanding to cease all cross-border military action. But Pak Army chief General Asim Munir can never be trusted,” a senior military officer told TOI.When military hostilities were fully underway for four days last week, the IAF’s fully-automated integrated air command and control system (IACCS) played a critical role during Operation Sindoor . It connects different radars to a wide array of AD weapon systems as well as the Army’s smaller Akashteer system to present a composite real-time air situation picture.The Army quickly deployed six mobile Akashteer nodes, which it had begun to induct just a few months ago under a Rs 1,982 crore inked with defence PSU Bharat Electronic (BEL) in March 2023, from J&K to Rajasthan, officials told TOI.“Ground-based defence systems integrated with Akashteer made it hell for Pakistan’s air adventures. The system performed beyond users' expectations, providing robust air defence to India during the current conflict,” BEL said in a post on `X’ on Wednesday.The major weapon systems plugged into the AD network included the long-range Russian S-400 `Triumf’ surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range), Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km), jointly developed with Israel, and the indigenous Akash systems (25-km). Then, there were Pechora missiles, L-70 low-level anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6-km) and the integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1-2 km).“This multi-tier defence prevented Pakistan Air Force’s attacks on our airfields and logistic installations during the night of May 9 and 10. It played a crucial role in ensuring that both civilian and military infrastructure across India remains largely unaffected during the enemy’s retaliation attempts,” the govt statement said. It added that at least 10 satellites also continuously worked round-the-clock, quoting ISRO chairman V Narayanan.Before the truce, India launched offensive actions with surgical precision against nine airbases in Pakistan and PoK as well as some radar sites, including the Nur Khan, Rahimyar Khan and Sargodha airbases, which included the use of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other stand-off weapons.“All these strikes were executed without loss of Indian assets, underscoring the effectiveness of our surveillance, planning and delivery systems. The use of modern indigenous technology, from long-range drones to guided munitions made these strikes highly effective and politically calibrated,” the statement said.Operation Sindoor is not just a story of tactical success, but also a validation of India’s defence indigenization policies. From air defence systems to drones, from counter-UAS capabilities to net-centric warfare platforms, indigenous technology has delivered where it mattered, it said.“Operation Sindoor emerged as a calibrated military response to an evolving pattern of asymmetric warfare, one that increasingly targets unarmed civilians along with military personnel. India is ready, armed with its own innovations, backed by a determined state, and powered by the ingenuity of its own people,” it added.","IAF bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems (like the HQ-9 missile batteries and radars), completing the mission in just 23 minutes on May 7. “We are strictly adhering to the May 10 bilateral understanding to cease all cross-border military action.

US defence strategist hails India’s ‘decisive victory’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-defence-strategist-hails-indias-decisive-victory/articleshow/121171502.cms,"US def strategist hails India’s ‘decisive victory’, says response showed clarity

NEW DELHI: John Spencer , a military strategist who is also an urban warfare expert, has weighed in the debate on the extent of the success of ‘Operation Sindoor’, asserting that India scored a decisive victory .“After just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory. Operation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims — destroying terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling a new national security doctrine . This was not a symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied,” Spencer wrote in his latest blog.Spencer currently serves as the chair of the Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute at West Point (US Military Academy), New York, and has been a part of the strategic research group at Pentagon.“India has not declared Operation Sindoor completely over. What exists now is a sensitive halt in operations — some may call it a ceasefire, but military leaders have deliberately avoided that word. From a war-fighting perspective, this is not merely a pause; it is a strategic hold following a rare and unambiguous military victory,” he says.Spencer said Operation Sindoor was “more than a retaliation, this was the unveiling of a strategic doctrine”, quoting PM Narendra Modi as saying, “terror and talks can’t go together. Water and blood can’t flow together”.He said that India’s military response to terror attacks is “overwhelming yet controlled — precise, decisive, and without hesitation. That kind of clarity is rare in modern war. In an era defined by ‘forever wars’ and cycles of violence without strategic direction, Operation Sindoor stands apart. It offers a model of limited war with clearly defined ends, matched ways and means, and a state that never relinquished the initiative”.“In an age where many modern wars spiral into open-ended occupations or political confusion, Operation Sindoor stands apart. This was a demonstration of disciplined military strategy: clear goals, aligned ways and means, and adaptive execution in the face of unpredictable escalation. India absorbed a blow, defined its objective, and achieved it — all within a contained timeframe,” he added.The controlled escalation, he said, sent a clear deterrent signal: India will respond, and it controls the pace. “India’s restraint is not weakness — it is maturity. It imposed costs, redefined thresholds, and retained escalation dominance. India didn’t just respond to an attack. It changed the strategic equation,” he adds.Spencer noted the fact that India handled this crisis without seeking international mediation, enforced its doctrine on sovereign terms, using sovereign means.","US military strategist hails India’s ‘decisive victory’, says response showed clarity.

Fake invoices

leading to GST credit facility misuse: HC

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns over the misuse of a Central Goods and Services Tax Act provision, Delhi high court has fined a private firm for fraudulently claiming input tax credit (ITC) to escape paying full GST.“This court takes note, with some consternation, that such large-scale fraudulent availment of ITC may, if left unchecked, lead to severe damage to the GST framework itself,” HC said.The GST framework is meant to encourage legally entitled persons and businesses to avail of ITC and other similar facilities, said a bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Rajneesh Kumar Gupta in a recent order.HC noted Section 16 of CGST Act was being misused by companies and traders who first availed of the ITC by issuing fake invoices and, when slapped with a penalty by the department, rushed to court in writ jurisdiction.In essence, ITC allows a tax entity or person to claim credit & deduct from payable GST on purchase of goods and/or services used in the chain of business transaction, as it has been taxed earlier. However, court noted that due to fake invoices leading to fraudulent claims by persons, the facility is being misused, along with writ jurisdiction of the court.“This court... is exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and when there is an allegation of such large-scale fraud, to the tune of more than Rs 56.2 crore, being committed with the involvement of a total of 527 firms including the petitioner firm, the court has to be circumspect in the exercise of its powers,” HC noted while imposing costs on the private entity after it emerged fake invoices were created to escape GST liability.",Delhi high court has fined a private firm for fraudulently claiming input tax credit (ITC) to escape paying full GST.

NEW DELHI: The second day of CUET-UG, 2025 witnessed continued disruptions, as technical failures at exam centres affected more than 350 students across J&K and Delhi. The repeated setbacks have sparked serious concerns about the readiness of infrastructure supporting this critical national-level test. In J&K, the situation was further exacerbated by logistical failures. National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts CUET-UG, confirmed cancellation of exam on May 14 at Kite Polytechnic centre in Srinagar, citing technical malfunctions. The test was also cancelled at the centre on May 13, the first day of the exam. While 76 students were unable to take the test on May 13, dozens more were affected on Wednesday. NTA said fresh dates will be announced and new admit cards will be issued to the affected candidates. However, the agency’s response has done little to address the growing frustration among students and their families in the region.Allocation of CUET-UG exam centres has also sparked widespread concern in Meghalaya, with the state govt accusing NTA of failing to communicate in advance about a shortage of centres within state. This oversight resulted in many students being assigned centres outside Meghalaya — some as far as Jorhat and Dibrugarh in Assam, Mizoram, and Bengal’s Kolkata — causing undue financial and logistical stress. Education minister Rakkam A Sangma urged NTA to defer the exams until additional centres, over 200 of which have already been identified and submitted to TCS for vetting, are made ready.J&K Students Association president Nasir Khuehami said he had received numerous distress calls from students unable to attend the exam. “Many had to flee homes due to the (India-Pakistan) conflict. Some are in different states and have no way to return. Their academic future is at risk,” he said. Several students assigned centres outside the UT described the situation as unmanageable. A resident of Jammu was allotted a centre in Himachal Pradesh. “Travelling during this period was not just unsafe—it was impossible. My whole year’s effort feels wasted,” he lamented.Delhi students faced a different set of obstacles. Candidates at centres such as the one in Rohini reported prolonged delays, power outages, and mismanagement. A students, who reached her centre at 6:30 am, said the gates remained closed well past reporting time, and the exam began nearly 90 minutes late. “There was no electricity, backup failed, and students were left waiting outside in the heat,” she said.Inside the examination centre, students experienced rushed verification, poor ventilation, and inadequate seating arrangements. “One AC for 40 students — barely working,” Panghal recalled.Similar reports came from centres in Ambala in Haryana, where candidates complained of extreme heat, lack of fans, and tight security that forced many to discard personal items due to the absence of lockers."," CUET-UG, 2025 witnessed continued disruptions, as technical failures at exam centres affected more than 350 students across J&K and Delhi.

CJI Gavai will have to constitute a Constitution bench comprising a minimum of five judges to give its opinion to the President’s 14 queries.The oath administered in Hindi by the Prez at 10.05am was solemnly affirmed by Justice Gavai, departing from the general practice of swearing in in the name of God. Dhankar, LS Speaker Om Birla, defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah and other Union ministers, along with ex-CJIs including Justice Sanjiv Khanna and judges of SC and HCs, were present.Justice Gavai is the first Buddhist and second Dalit to become CJI, the first being Justice K G Balakrishnan. The second Dalit President Ramnath Kovind, the first being K R Narayanan, was present at Justice Gavai’s oath ceremony .When he took oath, President Murmu was to his right, a fifth century statue of Buddha in Abhay mudra was behind and a grand portrait of Mahatma Gandhi adorned the high wall on his left at Ganatantra Mandap, earlier known as Durbar Hall and as Throne Room during British reign.After being sworn in as 52nd CJI, Justice Gavai touched the feet of his octogenarian mother Kamaltai, who flew in from Amravati and was seated on the front row, to seek her blessings. She was instrumental in shifting Bhushan from a Marathi medium to an English medium school to ensure he did not lag behind siblings studying in a convent school in Mumbai.From Rashtrapati Bhavan, the CJI reached SC and went straight to Dr BR Ambedkar’s statue to pay floral tributes. He also paid tributes at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi. “The first day went well,” Justice Gavai told TOI. A contingent of nearly 400 lawyers from Maharashtra had arrived to felicitate him.

The deceased were Mahabir Singh and his sons Lakshman and Deepak.According to Mahabir's wife, Santosh Devi, a household drain had been backing up for days. Lakshman, who worked at a motorcycle-repair shop, lifted the manhole cover outside the house to investigate and slipped in. Mahabir immediately descended to rescue him but failed to re-emerge. Deepak, employed at a private firm in Rohtak, then entered the sewer in a final effort to save both, but all three succumbed, apparently to toxic gases.DSP Ravi Khundia called the accident ""deeply unfortunate"" & confirmed that postmortems were underway even as no formal complaint had been filed yet.","A routine attempt to unblock a domestic drain at Majra village in Haryana's Rohtak district turned tragic Wednesday.

They cleared caves housing arms manufacturing units. The operation busted a major Maoist stronghold. Disjointed Maoist formations are taking shelter in different places.

BIJAPUR: A 21-day anti-Maoist operation in Karreguttalu Hills (KGH) on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border — headquarters of the most lethal of CPI(Maoist) wings, the PLGA Battalion No 1 , and housing its arms manufacturing units in the natural cave formations within — culminated on May 11, leaving scores of senior Maoists dead , with 31 bodies recovered, and segregated the Centrally-located Maoist command into 8-10 smaller, dislocated units with a massively depleted arsenal and armed capabilities.Hailing ‘ Operation Blackforest ’ — conducted from April 21 to May 11 by the Chhattisgarh Police’s special task force (STF) and district reserve guard (DRG) as well as CRPF — as “the biggest ever operation against Naxalism”, home minister Amit Shah in a post on X on Wednesday shared that the tricolour now flies proudly “on the hill where red terror once reigned”.“KGH was the unified headquarters of big Naxal organisations like PLGA Battalion 1, DKSZC, TSC & CRC, where along with Naxal training, strategies and weapons were also developed. Our security forces completed this biggest anti-Naxal operation in just 21 days and I am extremely happy that there was not a single casualty among the security forces,” Shah said as he congratulated CRPF, STF and DRG soldiers for facing the Naxalites “with exemplary courage even in adverse weather and treacherous terrain”.Eighteen security personnel injured in the operation are out of danger and recovering. The 28 neutralised Naxalites identified so far include 2 divisional committee members and 11 PLGA battalion fighters; they together carried a reward of Rs 1.72 crore.“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji, we are determined to root out Naxalism. I once again assure the countrymen that India is sure to be Naxal-free by 31 March 2026,” said Shah.Addressing a joint press conference here Wednesday, Chhattisgarh DGP Arun Dev Gautam said the forces defied challenging terrain, extreme temperatures and rainstorms, threats from wild animals and a web of landmines laid by the nearly 350 Maoists operating in the area, to reclaim KGH after killing at least 31 Maoists, including 16 women cadres. Around 250 caves running through the hills — which housed 4 arms manufacturing units with leth machines and weapon dumps holding 818 barrel grenade launchers; 35 automatic and semi-automatic weapons, 303 and INSAS rifles; 450 IEDs; cordex wires; besides 216 hideouts and bunkers; and 12,000 kg of food supplies and medicines — were cleared.DG CRPF G P Singh said the operation has busted yet another major Maoist stronghold after Chakrabanda in Bihar and Burapahar in Jharkhand. “The Maoist leadership and senior cadres who were congregated in the KGH hideout have been dislocated and segregated into smaller groups. The disjointed military formations have been forced to take shelter in different places,” he said. A source said this affects the CPI (Maoist) command structure and operational capabilities as the scattered groups cannot congregate for a big operation at short notice; also, it would be easier for the forces to go after them.Though the main objective of the operation was to neutralise top Maoist leaders like Hidma, the difficult topography of the hills made it difficult for the forces to assess the fatalities inflicted. But senior police and paramilitary official agreed that “the Maoists’ weaponry, arms and explosives emptied during the operation will significantly reduce their armed capabilities”.“Their technical units were busted and any attempt now by the scattered groups of Maoists, to reestablish contact will be detected through technical surveillance. Maoists are now possibly taking shelter in disjointed groups across national park area, West Bastar, south Bastar and parts of Telangana. Also, there seems to be some mistrust between the CPI Maoist leadership in Telangana and Chattisgarh. All this has put the Maoists on the backfoot,” said a senior officer.The CRPF DG said the once heavily-mined KGH hills have undergone several rounds of sanitisation, and the residual IEDs will also be de-mined soon. “Once this is done, the hills will be opened up for access by the locals,” he said adding that CRPF will be holding the area by setting up forward operating bases there.Gautam said Operation Blackforest — which displayed excellent coordination between the intelligence agencies, CRPF, Chhattisgarh Police, with Indian Air Force and BSF providing their choppers for airdropping rations and supplies and airlifting personnel and Telangana assisting CRPF on its side of KGH — has busted the Maoists’ belief that the area is their “impregnable” fortress.",Home minister Amit Shah called it the biggest assault on Maoists. Forces faced difficult terrain. They cleared caves housing arms manufacturing units. The operation busted a major Maoist stronghold.

File FIR on min for using ‘

gutter language

’ against Qureshi: HC

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance on Wednesday of state minister Vijay Shah’s remarks on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi , one of the two officers who were the face of the Indian armed forces during Operation Sindoor , and ordered the state DGP to register an FIR against him for using “gutter language” against a woman Army officer.HC ordered that the case be listed on top of the cause list Thursday and warned that if the FIR isn’t filed by then, the DGP will face contempt proceedings. Late Wednesday, CM Mohan Yadav said the order would be followed and an FIR was subsequently filed.The FIR was registered at Manpur police station in Ambedkar Nagar (Mhow) under the BNS sections specified by the court: 152, 196 (1) (b) and 197 (a) (c).A division bench of justices Atul Shreedharan and Anuradha Shukla said: “This court has been compelled to take up this matter suo motu on account of an incident published in various newspapers and digital media networks that has taken place at a public function at village Raikunda in Ambedkar Nagar, at Mhow, on Monday. A sitting minister of MP govt, whose name is Vijay Shah, has used scurrilous language against a senior official of the Indian Army.”The judges said the armed forces are perhaps the “last institution existing in this country”, reflecting integrity, industry, discipline, sacrifice, selflessness, character, honour and indomitable courage, with which any citizen of this country who values the same can identify themselves with. India’s armed forces have been “targeted by Vijay Shah who has used the language of the gutters”, the court said.“…the minister made a nauseating remark against Col Qureshi by way of an innuendo which can refer to none other than her alone, as there is no one else who would fit the description of the comment made by the minister,” HC said. “There are newspaper reports and a plethora of digital material on the internet in which the minister’s speech is clear and unequivocal… His comments are disparaging and dangerous, not just to the officer in question but to the armed forces itself.”Shah’s comment “encourages feelings of separatist activities by imputing separatist feelings to anyone who is Muslim, which thereby endangers the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India. Thus this court is prima facie satisfied that the first offence made out... is under BNS Sec 152”, the court said.","Madhya Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance of state minister Vijay Shah’s remarks on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi.

3.3 lakh Indian tourists visited Turkiye in 2024, spent an estimated $350-400m

NEW DELHI: Indian interest in Türkiye and Azerbaijan is rapidly losing altitude after both nations openly supported Pakistan during Operation Sindoor. The backlash is most visible in tourism, with widespread cancellations and a halt in new bookings.Türkiye’s military support to Pakistan, including drone supplies used during recent attacks on Indian border regions, has sparked a wave of anger. Indian travel agencies and platforms are now grounding promotions and advising customers to avoid both destinations.“Enough is enough! Blood and bookings won’t flow together,” wrote ixigo co-founder Aloke Bajpai on X, announcing a suspension of all flights and hotel reservations to Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and China.Other platforms, including India’s largest online travel agency MakeMyTrip, have stopped short of bans but issued strong advisories discouraging non-essential travel.Bookings for Turkiye and Azerbaijan have dropped 60%, and cancellations jumped by 250% in just one week,” a MakeMyTrip spokesperson said Wednesday.Travel agents across major metros reported that public outrage is translating into decisive action. “There’s a growing perception that Indian money spent on tourism could be fuelling hostile actions against us,” said a Mumbai-based agent.RPG Group chairperson Harsh Goenka weighed in online. “Indians gave over Rs 4,000 crore last year to Turkiye and Azerbaijan through tourism... Today, both stand with Pakistan after Pahalgam. Plenty of beautiful places in India and the world. Please skip these two places.”Indian outbound travel to both countries had surged before tensions escalated. Turkiye saw nearly 3.3 lakh Indian tourists in 2024, a 21% jump from the previous year. Azerbaijan welcomed 2.4 lakh Indians — more than double its 2023 figure. Direct connectivity by airlines like IndiGo played a role in boosting interest.But fallout has been swift. EaseMyTrip estimates Indian tourists spent $350-400 million in Turkiye last year alone, with average spending per person ranging between $1,200-1,500. That flow has slowed dramatically.Travel industry groups like Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) and Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) have stopped promoting both destinations. Refunds are being processed, with select airlines cooperating, said TAAI’s south region chairperson Devaki Thyagarajan.Digital visa platform Atlys confirmed a steep drop in Azerbaijan-bound applications, despite the country’s growing popularity as a budget-friendly alternative to Europe. “People wanted something new beyond Singapore or Thailand. Azerbaijan offered a European feel at a fraction of the price,” said Sejoe Jose of Indian Association of Tour Operators. “That interest has disappeared.”Kolkata has seen Turkiye-bound travellers fall from 200 a day to under 50. Azerbaijan’s daily footfall has dropped to single digits, said TAAI east chairman Anjani Dhanuka. MakeMyTrip and EaseMyTrip data show a 30% spike in Azerbaijan cancellations and a 22% increase for Turkiye.Agents now suggest similarly priced destinations. For couples who once chose Turkiye, where a weeklong trip cost Rs 3-4 lakh, alternatives include Russia, Hungary, Czech Republic or Germany. Azerbaijan’s budget travellers are being redirected to Vietnam, Singapore, Bali or Dubai.","Türkiye’s military support to Pakistan, including drone supplies used during recent attacks on Indian border regions, has sparked a wave of anger.

Operation Sindoor: Congress demands answers from Modi govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-cong-demands-answers-from-modi-govt/articleshow/121171406.cms,"Rahul Gandhi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will hold a press conference on Friday to address the issues arising after the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, as the party said the govt needs to answer the questions triggered by US President’s Donald Trump’s announcements on ceasefire that have led to internationalisation of Kashmir and a hyphenation of India and Pakistan. Congress will take out Jai Hind Yatras in cities to counter the BJP’s attempt to “politicise the operation against Pakistan”. The party reiterated the need for accountability on “intelligence failure” in Pahalgam, lamenting that it had not yet been fixed yet.A meeting of the CWC, chaired by Rahul Gandhi, expressed concerns that Prime Minister has chosen to remain silent on the crucial issue of comments from US leaders, which have resulted in hyphenation between India and Pakistan and led to belief that it has a leverage over the country. It said the PM should clarify the issues raised by Trump’s remarks.The gathering decided that Modi govt needed to be put on the mat for its “poorly devised” conclusion of hostilities without any guarantees on terror from Pakistan. Congress reiterated its demand for an all-party meeting chaired by the PM and a special session of Parliament. The party also demanded the resignation of MP minister Vijay Shah for his “appalling” comments on Col Sophiya Qureshi.Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have said that Congress fully backs the actions of the armed forces, but the US seems to have taken India for granted and it is not clear who rushed to America seeking intervention. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that tough questions should be asked of the govt. Crucially, Sachin Pilot is learnt to have noted that Trump and US secretary of state Marco Rubio have not mentioned the word “terror” even once in their tweets and comments, while Kashmir has figured prominently there. The development was dubbed as alarming by many in the meeting which included P Chidambaram, K C Venugopal, Ajay Maken, Shashi Tharoor, Randeep Surjewala, Pawan Khera and Jairam Ramesh among others.According to sources, the leaders felt BJP’s “politicisation of war” should be countered, with Randeep Surjewala suggesting that Congress take out Jai Hind Yatras in cities to challenge the BJP’s Tiranga Yatras. However, there appeared not much worry about BJP seeking to play the war card, with many opining that the ruling party’s rallies are a “face saver” because people were asking questions about the ceasefire brokered by the US, which has given Pakistan an advantage.Jairam Ramesh told reporters that PM calling an exclusive meeting of NDA chief ministers on May 25th, excluding other CMs, is a blatant attempt at politicisation of the operation against Pakistan. He said the PM should have called all the CMs.Interestingly, Shashi Tharoor, who has emerged as a vocal face in media defending India’s actions while also backing the govt, is learnt to have suggested that foreign secretary should be grilled on strategy when he briefs the parliamentary standing committee. Foreign secretaryVikram Misri will meet the panel chaired by Tharoor next week.Some leaders including Pilot are said to have underlined that China has come out openly in support of Pakistan but international support has been missing for India, with even Russia staying mum.The very durability of ceasefire was questioned as Pakistan govt is unstable and the army is calling the shots, sources said.In a resolution, the CWC said the abrupt end to action against Pakistan has raised questions as US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire first and said he used the threat of trade to pressure India. It termed the govt’s silence “inexplicable and unacceptable”. “This represents a dangerous and unprecedented hyphenation of India with Pakistan, which compromises our national position and prestige,” the resolution said.","Congress will take out Jai Hind Yatras in cities to counter the BJP’s attempt to “politicise the operation against Pakistan” The party reiterated the need for accountability on “intelligence failure” in Pahalgam, lamenting that it had not yet been fixed yet.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121171404,imgsize-914329,width-400,resizemode-4/Rahul-Gandhi-Bharat-Summit.jpg"

AMRITSAR/NEW DELHI: A BSF constable held for 22 days in Pakistan after inadvertantly crossing the Punjab border was released Wednesday morning, drawing emotional scenes in his Bengal hometown.Purnam Kumar Shaw , 40, was handed over by Pakistan Rangers to BSF officers at Attari-Wagah border near Amritsar around 10.30am, concluding days of tense diplomatic and military manoeuvring between India and Pakistan amid Operation Sindoor Shaw’s wife Rajni, who is in advanced pregnancy, said: “Every citizen prayed for my sindoor,” thanking PM Narendra Modi and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.Officials said Shaw, part of BSF’s 182 Battalion, was in uniform and carrying his rifle when he crossed into Pakistani territory in Ferozepur on April 23 while on operational duty. “He was received in accordance with established protocols. He appeared safe and healthy,” said Dr Atul Fulzele, IF of BSF’s Punjab frontier. A medical check-up and debriefing followed.Shaw’s crossing came a day after the Pahalgam terrorist strike that claimed 26 men, mostly tourists, and heightened tensions across the border. India responded with precision strikes on terrorist and military targets in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor.Pakistani Rangers had released photos showing Shaw blindfolded and disoriented. BSF initially shared an image of Shaw with a beard, later issuing one where he appeared clean-shaven and in fresh clothes.Efforts to secure his release included multiple flag meetings and diplomatic outreach. Sources said a final meeting between BSF and Pakistani Rangers commandants paved the way for Wednesday’s handover. BSF attributed Shaw’s return to “consistent efforts through communication channels”.In a parallel and unacknowledged move, a Pakistani soldier who had crossed into Rajasthan on May 4 walked back across Wagah the same morning.In Rishra of Bengal’s Hooghly district, Shaw’s family broke down in joy. “We cannot even imagine what he faced, but he will serve the country again,” said his father Bholanath Shaw. His mother Devanti Devi handed out sweets.Shaw’s wife recounted the anxiety that gripped the family. “I ran from pillar to post. I feared war would break out and we’d lose him,” she said. Rajni had even visited BSF officers near the border for updates. CM Banerjee later phoned Rajni and confirmed that talks at DGMO-level had included her husband’s case.After BSF’s press release confirmed his return, Rajni received a brief call from Shaw. “Main bol raha hoon,” he said. Unsure at first, she asked, “Aap PK Sir hain?” before recognising his voice.The couple’s young son Aarav looked up at a kite kept on top of a cupboard. “We flew it during Holi when papa was home. We’ll fly it again together,” he said.","Purnam Kumar Shaw was handed over by Pakistan Rangers to BSF officers at Attari- Wagah border near Amritsar around 10.30am.

The might of BrahMos

The Akash Shield

How D4 disabled enemy drones

Indo-Israeli collaborations

Import dependence

As the dust settles after Operation Sindoor, directed against Pakistan and terror actors on its soil, what is becoming clear is the resounding success of India’s nascent defence industry.It is believed India used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other precision-strike weapons to inflict damage to terror bases and military installations deep inside Pakistan. Indian armed forces also deployed indigenous Akash air defence missiles and D4 anti-drone systems to repel wave after wave of Pakistani aerial strikes, letting very little pass through.“During this operation, the credibility of our Made-in-India weapons was firmly established. The world now recognises that the time for Made-in-India defence equipment in 21st-century warfare has arrived,” PM Narendra Modi said on May 12 in his address to the nation after Operation Sindoor’s success.For the past several years, the govt has been pushing to maximise acquisition of defence equipment through indigenous sources and promote domestic manufacturing to reduce dependence on foreign-origin weapons as part of its flagship ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ programme. Parallelly, India’s defence exports reached a record high of Rs 23,622 crore in 2024-25, a 12% surge over the previous year.BrahMos (the name represents two rivers: the Indian Brahmaputra and Moskva of Russia) flies at a speed of Mach 2.8, or almost three times the speed of sound, and is considered to be one of the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missiles.It is produced by BrahMos Aerospace Pvt Ltd, a Delhi-based joint venture between Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyeniya or NPOM.BrahMos can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or land platforms. India has successfully tested all variants of BrahMos and inducted the missile system into its military years ago.In 2019, the range of this home-grown missile was enhanced up to 450km with a top official then saying, “India is now the only country in the world to integrate long-range missiles into fighter jets [Sukhoi 30]”.India recently exported these missiles to the Philippines as part of a $375 million deal signed in 2022.Efforts are also on to develop a hypersonic version of the missile, tentatively named BrahMos-II. According to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between New Delhi and Moscow, BrahMos-II will be based on a hypersonic scramjet technology. The main purpose of such a weapon is to target deeply buried enemy nuclear bunkers and heavily protected locations; all three military services will utilise this weapon.Referring to the new BrahMos integration and testing facility that was inaugurated in Lucknow last week, former DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy said it is capable of delivering 100-150 missiles annually. India has two more BrahMos production facilities — in Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram.Developed by DRDO and manufactured by state-run Bharat Dynamics Ltd (BDL), Akash is a short-range surface-to-air missile (SAM). It is part of India’s multi-layered air defence system, which played a decisive role in thwarting Pakistani aerial incursions into India recently.Akash is probably the first-of-its-kind system in the world that is capable of engaging four aerial targets simultaneously at a range of 25km. The new variant — Akash-NG — has an extended range of 70-80km.The missile is equipped with electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) capabilities, enabling it to penetrate enemy jamming and other evasion tactics.The Akash system is designed for mobile platforms, making it highly agile and capable of rapid deployment anywhere.While some analysts have likened India’s Akash with Israel’s famous Iron Dome missile system, there are some fundamental distinctions between the two.First, Akash is a larger platform than the Israeli one. Also, while the Iron Dome is a potent shield against short-range rockets and artillery shells, Akash is capable of intercepting missiles, combat drones as well as aircraft.India reportedly signed a deal with Armenia in 2022 to export 15 units of the Akash missile systems. Brazil and Egypt have also shown interest in this weapon.India resorted to both kinetic and non-kinetic (jamming) warfare to thwart Pakistani drone swarms. Reports suggest the DRDO-developed D-4 anti-drone system was used in the recent military operations. It can disable ordinary drones as well as unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) employing electronic jamming and spoofing techniques.D4 (Drone-Detect, Deter and Destroy) also has a laser-based kill mechanism to destroy enemy drones. It’s unclear if this hard-kill method was used in the recent conflict.This system integrates radars, RF (radio frequency) sensors, and EO/IR (electro-optical/infrared) cameras, thereby offering a multi-sensor and 360-degree approach to detect incoming drones.Multiple DRDO labs, including the Electronics & Radar Development Establishment (LRDE), Bengaluru; Defence Electronics Research Laboratory (DLRL), and the Centre for High Energy Systems and Sciences (CHESS), both in Hyderabad; and Instruments Research and Development Establishment (IRDE), Dehradun, contributed towards developing this system.Weapons jointly developed with Israel such as Barak-8 missiles and SkyStriker kamikaze drones also contributed significantly to India’s defensive and offensive actions during Operation Sindoor.Barak-8 is a medium range surface-to-air missile (MRSAM) jointly developed by DRDO and Israel Aerospace Industries. India’s military last month conducted successful tests of this air defence system.The MRSAM includes mobile launchers that can be deployed on land or on navy vessels. The missile is capable of intercepting targets of up to 70km range.In India, it is produced by BDL, Kalyani Rafael Advanced Systems (KRAS) and Tata Advanced Systems (TASL).SkyStriker is a loitering munition jointly developed by Israel’s Elbit Systems and Adani Group’s Alpha Design Technologies. Although a drone, SkyStriker can be used as a precision weapon. It hovers over the target area to identify and engage threats, operating either autonomously or under human supervision.While India did demonstrate the effectiveness of its Made-in-India weapons, it still remains heavily dependent on arms imports. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), India is the second-largest arms buyer in the world, with an 8.3% share of global imports between 2020 and 2024.Russia remains India’s main weapons supplier, accounting for 36% of its arms imports. Russia’s overall share, however, has been steadily declining (72% in 2010-14 and 55% in 2015-19) with India increasingly turning to countries like France, Israel and the US.","India used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other precision-strike weapons to inflict damage to terror bases and military installations deep inside Pakistan.

NAGPUR: After its kamikaze drone Nagastra 1 wreaked havoc during Operation Sindoor, Nagpur’s Solar Defence and Aerospace Ltd (SDAL) successfully conducted trials of its anti-drone system , “Bhargavastra”, at the Seaward Firing Range in Odisha’s Gopalpur in the presence of the Army’s air defence brass. The indigenously built “Bhargavastra” can fire 64 micro rockets in a single salvo, bringing down a swarm of drones and jam UAVs.When it is eventually deployed, a dual-layer drone defence system will be in place, the first layer comprising unguided micro-rockets with high lethality followed, in the second layer, by micro-missiles for precision hits. The system’s rockets have higher lethality with a kill radius of 20m.The “Bhargavastra” trials conducted on Tuesday witnessed rockets fired in both single and salvo mode. All rockets achieved required launch parameters. This proves Bhargavastra’s capability in mitigating large-scale drone attacks , as per information accessed by TOI.","Nagpur’s Solar Defence and Aerospace Ltd (SDAL) successfully conducted trials of its anti-drone system. “Bhargavastra” can fire 64 micro rockets in a single salvo, bringing down a swarm of drones and jam UAVs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121171267,imgsize-25272,width-400,resizemode-4/Bhargavastra.jpg"

Govt rejects another China bid to rename places in Arunachal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-rejects-another-china-bid-to-rename-places-in-arunachal/articleshow/121171040.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Govt has rejected another “preposterous” attempt by China to rename 27 places in Arunachal Pradesh, saying the state is and will always remain an integral part of India. This is the fifth time that China has renamed villages in Arunachal to reinforce its claim over the Indian state it calls ‘Zangnan’.“Consistent with our principled position, we categorically reject such vain and preposterous attempts to rename places in the Indian state. Creative naming will not alter the undeniable reality that Arunachal Pradesh was, is, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal .China has in the past renamed places in Arunachal Pradesh on four occasions — 2017, 2021, 2023 and 2024 — each of which was preceded by a diplomatic spat with India. For example, the first such exercise in 2017 followed the Dalai Lama’s visit to the state. In 2023, the same attempt followed a G20 meeting that India hosted in the state.On this occasion, it followed last week’s military skirmishes between India and Pakistan after the Pahalgam terrorist attack. The renaming is seen by many as another example of coercive diplomacy that Beijing is known to practise to validate its territorial claims .The Chinese foreign ministry later doubled down saying, “The Zangnan region belongs to China. The Chinese govt’s recent effort to standardise the names of some of the places in Zangnan is fully within China’s sovereignty.”China claims not just Tawang in Arunachal but effectively the entire state saying it’s a part of south Tibet. While the Tibetan govt-in-exile says Arunachal Pradesh is a part of India, China maintains it’s in south Tibet and cites examples like the second most important Tibetan Buddhism monastery being in Tawang and the sixth Dalai Lama being born there to back its claim.","This is the fifth time that China has renamed villages in Arunachal to reinforce its claim over the Indian state it calls ‘Zangnan’ The renaming is seen by many as another example of coercive diplomacy that Beijing is known to practise to validate its territorial claims.

NEW DELHI: Security forces conducted a comprehensive joint mock drill on Monday at Yatri Niwas, the base camp for the Amarnath Yatra in J&K, as a preemptive measure to ensure safety during the upcoming Amarnath Yatra. Buses were sent under full security cover to test preparedness.The first batch of pilgrims will be flagged off from the Jammu base camp on July 2. The Yatra will formally begin on July 3 via both the Baltal and Pahalgam routes.Speaking to reporters, Deputy Commissioner of Jammu, Sachin Kumar Vaishy, said all preparations for the Yatra have been completed. “Today, tokens will be distributed at Saraswati Dham. We appeal to people to come in large numbers; we will provide them with all the necessary facilities, and no one will face any issues. We have full preparations for everything,” he said.The exercise aimed to assess emergency preparedness in the event of landslides or other natural disasters during the pilgrimage and to ensure a prompt response in case of any unfortunate incident. The simulation involved rescuing stranded vehicles and providing immediate aid to injured pilgrims, with security and disaster response teams efficiently coordinating evacuation and medical assistance.Earlier, on Sunday, a joint mock landslide drill was conducted by the Indian Army CRPF , J&K Police, and the Jammu and Kashmir State Disaster Response Force (JKSDRF) in parts of Samroli and Toldi Nallah along the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, one of the critical routes for the Yatra.The CRPF has intensified surveillance by deploying K-9 (dog) squads alongside its personnel on key routes used by thousands of pilgrims and has strengthened highway patrols, with special focus on sensitive stretches such as the Udhampur sector.Meanwhile, Director General of Police (J&K) Nalin Prabhat held a joint security review meeting in Udhampur on Saturday ahead of the Yatra, which will continue until August 9. The meeting was convened to review preparations and enhance coordination among all agencies involved in ensuring the safety of pilgrims.Addressing the meeting, the DGP emphasised the need for officers to maintain very close coordination, describing it as crucial to ensuring an incident-free Yatra.He directed that zonal and sectoral officers must have up-to-date information about the availability and location of special teams such as Drone Units, Bomb Disposal Squads, Dog Squads and Quick Response Teams (QRTs), to ensure these teams can be deployed in real time in case of any emergency.",Joint mock drill conducted to ensure safety of pilgrims ahead of Amarnath Yatra.

Indore: Madhya Pradesh DGP Kailash Makwana highlighted that police action alone is insufficient to prevent sexual assault cases, pointing to declining social values attributed to widespread access to explicit content through digital devices and internet connectivity.Addressing media Saturday about rising sexual assault cases, the DGP said, ""There are many reasons why I believe this is happening - availability of internet, mobile phones, obscene content, alcohol. Through mobile phones, anyone can connect with anyone from anywhere. There is a serious decline in morality. There are many such reasons, and to expect the police to handle all of this alone is not possible.""Makwana said domestic supervision has weakened considerably. ""Within homes, people are no longer able to keep a watch on each other. Many of the boundaries have been broken, and the kind of obscenity being served through the internet from a young age is undoubtedly distorting children's minds. That, somewhere, is contributing to the increase in such crimes,"" he added.Speaking to journalists in Indore on Sunday after a comprehensive review meeting, DGP Makwana announced significant progress in anti-Naxal operations.“In its fight against Naxalism, MP police have neutralised 10 Naxals in past six months alone — marking the highest such figure recorded in any single year in the state. Previously, the maximum number of Naxals eliminated in a year stood at six,” the DGP said.The meeting included senior officials from Indore commissionerate and SP and DSP-ranked officers from all eight districts in Indore range. The DGP said, “While Naxal problem remains widespread in Chhattisgarh, the issue in MP is restricted to Balaghat and Mandla. Among these, Balaghat continues to be most affected.

Congress has appointed 8,586 BLAs, CPI(ML) (Liberation) 233, CPM 76, and BS.BJP allies JDU, Lok Janshakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party have appointed 27,931, 2,457 and 264 BLAs, respectively, taking the total deployment by NDA to 82,616 BLAs.EC sources told TOI on Sunday that all parties are in the process of appointing more BLAs for proper verification of electoral rolls.EC officials, despite facing criticism of SIR as an attempt at “disenfranchisement”, sought to make it clear Sunday that the poll body will strictly implement Article 326 during the exercise. The Article, a senior EC functionary told TOI, casts a constitutional duty on the commission to enrol only those who are Indian citizens above 18 years of age, ordinary resident in the assembly constituency concerned and not disqualified under any law as an elector.“SIR is in line with Article 326. It’s a straight question (to the parties criticising SIR): Do you agree with Article 326 or not,” asked the functionary.EC has already advised all recognised political parties in Bihar to appoint their workers as BLAs in polling stations “now rather than finding faults with the electoral rolls later”, as per the senior EC functionary.Electoral registration officers (EROs) have started conducting orientation workshops for BLAs of all parties to explain the process and sensitise them about SIR.The BLA for a polling station will be associated with the booth level officer (BLO) during the revision period. Political parties would also be asked to give a list of BLAs to respective their EROs.Before house-to-house enumeration, a BLO will hold a meeting with BLAs appointed by political parties and brief them about the schedule and process of SIR. BLOs will go through the draft electoral roll with BLAs and identify corrections to be carried out.“It is pertinent to mention that BLAs once appointed by a recognised political party will continue as BLA, unless their appointment is rescinded revoked by the political party concerned,” as per EC instructions on SIR in Bihar issued last week.EC has allowed BLAs to file applications in bulk, subject to the condition that a BLA would not submit more than 50 forms per day to a BLO before the draft roll publication, and 10 forms per day thereafter.BLAs will submit a list of application forms with an undertaking that he or she has personally verified the particulars of the application forms and is satisfied that they are correct.","RJD has appointed 47,143 BLAs, making it second only to BJP that has positioned 51,964 BLAs in the field.

"Post Op Sindoor, India to fast-track launch of 52 defence surveillance satellites",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-op-sindoor-india-to-fast-track-launch-of-52-defence-surveillance-satellites/articleshow/122149971.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the need for ‘deep’ as well as ‘persistent’ surveillance of enemy territory being reinforced by Operation Sindoor , India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine.Phase 3 of Space-Based Surveillance (SBS) programme, which was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in Oct last year at a cost of Rs 26,968 crore, involves the construction and launch of 21 satellites by Isro and 31 by three private companies.The first of these satellites is to be launched by April next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end, as part of the project being spearheaded by Defence Space Agency (DSA) under the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) of defence ministry.“Work is underway to compress these timelines to launch the satellites faster into the low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit. The three private companies that have got the contracts have been told to speed up building of the satellites,” a source told TOI.“The aim of SBS-3 is to cover much larger areas of China and Pakistan, as well as the Indian Ocean Region, with shorter revisit times (interval between two consecutive surveillance sweeps of the same location) and much better resolution.The space doctrine is also being fine-tuned,” he added.Parallelly, IAF is pursuing the case for three high-altitude platform system (HAPS) aircraft, which are basically unmanned aerial vehicles or ‘pseudo-satellites’ that operate in the stratosphere for long durations on ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions, as reported by TOI earlier.During Operation Sindoor, which saw intense hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10, India used domestic satellites like Cartosat, as well as foreign commercial ones, for tracking military movements in Pakistan. “We need to shorten our OODA (observe, orient, decide and act) loop. The faster India gets the 52-satellite constellation up in space the better,” another source said.India also needs to put in place its satellite shield since China is developing weapons like direct ascent anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare equipment, and directed energy weapons like high-powered lasers to contest or deny other nations access to the space domain.China’s military space programme has expanded from operating just 36 satellites in 2010 to over 1,000 by 2024, with 360 of them dedicated to ISR missions.At a seminar earlier this month, IDS chief Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit had stressed the need to extend India’s “surveillance envelope” while underlining the critical role of “real-time situational awareness” in conflicts.“We must detect, identify and track potential threats not when they approach our borders, but when they are still in their staging areas, airfields and bases, deep within an adversary’s territory,” he said.China’s creation of PLA Aerospace Force in April last year underlined its recognition of space as the “ultimate high ground” in modern warfare. “Their satellites have recently demonstrated sophisticated ‘dogfighting’ manoeuvres in LEO, practising tactics designed to track and potentially disable adversary space assets. They have evolved from a ‘kill chain’ to a ‘kill mesh’ — an integrated network that seamlessly interweaves ISR satellites with weapon systems,” Air Marshal Dixit said.","India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine. The first of these satellites is to be launched by April next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122149969,imgsize-1325035,width-400,resizemode-4/122149969.jpg"

Poll Should the judiciary focus more on reducing pending cases? Yes, it's a priority No, other issues are more pressing

NAGPUR: Chief Justice of India Bhushan Gavai called Supreme Court's recognition of the need to apply the ""creamy layer"" principle within SC/STs one of the defining moments of his judicial career, describing it as essential to refining social justice.""Treating children of high-ranking SC/ST officers on a par with those from truly disadvantaged families dilutes affirmative action's purpose.

Gavai also helped annul the electoral bonds scheme, calling it inconsistent with transparency in political funding.On his watch, SC stayed Allahabad HC's remarks in a sexual assault case, calling them ""inhuman"".

A bureaucratic bottleneck removed

Fast-tracked pathways for skilled talent



A magnet for Indian aspirants



The New Zealand Excellence Awards 2025, with a funding pool of NZ$260,000, offers up to NZ$20,000 per student for bachelor’s and master’s programmes.



Post-study work rights allow graduates to remain in the country for up to three years, offering valuable work experience and a potential route to permanent residency.



Competitive visa fees and simplified pathways have made New Zealand’s offer both attractive and accessible.

A new player in the global talent race



Final word

In a landmark policy recalibration, Immigration New Zealand (INZ) has made a pivotal decision that will dramatically ease the bureaucratic burden for thousands of Indian professionals and students. Effective 23 June 2025, India joins eight other nations on New Zealand’s prestigious “List of Qualifications Exempt from Assessment” (LQEA). This move eliminates the previously mandatory International Qualification Assessment (IQA) for most Indian degree-holders, accelerating their access to New Zealand’s skilled migration and work visa streams.The IQA, formerly a gatekeeper in the immigration process, was a time-consuming and costly requirement that mapped foreign qualifications onto New Zealand’s academic framework. With the latest inclusion of India in the LQEA, this cumbersome step is now obsolete for most degree-holders from recognised Indian institutions.Degrees from countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Sweden, and Switzerland have also been included in this exemption. Simultaneously, INZ will revise and harmonise existing exemptions for nations like Australia, the US, the UK, Japan, Malaysia, and South Africa, further reinforcing parity and transparency in its migration pathways.This change is more than just administrative housekeeping; it’s a strategic recalibration of New Zealand’s talent pipeline. Applicants from newly included LQEA countries can now apply directly under the Skilled Migrant Category, Green List roles, and Accredited Employer Work Visa schemes. These are not merely immigration categories; they are fast lanes to residency, employment, and, ultimately, long-term integration.For India, which has consistently remained one of New Zealand’s top four international student markets, with over 22,000 enrolments in recent years, the implications are profound.New Zealand has already taken significant strides to woo Indian talent through a suite of initiatives:In this context, the removal of the IQA requirement is not just a procedural relief—it’s a symbolic welcome mat for India’s skilled graduates, particularly in high-demand domains like STEM and business.This policy shift could reposition New Zealand as a formidable competitor in the global education and migration race, traditionally dominated by countries like Australia, Canada, and the UK. The streamlined rules may tip the scales in New Zealand’s favour, especially for Indian applicants who are increasingly weighing ROI, clarity in migration policy, and work prospects abroad.Immigration experts believe the LQEA update reflects not just operational pragmatism but also geopolitical foresight. In an era where talent is mobile and nations are competing for human capital, speed, efficiency, and trust are the new currencies.New Zealand’s decision to exempt Indian qualifications from assessment is more than an administrative tweak; it is a bold invitation to India’s brightest minds. For a country that prizes education, global mobility, and innovation, this may well be the opening chapter of a deeper Indo-Kiwi talent partnership. The message is clear: Bring your degree, your skills, and your ambition, New Zealand is ready.",India joins eight other nations on New Zealand’s prestigious ‘List of Qualifications Exempt from Assessment’ (LQEA) This move eliminates the previously mandatory International Qualification Assessment (IQA) for most Indian degree-holders.

Poll Will Praggnanandhaa become the next World Chess Champion? Yes, definitely! Maybe in the future. No, he won't. Unsure at this moment.

Dutch No.1 Grandmaster Anish Giri, 31, sparked conversation across the chess world on Friday with a tongue-in-cheek reaction to R Praggnanandhaa becoming the new World No.1 junior.“Chess juniors nowadays have to be at least U16, keeping track of U20 players is totally pointless,” Giri, who currently holds the live rating of 2748.0 and is world no. 10, wrote, hinting at how elite young talents are now already competing at the top of the senior world rankings.The remark came shortly after 19-year-old Praggnanandhaa’s remarkable victory at the UzChess Cup Masters 2025 in Uzbekistan, which propelled him to a live rating of 2778.3 — making him the World No.4 overall and officially India’s highest-rated chess player.He leapfrogged both World Champion D Gukesh (2776.6) and Arjun Erigaisi (2775.7), reshuffling the Indian chess hierarchy.Praggnanandhaa’s road to victory was nothing short of dramatic. Starting the final day behind both Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Javokhir Sindarov, he scored a crucial win over Abdusattorov in the last classical round to force a three-way tie.In the blitz tiebreaks, Praggnanandhaa showed nerves of steel, eventually winning the tournament in the second set of rapid games — his third major classical title of the year.Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand applauded the youngster, stating, “This win seemed the least likely with just two rounds to go… An impressive demonstration of character.”With this triumph, Praggnanandhaa adds the UzChess Cup to his 2025 title haul, which already includes victories at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament and the Superbet Classic in Romania. He also recently finished runner-up at the Stepan Avagyan Memorial.While Giri’s comment playfully downplays the relevance of junior rankings, Praggnanandhaa’s performance makes one thing clear — the future of world chess is already here, and it’s thriving in India.",R Praggnanandhaa is the new World No.4 chess player.

Railways to now prepare reservation charts 8 hours before departure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-to-now-prepare-reservation-charts-8-hours-before-departure/articleshow/122148003.cms,"Indian Railways Announces Major Changes As Mumbai Train Accident Claims 4 Lives

NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, Railways will soon prepare reservation chart (of confirmed berths/seats) eight hours before scheduled departure of trains instead of the present four hours. To facilitate passenger convenience, for trains departing before 2pm, the reservation chart will be prepared at 9pm the previous evening.Railway Board proposed the changes last week and railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has directed their implementation ""in a phased manner so that there is no disruption"". The board will come up with the roll out plan soon.In an official statement, the ministry said the current practice of preparing reservation charts four hours before train departure creates uncertainty in the minds of passengers. The new timeline will greatly help them with waitlisted tickets. They will get the first update on waitlist status well in advance. It will especially benefit passengers travelling from remote locations or suburbs of major cities to catch long distance trains. It will also provide more time to make alternative arrangements in case the waitlisted ticket is not confirmed, the statement said.In another passenger-friendly move, the railways announced complete revamp of passenger reservation system (PRS) by Dec.The new PRS will allow over 1.5 lakh ticket bookings per minute, around five times more than the current capacity of 32,000 tickets per minute.Under the new PRS, ticket inquiry capacity will increase 10-fold - from 4 lakh to over 40 lakh enquiries per minute. The system will also have a multilingual and user-friendly booking and inquiry interface. The decisions were made at a review meeting chaired by Vaishnaw last week. Officials said the project has been under execution by Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) over the last few months.""In the new PRS, users will be able to submit their choice of seat and see the fare calendar,"" said an official. On July 1, the national transporter will roll out mandatory authentication of users for booking Tatkal tickets on the IRCTC website and mobile app.","Indian Railways will soon prepare reservation chart eight hours before scheduled departure of trains instead of the present four hours.

NEW DELHI: Monsoon covered the entire country on Sunday, nine days before the normal date, advancing into the remaining parts of Delhi-NCR, Rajasthan, west UP and Haryana, IMD said.This is only the fourth time in the past 25 years that monsoon covered NCR and remaining parts of northwest India the same day. The last time this happened was on July 13 in 2021, whereas the earliest date on which such an event took place was June 16 in 2013 — the day Kedarnath witnessed a major disaster due to cloudburst and flash floods.It has taken monsoon 37 days to cover the entire country this time since its onset over Kerala on May 24, eight days before the normal date. On an average, monsoon covers all of India in 38 days (June 1-July 8).

Latest data from agriculture ministry shows that all kharif crops taken together reported an acreage of 138 lakh hectares till June 20 compared to 125 lakh hectares at the same time last year — an increase of over 10%.Meanwhile, IMD, has predicted “heavy to very heavy rainfall” over many parts of northwest, central, east & northeast India over the next seven days.","This is only the fourth time in the past 25 years that monsoon covered NCR and remaining parts of northwest India the same day.

‘Lost to Marathi manoos’

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra government on Sunday nixed the government order on the implementation of the three-language policy amid opposition's allegations of ""imposing"" Hindi language on the students of the state.During a press conference, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also announced the formation of a committee under educationist Dr Narendra Jadhav to suggest the way forward and implementation of the language policy.The panel has sought three months to study the issue and prepare a report.""The state cabinet has decided to withdraw the Government Resolutions (GR) issued in April and June regarding the implementation of the three-language policy from class one. A committee headed by Dr Narendra Jadhav will be formed to recommend implementation (of the three-language formula),"" Fadnavis said.He said the government will take a fresh decision based on the report of Dr Jadhav, a former member of the Planning Commission and ex-Vice Chancellor.""The other names of the committee will be announced in some days. The panel will study the Mashelkar Committee's report and suggest from which standard (class 1 or otherwise) the three language formula will be implemented,"" he said.""The decision (on language policy) has been taken in the interest of Marathi students. If three languages are taught, students will get credit in the academic bank,"" he added.The Fadnavis government had issued a GR on April 16, making Hindi a compulsory third language for students in classes 1 to 5 studying in English and Marathi medium schools. Amid backlash, the government issued an amended GR on June 17 making Hindi an optional language.This comes after the opposition - Shiv Sena (UBT), MNS, and NCP (SP)- dubbed the move as ""imposition"" of Hindi in Maharashtra.Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS had announced a joint march on July 5 to oppose the ""imposition"" of the Hindi language. The march was cancelled after the government withdrew the GRs.Accusing Uddhav Thackeray of playing politics over the language issue, Fadnavis said the Shiv Sena (UBT) chief was opposing the Hindi language as he wants to ""lay red carpet for the English language"".Fadnavis said the Mahayuti government headed by him issued the two GRs in April and June as part of the sub-group set up by the then Thackeray-led MVA government.""We changed the decision to make the Hindi language mandatory and made it optional,"" he added.Fadnavis said the then CM Thackeray had appointed an 18-member Mashelkar Committee on September 21, 2020, comprising reputed figures from the education sector, on how to implement the NEP. A GR was issued on October 16, 2020.""The committee submitted a 101-page report on September 14, 2021. The panel stated that apart from the Marathi language, English and Hindi languages should be taught in classes 1 to 12. The report was tabled in the state cabinet on January 7, 2022. The minutes of the cabinet meeting are available,'' he said.He claimed Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Vijay Kadam, who runs an educational institution, was a member of the Mashelkar committee.Fadnavis also claimed Uddhav didn't mention that his government disagreed with the Mashelkar committee's report.""At that time, Uddhav didn't say that his government was not accepting the three-language formula. The then government set up a sub-group on the Mashelkar Committee's report,"" he added.""Any Indian who doesn't accept this proposal as part and parcel of a linguistic state has no right to be an Indian. He may be 100 per cent Maharashtrian, 100 per cent Gujarati, and 100 per cent Tamil, but he cannot be an Indian in the real sense of the word, except in geographical sense. If my suggestion is not accepted, India will then cease to be India,"" he said quoting Ambedkar from ""Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar: writings and speeches"".While addressing a press conference, Uddhav said that Devendra Fadnavis government attempted to break the unity of the Marathi manoos and create a divide between Marathis and non-Marathis.""The decision to impose Hindi under the guise of a three-language policy from Class 1 has finally been withdrawn. The government has cancelled the two GRs (Government Resolutions) related to this. This cannot be called wisdom that came late, because this imposition was withdrawn solely due to the strong resistance from the Marathi people. Why the government was so insistent on pushing Hindi and from where exactly this pressure was coming still remains a mystery,"" Uddhav said.""But the attempt to enforce the learning of Hindi by students in Maharashtra through the three-language formula has finally been defeated, and for that, congratulations to all the people of Maharashtra. The government lost to the power of Marathi manoos. The government did not realise Marathi manoos will unite in this manner. Let this passionate resolve grow stronger, and let the Marathi language become a language of knowledge and global discourse — that is the real aspiration,"" he added.The Fadnavis government had issued a GR on April 16, making Hindi a compulsory third language for students in classes 1 to 5 studying in English and Marathi medium schools.

Fadnavis defends Hindi move, cites Uddhav-era panel’s report

MUMBAI: Buffeted by an anti-Hindi campaign led by the Thackeray cousins, CM Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday announced that the state cabinet had decided to scrap two Govt Resolutions (GRs) to introduce Hindi as a third language for class 1 students.The announcement came on a day when public protests against introducing Hindi in primary schools started with Uddhav Thackeray present at a symbolic burning of the GRs at Azad Maidan. A stormy start was also expected to the monsoon session of the state legislature on Monday.Announcing a rollback, the CM also set up a panel led by academic Narendra Jadhav to frame recommendations for implementing a three-language policy. ""Our policy is Marathi-centric and Marathi student-centric. We do not wish to do politics on this issue,"" said Fadnavis.Following the announcement, the Thackerays called off a joint protest rally to be held on July 5 and instead hold a 'victory procession'. Both Shiv Sena (UBT) and Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had described the move to start Hindi lessons in primary school as a 'linguistic imposition'.Announcing a rollback, Fadnavis cited recommendations of the Mashelkar committee set up by his predecessor in 2020 to defend his govt's move.He said Thackeray formed the expert panel to guide the administration on adopting the new National Education Policy. He said the report was accepted by Thackeray, Congress and NCP (SP) when in power. ""But as usual when in power speak differently, when out of power speak differently. Opposition for opposition sake,"" he added.Raj Thackeray must ask Uddhav Thackeray if he gave approval then how has he set out to hold an agitation now,” Fadnavis added.The state govt has been under pressure from its own Language Advisory Committee, which passed a resolution that no third language including Hindi be taught before Class 5. The opposition led by the Thackeray cousins had then announced a morcha against the introduction of Hindi on July 5. Several litterateurs and celebrities had announced their decision to join the morcha as also the Congress and the NCP (SP).Defending the GR for the third language, the CM said the Mashelkar committee set up during the tenure of Uddhav Thackeray submitted a 101-page report recommending such a move. The committee was led by scientist Raghunath Mashelkar and had a sub-committee which included Shiksha Vidya Prabodhini founder Vijay Kadam, a ‘deputy leader’ of Sena (UBT), he added.“Point number 8.1 (of the report) states English and Hindi languages should be implemented as second languages from first standard onwards. If students learn English for 12 years from first to twelfth standard, they will develop proficiency in English and be able to read necessary books. They will be prepared for engineering, medical and other technical-professional courses. While priority must be given to teaching in Marathi in higher education institutions, English and Hindi as second languages should be made compulsory from first standard to 12th. If needed, they should also be made compulsory in the 3 or 4-year degree courses of college education,” said Fadnavis, quoting from the report.He said that the new panel will study the Mashelkar report and engage with those opposed to the policy before making recommendations. The other members of the committee will be announced shortly and the committee will submit its report in three months, he said.Explaining the evolution of the three-language policy, he said the NEP was first adopted by Karnataka followed by MP, Telangana and UP. “On 21 Sept, 2020 then CM Uddhav Thackeray announced the setting up of an expert committee on how to apply this NEP.” Fadnavis said after the report was submitted on Sept 14, 2021, it came before the cabinet on Jan 20, 2022. Its minutes were confirmed on Jan 7, 2022 and signed by CM Thackeray. There is no mention of keeping aside the three-language policy,” said Fadnavis.“It is not true when some say the report was not accepted. The report was accepted and to implement it, a committee was set up to frame rules. In our tenure following the work of the committee the GRs were issued. We issued the first GR on 16 April, 2025 mentioning Marathi as compulsory followed by English as second language and Hindi as third language. There was an uproar and a second GR was issued on 17 June 2025 and in that we said any Indian language can be studied as a third language. Marathi is compulsory. The study of a third language is not from Std I. It is only an oral study, reading and writing is from Std III. Our govt did not take the decision, we did not make Hindi compulsory, rather (we) gave the option of any Indian language,” said Fadnavis.Fadnavis said when govt issued the second GR it was made clear they wanted to implement it through consensus and the education minister had begun holding consultations.After the CM’s press meet, deputy CM Ajit Pawar urged opposition to call off the July 5 morcha and not inconvenience people in Mumbai. “The reason for holding the morcha is no longer there,” he said.Following the CM’s announcement, MNS chief Raj Thackeray said, “This imposition was withdrawn solely due to strong resistance from the Marathi people. Why govt was so insistent on pushing Hindi and from where exactly this pressure was coming still remains a mystery.” He said the govt has once again appointed a new committee. “Let me say this in clear terms: whether the report of this committee comes or not, such things will no longer be tolerated. ”","CM Devendra Fadnavis defends Hindi move, cites Uddhav-era panel’s report.

MUMBAI: Jimmy Boy, the legendary Parsi restaurant tucked into the heart of Fort, was just months away from turning 100 years. Known for its Keema Pav, Brun Maska, Mava Cakes, and nostalgic Irani chai, the eatery has long been a culinary landmark in south Mumbai. But the dream of ringing in a centenary celebration at its original location came crashing down — quite literally — on the evening of June 20.According to civic records, on June 20 a call was registered with the BMC disaster management helpline by junior engineer of the building and factory department stating that cracks had developed in the ground plus four storey commercial building Vikas Premises whose ground floor houses this eatery. As per further details for safety reasons, the building had been vacated. “A formal notice has been issued instructing all occupants to vacate immediately and restricting further occupancy until structural safety is ensured,” stated a civic official.has a copy of the notice served to the owner of the building on June 21, under section 354 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888. However the notice further read that the said consultant came on site at around 08:25 pm on June 20.“He informed that he had given Structural Audit report to the society, about a year before, informing therein to carry out immediate structural repairs however till date the society has not taken any remedial measure. A letter dated June 21 of M/s. Mahimtura Consultants Pvt. Ltd. is received to this office along with Proforma – B of Structural Audit Report and photographs showing conditions of the structure, wherein the said consultant has mentioned his various observations showing that the structural condition of building has become extremely dilapidated,” stated the notice.When contacted, Shehzad Irani, Director of Operations at Jimmy Boy, said that the Fort premises had been the heart of their operations. “In September 2025, we complete 100 years. We’ve been operating from the same premises, with the same family managing it. It was known as Café India until 1999, serving all-day breakfast and tea. The name was later changed to Jimmy Boy, where we began offering our full Parsi food menu. We had a few plans for our centenary celebrations, especially to give back to our patrons in some way. However, we hadn’t finalised anything yet,” he said.Irani added that Café Olive Green, run by the Army in Navy Nagar, is being serviced by Jimmy Boy, and patrons can enjoy cakes, sandwiches, and puffs there as well. Apart from this, they are also operating out of their Mahim premises, which has takeaway option only. Since the closure of the Fort branch, they have extended their delivery radius through online food aggregators.""While the Fort branch remains shut due to the ongoing structural issue, the case is being handled legally and we’re staying positive. Though this feels like a speed breaker, we hope to bounce back stronger. At the heart of everything, our aim remains to serve authentic Parsi food and give back to the city that made us who we are,"" he said.TOI tried to contact the owner of Vikas Premises, but the manager said he would only be available to comment on Monday.Pinky Janak Ganjawala, a landlord of a building in South Mumbai, expressed concern that even structurally sound buildings are being served notices simply due to their age. “Just because a building is old doesn’t mean it’s unsafe,” she said. Citing Section 79A of the MHADA Act, she noted that if owners fail to act within months of a danger notice, MHADA can take over redevelopment without tenant or owner consent. “In most cases, landlords and tenants aren’t aligned — and this process feels unfair to us,” she added.","Jimmy Boy, the legendary Parsi restaurant tucked into the heart of Fort, was just months away from turning 100 years. Known for its Keema Pav, Brun Maska, Mava Cakes, and nostalgic Irani chai, the eatery has long been a culinary landmark in south Mumbai. The dream of ringing in a centenary celebration at its original location came crashing down on June 20.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122137403,imgsize-1385836,width-400,resizemode-4/122137403.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Indian Embassy in Indonesia on Sunday clarified that media reports had ""quoted out of context"" remarks made by Defence Attaché Captain Shiv Kumar during a seminar on Operation Sindoor . Captain Shiv Kumar had outlined the Indian military's initial response during the early stages of Operation Sindoor while speaking at a seminar hosted by an Indonesian university.In a statement posted on X, the embassy clarified that the officer’s remarks were “quoted out of context” and that media coverage had misrepresented the intent and focus of the presentation.“We have seen media reports regarding a presentation made by India's defence attaché to Indonesia at a seminar. His remarks have been quoted out of context, and the media reports are a misrepresentation of the intention and thrust of the presentation made by the speaker,” the embassy said.According to the clarification, the presentation highlighted a key tenet of India’s civil-military structure, that the Indian Armed Forces operate under the authority of civilian political leadership. It pointedly noted this contrasts with practices in “some other countries in our neighbourhood”.The embassy further said that the officer had referred to Operation Sindoor, explaining that the objective was to target terrorist infrastructure, and that India’s military response was non-escalatory.Earlier in the day, Congress had cited the reported comments of India's defence attache to Indonesia and accused the government of having ""misled"" the country.The party also asked why is Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""refusing"" to preside over an all-party meeting to take the Opposition into confidence and why has the demand for a special session of Parliament been rejected.","The Indian Embassy in Indonesia on Sunday clarified that media reports had ""quoted out of context"" remarks made by Defence Attaché Captain Shiv Kumar.

A proposed 55-megawatt hydel project on the Kulsi river and a satellite township at Barduar - both near Guwahati and along the Meghalaya border - have drawn protests from indigenous groups worried about displacement and threats to their way of life. The Kulsi project, planned in collaboration with Meghalaya, would involve dam construction in the river's upper reaches and possibly displace around 10 villages. The Barduar township, set on about 1,500 acre surrounding a British-era tea garden in Kamrup district, would transform a largely tribal area into a suburban hub on Guwahati's outskirts.""There are some people who love protesting,"" Sarma said on the sidelines of an event. ""We, the two CMs (including Conrad Sangma of Meghalaya), want to build the dam for public benefit, to provide irrigation water. If they don't want it, they can just say so.

I can't stop them from agitating."" Tribal groups, including All Rabha Students' Union, have demanded land documents for long-settled families in Barduar, fearing eviction if the township proceeds.

HYDERABAD: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday asserted that the Centre will not engage in any discussions with Naxals as they continue to bear arms.Speaking at a public meeting after the inauguration of the headquarters of Turmeric Board at Nizamabad in Telangana , the home minister emphasised that the Congress-governed state should not become a hub for Naxal activities. “Congress asks (the Centre) to hold discussions with these people (Maoists). Our govt’s policy is ‘no talks’ with those who hold arms. Give up weapons, surrender, and join the mainstream. I have serious doubts about whether Congress govt might offer shelter to Naxals on the run,” the Union home minister said.The home minister urged CM A Revanth Reddy to take a strong stance against making Telangana a hub for Naxals, highlighting losses among police and local tribes due to Maoist violence. “Should we simply forget the sacrifices and allow them to roam free?” the Union minister asked.Shah reiterated the Centre’s commitment to eradicating Naxalism from the country entirely by March next year. “In several Northeastern states, over 10,000 extremists have surrendered, many of whom have even successfully contested local elections. In the past two years alone, over 2,000 Naxals have laid down their arms.If they continue to resist, we are determined that Naxalism will be wiped out by March 31, 2026,” Shah declared.Shah slammed the Congress govt, saying the tenure of the previous BRS regime was marred by corruption, which ultimately led the public to vote for Revanth. But despite the change in leadership, the people of Telangana have not seen the benefits they expected. “Once Telangana was an ATM for BRS. Now, it has merely become an ATM for Congress leaders in Delhi,” Shah remarked.Shah denounced Congress LS leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi for raising questions about Operation Sindoor . “Rahul, how many doubts do you have? During Operation Sindoor, we crossed into Pakistan and dismantled their terrorist camps.”On the turmeric board, Shah credited PM Narendra Modi with the initiative, saying the latter had promised it in 2023 and had not fulfilled it by meeting a four-decade-old demand to set up its headquarters in Nizamabad. “Modi Ji always delivers on what he promises,” the Union home minister emphasised.Shah highlighted Modi’s other measures for farmers such as increasing the agriculture budget by Rs 1 lakh crore, providing Rs 6,000 annually to every farmer, keeping fertiliser prices stable, and ensuring crop insurance.","The home minister urged CM A Revanth Reddy to take a strong stance against making Telangana a hub for Naxals. “Our govt’s policy is ‘no talks’ with those who hold arms.

Incident caused by ‘abysmal failure’ of crowd mgmt: Naveen

Bhubaneswar: A pre-dawn stampede during Rath Yatra festivities in Odisha's temple town Puri left three devotees dead and dozens injured Sunday as over 20,000 people crowded into a space meant for less than a third of that number.The dead were identified as Premakanta Mohanty, 78, a retired state govt employee from Bhubaneswar; homemaker Basanti Sahu, 42, from Khurda; and Prabhati Das, 52, of Balianta in Bhubaneswar.They had come with families for ""darshan"" of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra atop chariots before the sibling deities entered Gundicha temple on the third day of the annual festival. The chariots were parked outside the temple, drawing massive crowds that overwhelmed barriers.Eyewitnesses attributed the chaos to poor planning and inadequate crowd control measures. They said the surge began as two trucks carrying wooden ladders for the chariots entered the dense crowd around 4am.""The narrow congregation site, combined with insufficient police presence and scattered palm log ladders near the chariots, resulted in the stampede,"" eyewitness Chinmay Patra said.CM Mohan Charan Majhi ordered a probe led by development commissioner Anu Garg and announced compensation of Rs 25 lakh for each victim's family.He called the lapses ""unforgivable"" and transferred Puri district collector S S Swain and SP Vinit Agrawal. DCP-ranked officer V P Pati and commandant Ajay Kumar Padhi were suspended for negligence.Bhubaneswar: Sunday's stampede at Puri in BJP-governed Odisha spotlighted failure of police's crowd control measures. Opposition BJD and Congress attributed the tragedy to govt's incompetence and ""favour"" shown to BJP workers to gather around the chariots.While there was a delay on Friday due to a crowd surge, the chariot-pulling ceremony eventually went off smoothly that day and Saturday with over 12 lakh devotees. But alleged mismanagement of a smaller gathering of 5,000-6,000 near Gundicha Temple led to the stampede Sunday.""The location in front of Gundicha Temple can accommodate a maximum of 5,000-6,000 devotees. Stampedes can occur when chariots are moving. However, tragedy struck before stationary chariots, a first in history,"" said Binayak Dasmohapatra, a senior servitor of Jagannath Temple.Police had announced deployment of 275 AI-enabled cameras and drones for real-time crowd monitoring as part of the security and traffic measures. At least two IPS officers were assigned to oversee 5 companies of RAF, 6 SP-rank officers, 7 ASPs, 24 DSPs, 42 inspectors, 189 SIs/ASIs, 12 havildars, 110 home guards and 52 platoons of state police. Despite this, security experts and devotees criticised police for failing to anticipate the massive weekend crowd. "" I suspect the personnel lowered their guard after Friday and Saturday, and did not take any preemptive measure for the remaining days of the festival,"" said Sahadeb Mohanty, a retired DSP.Leader of opposition and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik posted on X, ""While I refrain from accusing govt of criminal negligence, their blatant callousness undeniably contributed to this tragedy.""State Congress president Bhakta Charan Das claimed the entire arrangement was ""VVIP and BJP worker-centric"".Govt pushed back against the allegations, pointing out that action had been taken against negligent officers and more would follow after ongoing inquiries.""Senior police officers are on the spot to ensure comprehensive crowd control measures,"" law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said.Prabhati, one of the victims, had travelled in a group of seven.Her mother Binodini Panda said: “Thousands pushed through, walking over people. Some people lifted me and some others, but my daughter remained trapped. By the time we managed to reach her, she was gone.”According to Basanti’s husband Dilip Kumar Sahu, the crowd surged at dawn. “People started falling, including us. We were trampled. My wife got trapped. We pulled her out and waited for nearly an hour for an ambulance. She was declared dead at the hospital.”Opposition politicians blamed BJP-led govt for security failures. Former CM Naveen Patnaik of BJD called it an “abysmal failure” of crowd management. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said “no lapses in this responsibility are acceptable”.Undeterred, thousands of devotees continued gathering for darshan of the deities through the day. “We are saddened by the tragedy but not scared. Our faith is stronger than our fear,” said Saudamini Sarangi, 65, from Cuttack.“There was chaos for about an hour but then normalcy returned quickly. We offered prayers smoothly afterward,” said Sovan Pattnaik of Bhubaneswar.Police deployed reinforcements, set up barricades and implemented multiple queue systems. “We appealed to people not to spread rumours. Many were taking photos in the crowd, adding to the challenge,” said DGP YB Khurania.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said over 95 crore Indians were now covered under at least one social security scheme, citing a recent report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Quoting ILO’s findings, Modi said 64% of India’s population received at least one form of social protection benefit. This marks a significant increase from less than 25 crore beneficiaries in 2015.“This is not just a number. It reflects a significant transformation in how India supports its citizens,” the PM said during the 123rd episode of his radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. He added that India now ranked second globally in terms of social security coverage. ILO data is based on Phase 1 of a national data consolidation drive, which covers central schemes and programmes implemented in eight states — Rajasthan, Maharashtra, MP, TN, Odisha, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Assam.Modi said Phase-2 was already under way and would bring data from the remaining states and more sectors, potentially taking the total number of beneficiaries past 100 crore.Modi said schemes like Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana and e-Shram portal have been key in extending social protection to a wider population, particularly the poor, elderly and unorganised workers.He said these schemes have ensured access to food, healthcare, income support and insurance for crores of families.He added that this growing social protection coverage would also help India in signing bilateral social security agreements with developed countries, enabling portability of benefits for Indian workers employed overseas. Modi also referred to a WHO report that declared India free from trachoma, an infectious eye disease that can lead to blindness.PM Narendra Modi said Phase-2 of a national data consolidation drive was already underway and would bring data from the remaining states and more sectors, potentially taking the total number of beneficiaries past 100 crore.Modi said schemes like Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana and e-Shram portal have been key in extending social protection to a wider population, particularly the poor, elderly and unorganised workers.

There will be no respite on Monday either as the weather department has issued a red alert.A landslide at Chakki Mod near Parwanoo blocked Chandigarh-Shimla highway for hours, resulting in daylong traffic jams. In 2023, a massive landslide in the same area had wiped away an entire stretch of the highway, and it took National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) several months to fully restore the road.Landslides also struck Shimla-Chamyana and Arki-Shalaghat roads in Solan, blocking traffic for hours. The highest number of blocked roads, 57, were in Sirmaur district, followed by 44 in Mandi and 19 in Kullu. The rain also disrupted movement of six trains on the heritage line as boulders and uprooted trees fell on the tracks. “We cleared the tracks by 9am, and thereafter all our trains were back on track,” said an official.

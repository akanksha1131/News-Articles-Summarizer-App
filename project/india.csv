India needs $22tn for net zero by 2070; coal use to rise till 2047: Niti Aayog,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-needs-22tn-for-net-zero-by-2070-coal-use-to-rise-till-2047-niti-aayog/articleshow/128139161.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India is working on its 2035 climate action targets, the govt’s think tank, Niti Aayog, on Monday released a roadmap to achieve the country’s ‘net zero’ emission goal by 2070, noting that the transition will need cumulative investment requirements of $22.7 trillion, around $500 billion annually, to finance several “high-level actions” to meet the twin objectives of ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed India) and long-term carbon neutrality. It said at least $6 trillion out of the total investment requirement needs to come from external sources.The govt think tank also underlined that India’s coal consumption will continue to rise till 2047, giving enough hint of what India’s updated climate action - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) - for 2035 would look like.The roadmap - Scenarios Towards ‘Viksit Bharat’ and Net Zero: An Overview - emphasised India’s vision of becoming a developed economy by 2047 and achieving ‘net zero’ emissions by 2070, saying it will require a “delicate balancing act”.“Many of the technologies needed for net zero have yet to reach commercial maturity, while mature low-carbon technologies often demand large up-front investments,” the report said, referring to challenges.Noting a scenario of transition to clean energy in India, the report flagged that the non-fossil fuel power generation (including captive) share is expected to increase from 23% in 2025 to 65% in the current policy scenario and 80% in the ‘net zero’ scenario by 2050.“It is further expected to rise above 80% by 2070 in the current policy scenario, and to 100% in the ‘net zero’ scenario, it said.“The ‘net zero’ strategy is simple – first, electrify energy use. Two, green and clean electricity. Three, control demand through Mission LiFE. Four, focus on circularity and efficiency. Last, cheaper external finance is needed. Clearly stated, India’s coal consumption will go up till 2047 even as energy intensity decreases and efficiency goes up, while meeting ‘net zero’ goals. India can leapfrog to be a global leader in clean technologies. 85% of India of 2047 is yet to be built and can be built to be climate-friendly,” said B.V.R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog, on the occasion of the release of the report.Besides focus on clean energy, the roadmap’s high-level actions for India’s ‘net zero’ transition include focus on circularity, urban mobility, efficient buildings, proper land use, critical minerals, and robust data for monitoring, reporting & verification (MRV) systems as core infrastructure.On financing the transition, it noted that the power sector alone accounts for over half of total needs ($22.7 trillion), reflecting its central role in enabling economy-wide electrification and the expansion of low-carbon generation.“On an annualised basis, this cumulative requirement translates into average flows of approximately $500 billion per year, compared with actual annual investment of around $135 billion in 2024, of which only $70–80 billion currently supports clean energy,” the report said.Of this total, approximately $8 trillion must be front-loaded by 2050, including nearly $5 trillion in the power sector, given the capital-intensive nature of most low-carbon technologies, it added.The think tank noted that the financing gap of $6.5 trillion remains, as an estimated aggregate flow of only $16.2 trillion is expected against the ‘net zero’ scenario investment requirement of $22.7 trillion, and suggested having a ""National Green Finance Institution"" in the country to take care of the needs.It, at the same time, expressed confidence in India’s approach, saying India’s 'net zero' transition will create a new ‘Indian Development Model’ combining economic vitality, technological leadership, and sustainability. “The pathways India shows will be a lighthouse for the developing world. The Indian Development Model will set the trend for others,” said the think tank.“NITI Aayog has undertaken a comprehensive and rigorous exercise that will serve as a benchmark – a starting point for future discussions on ‘Viksit Bharat’ and ‘net zero’. The reports are a great resource for policymakers and researchers on charting India’s course to these twin objectives,” said V Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Advisor to the government.The report has come out with 11 reports that detail the findings of India’s first government-led, multi-sectoral, integrated study to assess development scenarios that deliver on the Viksit Bharat 2047 while simultaneously reducing net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to zero by 2070.The study entails a “scenario-based analytic modelling exercise” that integrates economic growth, India’s development priorities, and climate commitments. It has been prepared by 10 inter-ministerial working groups that examined long-term transition scenarios across key domains like macroeconomic aspects of the transition, sectoral low-carbon transition in power, transport, industry, buildings, and agriculture; financing for climate action; critical minerals; R&D and manufacturing; and the social implications of the transition.","Niti Aayog released a roadmap to achieve the country’s ‘net zero’ emission goal by 2070.

What are air taxis and how will they work in India? CII report explains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-are-air-taxis-and-how-will-they-work-in-india-cii-report-explains/articleshow/128137114.cms,"NEW DELHI: A pilot air taxi corridor linking Gurugram, Connaught Place and Jewar International Airport could sharply reduce travel time in the National Capital Region, according to a new report by the Confederation of Indian Industry. The study says Advanced Air Mobility solutions, including Electric Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft, could help India ease infrastructure bottlenecks by shifting a share of urban travel to low-altitude airspace.The report proposes that air taxis initially operate from rooftops of hospitals and commercial buildings and be deployed for time-sensitive missions such as medical logistics and organ transport. Strategic co-location with hospitals, metro stations and business districts would allow integration with existing transport networks, it said.Citing severe pressure on surface transport, the report argues that Advanced Air Mobility is the logical next step for Indian cities. It suggests setting up a new regulatory body within the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to oversee the rollout of these services.Released by Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu Kinjarapu, the report outlines a phased plan to safely integrate next-generation air mobility into the aviation ecosystem and address urban congestion.Senior officials including DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai and Airports Authority of India chairman Vipin Kumar were present at the launch, along with industry leaders.On infrastructure, the report makes a strong case for rooftop vertiports in major metros. “As India prepares Advanced Air Mobility, rooftop vertiports offer an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution, especially in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru,” it said. With land acquisition for ground-based vertiports proving expensive and slow, rooftops of commercial hubs, hospitals, tech parks and residential towers are seen as a practical alternative using under-utilised real estate.However, regulatory hurdles remain. “Under the current DGCA regulations, routine commercial vertical take-offs and landings from rooftops are not yet permitted, and any future enablement would be subject to the evolution of applicable regulatory frameworks and safety assessments,” the report noted. It proposes a sequenced rollout starting with drone deliveries, followed by medical logistics and organ transport, and later air ambulance services.On funding, the report calls on public financial institutions, including SIDBI, banks and government grant agencies, to create dedicated financing instruments for Advanced Air Mobility. These could include sector-specific infrastructure funds, venture leasing models or credit enhancement facilities to lower investment risk and support long-term capital flows.","A pilot air taxi corridor linking Gurugram, Connaught Place and Jewar International Airport could sharply reduce travel time in the National Capital Region.

"Read, think, don't scroll: PM Modi recalls learning from TOI in Pariksha Pe Charcha",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/read-think-dont-scroll-pm-modi-recalls-learning-from-toi-in-pariksha-pe-charcha/articleshow/128132083.cms,"NEW DELHI: Long before smartphones, search engines and AI entered classrooms, PM Modi said one habit shaped his thinking as a student - reading the newspaper and discussing ideas. Recalling his school days, Modi told students that a teacher once gave him a daily task rooted in curiosity and discipline. ""My teacher used to tell us daily, 'Go to the library. In The Times of India , there is a sentence on the edit page - write that in your notebook and come,' and the next day we used to discuss it,"" he said, underlining the role of reading and reflection in learning.The PM was speaking during the second episode of the ninth edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026, where he interacted with students from Coimbatore, Raipur, Guwahati and Devmogra in Gujarat. Using personal anecdotes and simple examples, Modi urged students to build habits that strengthen thinking, rather than becoming dependent on shortcuts.Warning against overuse of technology, he said mobile phones have become ""masters"" for some children. ""Some kids cannot even eat food unless they are watching a smartphone or television,"" he observed. He said every era has faced fears over new technologies, but technology must not become the master of human life.On AI, Modi advised balance over blind dependence, saying AI should be used for guidance and value addition, not as a substitute for learning. He noted that nature of jobs will keep changing, just as transport once moved from carts to airplanes.The PM also shared practical tips for exams, stressing preparation and rest. He said a good night's sleep keeps students cheerful and encouraged practising previous years' papers and focusing on writing.He cautioned parents against encouraging comparisons at home, saying constant comparison creates pressure rather than motivation. On leadership, Modi said it begins with courage and initiative.Expressing happiness that students carry the dream of Viksit Bharat 2047, Modi said small habits build a developed nation. Launched in 2018, Pariksha Pe Charcha has grown into a major student engagement programme. The ninth edition, held this year, recorded participation from across the country, reflecting sustained student enthusiasm nationwide overall.","PM Modi was speaking during the second episode of the ninth edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026.

"ED forms SIT to probe Anil Ambani, summons wife",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-forms-sit-to-probe-anil-ambani-summons-wife/articleshow/128130890.cms,"On SC directive, CBI and ED may file multiple cases against Anil



NEW DELHI: Complying with the Supreme Court's directive, Enforcement Directorate has set up a special investigation team to probe money laundering cases allegedly involving Rs 40,000 crore against Anil Ambani and companies of Reliance Group.The move comes amid ED stepping up its probe against the industrialist. The agency was set to question his wife, Tina Ambani, on Monday at its HQ here but she did not appear and may be summoned again.The purpose of the planned questioning is to establish the money trail in a case related to purchase of an apartment worth Rs 70 crore in Manhattan, New York, for which senior Reliance executive and Ambani confidant Punit Garg was arrested last week.Tina Ambani did not appear and may be summoned again.Tina Ambani’s name came up during the custodial interrogation of Garg. With Supreme Court on Feb 4 asking for registration of separate cases in each case of the alleged diversion of bank loans by Anil Ambani’s companies, both CBI and ED are looking to file multiple cases against him. CBI, in particular, will be required to file many more since the allegations of fund diversion concern more than a score of loans he took from different financial institutions.The Manhattan apartment, sources suspect, had been purchased using alleged proceeds of crime siphoned off from the bank loans that Reliance Communication had received from an SBI-led consortium. ED has come across a network of shell entities involved in money laundering, including the one that received the sale proceeds ($8.3 million) of the Manhattan apartment “remitted from the US under the guise of a sham investment arrangement with a Dubai-based entity controlled by a Pakistan-linked individual”.So far, during its probe against Anil Ambani and his entities, ED has searched 46 premises and attached 204 properties valued at over Rs 12,000 crore. ED has registered three enforcement case investigation reports, equivalent to police FIRs, under PMLA against Ambani and his entities so far.One is against Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Ltd (RHFL) in the Yes Bank money laundering case. The agency has told SC that RHFL had borrowed public funds from 33 banks/financial institutions and committed a default of over Rs 5,400 crore which constitutes proceeds of crime. The 33 lenders were able to recover only Rs 2,116.9 crore. “As regards the default committed by RCFL, 21 banks/financial institutions faced defaults of Rs 6,281 crore. Out of Rs 8,226 crore, only a sum of Rs 1,945 crore has been paid,” ED told the court. In second ECIR against Reliance Communications Ltd, ED has said total outstanding amount was Rs 40,185 crore that constitutes proceeds of crime. Third case is against Reliance Power Ltd in which allegedly forged bank guarantees were submitted. Three accused were helld in the case.“Having gone through ED’s counter affidavit, it appears to us that the aforesaid agency ought to look into every possible financial transaction which might have led to siphoning of funds and must determine the estimated value of the proceeds of crime. ED is well advised to constitute an SIT,” SC had said in its Feb 4 order. SC posted the matter for hearing on March 10."," Enforcement Directorate has set up a special investigation team to probe money laundering cases allegedly involving Anil Ambani and companies of Reliance Group.

NEET-PG cut-off: Single-digit scores land PG seats in top med colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-single-digit-scores-land-pg-seats-in-top-med-colleges/articleshow/128086922.cms,"Removing cut-offs altogether risks patient safety , says doc



NEW DELHI: A steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores - including in high-risk clinical specialties - triggering alarm across the medical fraternity, reports Anuja Jaiswal.The impact was stark in third-round PG counselling, where candidates secured seats in govt medical colleges with scores ranging from single digits to double digits, spanning both clinical and non-clinical disciplines. Even premier institutions and core clinical branches saw seats being allotted to candidates with such scores.An MS orthopaedics seat at a govt institute in Rohtak was allotted to a candidate with just 4 marks out of 800, while obstetrics and gynaecology at a premier Delhi medical college went to a candidate who scored 44 marks. A general surgery seat was filled at 47 marks.This signals a serious breakdown in medical education and workforce planning,” said a senior faculty member at a govt medical college. “Orthopaedics has traditionally been among the most demanding surgical specialties. Filling it at near-zero scores is a sign not of weaker students but a system under severe strain.”This happened following the sharp lowering of NEET-PG qualifying standards by Union health ministry for the 2025–26 academic session, with drastically reduced cut-offs across categories allowing candidates with extremely low — and even negative — scores to qualify.The effect was visible across disciplines. Seats were filled at 10 marks in transfusion medicine, 11 marks in anatomy, and minus 8 marks in biochemistry, many under reserved and PwD categories. While the revised cut-offs ensured that seats did not remain vacant, doctors warn the policy risks trading competence for convenience.“Allowing surgical and clinical branches to be filled at zero or near-zero percentile represents a serious erosion of standards,” said a senior doctor at a govt medical college. “Marks as low as 4, 11, 44 or 47 out of 800 point to a lack of basic aptitude. Removing cut-offs altogether directly risks patient safety.”The current policy marks a sharp shift from govt’s earlier stand. In July 2022, opposing a plea to lower NEET-PG cut-offs in Delhi HC, Centre had argued that minimum qualifying percentiles were essential to maintain education standards. The court agreed, warning that lowering medical education standards could “wreak havoc on society”, as medicine involved matters of life and death.Defending the present framework, a senior health ministry official said PG seats are allotted strictly under revised eligibility rules, and competence is intended to be ensured through training and exit exams, not entry cut-offs alone. Colleges are certified by regulators and are responsible for failing unsuitable candidates, the official said.Medical educators, however, say the trend reflects deeper structural problems — rapid seat expansion without a matching rise in trained faculty, overcrowded classrooms and eroding bedside skills. “Without strong faculty, robust exit exams and a system to weed out unsuitable candidates, anyone who enters medicine eventually gets a degree,” said a senior academician.Faculty members say the consequences are already visible. Many postgraduate students arrive without strong theoretical foundations, clinical skills or discipline. Pressure to pass students, weak exit mechanisms and over-reliance on online learning have further diluted training quality.“Easy entry has reduced seriousness even at top institutions,” said another doctor on condition of anonymity. “Numbers are rising, but training quality is falling — and that poses long-term risks to patient care.”Doctors caution that the branch of medicine does not reveal its failures immediately. Gaps in training today may surface years later, when these doctors practise independently — with serious implications for patient safety and public trust in the healthcare system.","St steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores.

New Income Tax Rules 2026 likely to be notified in March: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/new-income-tax-rules-2026-likely-to-be-notified-in-march-report/articleshow/128111047.cms,"Budget 2026 Brings New Income Tax Act From April With No Slab Change But Major Compliance Reset

The Income Tax Department is likely to notify the draft Income Tax Rules, 2026 and the accompanying forms in the first week of March, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) sources told ET.The new rules are aligned with the Income Tax Act, 2025, which is scheduled to come into force from April 1, 2026, and will replace the existing Income Tax Rules, 1962. Once notified and approved by Parliament, the Income Tax Rules, 2026 will be applicable from the same date.The department had earlier released draft rules and forms as part of the transition to the new Income Tax Act, aimed at simplifying compliance and aligning procedural provisions with the updated law.Sources said revisions related to perquisites under the new framework will be applicable under both the old and the new tax regimes, offering relief across categories of taxpayers.The notification of the rules is seen as a key step in operationalising the Income Tax Act, 2025, ahead of its scheduled rollout from the next financial year starting April 1, 2026.The draft rules and forms will remain in the public domain for 15 days, until February 22, 2026. The Income Tax Department had invited stakeholders and members of the public to examine the draft framework and submit feedback, saying the consultative process is aimed at making the framing of subordinate legislation more participative and effective.According to the department, the drafting of the new Income-tax Rules and forms follows the same philosophy as the Income Tax Act, 2025, with a focus on simplification and clarity. The language of the rules has been simplified wherever possible, with formulas and tables introduced to improve understanding, while efforts have been made to eliminate redundancies present in the existing Income-tax Rules, 1961.While the broader policy framework has been retained, the department said selective changes have been introduced to align the rules and forms with provisions of the Income Tax Act, 2025.The tax forms included in the draft rules have also been significantly simplified to ease compliance for taxpayers. Common information has been standardised across forms to reduce duplication and lower the compliance burden.The department said the redesigned forms incorporate features such as automated reconciliation and pre-fill capabilities, making tax filing more intuitive and less prone to errors. It added that the use of smart forms would facilitate centralised processing and data-driven decision-making, enabling improved taxpayer services.Officials said the language used in the forms and accompanying notes has been simplified to avoid operational, administrative and legal ambiguity, further enhancing the overall taxpayer experience.","The Income Tax Department is likely to notify the draft Income Tax Rules, 2026 and the accompanying forms in the first week of March.

HYDERABAD: At a time when a knife attack that left four Indian students injured in Russia has put the spotlight on the challenges faced by them in the country, latest external affairs ministry data shows that over 50% of all complaints of exploitation and racial discrimination reported by Indian students globally originate from Russia, with Moscow emerging as the biggest hotspot.As per the data, Indian students across 196 countries registered around 350 complaints of exploitation, harassment and racial discrimination in 2025. Of these, more than 200 came from Russia alone.What has raised serious concern is the steep rise in such cases over the past three years - from 68 complaints in 2023 to 78 in 2024, before surging to 201 in 2025. The majority of Indian medical students in Russia belong to states such as Rajasthan , Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh , Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. While Russia remains one of the most popular destinations for Indian students, particularly those pursuing medical education, due to relatively lower tuition fees and easier admission processes, the sharp increase in complaints has triggered serious safety concerns.Students in Russia whom TOI spoke to said they are routinely discriminated against by students from other countries, with some even alleging mental harassment by universities themselves, including threats of expulsion over minor issues or violations. They said many of their grievances never reach official channels due to fear of retaliation from varsities or complications related to visas and immigration.""During my sixth year, a group of foreign students attacked Indian students in the hostel kitchen over a minor argument and threatened them with a knife,"" said Kanishka K, a graduate from Bashkir State Medical University, Moscow. He reiterated that ""many such incidents are never reported because students are scared of being targeted or expelled"".Members of Foreign Medical Graduates associations admitted to widespread racial profiling, verbal abuse and a lack of institutional support for Indian students in Russia. ""Complaints are rarely taken seriously. Students suffer in silence as universities often sideline them,"" said D Kaushal, coordinator of All FMGs.He further claimed that while Russian regulations limit foreign intake to around 200 students per institution, some universities admit over 1,200 students and later expel them, sometimes even in sixth year, in violation of norms. ""Such expulsions leave students in severe financial and psychological distress,"" he said.Owing to the deteriorating situation, FMGs say many Indian students are now opting for Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan instead. ""The number of Indian students choosing Russia has declined significantly, by at least 50%, in recent years due to these issues. Moreover, since the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, Indian students have shown declining interest in pursuing MBBS in Russia because of safety concerns and academic uncertainty,"" said Manoj Kumar, president of the FMGs Association of India.Meanwhile, replying to a recent LS query on Indian workers and students facing exploitation, detention, wage denial and racial discrimination abroad, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said dedicated officers have been posted in Indian missions and posts overseas to handle education and student welfare-related matters.""Our missions maintain regular contact with Indian students enrolled abroad and brief them on challenges and threats, if any, that they may confront during their stay there. Heads of missions and senior embassy officers visit foreign educational institutions in their respective countries of accreditation to interact with Indian students and students' associations,"" he said.","Over 50% of all complaints of exploitation and racial discrimination reported by Indian students globally originate from Russia.

We will take a final call with respect to the power of EC in this regard. Before doing so, we are giving the DGP an opportunity to file an explanation.""It was solicitor general Tushar Mehta who flagged the serious allegations in the EC affidavit detailing deliberate non-cooperation and inaction of the state govt coupled with an obstructionist stance and threats of violence given by TMC functionaries against EC officials.""A strong message must go that the Constitution applies in equal vigour to all states. Constitutional post holders cannot threaten EC officials,"" he said.EC counsel D S Naidu told the court that the state govt was not cooperating with it and not heeding its recommendations to act against state officials who committed illegal acts while under deputation to the commission for SIR work.While asking Pant to verify EC's allegations, SC said, ""EC shall be at liberty to replace the state govt officials on deputation for the SIR work but are not performing or acting contrary to instructions.""In its affidavit, EC said, ""While SIR is underway in 12 states, a controversy of the present nature where the ruling party in the state is actively involved in causing obstruction and issuing threats to officials is confined only to West Bengal.""""The material placed on record discloses that, through proper planning and concerted action, deliberate and systematic attempts are being made to derail, paralyse and frustrate SIR in West Bengal... Regrettably, this confederacy is not confined to fringe elements. The actions demonstrate complicity of all key actors of the State, including the govt, certain elected representatives of the ruling party, and party functionaries. Every trick in the armoury is being employed to ensure that the SIR process is either stopped or frustrated by fair or foul means,"" it said.","EC alleges that governing party TMC functionaries were making systematic, deliberate and concerted attempts to ""derail, paralyse and frustrate"" the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. EC also asks Manoj Pant, the former chief secretary-turned principal secretary to CM Mamata Banerjee, to verify whether prompt action was taken based on EC's complaint.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128130069,imgsize-1023316,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

We are not going to regulate internal mechanism of EC: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said Monday it would under no circumstance allow stalling of special intensive revision (SIR) of voter rolls in 12 states but said it was open to suggestions to ensure genuine voters are not left out, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The CJI-led bench extended by a week the Feb 7 deadline for submission of documents by voters issued notice by EC, including 1.36 crore voters categorised under 'logical discrepancy'. It also sought a personal affidavit from the Bengal DGP on EC's charge of TMC functionaries making attempts to derail SIR. ""We hope the state remembers the laws of the land,"" it said.The bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria, which had heard West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee passionately argue for discontinuing SIR, frowned upon the state govt for not providing the names of 8,500 group B cadre officials to EC for assisting electoral revision officers (EROs) and assistant EROs in the massive document verification work. The displeasure had a dramatic effect as the West Bengal govt provided the list within minutes to EC in the court and said it would verify the suitability of the officials.The court also dismissed the fear expressed by Banerjee’s counsel Shyam Divan who told the bench that the process adopted by EC would lead to mass exclusion of voters given the fact that 50% of the cases of voters facing “logical discrepancy” scrutiny are misspelling of names, which happened due to translation errors.“This is a speculative apprehension,” the bench said, and allayed it by saying suitable officials, inducted by EC from among the 8,500 officers provided by the state govt, would assist the EROs and AEROs about the cases where notices have been issued merely because of spelling errors in names and facilitate their inclusion in voter lists.Though the Bengal govt, represented by a battery of senior advocates, vehemently argued against engagement of micro-observers drawn from central PSUs and the Union govt, the bench said the micro-observers along with the additional hands provided by the state govt would help the EROS and AEROs even though the the final decision on inclusion or deletion of voters from the final list would be taken by the EROs only.Since the Feb 7 deadline for document submission, its scrutiny and hearing period is extended by one week, the scheduled publication of the final voter list on Feb 14 is likely to be extended by one more week, that is to Feb 21.Advocate Kalyan Banerjee alleged that thousands of anonymous complaints against inclusion of names in voter lists have been filed and have been entertained by EC even as the rules and regulations mandate that person filing complaint must remain present during the hearing.The bench said, “We are not going to regulate the internal mechanism of EC in dealing with such issues.” Senior advocate V Giri, appearing for Sanatani Sangsad, alleged that there is widespread violence and open threats being given to EC officials to derail the SIR work.“Thousands of objections to names in voter lists were burnt,” Giri said and requested the bench to allow filing of fresh objections during the extended period for filing documents.For West Bengal, Menaka Guruswamy told the bench that the organisation is managing temples and wondered how a temple management organisation would have locus standi to file such an application.","The CJI-led bench extended by a week the Feb 7 deadline for submission of documents by voters issued notice by EC, including 1.36 crore voters categorised under 'logical discrepancy' It also sought a personal affidavit from the Bengal DGP on EC's charge of TMC functionaries making attempts to derail SIR.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128130773,imgsize-1215860,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The Speaker can be removed by a resolution passed by the LS under Article 94(c) of the Constitution, and the resolution requires a 14-day notice.Sources said another meeting of the opposition parties has been called on Tuesday morning to take a final view on the matter, especially about the timing.Unfazed, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju made light of the opposition's plan, saying it lacks the numbers to carry the resolution.A possible resolution to the extreme step could be the Speaker's view on the opposition's demands Tuesday. Rahul along with T R Baalu, Akhilesh Yadav and Abhishek Banerjee met Birla after the House was adjourned prematurely amid protests Monday. The opposition grievances include lack of action against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey for his remarks, suspension of opposition members, and claim that women MPs posed a threat to the PM.As the India bloc partners gathered to discuss the strategy for Parliament in the wake of logjam in LS over repeated refusal of permission to speak to LoP Rahul Gandhi, sources said a senior Congress neta proposed a ""no confidence"" resolution against the Speaker.It elicited a nod from the gathering. However, TMC MP Shatabdi Roy reportedly said she would have to consult party supremo Mamata Banerjee before a reply. It was also proposed by TMC that the Speaker be first given a letter listing the grievances. However, ""it did not say no to the proposal once it was accepted"", a opposition neta pointed out. The meeting was attended by Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Ramgopal Yadav and Dharmendra Yadav (SP), John Brittas (CPM), N K Premachandran (RSP), T R Baalu (DMK), Sanjay Raut (Shiv Sena), K C Venugopal, Kodikunnil Suresh and Manickam Tagore (Congress), Mian Altaf (National Conference). NCP was not present.Sources said the notice with over 100 signatures was still to be signed by Trinamool and SP till the evening.It may be noted that the opposition discussed a no-confidence against then Chairman of RS Jagdeep Dhankhar for many months, but the issue came to fruition much later.Sources said while the matter was intensely discussed in the morning, a possible resolution was not ruled out. However, after Rahul was refused permission to speak at 12pm, a quick consultation among opposition parties ensued which reinforced the plan.","The opposition is seriously mulling a notice to seek the removal of Speaker Om Birla as the Chair of Lok Sabha.

BENGALURU: Isro, which has been analysing the data from the failed PSLV-C62 from Jan 12, is expected to formally constitute a Failure Analysis Committee (FAC) to investigate the causes for the mishap and recommend corrective measures soon.It has been nearly a month since the failure, the second for PSLV in as many attempts, and so far, the analysis has been done by an expert committee that is being called “data analysis committee” or DAC internally, multiple sources confirmed to TOI.Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI: “The expert committee is analysing the data,” without elaborating further. The DAC’s task, one scientist said, was to analyse telemetry, ground station records, log books and process documents, and place them on a single timeline before any higher-level inquiry begins.To do this, another scientist said that the DAC has about around six minutes of flight information, recorded at intervals as fine as two milliseconds. He described this as a large amount of material that could reveal the health of the vehicle up to the moment of the anomaly.Isro has not indicated a timeline for the next PSLV launch — built by the HAL-L&T consortium — which was initially expected in the first quarter of this calendar year.Multiple sources confirmed that the mission has been put on hold until the analysis of the PSLV-C62 failure is complete.“The committee [DAC] is in the final leg of its analysis and once it completes the process, the FAC will be formally set up. This could happen very soon, in just a few days,” one source said. Unlike the DAC, which is being headed for a former Isro chairman and comprises internal teams, the FAC will comprise experts from outside the Department of Space (DoS) too.Aside from analysing the data from the PSLV-C62 mission to determine what exactly occurred during the mission, the DAC’s second priority, the scientist said, was to check for any link with the previous failure (PSLV-C61 from May 2025), followed by a complete review of the 33-year-old PSLV vehicle.“Having two repeated failures, it is essential to revisit the entire PSLV once again,” the scientist said. He added that the role of the DAC was to provide all the information that the FAC may require to carry out its analysis.“There will be data from telemetry, ground station, tracking data, other information about processes and tests, all of which need to be analysed and presented properly for the FAC to begin work,” the scientist said.While Isro has not formally said that the launches of other launch vehicles, the agency has been carrying out stringent reviews ahead of all planned missions. As reported by TOI last week, it is gearing up for a GSLV mission, while the planned SSLV mission is said to be put on hold given that its second stage is the same as the PSLV’s third stage (PS3).On Jan 12, after a normal lift-off and second stage performance, the PSLV-C62 suffered a glitch in PS3, which led to the failure. “...Close to the end of the third stage, we saw little more disturbance in the vehicle roll rates and subsequently there was a deviation in the flight path. We are analysing the data and we shall come back at the earliest,” Narayanan had said soon after.","Isro is expected to formally constitute a Failure Analysis Committee (FAC) to investigate the causes for the mishap and recommend corrective measures soon.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said banks must devise an AI-based mechanism to flag all suspicious transaction from an account, issue alerts, and suspend the transfer until the transaction is authenticated with the account holder.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria said the home ministry has flagged the alarming siphoning of nearly Rs 52,000cr between April 2021 and Nov 2025 through online fraud, including ""digital arrest"". The bench said the banks' IT applications devised for seamless transactions cannot be only profit-oriented and must be equipped to detect unusual transactions and verify genuineness.The direction comes against the backdrop of growing number of instances where bank personnel failed to act despite unusually large withdrawls from accounts of senior citizens who had long banked with them.Attorney general (AG) R Venkataramani said RBI has devised an SOP for banks to thwart cyber frauds. The bench asked the ministry to examine the SOP and notify them for pan-India implementation. Justice Bagchi said, “In the over-anxiety of making profits, banks must realise they are trustees of public money.People have deposited their monies in banks because they trust them. These banks are becoming a huge liability to the public. ” The CJI said that the courts are becoming recovery agents for the banks, whose officials, in collusion with industrialists, grant huge loans recklessly and then use NCLAT and other tribunals to recover money.The attorney general said the home ministry has constituted a high-level inter-departmental committee to comprehensively examine all facets related to ‘digital arrest’. The committee will work under the chairmanship of special secretary in the ministry. The court asked RBI to discharge its duties as the regulator of banking sector to ensure security of hard-earned money of retired people. “The problem is banks are more into business mode, and naturally so, and in doing that, they are becoming, either innocently or connivingly, platforms through which there is a swift and seamless transmission of stolen proceeds of crime,” bench said.","Banks must devise an AI-based mechanism to flag all suspicious transaction from an account.

Two decades of sat data show gradual dip in Uttarakhand hills green cover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-decades-of-sat-data-show-gradual-dip-in-uttarakhand-hills-green-cover/articleshow/128129466.cms,"BENGALURU: Satellites watching the sweep of the Himalayas have begun to read the mountains like a slow-moving diary. Grasslands revive with the seasons, forests deepen in colour, and valley flora shifts its pattern, yet the same images also carry warnings of strain. An analysis of two-decade data of Uttarakhand’s vegetation shows how closely the region responds to climate and how those rhythms are starting to falter.Mountain ecosystems react faster than most landscapes to changes in temperature and rainfall. Rising global surface temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are already influencing plant growth, soil moisture, and snow cover. Scientists say this makes local and long-term monitoring essential if govts are to prepare for floods, droughts, and biodiversity loss.To track these changes, researchers from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) in Nainital, an autonomous institute under the department of science and technology (DST), worked with Indian and international collaborators using Google Earth Engine, or GEE, a platform that processes large volumes of satellite data.The tool allows scientists to study land degradation, urban growth, dust movement, and temperature trends without the heavy burden of storing raw images.The team examined satellite records from 2001 to 2022 and relied on a widely used indicator called the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The index measures how plants reflect light and provides a simple guide to their health. Low NDVI values point to rock, sand, water, or snow, while higher values signal dense forests, croplands, or wetlands. The researchers also studied the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which performs better in areas with thick biomass.Their findings of the study led by Umesh Dumka from ARIES, published in the journal “Environmental Monitoring and Assessment”, reveal clear seasonal cycles. NDVI and EVI peak after the monsoon when hills turn lush, and fall to their lowest levels before the rains. Monthly and yearly variations follow a familiar pattern, yet the long-term graphs show a gradual decline.The study links this drop to deforestation, expanding agriculture, illegal logging, and rising pollution from towns and industries. Pollution, the researchers note, does not strike evenly. Some pockets suffer heavier damage, adding to the stress created by warming temperatures and erratic rainfall. Such pressures threaten wildlife habitats, river systems, and the livelihoods of millions who depend on the mountains downstream.Using time-series maps generated through GEE, the scientists compared vegetation trends with climate data and applied Pearson’s correlation to understand their relationship. The approach allowed them to pinpoint districts where greenery has weakened most sharply.The authors argue that satellite science can serve as an early-warning system. By identifying vulnerable zones, authorities can plan afforestation, regulate construction, and control emissions before losses become irreversible. The Himalayas, they say, are signalling distress in a language of pixels and numbers. Listening to that message may decide how resilient the region remains in the decades ahead.","Mountain ecosystems react faster than most landscapes to changes in temperature and rainfall.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has doubled down on his charge that PM Modi's safety faced a threat from opposition MPs in LS if he were to reply on Feb 4 to the motion of thanks on the President's address, refuting opposition parties' claim that his advice to Modi to call off his speech was devoid of merit and that there was no threat to him.While ""grave and unprecedented"" disorder unfolded in LS as the scheduled time of Modi's reply approached, several opposition MPs visited Birla's chamber where they resorted to using unparliamentary language and threatening remarks, including ""dekhte hain PM ka kya karte hain (let's see how they handle PM's address)"", LS secretariat sources said.Such conduct was wholly unbecoming of MPs and further underscored the volatility of the situation prevailing that day, they said.Inside LS, situation had worsened rapidly as some opposition MPs climbed onto tables, tore official papers, and hurled them towards the Chair, they said. ""These acts signified a breakdown of discipline and constituted one of the most unfortunate and undesirable episodes witnessed in LS, drawing widespread attention and concern both within the House and beyond, in India and abroad.""Amid these dramatic scenes in the House, several women MPs moved aggressively towards the designated seat of Modi and virtually cordoned it, they noted, recalling that some of them moved further along the treasury benches carrying banners and placards, adopting an ""openly confrontational"" posture.""They not only laid siege to the Prime Minister's seat but also advanced deep into the treasury benches, encroaching upon the space where senior ministers were seated, heightening the sense of disorder and insecurity within the House,"" they said.In view of this sequence of events, Birla had genuine and well-founded concerns regarding Modi's safety and the maintenance of order in the House, they said, stressing that this prompted him to advise Modi not to enter LS.",Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has doubled down on his charge that PM Modi's safety faced a threat from opposition MPs in LS.

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha discussion on the Budget continued to be mired in the standoff between govt and the opposition, with LoP Rahul Gandhi 's insistence on being allowed to raise a few issues and govt's refusal to heed his plea stalling the transaction of business for the sixth consecutive day on Monday. Amid the standoff, opposition netas Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav accused the govt of avoiding a discussion on the Budget because it feared questions about the Indo-US trade deal and its impact on farmers, even as BJP claimed the opposition did not want the budget debated.Rahul, SP's Akhilesh, TMC's Abhishek Banerjee and DMK's T R Baalu met the Speaker to find a solution to the logjam after the House was adjourned for the day. Later, Rahul said he would be allowed to raise some issues on Tuesday, after which the Budget would be discussed. Opposition is also seeking revocation of suspension of its MPs.On Monday, when presiding officer Sandhya Roy did not allow Rahul to speak and called Shashi Tharoor to start the Budget discussion, the opposition raised a protest. Rahul said the Speaker had committed that he would be allowed to speak and the Chair was going back on its word.But parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju contested his claim as ""not being 100% correct"". Rijiju said he was present in the meeting of the Speaker and K C Venugopal, and it was decided that Rahul should spell out the issues he wanted to raise so that if he made any allegations against the Speaker, the latter could reply. ""There was no commitment that only the LoP would be allowed to speak,"" he said.Rahul told reporters that his issues include not allowing the LoP and the opposition to speak on the motion of thanks while a BJP MP was allowed to speak ""wild stuff"", and suspension of MPs. He said the opposition is disturbed by the ""idea floated"" that the PM faced a threat inside LS. ""The PM was scared of coming to the House not because of members, but because of what I was saying,"" he said, referring to his announcement Wednesday that he would give the book of Army chief M M Naravane on Chinese aggression to the PM if he came to the House. Meanwhile, the opposition walked out of RS after Chairman C P Radhakrishnan did not allow LoP Mallikarjun Kharge to talk about Rahul not being allowed to speak in the LS.Casting doubts about the govt's intent to run the House, Akhilesh and Rahul said the opposition is keen on a discussion because of ""dheel"" in the trade deal given by govt to US.",LoP Rahul Gandhi's insistence on being allowed to raise a few issues and govt's refusal to heed his plea stalling the transaction of business for the sixth consecutive day.

JAMMU: PDP slammed J&K’s Omar Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) govt on Monday for tapping the Centre’s Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI), calling it the “most dangerous scheme” after the abrogation of Article 370.The scheme provides 50-year interest-free loans for capital investments and infrastructure, besides offering financial incentives for reforms in key sectors.Speaking during the assembly’s budget session, PDP legislator Waheed Parra accused NC of betraying its mandate. “Why are you taking loans under this scheme? Who will repay these loans after 50 years?” Parra asked CM Omar, who was present in the House, in an emotional speech.Omar had in his budget speech last week revealed that J&K was brought under SASCI last year, saying his govt had “proactively leveraged this new opportunity”. “This reflects the confidence of Govt of India in reform orientation, financial discipline, and execution capacity of J&K,” Omar had said.However, Parra questioned SASCI’s benefits, pointing out that unlike the earlier MGNREGA rural job scheme, these funds are not a grant but a “market loan”.“If you are constructing roads, bridges and playgrounds under SASCI, you are effectively putting J&K under mortgage. You are putting J&K on sale. SASCI means destruction of J&K and you have brought it without consultation,” Parra argued, his voice getting louder and riling NC members.The Pulwama MLA urged Omar to allow a debate on the scheme. “It is a death trap. It (problems from similar loan schemes) happened in Bangladesh and Pakistan. We are selling J&K for petty loans. Who will repay this loan after 50 years, and who gives loans for free?” Parra asked.Parra went further with his criticism of the scheme. “BJP is not your alliance partner. So, on whose behest you are bringing this? Why are you taking a Rs 50,000-crore loan for free?” he asked.Later, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather ordered an inquiry into whether Parra had used an additional microphone to amplify his voice, which Omar and NC members claimed kept getting louder.","J&K's Omar Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) govt tapped Centre's Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) PDP legislator Waheed Parra accused NC of betraying its mandate.

Effort To Protect Assam’s Identity, Says Himanta Defending ‘Miyan’ Remark

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday said he was ready to be arrested after AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi filed a police complaint against him over a now-deleted Assam BJP's controversial video.The BJP leader also said he didn't know anything about the video, adding that he would continue to oppose Bangladeshi infiltrators.""I am ready to go to jail, what can I do?

""I have lodged an official complaint with @CPHydCity demanding criminal action against Himanta Sarma for his (now deleted) violent video showing him shooting Muslims. Unfortunately, genocidal hate speech has become a norm.He also attached a copy of the complaint, stating that the imagery and phrases used in the video, including ""Point blank shot"" and ""No Mercy,"" were intended to outrage religious feelings, promote communal hatred, and incite violence.According to the complaint, the video was uploaded on February 7 from the official X account of the Assam BJP and was taken down a day later, though it continues to circulate on social media. Owaisi argued that law enforcement agencies are constitutionally bound to act suo motu in cases of hate speech, even without a formal complaint.Owaisi also raised the issue during a public rally in Zaheerabad on Sunday while campaigning for the Telangana municipal elections scheduled for February 11. Shifting focus from local civic issues to what he described as a national crisis of dignity, Owaisi accused the BJP of spreading communal hatred and urged voters to strengthen AIMIM as an antidote to communalism.Addressing supporters, Owaisi highlighted AIMIM's relief work during incidents such as the Jainoor violence and the Medak town clashes, alleging inaction by both the Congress and BRS governments. He said municipal elections were crucial for everyday governance and appealed to voters to back AIMIM candidates for inclusive development and effective grassroots leadership.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma says he is ready to be arrested.

‘Can’t Stay Two Days In Delhi’: Gadkari On Severe Pollution, Transport Sector Role

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta on Monday said pollution control requires sustained, year-round action, inaugurating six new Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (CAAQMS) stations to expand real-time tracking of air quality across the capital.She also flagged off 100 'Vayu Rakshak' vehicles for stricter monitoring, and enforcement of pollution control norms.Addressing an event at the Delhi Secretariat, Gupta said the government is working towards comprehensive citywide monitoring and long-term policy action to address pollution at its source.""Our aim is to ensure that for every 25 sq km area in Delhi, there is at least one air quality monitoring station so that we get complete and accurate data on pollution levels and their sources,"" she said.The six new monitoring stations set up by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) are located at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Indira Gandhi National Open University, Netaji Subhas University of Technology West Campus (Dwarka), CWD Akshardham, Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Delhi Cantt and the Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee Swimming Pool Complex at Talkatora Garden.Gupta said Delhi currently has 46 air quality monitoring stations, and 14 additional stations will be installed in the coming phase to ensure full coverage of residential areas, industrial zones, traffic corridors and green belts.""Pollution is not a seasonal problem. It requires 365-day caretaking, continuous monitoring and sustained action,"" she said, adding that air safety officers will be deployed for year-round supervision and enforcement.The chief minister asserted that the government is working on strengthening pollution control across sectors, including transport, roads, waste management and green cover. ""Clean air is a right, and we are committed to delivering it with seriousness and long-term planning,"" she said.Highlighting the works undertaken, she said city has the highest number of electric buses in the country, with 4,200 vehicles currently operational. ""By 2028, this number will increase to 14,000, which will significantly reduce vehicular emissions,"" she said.Gupta stressed that the pollution checking infrastructure is being upgraded, with automated vehicle testing stations being developed and a new electric vehicle policy for private vehicles under preparation.She described notification of large parts of the Delhi Ridge as forest land as a historic step. She said protecting green spaces is essential for improving Delhi's environmental health and ensuring long-term sustainability.Criticising previous approaches, Gupta said earlier governments treated pollution as a short-term issue. Referring to measures such as smoke towers and odd-even schemes, she said these were ""cosmetic solutions"" that failed to address pollution at its root.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who also addressed the event, outlined further steps being taken by the government to strengthen pollution control and enforcement.""To ensure strict monitoring, 100 'Vayu Rakshak' vehicles will be deployed across Delhi to check industrial, vehicular, hotel and institutional pollution,"" Sirsa said, adding that 100 permanent surveyors will also be appointed for year-round physical inspections.He said the government has strengthened coordination among the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), CAQM and the Centre, leading to systematic monitoring and data-based policy planning.Sirsa asserted that Delhi has also made progress in waste management, with around 85 per cent of the city's daily waste generation, around 12,500 metric tonnes, now being processed for energy production.Referring to legacy waste, he said the present government inherited three garbage dumps spread over 202 acres and about 60 metres high.""In just one year, garbage has been cleared from around 45 acres, and the height of the remaining dumps is being reduced,"" he said.He also alleged that previous governments failed to address the core causes of pollution and instead resorted to blame-shifting.""Everyone knows the reasons are road dust, vehicle emissions and garbage mountains but no serious work was done,"" Sirsa said.","Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta says pollution control requires sustained, year-round action.

Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla Likely To Face No-Confidence Motion After Naravane Memoir Row

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Monday registered an FIR over the circulation of an unpublished book of ex-Chief of Army Staff General Naravane on social media, cops told news agency PTI.A row erupted over General Naravane’s book after Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi cited excerpts from the former Army chief’s unpublished memoir and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ""not fulfilling responsibility"" during the 2020 India-China military clashes in Ladakh.Speaking to reporters outside the Parliament the Congress leader said, “The speaker is saying that this book does not exist, Rajnath ji has said this book does not exist. This is Naravane ji's book wherein he has written the account of Ladakh...Narendra Modi ji did not fulfil his responsibility.”Rahul Gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be-published Naravane's book shone the spotlight on the rules and regulations that restrict senior military officials from revealing classified information or crucial leadership decisions even after retirement.Meanwhile, Penguin Random House, which holds the publishing rights, said the book has ""not gone into publication. No copies of the book - in print or digital form - have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public"" by them.""In light of recent public discourse and media reporting, Penguin Random House India would like to clarify that we hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny, a memoir by General Manoj Mukund Naravane, former Chief of the Indian Army.

There are chances that if the memoir is published, it could “flare up” the LAC situation with China.In May-June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops engaged in violent face-offs along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and Sikkim, most notably during the June 15, 2020, clash in Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers. There were casualties on the Chinese side as well. This marked the deadliest confrontation in decades, leading to major troop escalations.Under the then General Naravane’s command, India and China held a series of ground-level talks that led to “disengagement” in a phased manner from the stand-off areas. As of today, the situation along LAC is characterised by a “thaw” following a series of disengagement agreements, yet high-level military forward deployment from both sides persists.",Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of an unpublished book of ex-Chief of Army Staff General Naravane on social media.

Preserving Bastar’s culture and heritage

Centre confident of meeting March deadline

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said Maoism has never benefited any society and has only caused destruction wherever it existed, citing countries such as Colombia, Peru and Cambodia.He reiterated that the Naxal menace would be completely eliminated from India by March 31.Addressing the closing ceremony of the three-day division-level Bastar Pandum 2026 cultural festival in Jagdalpur, Shah urged Naxalites to surrender and return to the mainstream, assuring them of respectful rehabilitation, according to news agency PTI.He said the Chhattisgarh government’s Maoist rehabilitation policy was among the most attractive in the country and appealed especially for young tribal girls still involved in the movement to lay down arms. “They must be sent for rehabilitation as their whole lives lie ahead of them,” Shah said.The home minister made it clear that while surrendered Naxalites would face no harm, armed violence would be dealt with firmly. “If someone holds weapons, the response will also be with weapons. Maoism never benefitted any society and spread destruction wherever it existed, including nations like Colombia, Peru and Cambodia,” Shah said, adding that Maoists who plant IEDs or attack schools and hospitals will not be spared.He said such acts often harm innocent tribals and children, leaving them dead or permanently disabled, and questioned the cruelty behind such violence.Shah also blamed Maoists for shutting schools for decades, leading to widespread illiteracy in the region.Shah said Bastar is now witnessing rapid development, with schools reopening, roads being built, mobile towers installed and villages getting electricity and drinking water.“It is our resolve that Bastar will become the country’s most developed tribal-dominated division within the next five years,” he said.He outlined a roadmap covering seven districts of Bastar, aiming to provide electricity to all villages by December 2027, ensure mobile connectivity everywhere, and open a post office or bank branch within every five kilometres.Paddy will be procured from tribals at Rs 3,100 per quintal, LPG cylinders provided to households and tap water connections ensured in every home, he added.With Naxalism declining, Shah said the government is promoting new tourism initiatives such as adventure tourism, homestays, canopy walks and glass bridges to strengthen Bastar’s economy. He also announced a new 118-acre industrial area to generate jobs for tribal youth.On irrigation, Shah said projects on the Indravati river would irrigate 2.75 lakh hectares in Dantewada, Bijapur and Sukma districts and generate 120 MW of electricity.Stressing that guns and explosives cannot define Bastar’s identity, Shah said its true identity lies in its culture and heritage. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to take Bastar’s culture to the rest of the country and the world.Thanking security forces including the Chhattisgarh Police, CRPF, ITBP and BSF, Shah also expressed gratitude to the families of personnel who lost their lives in anti-Naxal operations.He said President Droupadi Murmu had inaugurated the Bastar Pandum event on February 7 and agreed to invite the top three winners in all 12 disciplines to Rashtrapati Bhavan to showcase their art and dine there.The festival has expanded significantly this year, with competitions across 12 disciplines involving participants from seven districts, 1,885 gram panchayats and 32 janpad headquarters, compared to seven disciplines last year.Yersterday, Shah had said the Centre’s strategy against Left-Wing Extremism was delivering results and that Naxalism would be eradicated before March 31.After a recent security review meeting in Raipur, he said a mix of security operations, infrastructure development, disruption of Maoist funding and an effective surrender policy had weakened the insurgency.According to police data, since January 2024 more than 500 Naxalites have been killed in encounters in Chhattisgarh, around 1,900 arrested and over 2,500 surrendered, reflecting the impact of sustained operations and rehabilitation efforts.","Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said Maoism has never benefited any society and has only caused destruction wherever it existed. He reiterated that the Naxal menace would be completely eliminated from India by March 31. Shah said the government is promoting new tourism initiatives such as adventure tourism, homestays and canopy walks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128115590,imgsize-1101144,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-2026-02-09t182720.jpg"

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday informed the Supreme Court that detained climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is in “perfectly good” health and is receiving the “best possible treatment” from AIIMS, Jodhpur while in custody.Wangchuk has been lodged in a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, since September last year in connection with his alleged role in the deadly pro-statehood protests in his native Ladakh. He was detained under the National Security Act (NSA), a stringent law that permits preventive detention without formal charges or trial for up to 12 months.The Supreme Court is hearing a plea filed by Wangchuk’s wife, social entrepreneur Gitanjali Angmo, seeking a declaration that his detention is “illegal.”At the outset of the latest hearing, Justice Aravind Kumar, who is hearing the matter along with Justice PB Varale, asked Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for the Union government, whether any progress had been made on the bench’s request to review the former educationist’s detention in light of his deteriorating health.""What happened? Any progress? Has it been done?"" Justice Kumar asked Nataraj.ASG Nataraj replied, ""I will submit... Nothing has been done as of now. He is getting the best of treatment.""A counsel appearing for Wangchuk submitted that it is “high time” to reconsider his detention, as the 59-year-old continues to remain unwell.""There are issues, and it's not like you are not denying it, and he is also making a complaint of health issues. The doctor says yes, it is there, and now treatment is being provided. Admittedly, the health issue is there, and on the last day itself we made the suggestion,"" Justice Varale told Nataraj.The ASG submitted, ""So far, the health issue is concerned, he is perfectly good… Jaipur is a better place to get treatment than Ladakh. There is AIIMS in Rajasthan, whereas in Ladakh, there would have been nothing.""The bench posted the plea for further hearing on Wednesday and made it clear that no further adjournments would be granted in the matter.This followed the Supreme Court’s observation on February 4 that Wangchuk’s health report was “not good,” prompting it to ask if the Centre would consider whether his detention could be reviewed in view of his medical condition.Earlier, appearing for Angmo, senior advocate Kapil Sibal had moved an application seeking a medical examination of Wangchuk by a specialist, citing his frequent complaints of stomach pain, possibly caused by contaminated water.Pursuant to the court’s directions, Wangchuk was examined by doctors at AIIMS Jodhpur, and a medical report was subsequently submitted to the Supreme Court.Wangchuk has rejected the allegations by the Union government and the Ladakh administration that he had called for the “overthrow” of the government, akin to movements such as the Arab Spring and recent youth-led protests in neighbouring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. He has asserted that he was merely exercising his “democratic right” to criticise and protest.","Wangchuk has been lodged in a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, since September last year.

"'Absolute robbery': SC on siphoning of over Rs 54,000 crore in digital arrest cases; asks Centre to frame SoP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/absolute-robbery-sc-on-siphoning-of-over-rs-54000-crore-in-digital-fraud-cases-asks-centre-to-frame-sop/articleshow/128110194.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday termed the siphoning of over Rs 54,000 crore through digital arrests as nothing short of “robbery or dacoity” and directed the Centre to formulate a standard operating procedure (SoP) to tackle such offences.A bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and NV Anjaria, noted that the money lost to digital fraud exceeds the annual budgets of several small states.“These offences may occur due to either collusion or negligence on the part of bank officials. This necessitates prompt action by the RBI and banks,” the bench observed, according to PTI.The top court pointed out that the Reserve Bank of India has already framed an SoP requiring banks to temporarily block debit cards to prevent cyber-enabled fraud. It directed the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to examine the RBI’s SoP, along with similar protocols or decisions taken by the Department of Telecom (DoT), and prepare a draft memorandum of understanding (MoU) within four weeks to effectively address such crimes.The bench also instructed the CBI to identify cases involving digital arrests and directed the Gujarat and Delhi governments to grant sanction to the agency to proceed with investigations in these matters.Further, the Supreme Court asked the RBI, DoT, and other stakeholders to hold a joint meeting and develop a framework for compensating victims of digital arrest scams. Emphasising the need for a “pragmatic and liberal approach” in awarding compensation, the court posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks and asked authorities to submit fresh status reports before the next date.Earlier, on December 16 last year, the bench had asked the Centre to consider suggestions made by the amicus curiae on ensuring compensation for victims, while expressing concern over the massive sums siphoned out of the country by cybercriminals. On December 1, it had directed the CBI to conduct a unified pan-India probe into digital arrest cases and questioned the RBI on why artificial intelligence was not being used to trace and freeze bank accounts linked to such crimes.Digital arrest is an emerging form of cybercrime in which fraudsters impersonate law-enforcement officials, court authorities, or government personnel to intimidate victims through audio or video calls, hold them virtually hostage, and coerce them into transferring money.",The money lost to digital fraud exceeds the annual budgets of several small states.

Deepam row: Piyush Goyal Accuses MK Stalin Govt Of Targeting Hindu Traditions

‘Hard To Believe Mighty State’s Fear Of Disturbance In Peace’

What’s the deepam row?

NEW DELHI: In a long-running dispute over religious practices on the Thiruparankundram hill in Madurai, the Supreme Court on Monday refused to interfere with a Madras high court judgment that permitted lighting of the Karthigai Deepam at a hilltop stone pillar and restricted Muslim prayers at a nearby site except during Ramzan and Bakri-Id.The high court had held that Muslims have no right to conduct any prayers at the Nellithoppu site except during Ramzan and Bakri-Id. The 33 cents of land is owned by the Sikkandar Badhusha Avuliya Dargah. The high court had also ruled that animal sacrifice cannot be permitted in the area.Challenging the verdict, M. Imam Hussain, a worshipper at the Dargah, approached the apex court.A bench comprising Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice PB Varale declined to interfere, describing the high court order as balanced. Appearing for the petitioner, Advocate Prashant Bhushan submitted that there has never been a law and order problem in the area.Justice Kumar responded that had there been no law and order issue, there would not have been a meeting of the Peace Committee.""It seems to be a very very balanced order,"" Justice Kumar said and Justice Varale agreed with it, according to the Live Law.""We do not propose to interfere with the order. Without expressing any opinion on rights of the parties, the impugned order stands upheld,"" the bench observed.The ruling stems from proceedings before the Madurai Bench of the Madras high court, which had upheld a single judge’s order permitting the Thiruparankundram Murugan Temple management to light the Karthigai Deepam at the Deepathoon, a stone pillar located on one of the peaks of the Thiruparankundram hill.A division bench confirmed the earlier ruling of Justice GR Swaminathan, directing that the ceremonial lamp be lit at the Deepathoon in addition to the other customary locations during the festival.The high court observed that the district administration ought to have treated the issue as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the communities through mediation. It further held that since the hill is a protected site, any activity carried out there must strictly comply with the provisions of the relevant law.The court clarified that the lamp may be lit and the number of persons permitted can be fixed, subject to consultation with the Archaeological Survey of India. With this, the court cleared the way for continuation of the practice, dismissing objections raised against lighting the lamp at the hilltop stone pillar.Thiruparankundram hill, rising at the edge of Madurai, carries a layered religious history spanning more than two millennia. Revered as one of the six abodes of Lord Murugan, it houses the ancient Subramaniya Swamy Temple and has references in Sangam-era literature.Archaeological traces reveal Jain presence dating back over 2,300 years. By the 14th century, the hill also became associated with Sikandar Shah, whose memorial evolved into the Sikkandar Badusha Dargah. For generations, temple festivals and dargah observances unfolded in proximity, with local residents describing shared rituals and overlapping traditions rather than rigid divisions.The current dispute centres on where the Karthigai Deepam should be lit during the annual festival. Historically, the lamp was lit at the Uchipillaiyar mandapam. Petitions beginning in the 1990s sought to shift the lighting to the hilltop Deepathoon pillar. Courts had earlier declined to alter established practice.However, a fresh petition in 2024 argued that the 1920s Privy Council decree recognising temple ownership of the hill permitted lighting at the pillar.Justice G R Swaminathan allowed the hilltop lighting, triggering administrative resistance on law and order grounds and eventually escalating into a political flashpoint between the ruling DMK and the BJP, before reaching the Supreme Court.",The Supreme Court refused to interfere with a Madras high court judgment that permitted lighting of the Karthigai Deepam at a hilltop stone pillar. The high court had held that Muslims have no right to conduct any prayers at the Nellithoppu site except during Ramzan and Bakri-Id. The court also ruled that animal sacrifice cannot be permitted in the area.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128109732,imgsize-63216,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-8.jpg"

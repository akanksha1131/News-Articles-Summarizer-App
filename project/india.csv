NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishnakar on Thursday addressed the attack on Indian consulate in San Francisco, which took place in 2023, and called it a ""very serious matter"". He added that the country expected accountability from the US in the matter.""The arson attack on our consulate in San Francisco is a very, very serious matter, and it is something for which we expect accountability. We would like to see that people who did it are held responsible,"" Jaishankar said at a press conference in Washington DC.On March 19, 2023, the Consulate General of India in San Francisco faced a series of attacks. Early in the morning, assailants attempted to set the consulate building on fire by sprinkling inflammable substances.Later that day, a group of attackers engaged in criminal trespass, vandalized public property, and targeted consulate officials, escalating the severity of the incident.The video, which surfaced on social media, showed suspected pro-Khalistani protestors gathered outside the Indian Consulate, shouting slogans and heckling staff as they exited the diplomatic mission.Three months later, in July, Khalistan extremists made another attempt to set the Consulate on fire. Following this incident, an investigation was launched.The attack was condemned by the US as ""criminal offence"".Later that year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had assured the National Investigative agency that it was 'aggressively' looking into the attack."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar addressed the attack on Indian consulate in San Francisco, which took place in 2023.

Sambhal admin starts excavating centuries-old well found near Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sambhal-admin-starts-excavating-centuries-old-well-found-near-mughal-era-shahi-jama-masjid/articleshow/117470492.cms,"Excavation begins near Sambhal's Shahi Jama Masjid well

MEERUT: Sambhal district administration on Wednesday began excavating a centuries-old well located 50m from the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid in Chandausi town . The digging is part of a broader initiative to revive historical wells and pilgrimage sites across the city.Sambhal DM Rajender Pensiya told TOI, “A total of 19 wells are mentioned in the history of Sambhal district, and we have so far managed to identify 17. Over decades, these wells were sealed off and encroached upon. The well adjacent to Jama Masjid was also encroached and a cemented platform was built over it. Nine more wells were found separately during the search, making a total of 28 wells found so far, including 19 Mahakoops and 87 pilgrimage sites. The sites have been freed from encroachment . This action is being taken after receiving a complaint letter from local residents.”Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi said, “Adequate security measures have been taken and an additional superintendent of police, along with a police force and personnel from provincial armed constabulary, was present during excavation . Law and order situation is stable.”The excavation effort comes after residents highlighted the condition of wells, many of which were encroached upon or neglected over the years. Authorities are focused on restoring thehistorical structures and ensuring their preservation.ASP Shreesh Chandra said, “Legal action will follow after further investigation. According to local accounts and elderly residents, this well has existed for centuries. Further verification will be done as the excavation progresses.”Sanjay Kumar, a resident, said, “This well is situated near the Harihar temple. It used to be a place of worship where people came during auspicious occasions like childbirth or weddings. Over time, it was covered and its original form altered. The excavation will restore its historic appearance.”Shahi Jama Masjid has been at the centre of recent tensions in Sambhal. On Nov 19, a court-ordered survey began to investigate claims the mosque was built over a demolished Hindu temple. The second inspection on Nov 24 led to clashes, resulting in five deaths. Following this, SC directed that no action be taken regarding a private well located near the mosque’s entrance without its permission.","The digging is part of a broader initiative to revive historical wells and pilgrimage sites across Sambhal.

NEW DELHI: India and the US are in touch diplomatically to schedule a visit by PM Modi to the US, but there’s no clarity on how soon it could happen, govt sources said. India has to host President Donald Trump for the Quad summit this year and the timing of the first bilateral visit by Modi to the US could hinge on when India is able to host the Quad leaders.It is understood that the possibility of an early meeting between the two leaders was discussed by foreign minister S Jaishankar and US secretary of state Marco Rubio, though there was no official confirmation by either side. Trump had invited Modi to visit the US early into his first stint as president in 2017. Modi had then visited the US in June that year.Trump was reported to have told his advisors last week that he would like to soon visit both China and India. “Trump has also talked to advisers about a possible trip to India, according to people close to him,” he was reported as saying by Wall Street Journal.The two leaders could also meet as early as next month in France which is hosting the AI action summit.","India and the US are in touch diplomatically to schedule a visit by PM Modi to the US.

One of the issues secretary of state Marco Rubio raised with EAM S Jaishankar was irregular migration , underlining the Trump administration’s position on the issue. Jaishankar said India’s position on legal mobility and illegal migration has been consistent with all countries and “US is no exception”.“We have always taken the view that if there are any of our citizens who are not here legally and if you are sure that they are our citizens, we’ve always been open to their legitimate return. So, it’s not a position unique to the US. We have been consistent, we have been very principled about it and that remains our position, and I conveyed that very clearly to secretary Rubio,” Jaishankar said at a press meet. He warned against quoting numbers, saying India first has to validate that the individuals concerned are of Indian origin.During the meeting with Rubio, Jaishankar raised the issue of delay in visas for Indian nationals. He said the delay constrained people-to-people contacts that act as the very basis of the relationship. Jaishankar also said he discussed the Bangladesh situation with Rubio, but provided no details.","Jaishankar said India’s position on legal mobility and illegal migration has been consistent with all countries and ‘US is no exception’ He warned against quoting numbers, saying India first has to validate that the individuals concerned are of Indian origin.

NEW DELHI: Can the country return to elections with ballot paper? What’s the cost-benefit of one-nation-one-election (ONOE)? How many phases will be required to hold nationwide simultaneous elections and what will be the effect of model code of conduct imposed for such polls on the economy, foreign direct investment and development? How does the expenditure on polls get reduced with ONOE, particularly if 10 states were to have mid-term polls ?These are among the nearly 40 queries raised by MPs in the joint parliamentary committee studying the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024 and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, proposing simultaneous Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, followed by local body polls in the next 100 days. The questions have now been forwarded by law ministry to Election Commission for inputs, sources told TOI on Wednesday.A senior EC official told TOI that the poll panel will submit its response “in due time”. In any case, the official added, EC has fielded most of these queries in its earlier inputs to law ministry and the ONOE panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The poll panel had, during its consultations earlier with the Kovind panel, given a detailed estimate of the EVMs/VVPATs, manpower, polling stations and budget required to hold simultaneous elections, while insisting on suitable lead time to hold simultaneous polls. “We will see what more is to be shared,” said the official.Among the important questions is how expenditure on elections will get reduced with simultaneous polls. “The stress seems to be on quantifying the savings,” said an officer.Besides seeking a cost-benefit analysis, the MPs want a comparison of expenses on holding separate and simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls.An estimate of additional resources, EVMs and manpower required to hold simultaneous polls has also been sought. More pinpointed queries include the cost of simultaneous polls as a share of GDP.Inputs have also been sought from EC on an MP’s query regarding the cost of diverting govt staff for poll-related training, which starts a year ahead of polls, and election duties, and who will bear the losses on account of their absence from normal duty.Among the non-finance questions are how the municipal and panchayat polls will be tied with parliamentary and assembly polls. A commission official however said holding local body polls is not its mandate. Another query relates to whether using two EVMs in a polling station will pose a problem and what if the EVM for Lok Sabha poll and assembly poll record different voting figures; an EC official said this is the normal practice when state assembly polls are held along with general election to Lok Sabha.Yet another interesting query that the law ministry has conveyed to EC is as to why the One-Nation-One-Election Bill does not include an amendment to give model code of conduct legal sanctity, as recommended earlier by National Commission on Working of the Constitution.","Nearly 40 queries raised by MPs in joint parliamentary committee studying Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024.

deeply upset at BCCI's fresh demands

Poll Do You Support India’s Decision to Exclude Pakistan’s Name From Jerseys? No, Sports Should Be Free of Political Considerations Yes, The Team Should Represent National Pride

MUMBAI: A fresh controversy has erupted over Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan and UAE in February-March.TOI has learnt BCCI doesn't want its players to wear jerseys with the name of Pakistan, the host nation, displayed on it.BCCI is also firm that skipper Rohit Sharma won't travel to Pakistan for the captains' press conference and photo shoot.According to a BCCI source, the board has requested ICC to shift the twin events, which take place just before the tournament takes off on Feb 19, from Pakistan to Dubai.""ICC has already accommodated India's request to not schedule its CT matches in Pakistan, so these are minor issues,"" the source told TOI on Tuesday.The decision by BCCI has left the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) peeved and it is hoping for ICC's intervention in the matter.""The BCCI is bringing politics into cricket, which is not at all good for the game. They refused to travel to Pakistan. They don't want to send their captain (to Pakistan) for the opening ceremony. Now there are reports that they don't want the host nation's (Pakistan) name printed on their jerseys. We believe that the world governing body (ICC) will not let this happen and support Pakistan,"" a PCB official told IANS on condition of anonymity.As per the rules, India not wearing the official logo of the hosts, in this case Pakistan, will be a breach of ICC's official clothing code.According to the tradition of ICC tournaments, it is customary for the participating teams to feature the host nation's name on their jersey even if the tournament is being held elsewhere.For example, Pakistan's jersey during the 2021 T20 World Cup featured India's name on it despite the tournament taking place in the UAE.Also, when Pakistan participated in the 2016 T20 World Cup and 2023 ODI World Cup in India, they had the host nation's name on their jerseys.BCCI's decision will add to the ongoing tension between BCCI and PCB. The former has already refused to travel to Pakistan and India will play their fixtures in the UAE.The eight-team tournament will commence on Feb 19 and will conclude on March 9. The 15 matches in the competition will be hosted across four venues - Dubai, Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.","Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan and UAE in February-March.

At Kumbh mela, Russian, Ukrainian seers hold prayers for world peace

PRAYAGRAJ: Spirituality knows no boundaries. Despite Russia and Ukraine being embroiled in a bloody war for 1,000 days, two spiritual leaders, Swami Vishnudevananda Giriji Maharaj from Ukraine, and Ananda Lila Mata from Russia, have been giving sermons on love, peace and compassion from the same platform at the Maha Kumbh Mela.They have been conducting daily sessions at Pilot Baba’s camp in Sector 18 where devotees from various parts of the world gather to listen to their teachings. More than 70 people from Ukraine and Russia are living together at the camp, and 100 more are expected to arrive.Their sermons often include traditional prayers and discussions about applying spirituality in daily life. And both share personal experiences from their countries while emphasising the universal nature of spiritual truth.Giriji Maharaj, formerly Valeriy, is from Kharkiv city in northeast Ukraine and now the Mahamandaleshwar of Juna Akhara. He told TOI, “My message for world peace is expressed in two words: “Loka Sangraham” (universal good) and “Arru Paddai” (universal enlightenment). We must remember the mantra ‘lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu’, which seeks the good and happiness of all living beings. Humanity lacks ‘sattva energy’. When sattva energy spreads through meditation in a society, nation and on earth, the world begins to change for the better. And the stage is set for the arrival of Satya Yuga, the Golden Age.”Ananda Mata, formerly Olga, is from Nizhny Novgorod in western Russia. “This is my fifth visit to Kumbh Mela. The first time I came here was at the invitation of Mahamandaleshwar Pilot Babaji. In 2010, I accepted the status of Mahamandaleshwar and since then I have come to almost every Kumbh Mela,” she said.“Kumbh Mela is a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in the very heart of the sadhu culture and spread the message of peace. Many saints come to the Kumbh Mela to be a part of this festival of blessings. It is also a way for thousands of people to purify their karma and their consciousness. I come here to meet my students from all over the world, to show them the culture of Sanatan Dharma, to convey the teachings of Advaita Vedanta , Shaivism, yoga, and meditation,” Ananda Mata added.“When people from Russia and Ukraine sit together in harmony it sets an example of how spiritual pursuit can unite people beyond national identities,” she said. Both Giriji Maharaj and Ananda Mata conduct special prayers for world peace and healing of nations affected by war. Their message has special resonance given the bloody conflict their countries have been engaged in, which has caused huge loss of lives on both sides and widespread destruction in Ukraine.","Two spiritual leaders from Russia and Ukraine have been giving sermons at the Maha Kumbh Mela.

Message to China: Quad opposes unilateral acts to forcibly alter status quo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/message-to-china-quad-opposes-unilateral-acts-to-forcibly-alter-status-quo/articleshow/117469337.cms,"Foreign minister S Jaishankar, flanked by counterparts Iwaya Takeshi (Japan), Marco Rubio (US) and Penny Wong (Australia), in Washington DC on Tuesday

Timing of meet shows priority member-states attach to Quad: EAM Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: Hours after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, Quad nations sent out a clear message to China in the form of a joint statement, in which their foreign ministers strongly opposed any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion.While this formulation is not new, it’s significant, coming as it does amid fears in the Indo-Pacific about the potentially erratic nature of President Trump’s foreign policy that have been exacerbated by his recent courting of his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.The Quad ministers, according to the joint statement, reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening a free and open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, democratic values , sovereignty, and territorial integrity are upheld and defended. If there was any doubt about who these messages were intended for in the first meeting of the group after Trump’s return as President, Japan laid it to rest by specifically mentioning in its own readout East and South China Seas where China’s territorial claims remain a major source of friction.“Our four nations maintain our conviction that international law, economic opportunity , peace, stability and security in all domains, including the maritime domain underpin the development and prosperity of the peoples of the Indo-Pacific,” said Quad joint statement. Significantly, it also committed to regular meetings between the foreign ministers and the proposed summit in India later this year.“We are committed to strengthening regional maritime, economic, and technology security in the face of increasing threats, as well as promoting reliable and resilient supply chains,” said the joint statement.The timing of the Quad meeting is especially significant for countries like India and Japan as it suggests the Trump administration , the President’s recent overtures for a deal with China notwithstanding, will remain committed to working jointly with other partners in a way that could blunt Chinese aggression. Jaishankar said that the timing underlined the priority that member-states attach to Quad. “The meeting today sends a clear message that in an uncertain and volatile world, Quad will continue to be a force for global good,’’ he said in a post on X. PM Narendra Modi had described Quad as a force for global good, participating in the first in-person summit in 2021.While Quad was upgraded to the summit level under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, Trump is credited with reviving the mechanism under his first term as President. The Quad officials met for the first time in 2007 but it was only in 2019, on the margins of UNGA in New York, that the foreign ministers met for the first time. Speaking on Trump’s concerns about alliances and burden-sharing, Jaishankar had said last month these don’t apply to Quad as “everybody pays their fair share’’.Quad sees itself as harnessing the collective strengths and resources of Australia, India, Japan and the US, from govts to the private sector to people-to-people relationships, to support the region’s “sustainable development, stability, and prosperity by delivering tangible benefits to the people of the Indo-Pacific”. So it’s like everybody goes for dinner and you split the bill, and everybody thinks it’s the right thing to do,’’ Jaishankar had said.",Quad nations sent out a clear message to China in the form of a joint statement.

Similar accident claimed 22 lives in Mumbai 31 years ago

NAHSIK: It was smoke that perhaps sparked rumours of a fire, which caused panicked passengers to jump out of Pushpak Express, only to be crushed under the wheels of the oncoming Karnataka Express on the adjoining track, said survivors and passengers of the Lucknow-Mumbai train who were witness to the tragedy that took place near Pachora station in Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district.The unreserved coaches of the train were packed to the hilt, and chaos ensued as soon as the train stopped. Jagmohan Paswan, a 48-year-old survivor, said: “There were many vendors in our coach. One of them shouted that a fire had broken out in a coach. Seconds later, the train stopped and everyone came rushing to squeeze out of the two doors. My relative, Uttam Paswan, too, jumped out and sustained head & leg injuries.”Paswan said those killed and injured had jumped out of the door on the right side of the coach. Uttam was among them, but survived, he said, adding those who exited from the left door, including himself, were unharmed.Sanjeev Singh, who was on his way to Shirdi, said: “We were sitting when suddenly people started screaming about a fire. There was some smoke emanating, but not from a fire. However, this caused chaos, and a few seconds later, the train pulled to a stop. I went to the door and saw people jumping out and coming under the train on the next track. I saw eight to ten bodies on the other track.”“Our coach was intact and people in AC coaches were mostly safe. I am not sure if the smoke was from pantry or braking,” he said.Md Mulin (42), whose relative Md Bilal sustained injuries in the right leg, said there was hardly any space in the coach they were travelling in. “Even the doors were blocked by passengers standing there. Suddenly, everyone rushed towards the doors.” Recounting the heart-rending sight before him on jumping out, he said: “I saw dismembered bodies on the adjacent track. I will not forget what I witnessed.”According to some survivors, the loco pilot of Karnataka Express stopped the train after seeing passengers from Pushpak Express jumping out.

Assam govt gets 6 weeks to file compliance affidavit

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the Assam government for not explaining why foreign nationals were being kept in detention centres and not being deported to their country and asked the chief secretary to appear before it through virtual mode on the next date of hearing with an explanation.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and N Kotiswar Singh said the fundamental right to life was not confined only to citizens but all people, including foreigners, and immediate steps should be taken to deport them to their country.The bench was hearing a case pertaining to 270 people in detention centres/transit camps in Assam. ""Time of six weeks was granted to the state to file compliance affidavit. We expected the state to put on record reasons for detaining 270 foreign nationals in the transit camps and details of the steps taken by the state govt for deporting the detenus,"" the bench said.Time of six weeks was granted to the state govt to file compliance affidavit. We expected the state to put on record reasons for detaining 270 foreign nationals in transit camps and details of steps taken by state govt for deporting the detenus.We find from the annexure to the affidavit that some of the foreigners are languishing in the camps for about 10 years and more. The affidavit does not give any justification for detaining 270 persons and, moreover, steps taken to deport them are not set out. This is a gross violation of orders of this court. We direct the chief secretary of Assam to remain present through VC and explain the non-compliance,” the top court said.The lawyer appearing for Assam told the bench the deportation process of illegal migrants took place through the Union govt. He said complete details of illegal migrants, including contact address, were to be provided by the state govt to the ministry of external affairs, which then verifies the identities of the migrants through diplomatic channels.Earlier, SC had directed Assam State Legal Services Authority to conduct visits at the Matia transit camp for foreigners to check the facility’s hygiene and food quality.",Supreme Court pulls up Assam government for not explaining why foreign nationals were being kept in detention centres.

BHOPAL: Actor Saif Ali Khan and other members of the Pataudi family are at risk of losing ancestral properties in MP worth several thousand crores after 94 of 131 such assets bequeathed by his great-grandfather and the last Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan , were found to be within the ambit of “enemy property” during a verification process spanning nine years.Custodian of Enemy Property for India (CEPI), which was assigned the task of identifying and assessing these properties in accordance with the Enemy Property Act of 1968, provided the status of the investigation in its Jan 3 response to an RTI query.Enemy property refers to assets left behind in India by entities who migrated to countries designated as “enemy nations” during times of conflict. In this case, the dispute stems from the heir to the Bhopal estate , Abida Sultan , relocating to Pakistan three years after Partition. The last Nawab’s properties then passed to his other daughter Sajida Sultan, whose son Mansur Ali Khan ‘Tiger’ Pataudi is Saif’s father.In 2015, CEPI sent a notice to the MP govt, vesting control of all properties of ""Gowhar-i-Taj"" Abida Sultan. Until February 2017, CEPI cited 88 immovable properties in MP as being part of the “enemy” estate. The Pataudis moved court against the notice soon after.The recent RTI reply valued the cumulative 113.6 acres of immovable assets at Rs 1,796 crore.CEPI provided details of the assessment barely three weeks after Madhya Pradesh high court instructed Saif and his mother, actor Sharmila Tagore, to approach the ministry of home affairs' appellate authority for information regarding the assets vested as ""enemy property"". The Pataudis didn't have any legal representation at the Dec 13 hearing.RTI petitioner Naresh Kadyan, who filed a query regarding the case in Aug 2023, questioned why CEPI hadn't listed the ""enemy properties"" linked to the last Nawab of Bhopal in the public domain all these years.","94 of 131 assets bequeathed by his great-grandfather and the last Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan, found to be within the ambit of “enemy property’ The dispute stems from the heir to the B hopal estate relocating to Pakistan three years after Partition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117468047,imgsize-73984,width-400,resizemode-4/117468047.jpg"

Use of Radar Technology to Overcome Cloud Cover Detailed Images of the Event Site

NEW DELHI: A radar imaging satellite operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has captured detailed images of the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj , Uttar Pradesh.The images, released by Isro, showcase the extensive infrastructure, including the layout of tent cities, roads, and numerous pontoon bridges constructed at the Sangam for the massive religious gathering.The high-resolution images were captured by EOS-04 (RISAT-1A), a ‘C’ band microwave satellite with all-weather imaging capability. Combining time-series images from 15 September 2023 (pre-event) and 29 December 2024 (infrastructure buildup), the satellite highlights the event's progressive development. Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri shared some of these images on X, saying, ""The Indian Space Research Organisation has released stunning images of the Maha Kumbh Mela as seen from space.""ISRO’s National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) in Hyderabad used the advanced radar technology to overcome cloud cover over Prayagraj and provide clear visuals. Dr Prakash Chauhan, Director of the NRSC, explained, “The radarsat was used as it could image the region through the cloud band that enveloped Prayagraj.” The Uttar Pradesh administration is reportedly leveraging these images to mitigate potential disasters and manage crowd control.Union minister of State for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh lauded the use of advanced technology at the event. ""These advanced technologies represent a paradigm shift in managing large-scale religious gatherings. The Mahakumbh Mela stands as a shining example of how technology and tradition can come together to create a cleaner, healthier future for all,"" he said.The Maha Kumbh, held every 12 years, is one of the world's largest spiritual events, attracting over 450 million devotees.

NEW DELHI: The governing BJP and opposition clashed over the plan to finalise the Waqf bill, with the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) announcing back-to-back meetings on Jan 24 and 25 to wind up its work, and the opposition demanding that the sessions be postponed by a week. BJP dubbed the opposition plea as a delaying tactic.The opposition said MPs did not get the required time to collect evidence and peruse material to finalise their arguments for a clause-by-clause discussion and for moving the amendments, and scheduling meetings just three days after the end of field tours will “defeat” the “purpose of the constitution of the JPC itself”.They demanded that the meetings be held on Jan 30-31. Opposition MPs, represented by DMK veteran A Raja, has shot off a protest letter to panel chairperson Jagdambika Pal, claiming the issue was discussed in the Lucknow JPC session on Jan 21 and he had reacted positively to their demand for postponement.Raja said rushing through the finalization of the bill without giving time to the opposition will raise doubts in the minds of people that while “secular fabrics of the Constitution embodied in its Preamble itself are endangered”, “due process in conducting JPC is not followed”.But government appeared ready to go ahead with the meetings, with BJP sources saying the report has to be submitted in the budget session. They added the bill will be passed as NDA allies have pledged their support to the final legislation.“We have held extensive consultations and a demand for extension seems a tactic to delay the tabling of the bill,” said BJP MP and JPC member Nishikant Dubey. Opposition said that since the JPC’s tours to Patna, Kolkata and Lucknow were completed on Jan 21, after which MPs dispersed to their constituencies/states, it was “strange the next dates of the sitting of the JPC were hurriedly announced without any formal discussion when the JPC was already on tour”.“The members are not in a position to recollect evidence/materials on a short notice, which are needed for moving the amendments and discussion,” Raja said. Pal said, “In the last six months, we have held 34 meetings in Delhi alone. I believe it will be a very good report... and a good law will be made to ensure that Waqf properties are used for their intended purposes.”",The governing BJP and opposition clashed over the plan to finalise the Waqf bill.

‘Some passengers pulled chain suspecting fire’

NASHIK: At least 12 passengers of Lucknow-Mumbai Pushpak Express lost their lives and 15 others were injured in an accident Wednesday evening in north Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district. They jumped from their train following rumours of a fire in one of the compartments, only to be hit by Bengaluru-New Delhi Karnataka Express coming from the opposite direction and negotiating a curve on the adjacent tracks.An official said the driver of Pushpak Express had turned on the flasher light after the train halted due to the alarm chain being pulled. The Karnataka Express driver applied brakes upon noticing the light, but a track curvature near the spot hindered visibility.“The curvature of almost two degrees obstructed visibility and reduced the distance for the drivers to apply brakes. The passengers also could not see the approaching train because of the curvature. The drivers tried their best to avert the accident,” the official said.Witnesses described scenes of chaos as people on the tracks desperately tried to move away, but many were unable to escape before the oncoming train struck them. Railways has ordered an investigation.Among the fatalities, three were women. “Fifteen passengers were injured, four of them seriously,” Jalgaon DC Ayush Prasad said. Authorities have released the names of seven deceased identified so far: Nandaram Vishwakarma (10), Lacchi Paasi (18-20 years), Kamla Bhandari (43) — all from Nepal — Imtiyaz Ali (35), Javkala Jaygaddi (50), Nasiruddin Siddiqui (18-20), & Babu Khan (27-30).The accident occurred around 4.50 pm, about 10km from Pachora station. Central Railway chief PRO Swapneel Nila said: “Suspecting a fire in one of the coaches, some passengers in general compartment pulled the chain. Panicked, some of them jumped off the train and fell on adjoining tracks.” Witnesses reported hearing a loud noise and seeing smoke before panic ensued. “There was a rumour that the train was on fire. Passengers who jumped through the right side of the compartment were run over by Karnataka Exp,” a witness said.Maharashtra govt and railway ministry announced ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh, respectively, for the families of the deceased. CM Devendra Fadnavis expressed his condolences. “Deeply saddened by the tragic loss of lives… The district administration, in close coordination with the railway authorities, is ensuring swift action for the treatment of the injured,” he added.PM Modi wrote on X, “Anguished by the tragic accident on the railway tracks in Jalgaon, Maharashtra. I extend my heartfelt condolences to bereaved families and pray for the speedy recovery of all injured. Authorities are providing all possible assistance to those affected”.Home minister Amit Shah said, “The accident in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, is extremely sad… The local administration is providing all possible help to the injured.”","At least 12 passengers of Lucknow-Mumbai Pushpak Express lost their lives and 15 others were injured in an accident Wednesday evening in north Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district.

NEW DELHI: In a move to expand emergency health services , govt has decided to establish 24x7 primary health centres (PHCs) and first referral units (FRUs) across the country.As of March 2024, 12,348 PHCs have been converted to 24x7 services and 3,133 FRUs have been made operational, govt said. The fleet of mobile medical units (MMUs) has also expanded, with 1,424 MMUs now operating to ensure healthcare access in remote and under-served areas,” said an official, while briefing about the PM Modi-chaired Cabinet meeting on Wednesday to review progress under the National Health Mission (NHM).India has over 30,000 PHCs operational. The PHCs are established to provide primary care to a population of 30,000 in rural areas and 20,000 in hilly, tribal and desert areas.Dr Vinay Agarwal, of the Indian Medical , said making the PHCs functional 24x7 was a great move as it would help people, especially those living in rural areas, access emergency health services promptly. For example, in case of snakebite, deaths occur mostly because the patient can’t reach hospital in time. If medical intervention can be assured locally, at PHCs, it will help save many lives. Similarly, for maternal and child health , such a service is going to be a big boon.” Dr Aggarwal, however, stressed the need to maintain such facilities well, in terms of availability of required manpower, medicines, and other key equipment.A key achievement of NHM, govt said, has been the increase in human resources within the healthcare sector. “In the financial year 2021-22, NHM facilitated the engagement of 2.69 lakh additional healthcare workers, including general duty medical officers, specialists, staff nurses, ANMs, AYUSH doctors, allied healthcare workers, and public health managers.”","As of March 2024, 12,348 PHCs have been converted to 24x7 services and 3,133 FRUs have been made operational.

When will the women of Manipur get justice? Whether it is the Dalit daughter of Hathras or the daughter of Unnao, or our champion female wrestler, why has BJP always protected criminals?”.With the government's flagship ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP)’ programme completing 10 years, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the initiative has been instrumental in overcoming gender biases and has created the right environment to ensure that the girl child has access to education and opportunities to achieve her dreams.Referring to the programme as a “movement”, Modi on X said over the past decade, it has become a “transformative, people-powered initiative and has drawn participation from people across all walks of life”.“Thanks to the dedicated efforts of the people and various community service organisations, ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ has achieved remarkable milestones,” he added.The PM said districts with historically low child sex ratios have reported significant improvements, and awareness campaigns have instilled a deeper sense of the importance of gender equality.","Beti Bachao initiative has helped overcome gender biases: PM Narendra Modi.

The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains, which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even when the Vande Bharat trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the Vande Bharat trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, and would meet the expectation of passengers.","The railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow Vande Bharat trains to run on this section.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

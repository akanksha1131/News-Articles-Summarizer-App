He has been selected as the pilot for Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), a private astronaut mission launching aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft no earlier than spring 2025.Shukla, a Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot, will join a crew led by former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who will serve as mission commander. He will be accompanied by two mission specialists—Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. This mission will not only send the first ISRO astronaut to the ISS but will also mark the first stay aboard the station for astronauts from Poland and Hungary.Expressing his excitement about the mission, Shukla said he hopes to share his experience with the people of India. He plans to carry cultural items from different parts of the country and even intends to perform yoga poses aboard the ISS. “Even as an individual travelling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,” he said. The mission will last up to 14 days, during which the crew will conduct scientific experiments, outreach programmes, and commercial activities in microgravity.The Ax-4 mission is part of a broader effort to expand private astronaut access to low Earth orbit. According to Dana Weigel, manager of Nasa’s ISS programme, private missions like Ax-4 help pave the way for a sustainable low Earth orbit economy, enabling future deep space exploration. Whitson also praised the dedication of the Ax-4 crew, calling their commitment to space exploration “truly remarkable.”","Shubhanshu Shukla is set to make history as the first Indian astronaut to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) He has been selected as the pilot for Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), a private astronaut mission launching aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft no earlier than spring 2025.

"Good Glamm in jam, investors exit board",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/good-glamm-in-jam-investors-exit-board/articleshow/117764632.cms,"BENGALURU: Mumbai-based unicorn Good Glamm Group became the latest startup to witness investor exits from its board, drawing attention to corporate governance issues in India's startup ecosystem. Representatives from three venture capital firms - Anand Daniel, partner at Accel Partners, Vishal Gupta, partner at Bessemer, and Gaurav Kothari, principal at Prosus Ventures - stepped down from the company's board in Dec.The board exits come amid financial challenges at Good Glamm, including fund constraints, delayed salary payments, and layoffs. ""Cheque bounces, defaults in salaries, provident funds, and TDS are all massive risks for anyone on the board of a company. In such a scenario, it is common for board members to step down to absolve themselves of legal liabilities,"" Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of proxy advisory firm InGovern, told TOI.The company, which owns a portfolio of direct-to-commerce beauty and personal care brands, had planned an IPO last year, which did not materialise. While IPO can get delayed due to market conditions, Good Glamm has been in the spotlight for its financial difficulties.Good Glamm said the board exits are part of an ongoing restructuring effort. ""At Good Glamm Group, we are in the midst of restructuring and a subsequent fundraise. As a part of our restructuring, our board is also being reconstituted and new members will be joining our board,"" the company said in a LinkedIn post on Thursday.Investor resignations from startup boards are rare and often signal governance concerns. The developments at Good Glamm mirror those at Byju's, where a series of board exits by key investors highlighted deeper structural and financial issues. This has reignited discussions on the role of investors in ensuring transparency and financial discipline in high-growth startups. As governance challenges persist, industry experts continue to debate the extent of investor responsibility in overseeing business practices and ensuring ethical leadership in India's startup landscape.","Good Glamm Group became the latest startup to witness investor exits from its board.

People should reduce intake of edible oil by 10% to cut obesity risk: PM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-should-reduce-intake-of-edible-oil-by-10-to-cut-obesity-risk-pm/articleshow/117763507.cms,"NEW DELHI: While physical inactivity, junk food and other factors have drawn a lot of attention for their role in causing lifestyle disorders, and rightly so, edible oil has mostly escaped scrutiny. PM Modi, in his address at the 38th National Games opening ceremony, focused on it and called its excessive use a key factor for rising obesity, while urging for reduced oil intake in all households.Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity. ""Every age group of the country, and even the youth, are being badly affected by it. And this is also a matter of concern because obesity increases the risk of diseases like diabetes, heart disease,"" the PM said.PM Modi appealed to people to reduce oil intake, in addition to working out daily and focusing on a balanced and nutritious diet, leading many to wonder if it was a precursor to a plan focused on tackling obesity by, among other things, discouraging high consumption of edible oil.“In our homes, ration comes at the beginning of the month. Till now, if you used to bring home two litres of cooking oil every month, then reduce it by at least 10%. Reduce the amount of oil we use every day by 10%,” Modi said.He is not alone in sounding the alarm. According to Dr Vineet Kumar Surana, consultant diabetes and endocrinology at Manipal Hospital-Dwarka, when you add excess oil in cooking, it can add hidden calories without causing fullness leading to weight gain and obesity. “One should not consume more than 600-700 ml per month, which translates to approximately 20 ml/day (equivalent to roughly four teaspoons),” he said.Fortis C-Doc chairperson Dr Anoop Misra said, “Normally, people tend to consume double the recom mended amount of oil or more.” To make matters worse, he added, many people tend to reuse oil which is dangerous. “Re-using oil for frying food items leads to an increase in trans-fats that are known to increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke among others,” he said.Apart from quantity, the quality of oil is equally important. The ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMRNIN), says though mustard oil and groundnut oil are very good for cooking, it is best to use a combination of oils either blended or by rotation. e.g. groundnut oil, soya bean oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil so that one can get the benefit of all. The PM’s call, sources said, suggests the govt is looking to initiate dedicated programmes to tackle and prevent a potential crisis posed by it.The Economic Survey 2023-24 has warned that unhealthy food and sedentary habits don’t just raise the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases and certain types of cancer but they also pose a threat to the country’s economic potential.“For India’s working-age population to be gainfully employed, they need skills and good health. Social media, screen time, sedentary habits and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that can undermine public health and productivity and diminish India’s economic potential,” the survey report said. It adds that the private sector has made substantial contributions to this toxic mix of habits, and that is myopic.It recommended Indian businesses to embrace traditional lifestyle, food and recipes. These have shown how to live healthily and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It makes commercial sense for Indian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to be led rather than tapped, the report said.","Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity.

They were stopped by the security personnel and had to wait for 90 minutes before they were finally allowed to go in. The entire search operation was recorded on video.AAP functionaries protested vehemently with Mann accusing the Election Commission of ""defaming Punjabis at the behest of BJP"" and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal alleging that opposition functionaries were being targeted while BJP netas were openly distributing cash and valuables without facing any action. BJP, on the other hand, claimed that poll officials and cops were stalled from entering to remove incriminating material.According to the poll officials, the team was responding to a complaint on cVIGIL, a platform where anyone can report violations of the model code of conduct.As per standard protocol, a flying squad team (FST) of New Delhi assembly constituency stationed nearby was assigned by the control room the task of investigating the complaint and closing it by taking appropriate action within the stipulated 100-minute timeframe,” the district election office of the New Delhi district said in a statement.In a post on X, Mann alleged that the Election Commission was not reacting to the complaints of “open distribution” of money but had conducted a raid at his house with police. “BJP members are openly distributing money, yet neither Delhi Police, nor the Election Commission seems to notice anything. No action is being taken against this…” Mann said in a post in Hindi.“I don’t understand. It’s BJP functionaries who are openly distributing money, blankets, saris, shoes, jackets, shawls, and even gold chains. Yet, the raid is happening on the chief minister of Punjab. What kind of governance is this? What did EC find during the raid? When will EC muster the courage to raid those BJP netas who are openly distributing money and goods?” Kejriwal said.While Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh charged BJP with launching a campaign to “defame Punjabis and Sikhs”, Delhi chief minister Atishi posted on X that “the people of Delhi will give their answer to BJP on the 5th (with their votes)!”AAP Punjab president and cabinet minister Aman Arora also lashed out at BJP. He wrote on X: “BJP is unable to accept the truth written on the wall about AAP's victory and their own defeat. The raid on the Delhi residence of the chief minister of Punjab, Bhagwant Mann, is next in the series of vendettas by BJP against Punjab and Punjabis, which neither the people of Punjab nor those of Delhi will tolerate.”Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva, however, claimed that by the time poll officials were allowed inside Kapurtha House, an “operation cleanup” had already taken place, and that’s why no illegal material was found. “By preventing election officials from entering Kapurthala House, Punjab Police protected Punjab’s leaders from investigation, which is both disgraceful and a blatant attack on democracy,” Sachdeva claimed.","A team of election officials, along with police, reached Kapurthala House on Thursday evening.

West Bengal professor weds student in classroom

Video circulated to malign my image: Accused prof

KOLKATA/HARINGHATA (NADIA): A video clip of a professor of a Bengal govt-funded university, apparently marrying a first-year student in a classroom earlier this month, has gone viral, raising questions of propriety and prompting the institute to order an inquiry and send the teacher on leave.Payal Banerjee , a former head of applied psychology at Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (Makaut) in Nadia's Haringhata, has said in her defence that she and the student were merely acting out a ""wedding drama"" during a freshers' welcome event. She has threatened to sue a ""jealous colleague"" for releasing the clip without context in order to defame her.TOI is not naming the student.The clip shows Banerjee in bridal finery and the student - in a green sweatshirt - enacting wedding rituals. Teachers, other staff and students cheer the couple and take selfies. The ""wedding"" also had an e-invite, which listed a haldi ceremony on Jan 9 and a mehndi and sangeet ceremony on Jan 14.Interim vice-chancellor Tapas Chakrabarty said an inquiry panel, comprising five faculty members, had been set up. But he said it was ""surprising that a video of a Jan 16 event has flooded social media on Jan 28, twelve days later.""Payal Banerjee, a former head of applied psychology at Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (Makaut), told TOI that the intention of releasing the clip now was ""to malign my image."" ""I even identified the person who did it, and I am taking help to take legal steps against the person,"" she said.The first-year student, who joined classes in Aug last year, did not respond to calls.Banerjee also claimed that the e-invite had been made by students, and that she had no role in it.She said her students had planned a cultural programme for the freshers' welcome, in which the ""wedding"" was part of a skit. ""They (the students) requested me to play the main character, and I agreed. Other faculty members knew about it and agreed to the programme; no one objected then. Students printed the card and planned the whole thing. My first-year students and I acted, following the script. This was nothing serious. I agreed only because the students requested me,"" she added.Several students defended Banerjee, saying this was also ""psychodrama"" - a therapeutic technique that uses role-playing to help people gain insight into their lives, an established psychology technique.But several senior academics expressed surprise at how Banerjee - who has been teaching applied psychology for 13 years - felt the need to enact a wedding publicly with a first-year student, especially someone who has not yet attained legal marriageable age. ""We have never felt the need for such wedding enactments in classrooms, with first-semester examinations scheduled from Jan 30.

The driver also did not know the two and got into an argument with them.Sensing danger, the girl got down from the car and started running towards her house. One of the strangers ran behind her and caught her by the neck from behind.When she tried to get away from his clutches, he hit her and pushed her to the ground.

This could include ordering a criminal FIR if it concludes that he has failed to back up his claims with facts and evidence by the Friday 11 am deadline set by the poll panel.The EC letter to Kejriwal on Thursday stated that his reply to its notice provided no “factual and legal matrix” with evidence to back his allegation that the BJP govt in Haryana deliberately poisoned the waters of Yamuna “with an intent to cause genocide of citizens of Delhi”. It put on record that the commission has prima facie found his allegations as “promoting disharmony and enmity between different groups, and overall public disorder and unrest, even by most sober interpretation”.EC said the words used in his statement, the comparative emphasis laid on them and the manner of expression at a delicate time during peak campaigning “prima facie pose a risk of endangering peace and harmony between states and peoples.”As Kejriwal refused to back off, his defiance raised the prospect of EC responding with measures, including the registration of an FIR, in its armoury for alleged violation of the model code of conduct.The AAP convenor responded by going ballistic against the poll panel and Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and said, ""I want to tell Rajiv Kumarji, history will not forgive you. The amount of damage you have done to the EC, I don't think it has ever been tarnished this badly in India's history. I know that within two days, they will put me in jail. The kind of language the EC has used today is unprecedented. This is not the job of the EC.""He went on to say that if Kumar wanted to engage in politics, he should contest an election. ""Let him stand as a candidate from any assembly seat in Delhi,"" he said.The EC letter said Kejriwal, being a prominent public figure and former chief minister, should be aware of the dire consequences that such utterances can have and how they can leave permanent scars between residents of Haryana and Delhi. The poll panel also noted that in its notice on Tuesday, it had elaborated the legal and regulatory provisions attracted by his claims if not proved true.EC's assertions indicate that any dissatisfaction with Kejriwal's reply to its five pointed queries - the kind of poison mixed by Haryana in Yamuna; supporting evidence of the quantity, nature and manner of detecting the poison; locations where the poison was detected; which DJB engineers detected it and how and where; and the methodology employed by those engineers to stop the poisonous water from entering Delhi - may lead the poll panel to consider directing Delhi Police to file an FIR invoking Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Section 196 (statements that promote enmity between groups), Section 197 (imputations prejudicial to national integration) and Section 353 (public mischief), as also Section 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act (false statement equivalent to a corrupt practice).All three BNS sections attract up to three years in prison, or fine, or both. Separately, EC may initiate action against Kejriwal for violating model code provisions that restrain parties and candidates from activities that create hatred and tension between groups.The poll panel on Thursday told Kejriwal that his reply was ""entirely silent"" on his public and widely circulated campaign statement of 'poisoning' of Yamuna waters. ""Instead of clarifying factual and legal matrix of your statement you have chosen to justify it under the question on high ammonia content in the river Yamuna in Delhi,"" EC said as it reminded Kejriwal that the commission was dealing separately with the matter already raised by the chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab. It said Haryana govt's inputs on the issue were also being considered. TOI had exclusively reported om Wedneday's EC's response to Kejriwal's reply to its notice.On Kejriwal's request for EC's intervention to ensure availability of sufficient and safe water, the commission said the matter was best left to the competence and discretion of the govts and the agencies concerned.","The poll panel on Thursday told Kejriwal that his reply was ""entirely silent"" on his public and widely circulated campaign statement of 'poisoning' of Yamuna waters.

"With government nod, Supreme Court orders reappointment of retired high court judges to cut pendency",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-government-nod-supreme-court-orders-reappointment-of-retired-high-court-judges-to-cut-pendency/articleshow/117759388.cms,"Retired judges to be part of benches led by sitting judges

NEW DELHI: To reduce pendency of 62 lakh cases and counting in high courts, Supreme Court on Thursday, with the Centre's agreement, ordered that a maximum of five retired HC judges could be reappointed to each HC to hear criminal cases, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. It added that their number should not exceed 10% of the HC's sanctioned strength.With attorney general R Venkataramani recording no objection from the Union govt, a CJI-headed bench set in motion the reappointment process under the dormant Article 224A of the Constitution, used only thrice in last 75 years.The move will enable HC collegiums to recommend names of retired judges, with proven record of efficient disposal of cases, to the Supreme Court collegium, which will then select suitable persons and recommend their names for appointment as ad hoc judges of HCs for a fixed tenure or for specific purpose.A bench of the top three SC judges, CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, clarified that the retired judges, after being appointed as ad hoc judges, would be part of a bench headed by a sitting judge of the HC, who may be junior to the ad hoc judge, and decide pending cases. This means, no fresh cases would be listed before a bench which has an ad hoc judge.Till 1970, some retired SC judges were reappointed to the top court. But the practice was rare in HCs. Instances of reappointment of retired HC judges were for specific purposes - Justice Suraj Bhan to Madhya Pradesh HC in Nov 1972, nearly nine months after his retirement, for disposal of election petitions; Justice P Venugopal for two years in Madras HC in Aug 1983; and Justice O P Srivastava as ad hoc judge of Allahabad HC in 2007 as he was part of the special bench hearing the Ayodhya suits.The Allahabad high court, with a sanctioned strength of 160 judges but functioning at 50% strength, has the highest pendency of more than 11.5 lakh cases - 6 lakh civil cases and 5.5 lakh criminal cases.Of the total pendency of over 62 lakh cases in HCs, 18.2 lakh are criminal cases and 44 lakh civil. Total pendency in Bombay HC is 6.5 lakh, Calcutta HC 2 lakh, Madras HC 5.2 lakh, Delhi HC 1.3 lakh, Punjab and Haryana HC 4.3 lakh and Karnataka HC 3 lakh.To facilitate early reappointment of retired HC judges under Article 224A, the bench kept in abeyance certain impractical conditions a three-judge bench of the SC had imposed in its April 20, 2021, judgment. These include the rider that ad hoc judges can be appointed only when there is less than 20% vacancy in a HC; and if 10% of pending cases are more than five years old.Supreme Court had reasoned that if retired judges were allowed to be appointed without any caveat, then HC collegiums would be lax in recommending names for filling the vacancies with regular appointments.Article 224 provides that though such retired judges on being appointed as ad hoc judges would draw a salary and enjoy powers and privileges of an HC judge, they would not be deemed to be a judge of the HC. This means, they will not have any say in the administrative affairs of the high court, nor will they head a division bench.","Supreme Court on Thursday, with the Centre's agreement, ordered that a maximum of five retired HC judges could be reappointed to each HC to hear criminal cases.

That TV debates often turn into a platform for shouting matches and mud-slinging are expected to figure in the meeting as well.A source said conflict of interests involving media owners, journalists and political entities affects credibility of the news and that ethical boundaries are crossed many a time due to lack of strong regulatory mechanism.Among other key issues that may draw the committee's concerns is the expensive and long-drawn legal battles faced by journalists and media houses that discourage investigative journalism. Severe financial crunch facing regional and vernacular media, and fake news is playing ""havoc"" in the country, especially during polls, a source said.Among other items likely to invite the panel's attention is the control of social media by big corporate firms based abroad as it can cause irreparable damage to society, political functionaries, political parties and even to the country unless regulated properly.Information and broadcasting secretary, Prasar Bharti CEO, Press Registrar General and Press Council of India chairperson are among the important functionaries who are expected to appear before the committee.The panel is also expected to traverse the journey of laws and other mechanisms related to the media since enactment of the Press and Registration of Books (PRB) Act, 1867, which was later replaced with the Press and Registration of Periodicals Bill, 2023.The functioning of the Press Council of India (PCI), a statutory quasi-judicial body which functions under the Press Council of India Act, 1978 is also likely to come up for discussion, sources said.","Parliament's standing committee on communications and information technology is scheduled to ""review implementation of laws related to all forms of media"" A host of factors related to media will be discussed.

The mela grounds became a labyrinth of hope and despair after a stampede , with people searching for their missing loved ones. Some were reunited, others were left to wander through uncertainty.For Leena Sahoo, thousands of miles away in the US, desperation weighed heavily with every unanswered call, every message that carried no news of her 70-year-old mother Chinmoy, who had vanished in the sea of pilgrims.Chinmoy was among five family members on the pilgrimage. ""My aunt from Bhubaneswar had accompanied us. We boarded a train in Cuttack on Jan 26 and reached our hotel in Prayagraj at midnight on Jan 28 (hours before the Amrit Snan). After resting awhile, we left for Sangam around 2am. Midway, we discovered there was a stampede. To our horror, I realised that my bua was nowhere to be found,"" her nephew Gaurav Sahoo said.Then, on Thursday noon, hope flickered back to life. A call, a frantic rush, and finally - relief. Chinmoy was found at Lost and Found Centre 21, one of many set up by the administration. ""It was as if we found life again,"" Gaurav said.In a different corner, Mukesh Chauhan from Bengal wandered with a heart burdened by fear. His father Ashish Chauhan had disappeared during the chaos. ""I kept looking, calling his name, searching every face in the crowd... but he was nowhere,"" he said.When Mukesh finally found his father - tired, shaken, but safe in a camp in Sector 18 - relief came in a flood of tears. ""We will never take these moments for granted again,"" he said, now an advocate for carrying identification and emergency contacts to such gatherings.Not everyone was as fortunate. Jitendra Sahu roamed the vast grounds, eyes scanning the crowd for any trace of his aunt Shakuntala Devi.A woman of 70, she had travelled from Gwalior with a group.

NEW DELHI: The Budget session of Parliament, which starts on Friday with President Droupadi Murmu's address, is once again likely to be contentious. The first signs of it emerged at Thursday's all-party meeting attended by representatives from 36 parties, where opposition vowed to raise issues, such as the Maha Kumbh stampede and waqf bill.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju sought cooperation from all parties for a productive session, saying that the business advisory committee would decide which issues would be taken up for discussion.The winter session witnessed severe disruption, leading to a scuffle in which two MPs were injured.When asked about the stampede at Maha Kumbh, Rijiju said the issue was also mentioned for discussion.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who chaired the meeting on Thursday, informed parties about the legislative agenda and sought their inputs. According to sources, Singh mentioned that Uttar Pradesh govt had ordered a probe into the tragedy in Prayagraj.Opposition parties, including Congress and Samajwadi Party, protested the functioning of Joint Parliamentary Committee on waqf bill. Congress MP Jairam Ramesh criticised the committee's operations, calling it a ""farce"" on X.""It has made a complete mockery of all parliamentary traditions and practices. Such committees used to be a force to be reckoned with - now they have been reduced to being a farce to be reckoned with,"" he said.Including waqf bill, govt on Thursday circulated a list of 16 bills that are likely to be taken up during the session. The list includes waqf bill, banking laws and disaster management bills, immigration and foreigners bill, finance bill and coastal shipping bill.While the last session saw opposition parties divided over Adani, Congress's Pramod Tiwari said INDIA bloc would collectively address issues during the Budget session. He and SP's Ram Gopal Yadav criticised the management of VIP movements at Kumbh, claiming it inconvenienced common pilgrims.During the meeting, BJP's ally JDU sought an extension in the tenure of JPC scrutinising bills proposing simultaneous elections, while another partner, LJP (Ram Vilas), demanded a ""special industrial package"" for Bihar. Sources said JDU working president Sanjay Jha called for an extension in the tenure of the JPC, which was asked to submit its report by the first day of the last week of the Budget session.The party said it sought the extension as the committee has met only once and that such an important piece of legislation would require wide consultations. The second meeting of the panel is scheduled on Friday.BJD's Sasmit Patra criticised Centre for not fulfilling its promise from 2014 manifesto to grant special category status to Odisha.Meanwhile, BJP president J P Nadda is scheduled to chair a strategy meeting with NDA MPs from both Houses on Friday after tabling of the Economic Survey.","Budget session of Parliament starts on Friday with President Droupadi Murmu's address.

AAP vs Cong gets bigger and bitter: Why has Rahul doubled down on attacks against Kejriwal?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-vs-cong-gets-bigger-and-bitter-why-rahul-has-doubled-down-on-attacks-against-kejriwal/articleshow/117748063.cms,"NEW DELHI: The AAP versus Congress battle in Delhi is getting bigger and bitter with the allies-turned-rivals engaged in no-holds-barred attack against each other. Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi , who have shared stage several times in the last one year as allies under the opposition's INDIA banner, have been targeting each other like never before.Rahul Gandhi has been relentless in his attacks on Kejriwal. The former Congress president has accused the AAP chief of ""speaking lies like PM Narendra Modi"" and claimed that ""probably Kejriwal is even more 'chalaak (cunning)' than Modi."" Rahul also attacked Kejriwal for allowing the ""biggest liquor scam"" to happen under his watch and has taken jibes at AAP chief's 'sheesh mahal wali rajneeti'.Kejriwal has also returned fire reminding Rahul Gandhi about the involvement of Gandhi family in the National Herald corruption case and has alleged Congress complicity with the BJP in ensuring clean chit to Robert Vadra in alleged land grab cases. The AAP chief has blamed the Congress of fighting Delhi elections to defeat his party and in the process help the BJP.""This time, there is 'ilu ilu' between the BJP and Congress, and they are fighting these elections together. Voting for Congress means voting for BJP. Do not press the wrong button, otherwise, life will be miserable,"" Kejriwal said at a rally with Samjawadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav by his side.The Congress has reacted sharply to allegations of ""tango with the BJP"" and has said that by similar yardsticks it could be claimed that AAP had joined hands with BJP in states where it contested against the grand-old-party. ""Arvind Kejriwal is rattled to see his impending defeat (in the elections). We can also ask him that when he went to Goa, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, did he make a compromise with the BJP? Such statements don't suit Kejriwal,"" Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said countering AAP chief's charge.When Kejriwal tried to change the discourse of Delhi campaign by accusing Haryana government of poisoning the city's water - Rahul led the charge to shred the AAP chief and said, ""Kejriwal ji, now 2025 has come. When will you take a dip in the Yamuna? Delhi is waiting!""Ever since coming to power in Delhi, Kejriwal has been making empty promises - 'we will clean Yamuna, I will take a dip or else don't vote', and many more long speeches. And today again he is sitting with a bottle of Yamuna water making allegations and counter-allegations,"" Rahul said.""This is not just an insult to Yamuna ji, it is a mockery of the lives of the people of Delhi that has been going on for years. This horrific condition of Yamuna is the result of the confluence of negligence and corruption of the Modi and Kejriwal governments,"" the Congress leader added.It will be interesting to see the impact of this bitter slugfest between the AAP and the Congress on the future dynamics of the INDIA bloc. Akhilesh Yadav has openly backed Kejriwal in this fight and held a road show with the AAP chief. His appeal to voters not to waste their votes had a subtle message for the Congress. Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar have also spoken in support of Kejriwal. However, they have not joined the campaign on ground. Uddhav Thackeray has announced to stay neutral and stay away from campaigning in Delhi elections. While the dynamics of INDIA bloc differs from state to state, there is perhaps one common thread that defines its politics - balancing power aspirations between the Congress and the regional parties.Kejriwal is not the first INDIA bloc leader with which the Congress has had bitter tussle. We have seen a similar bickering play out in West Bengal where Congress and the Left parties refused to join hands with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress. Mamata then levelled similar allegations against the Congress of working to help the BJP in Bengal.Interestingly however, the intensity of Congress's attacks against Kejriwal is much more than what we saw in Bengal against Mamata. AAP is the only national party in the opposition alliance other than the Congress and has spread its wings in several states. This raises the obvious question - Does Congress see Kejriwal as a bigger threat to the grand-old-party than other regional leaders including Mamata or is the Congress trying to send out a message to other allies in the opposition bloc?While there may be no clear answer to this - the aggression in Rahul's attacks on Kejriwal perhaps points to the party's long-term plans as the Congress is unlikely to make big gains in these elections riding on this offensive.",Rahul Gandhi has been relentless in his attacks on Kejriwal.

There, Uddhav’s PA and MLC Milind Narvekar asked Patil when the two would come together again. To this, Patil said, “I’m waiting for that golden moment.” Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said that Patil’s feeling is shared by many in Sena (UBT).Raut said, “Chandrakant Patil has been a supporter of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance from the beginning. He is our good friend. Especially with regard to having Shiv Sena BJP alliance, there was an older generation, including leaders like Chandrakant Patil (who were favourably inclined). Now, there are many newbies in BJP. They will not understand the importance of the alliance of 25 years. They have no connection with BJP, they have no connection with the alliance. But the feelings of Chandrakant Patil are the same as the feelings of many in that party. Because we worked well with him for 25 years. We also worked well with Modi. But after the rise of Amit Shah in Delhi, disillusionment entered Shiv Sena-BJP alliance. We are grateful to Patil for raising positive issues regarding the Sena-BJP alliance.”He further stated, “Shiv Sena (UBT) netas may also have such feelings. We joined MVA because of the insistence of some people in BJP to break the alliance. If we look at the reasons for which the 25-year-old alliance broke up, our stance was right. What we were demanding was given to Eknath Shinde after our party split. Shah rejected our demand, he decided to break Shiv Sena. He wanted to break and destroy Balasaheb Thackeray’s Shiv Sena. Even today, Shinde is being used for that purpose.”",BJP minister Chandrakant Patil told Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday that he was waiting for the “golden moment’ when the two parties would ally again.

No fresh case was reported, while 20 patients remain on ventilator support across different hospitals.NIV's next step will be to study the C.jejuni found in patients to determine if they were struck by a more serious strain. Officials said genetically characterising the entire bacterial genome of C. jejuni would likely provide insights into virulence.Dr Shahzad Beg Mirza, microbiologist at Dr DY Patil Medical College, told TOI that NIV analyses could reveal if a specific strain was responsible for triggering multiple GBS cases.""Some C. jejuni strains with particular genetic traits are strongly linked to GBS. The key mechanism behind GBS involves 'molecular mimicry'. Similarities between bacterial components and human nerve structures can lead the immune response to mistakenly attack the nervous system,"" he said.""Changes in a bacterial component called LOS (lipooligosaccharide) may be a factor in the outbreak's severity. The genetic study will help determine if the strain involved in this surge carries these high-risk genetic traits, which could explain the increased number of GBS cases.""","Water samples tested for Campylobacter jejuni, found in stool samples of at least five patients, were found free of the bacterium. The caseload increased to 130 with confirmation of three infections that weren't accounted for in the tally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117758226,imgsize-1115390,width-400,resizemode-4/117758226.jpg"
"Citing financial crisis, Kerala halves minority scholarships",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citing-financial-crisis-kerala-halves-minority-scholarships/articleshow/117761381.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala's govt has, citing the financial crisis, slashed scholarships for minority community students by 50%, leaving the education of thousands of students in limbo. The decision affects nine of the 11 scholarship programmes - originally allocated Rs 13.6 crore - offered by the department of minority welfare.Govt insists that the reduction in plan size is being adjusted on a priority basis but the disproportionate cutback in educational assistance for minority students raises questions about policy priorities and social justice.The hardest hit is the Prof Joseph Mundassery Scholarship, which was allocated Rs 5.2 crore this year. It has been a lifeline for high-achieving students from the Muslim, Sikh, Jain and Parsi communities, offering Rs 10,000 to those securing A-Plus in all subjects in the SSLC examination and Rs 15,000 to those scoring 80% in higher secondary or 75% in vocational higher secondary courses. With priority given to students from below-poverty-line (BPL) families and provisions extended to those from economically weaker sections of the above-poverty-line (APL) category, it ensured that bright students from underprivileged backgrounds were not forced to abandon their education due to financial constraints.The APJ Abdul Kalam Scholarship, another critical support for minority students, has also been halved. The scholarship, of Rs 6,000, is offered to those securing admission in govt-approved institutions on merit, with priority for those from BPL families. It also reserves 30% of funds for female students, meaning the cuts could affect young women from disadvantaged backgrounds who already face hurdles in accessing higher education.The Mother Teresa Scholarship, which supports students from Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi communities pursuing diploma courses in govt nursing and paramedical institutions, is another scheme affected. Many aspiring nurses and paramedics, whose families struggle to afford the cost of professional training, now face the grim prospect of discontinuing their studies.The decision has also affected scholarships for those studying abroad, financial assistance for civil service coaching and reimbursement for UGC coaching.When education remains the most powerful tool for social mobility, slashing financial assistance for students from historically marginalised communities only widens the gap between privilege and disadvantage, IUML leader M K Muneer said. ""The LDF govt always speaks about the younger generation and knowledge economy. This is contradictory to that stance. They justify the Plan cuts citing a financial crisis and claim they are prioritising essential expenditures. If this so-called prioritisation results in slashing scholarships meant for underprivileged students, it clearly exposes where the govt's real priorities lie,"" he said.Many families from minority communities rely on these scholarships for their children's education. The selective austerity measures also raise the question of who bears the real cost of the financial crisis.","The decision affects nine of the 11 scholarship programmes offered by the department of minority welfare.

Haryana bid to drop 'irrelevant' caste names reveals 2013 'illegality',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana-bid-to-drop-irrelevant-caste-names-reveals-2013-illegality/articleshow/117761936.cms,"NEW DELHI: Haryana govt's proposal seeking deletion of three caste names from the its Scheduled Caste list for being ""objectionable and irrelevant"" has brought to light an ""illegality"" committed more than a decade ago by the state.The state had in 2013 issued administrative orders announcing that caste certificates to 'Chura' and 'Bhangi', and 'Mochi', will in future be issued as ' Balmiki ' and 'Chamar' respectively, since Haryana had decided to delete the three names from the SC list.Haryana's 2013 instructions to its field officers and institutions about issuing certificates to these communities in the name of two synonymous castes inadvertently came to light only now - the state is learnt to have reportedly enclosed it as supporting evidence to press its plea to the Centre for dropping of the names from the list.According to sources, the 2013 order is ""blatantly unconstitutional"" as the state has no power to tinker with the SC list or decide the fate of the names. According to Article 341, the mandate to make any change to the SC list rests with Centre and Parliament through legislative amendment. Also, there is a laid down process of consultation to arrive at a decision on such issues.In what is viewed as an attempt to remove from public parlance the community names that are widely deployed as pejoratives, Haryana has urged the Union ministry for social justice and empowerment to drop 'Chura', 'Bhangi' and 'Mochi' from the SC list, arguing that the words are ""not only objectionable"" but have also ""lost relevance"", as reported by TOI.Since the Centre has come to know about Haryana's decision after 12 years, there is a lack of clarity if the state had, in pursuance of its 2013 instructions, stopped issuing certificates in the names of three communities, and replaced them with two others. ""Any such action would be illegal and will have to be nixed retrospectively,"" it is argued.There is a possibility that the Centre may seek more information from Haryana if its 2013 instructions were followed, and if the three communities in question are no longer issued certificates on their own names.Oblivious, Haryana seems to have enclosed the 2013 order to add weight to its proposal for deletion of the three names. Sources said the Centre had in the past, after consultation, advised Delhi govt to withdraw a move similar to Haryana's, while in 2005-06, it had overruled a decision of UP govt to transfer some OBC communities to the SC list.","Haryana govt's proposal seeking deletion of three caste names from the its Scheduled Caste list has brought to light an ""illegality"" committed more than a decade ago.

LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath government in UP cancelled Thursday all VIP protocols in Prayagraj - pilot cars, police escort and direct entry, among other privileges - for the three remaining special snan days of Maha Kumbh following the Mauni Amavasya stampede.The curbs will kick in on the eve of Amrit Snan on Basant Panchami (Feb 3), Maghi Purnima (Feb 12) and Shivratri (Feb 26), and remain in force for a day each after these events. The administration has also clamped a blanket ban on vehicles entering the mela zone till Feb 4.

More SP-level officers have been deployed to handle security duties.Steps to regulate pedestrian movement and prevent overcrowding include creating one-way pathways at several places. This is meant to prevent bottlenecks, reduce the risk of stampede, and enable emergency services to operate efficiently if and when needed.Movement through the pontoon bridges has been eased. Some bridges were shut on Mauni Amavasya to stop pilgrims from crowding the Sangam area, but it apparently proved counter-productive.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Stock market recommendations:The Nifty index experienced a pullback for the third consecutive session on Thursday, closing the monthly expiry sessions with a gain of 0.37% at 23,249,50. Following a 13% correction from its all-time high of 26,277 over the past four months, Nifty appears to be forming a base within the 22,800-23,450 range in the last three weeks. This consolidation is happening ahead of major events like the Union Budget 2025, Delhi Election, and the RBI monetary policy outcome. Volatility is expected to stay elevated as these events approach.Dips in the index are seen as potential buying opportunities, with strong support in the 23,000-22,800 range, which aligns with the current week’s low and a key trendline support. On the upside, resistance is located between 23,400-23,600 being the confluence of the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), the previous major breakdown area and the almost identical highs from the past two weeks. A breakout above this resistance could shift sentiment and open up a move towards 24,000-24,200 in the coming weeks.The market breadth indicator, measured by the percentage of stocks above the 50-day EMA in the Nifty 500, is recovering from oversold conditions. It reached a low of 8% last Tuesday and is now at 13%. Historically, the 5%-8% range has marked a rebound point for the Nifty, further supporting the potential for a pullback in the index.Bank Nifty gained for the 3rd session in a row on Thursday to close higher by 0.3% at 49,311.95 levels. The index has witnessed a strong pullback during this week from the lower band of the last 3 weeks range (47,800-50,300) after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced measures to inject over Rs 1.5 lakh crore into the money markets, marking the largest monetary easing since the pandemic. This move aims to address the liquidity shortfall caused by the RBI’s efforts to stabilize the rupee through dollar sales.We expect the index to extend the consolidation in the range of 47,800-50,300. With key resistance placed around 50,300 levels being the confluence of multiple moving averages and previous major breakdown areas. Only a breakout above 50,300 will signal a shift in sentiment and open up a move towards 51,600-52,000 in the coming weeks.The stock has been consolidating near the 200-week EMA for the past three weeks after a sharp 33% decline over the last seven months. Currently the stock is in oversold territory, it presents an attractive risk-reward setup. Strong support is seen around 122-123, which is expected to hold, providing a foundation for a potential bounce towards 146, a key retracement level and the 200-day EMA.Bharat Electronics has been an outperformer in the Defense sector, with buying interest emerging over the last two sessions after forming a base above the 52-week EMA (currently at 264).The stock has taken six months to retrace just 50% of its previous six-month up move (172-340), which indicates a positive bias. We expect the stock to continue its upward momentum and head towards 307 levels being the 80% retracement of the previous decline (320-253).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Tata Steel and Bharat Electronics are the top stock picks for today.

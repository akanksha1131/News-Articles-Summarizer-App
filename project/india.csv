THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Tension gripped Neyyattinkara in Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram district on Wednesday evening after RSS activists staged a protest against Mahatma Gandhi ’s grandson, Tushar Gandhi during the unveiling of Gandhian representative Gopinathan Nair’s statue at his residence at TB Junction.The protest was triggered by Tushar’s remark during his speech that “the soul of the nation is afflicted with cancer, and the Sangh Parivar is spreading it”.Outraged BJP and RSS activists demanded a retraction and an apology. Tushar, however, stood by his remark, and chanted “hail, Gandhi”, before leaving. The protesters shouted slogans and blocked his car, but Tushar refused to back down and countered with slogans like “down with RSS” and “long live Gandhi”, before exiting the venue.Congress condemned RSS-BJP activists, with party’s state chief K Sudhakaran accusing them of being haunted by “(Nathuram) Godse’s ghost”. He also questioned CPM’s silence on the incident.","RSS activists staged a protest against Mahatma Gandhi ’s grandson, Tushar Gandhi during the unveiling of Gandhian representative Gopinathan Nair’s statue at TB Junction.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court directed ASI on Wednesday to whitewash “flaking” portions of Sambhal Jama Masjid 's outer facade and the mosque committee to reimburse the expenditure within a week.HC said that barring the use of LED or focus lights to illuminate the periphery, there should be no extra lighting installation on the walls lest they damage the structure.Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal ’s order came on a petition filed by the mosque management committee seeking permission to whitewash the mosque and clean the disputed premises, which a group of Hindu litigants say was built over a razed temple.The court will next hear the case on April 8.ASI filed a second supplementary affidavit Wednesday in response to a March 10 court order seeking to know whether whitewashing, extra lighting and installation of decorative lights were required outside the structure or not.Advocate SFA Naqvi, counsel for the mosque committee, pointed out that ASI never explicitly stated in an affidavit that the exterior of the structure didn’t require whitewashing, extra lighting and installation of decorative lights.Manoj Kumar Singh, representing ASI, said that there was some flaking on the structure’s exterior, but it would be possible to take a call on the extent of work required only after a proper survey involving archaeologists and conservation experts.On Feb 27, the court directed ASI to inspect the site and report its findings the next day. ASI’s report said the enamel paint was still in good condition, at which the court asked it to clean the surroundings and shear the long grass. The court also permitted the mosque committee to submit objections to ASI’s report.","HC said that barring the use of LED or focus lights to illuminate the periphery, there should be no extra lighting installation on the walls.

With the body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family, authorities there said Wednesday they expect protests and blockade in the district to end soon.However, the road to lasting peace in the restive state may be a long way off. Ongoing talks between the Kuki-Zo community and Centre’s interlocutor A K Mishra are unlikely to make much headway with the former sticking to its demand for a “separate hill state” after hiving off Meitei-dominated Valley areas.The demand, which goes against the Constitutional framework, will not be acceptable to the Centre.Govt also does not seem keen to concede to the Kuki demand for a separate administrative framework for the tribal-dominated hilly regions either, recognising that it can fuel the demand for a separate state, besides giving fillip to separatist tendencies in the strategically crucial border state.Still, efforts would be to stay engaged with both Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, while tactfully persuading the latter to settle for a solution within the four corners of the Constitution, including granting them more autonomy and preserving their unique culture, heritage and language.Sources said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of Kangpokpi had been engaging with Kuki-Zo protestors over the past few days to persuade them to accept the body of the local killed during protests on March 8, amid clashes between them and security forces.The killing had triggered further tension with Kuki-Zo protestors ordering a shutdown, apart from blocking roads and stopping the movement of vehicles. “The blockade call was given for all areas with a significant Kuki-Zo population. But its effect was seen largely in Kangpokpi. However, the talks between the local administration and community representatives have made headway, with the family of the deceased protester taking back his body for last rites,” said a Manipur govt functionary.A senior Manipur police functionary shared that a total 4,500 weapons, including those looted after ethnic violence broke out in Manipur in May 2023, were now back with police. Of these, around 1,050 were surrendered by rebels in response to a call given by Governor Ajay Bhalla.“The remaining weapons were recovered in raids and searches undertaken over time by police and security forces. These raids shall continue, now that the deadline set by the governor to voluntarily surrender weapons has ended,” said the functionary.Manipur MP Bimol Akoijam protested in Lok Sabha that his question about the state was removed from the list of questions after having been listed initially. He raised the issue in Lok Sabha during the zero hour. Jagdambika Pal, who was in the chair, denied permission to raise the issue. “This issue cannot be raised here,” he said. Akoijam has been raising issues related to the state which is affected by ethnic strife for around two years. His office, however, refused to answer what the issue was about.","The body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family on Wednesday.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh deputy CM and finance minister Jagdish Devda on Wednesday presented the state budget of Rs 4,21,032 crore for 2025-26, a 15% increase in outlay over the 2024-25 estimate of Rs 3,65,067 crore. There are no new taxes and no hike in existing taxes. Govt assured that no welfare scheme would be stopped, but several key schemes faced fund cuts.Ladli Behna Yojana — seen as the gamechanger in 2023 assembly election — got the lion’s share of funds, but it was trimmed by Rs 315 crore. This year’s allocation of Rs 18,669 crore is lower than last year’s Rs 18,984 crore.The Ladli budgetary allocation is higher than those for PM Modi’s flagship schemes like Jal Jeevan Mission (Rs 17,136 crore), Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (Rs 2001 crore), PM Awas Yojana (Rs 4,400 crore) and PM Gram Sadak Yojana (Rs 1,550 crore).Devda said Ladli Behna beneficiaries will be linked to central schemes like Atal Pension Yojana, PM Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and PM Suraksha Bima Yojana.Under Ladli, beneficiaries get Rs 1,250 a month.When the scheme was launched, govt had promised that the Rs 1,000 payout would be gradually increased to Rs 3,000 per month. But the last hike was in Oct 2023, a month ahead of polls.Cuts were also announced in Ladli Laxmi Yojana, PM Gram Sadak Yojana, and even allocation for govt schools. The allocation for primary schools has been reduced from Rs 15,509 crore to Rs 11,837 crore, and that for secondary schools from Rs 9,258 crore to Rs 7,206 crore.Funds for Ladli Laxmi Yojana have been trimmed from Rs 1,231 crore to Rs 1,183 crore. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana has faced a cut from Rs 1,788 crore to Rs 1,550 crore.Dewda said focus has been on PM’ s categorisation of GYAN — ‘garib’ (poor), ‘yuva’ (youth), ‘annadaata’ (farmers) and ‘nari’ (women). “This is a budget for development. Our target is to increase per capita income from Rs 1.4 lakh to Rs 22.3 lakh,” he said.","Madhya Pradesh deputy CM Jagdish Devda presented the state budget of Rs 4,21,032 crore for 2025-26.

NEW DELHI: India and Mauritius upgraded their ties to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership as PM Narendra Modi held formal talks with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, reaffirming commitment to a free, open and secure Indian Ocean and pledging full support for the security of Mauritius’s Exclusive Economic Zone, including through increased deployment of ships and aircraft.Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South, 10 years after he announced India’s ‘Vision Sagar’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region) from the same strategically located Indian Ocean country that, he said, connects India to the wider Global South.It shall encompass the ideas of trade for development, capacity building for sustainable growth, and mutual security for a shared future. Under this, we will extend cooperation through technology sharing, concessional loan and grants,” Modi said, describing Mauritius also as a special partner in the region.Modi’s meeting with Ramgoolam was followed by signing of eight agreements and several announcements, including construction of a new Mauritius Parliament building by India, which Modi said would be a gift from the “mother of democracy”.India had last year welcomed the UK-Mauritius agreement for Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, which houses a US-UK military base, and Modi reiterated India’s “firm support” for Mauritius on this issue. Ramgoolam thanked Modi for his personal support and engagement with global representatives on this issue, according to a joint statement that described the two countries as natural partners.“We fully respect the sovereignty of Mauritius with regard to Chagos. We will extend our cooperation through forums such as the Colombo Security Conclave, Indian Ocean Rim Association, and Indian Ocean Conference,” Modi said in his media statement after the meeting.India also announced a rupee-denominated line of credit amounting to Rs 487 crore for undertaking the replacement of water pipelines in Mauritius. “It is the first-ever Indian rupee-based line of credit that’s being extended by India to any country and, therefore, a significant development,” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.Modi laid special emphasis on defence and maritime security cooperation, calling it a key pillar of the strategic partnership and committing to fulfil all the needs of the local coast guard. “India shall also assist in setting up of the police academy and National Maritime Information Sharing Centre in Mauritius. Cooperation will be further strengthened in white shipping, blue economy, and hydrography,” he said.According to the joint statement, Ramgoolam thanked Modi for “unwavering support” to Mauritius in protecting its vast EEZ through provisioning of defence and maritime assets, regular deployment of ships and aircraft, conducting joint maritime surveillance, hydrographic surveys and patrolling, bilateral exercises and information sharing and training support, “thereby emerging as a significant security provider for Mauritius”.The representatives also agreed to deepen cooperation towards securing the EEZ of Mauritius, including through enhanced utilisation of a new runway and jetty on the Agalega islands that India has built amid increasing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.The representatives called for ratifying the protocol on amendment of double taxation avoidance agreement, which was signed last year, at the earliest “to harmonise with international standards on treaty abuse, after ongoing discussions are concluded”. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Mauritius had sought some clarification and those had been addressed by India at a very high level. “Our aim is to set at rest all doubts and provide satisfaction to our friends and colleagues from Mauritius that they have a good and a solid agreement on this front… we very much hope that Mauritius will complete its internal processes at the soonest, and the protocol will come into force very quickly,” he added.",Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South.

NEW DELHI: On the day he was awarded the highest civilian honour of Mauritius, Prime Minister Narendra Modi , alongside his Mauritian counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, jointly inaugurated the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Public Service and Innovation in Mauritius on Wednesday. This milestone marks another significant step in India’s ongoing efforts to establish itself as a reliable development partner on the global stage.The institute, named in honour of the former Indian PM, underscores Vajpayee’s legacy of fostering strong India-Mauritius relations and symbolises the deepening ties between the two countries.A senior govt official emphasised that PM Modi has consistently championed India’s role as a reliable partner in global development, supporting a wide array of initiatives worldwide. These efforts span critical sectors such as infrastructure, healthcare, education, and connectivity. “The inauguration of this institute is a testament to that vision, aligning with India’s broader mission to contribute meaningfully to the Global South and the Indian Ocean Region,” the govt functionary said.The Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute was funded through a $4.7 million grant from India under a 2017 MoU. It is designed to meet the training needs of Mauritian civil servants across various ministries, public offices, parastatal organizations and govt enterprises.The institute is also poised to become a centre of excellence in public administration. It will promote research, governance studies, and institutional collaboration with India, further strengthening bilateral ties.India’s global outreach extends far beyond Mauritius.

Sensex outlook: Worst over?

Global Market Turmoil: US equities bleed as well



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





What a fall! BSE Sensex and Nifty50 have plunged drastically from their lifetime peaks in a matter of a few months. According to a Bloomberg report, the Indian stock market decline has erased over $1 trillion in market value during the previous four months! This has led to a reduction in India's portion of worldwide market capitalisation.Based on a 20-day average calculation, India's share of global equity market value is approaching 3%, showing a significant decrease from its highest point of over 4% recorded in the previous year, the report said.The Indian stock market is experiencing an unusually prolonged downturn, with a 16% decline from its peak - a correction phase that has lasted significantly longer than typical market adjustments outside major global crises.Historical data examining 20 previous instances of market corrections exceeding 10% (excluding the global financial crisis and Covid-19) reveals that standard corrections averaged 14% and typically resolved within 70 days, states an ET report.Also Read | Why Jim Walker, man who foresaw 2008 market crash, wants investors to ‘absolutely double down’ on Indian equities The current situation stands apart, with the Nifty 200 experiencing a substantial 16% decrease over 165 days, establishing this as one of the most significant and extended downturns in recent market history.This correction differs from previous market declines, which were primarily caused by significant global events. The present downturn lacks a major external catalyst, aside from US trade-related tensions. The primary factors appear to be domestic economic challenges, including poor corporate performance, high valuation levels, and continuous Foreign Institutional Investor withdrawals.What initially appeared as a standard market adjustment has evolved into a persistent decline, affecting both active traders and buy-and-hold investors.The continuous decline in the Nifty since September, extending across approximately six months, represents an unusual pattern. This gradual but persistent downturn presents a notable contrast to the previous extended bull market phase, which continued for 55 months without experiencing even a 5% reduction.The BSE100 companies, comprising major and frequently traded firms on the Bombay Stock Exchange, witnessed their revenue growth decelerate to one-third in the previous calendar year versus 2023, whilst their net profit growth accelerated fivefold, demonstrating successful cost management strategies.Also Read | Trump tariffs and trade tensions: Three reasons why India is best placed in Asia to outperform Analysis of BSE100 data by the financial daily, which offers a comprehensive view of India's equity markets beyond the Sensex, indicated considerable deceleration across industrial, service and consumer sectors.These organisations recorded a 9% increase in revenues and 32% growth in net profit during 2024, in contrast to 25% sales growth and 7% profit increase in 2023.""It is largely due to a slowdown in the overall consumption segment as well as oil, gas and steel businesses, where prices essentially remained benign and hurt value growth,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda was quoted as saying. ""If BFSI is excluded, the overall growth will moderate even further. While profit was higher, it was largely due to high base effect, cost control by companies that include cost of production, and marginal salary hikes.""According to Sabnavis, these organisations are anticipated to deliver improved collective results in the upcoming year.Morgan Stanley maintains its year-end Sensex projection of 105,000 points by December 2025, despite recent global tariff conflicts. Morgan Stanley’s team, headed by Ridham Desai, identifies India as 'A stock pickers' market' and notes that India's comparative earnings growth is improving, even considering conservative consensus estimates.A separate analysis from Morgan Stanley suggests that India's position, with minimal share in global manufacturing exports but substantial presence in services exports, could prove advantageous during international trade disputes.“Valuations are the most attractive since the Covid pandemic. The market has ignored the RBI's policy pivot, and a strong budget from the government, among other positive developments since early February. India's low beta characteristic make it an ideal market for the uncertain macro environment that equities are dealing with. Importantly, our sentiment indicator is in strong buy territory,” Desai’s report says.US equity markets have seen a $4 trillion decline in market capitalisation, entering correction territory with a drop exceeding 10% from their December high. The substantial decline stems from economic uncertainties, recession concerns and growing trade disputes, triggering widespread selling that has erased vast amounts of market worth.The technology sector has experienced the steepest declines. Tesla witnessed a single-day value erosion of $125 billion, whilst Apple and Nvidia each declined approximately 5%. The technology component of the S&P 500 registered a 4.3% fall. Additionally, Delta Air Lines shares tumbled 14% following the airline's announcement of halved first-quarter profit projections.","India's share of global equity market value is approaching 3%, showing a significant decrease from its highest point of over 4% recorded in the previous year.

NEW DELHI: A political row has erupted in Maharashtra over the government's new meat certification initiative. The controversy began when Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane launched 'Malhar Certification' for Hindu meat traders to ensure “100% Hindu-owned mutton shops, free from adulteration.”Rane stated that Hindu shopkeepers selling 'jhatka' mutton would be granted this certification and urged Hindu consumers to purchase mutton exclusively from certified vendors.Soon after Rane's announcement, the opposition criticised the move, alleging it would divide society.Also read: 'Eating halal not written in Hindu religion': Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane proposes 'Malhar certification' Congress MLA Nana Patole condemned Rane’s remarks, stating that a minister should not make such divisive statements. “A minister cannot talk like this. It sends a message that the Chief Minister has no control over his ministers. If any minister is inciting conflict between two religions, the CM should take action,” Patole told ANI.Congress leader Aslam Shaikh termed the move unconstitutional. “If this government or Nitesh Rane wants to enter the meat business, then it's good. Our Constitution gives us the freedom to do anything, eat anything, but saying that only one person will do a type of job does not align with our Constitution,” he said.Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Chandra Pawar faction) MLA Jitendra Awhad also criticised the comments, particularly during the holy month of Ramzan. “When everything is running smoothly in the state, the BJP government tries to stoke Hindu-Muslim issues,” he said. He also questioned the political motive behind the debate on illegal loudspeakers, stating, “Action should be taken where necessary, but why make it a political issue?”Despite the backlash, BJP MLA Sanjay Upadhyay defended Rane’s certification initiative, arguing that ‘Halal’ meat poses health risks. “I have no issue with what people choose to eat, but if someone is being misled, it should be objected to. The chemicals produced during the ‘halal’ process are harmful to the body. I support Nitesh Rane in this case — chicken and mutton shops should have proper licensing,” Upadhyay said.Meanwhile, Rane, justifying his initiative, claimed that the certification would help Hindus identify “rightful mutton shops” run by members of the Hindu community and ensure no adulteration. Announcing the launch on social media platform X, he wrote, “Today, we have taken a very important step for the Hindu community in Maharashtra. Malhar Certification has been launched to ensure access to 100% Hindu-owned mutton shops , free from adulteration.”He further urged people to prioritise certified vendors and avoid purchasing from uncertified shops. “I appeal to everyone to use Malhar Certification and not buy mutton from places without it. This initiative will empower Hindu youth financially,” Rane added.According to the government website, Malhar certification is for jhatka mutton and chicken vendors. “It ensures that goat and sheep meat, sacrificed according to Hindu religious traditions, is fresh, clean, free from saliva contamination, and not mixed with any other animal meat,” the website stated.“This meat is available exclusively through Hindu Khatik community vendors. Therefore, we encourage everyone to purchase mutton only from vendors certified by Malhar,” it said.","Maha minister Nitesh Rane launched 'Malhar Certification' for Hindu meat traders to ensure ‘100% Hindu-owned mutton shops, free from adulteration’ Opposition criticised the move, alleging it would divide society.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday criticized the National Education Policy (NEP), calling it a "" saffron policy "" and alleging that it is aimed at promoting Hindi rather than the country's overall development.""National Education Policy is not education policy; it is saffron policy. The policy is not created to develop India but to develop Hindi. We are opposing the policy as it would destroy the Tamil Nadu education system completely,"" Stalin said while addressing a rally at Thiruvallur.He also claimed that NEP does not recognize reservation, which he described as social justice . ""NEP denies assistance amount to SCs, STs, and Other Backward Classes,"" he alleged during the public meeting.Stalin further accused the central government of withholding Tamil Nadu’s share of funds because the state did not adopt NEP. ""We are asking for your tax share, which we paid with our efforts. What is the problem with this? Is it fair to threaten without releasing funds for the welfare of 43 lakh schools? As we didn't accept NEP, they are refusing to release funds that belong to Tamil Nadu. We would have welcomed the scheme if it brought everyone into education. But is NEP like that? NEP has all the factors that remove people from education. This is how this policy is, and that's why we are opposing it,"" he said.The point of contention in the debate over NEP is its three-language formula , which Tamil Nadu fears could lead to the imposition of Hindi in the state. Stalin earlier argued that the policy gives preference to Hindi over regional languages, affecting the state's autonomy and linguistic diversity.The central government, however, insists that the NEP is designed to encourage multilingualism and provide flexibility in language education. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has refuted claims of Hindi imposition , stating that the policy allows states to decide on their preferred languages.On the issue of delimitation, Stalin alleged that the BJP is trying to increase the number of MPs in states where it has influence to strengthen its position. ""BJP is attempting to sustain power by winning in northern states,"" he said.He further added, ""BJP is trying to increase the number of MPs in states of their influence and develop the party. DMK will stop it.""Stalin also alleged that the BJP wants to destroy the federal structure, adding that ""they will never be submissive to the BJP's fascism even if we lose our lives.""""Let's gather whole India against BJP fascism . BJP's casteist thoughts neglect social justice to our people and destroy communal harmony. If we fail to stop this now, then it can't be stopped ever.

He made the remark while speaking at an event in Lucknow organized by RSS-linked weeklies Organiser and Panchjanya .Addressing the gathering at the event titled 'Manthan: Kumbh and Beyond' , Adityanath said, ""The world may think whatever it wants about me, but I indeed wear the 'bhagwa'. This is my identity, and it is also the identity of our Sanatan tradition. I take immense pride in it and mark my words—one day, the entire world will wear it.""The chief minister also spoke on the ongoing Sambhal mosque controversy , saying that forcibly seizing someone's faith and trampling over their beliefs is ""unacceptable,"" especially when ""we know the truth about Sambhal.""

I am talking about something that predates Islam by at least 2,000 years,"" Adityanath said, asserting that Sambhal represents ""historical truth.""He further said that the evidence of these events has existed for centuries, pointing out, ""Remember, in 1526, a temple of Lord Vishnu in Sambhal was demolished. Two years later, in 1528, the Ram temple in Ayodhya was destroyed.""The chief minister added that both temple demolitions ""were carried out by the same person.""Since last November, tensions have been rising in Sambhal following a court-ordered survey at a mosque believed by some to be the site of a demolished temple.During his address, Adityanath emphasized that he respects all communities and sects. ""I am a Yogi. I respect every sect, community, and form of worship. If you visit Gorakhnath Peeth, you will see that there is no discrimination against anyone. People of all castes, regions, and sects sit together and eat from the same plate, and all sadhus, regardless of their religious affiliations, have meals together and receive equal respect,"" he said.Adityanath also said that Sambhal has always been a pilgrimage site, mentioning that it had 68 sacred places, out of which 18 have been ""reclaimed"". ""There were 19 ancient wells, which we have revived. After 56 years, for the first time, there was the ritual offering of water at Lord Shiva's temple in Sambhal,"" he added.He criticized opposition parties, questioning their role in preserving cultural and religious heritage. ""What were these so-called leaders doing all this time? They have only been busy dividing people in the name of religion and caste,"" he said.Meanwhile, on Sunday, Adityanath had said,Adiyanath made this remark while backing Sambhal CO Anuj Chaudhary's statement. Chaudhary, while talking to reporters, said, ""Holi is a festival that comes once a year, whereas Friday prayers take place 52 times a year. If anyone feels uncomfortable with the colours of Holi, they should stay indoors on that day.""On November 19, 2024, the Sambhal civil judge senior division ordered an urgent survey of a mosque after considering an application from some Hindu activists. The activists claimed that the Islamic religious site, built during the reign of Mughal emperor Babur, was originally a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu's prophesied avatar, Kalki.Following the court’s directive, a survey team led by advocate commissioner Ramesh Raghav conducted an initial inspection of the mosque within a few hours. On the morning of November 24, the team arrived for a second round of photography and videography.However, violence erupted that day in the lanes near the Shahi Jama Masjid during the tense second survey, resulting in the deaths of at least five Muslim men.","Yogi Adityanath: If anyone wants to read Friday prayers, they can do so at their home.

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday inked a Rs 2,906 crore contract for procurement of 18 `Ashwini’ low-level transportable radars (LLTRs) for the IAF, as part of the ongoing drive to strengthen indigenous military capabilities .The contract was inked with defence PSU Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), in the presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, for the LLTRs designed and developed by the Electronics & Radar Development Establishment of DRDO. This is the first time that the IAF will induct indigenous LLTRs instead of those imported from abroad.“The Ashwini LLTR is an active electronically scanned phased array radar based on state-of-the-art solid-state technology. The radar is capable of tracking aerial targets from high-speed fighters to slow-moving targets such as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones and helicopters,” a MoD official said.“The acquisition will significantly enhance IAF’s operational preparedness. The programme is a major step towards achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing by reducing dependency on foreign companies, besides acting as a catalyst for development of the country’s defence-industrial ecosystem,” he added.The IAF deploys a variety of ground-based radars, including LLTRs, as well as airborne sensors for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) capabilities along the borders with China and Pakistan.The force is also looking to induct specialized mountain radars to look deep into enemy territory along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China, which has upgraded all its air bases facing India and deployed an extensive network of radars and surface-to-air guided weapons since the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh erupted in April-May 2020.","The defence ministry on Wednesday inked a Rs 2,906 crore contract for procurement of 18 `Ashwini’ low-level transportable radars (LLTRs) for the IAF.

It has been forced for years that only Halal mutton should be eaten. Either eat Halal, or you have no other alternative. We have brought a good alternative for it.

Centuries of discrimination

Dalit families enter temple but fear backlash

'God is with everyone'

NEW DELHI: For the first time in nearly 300 years, Dalit families in a West Bengal village have been allowed to worship at the Gidheshwar Shiv Temple , breaking a long-standing caste barrier.On Wednesday, representatives of 130 Dalit families stepped into the temple in Purba Bardhaman district’s Katwa subdivision, marking a historic moment in their fight for religious rights.The breakthrough came after weeks of tension and intervention by local authorities. Around 10 am, five members from the Das community—including four women and one man—climbed the temple steps in Gidhgram’s Daspara area. Under police protection, they poured milk and water on the Shivling and offered prayers without any obstruction.For centuries, Dalit families, traditionally cobblers and weavers, were not allowed to enter the temple. When they tried to break this practice on Maha Shivratri (February 26), they faced strong opposition. They were forced to leave and faced economic boycotts, including a ban on selling milk from their cattle.The families were determined to worship and turned to the administration for help. But early talks with village elders and temple authorities failed. After several discussions, a key meeting on Tuesday, led by Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) Ahimsa Jain, finally resolved the issue. Local MLAs, police officials, and temple committee members attended, ensuring that Dalit families could worship freely.The families expressed joy and relief but remained cautious about the future. “We are ecstatic to have been granted the right to perform puja at the temple. I prayed to God for everyone’s well-being,” said Santosh Das, a villager previously barred from entering the temple.“We received tremendous support from the local police and administration on whom we had reposed our faith,” added Ekkori Das. However, she voiced concerns over whether the temple doors would remain open once the police deployment was withdrawn. The economic boycott against the Das families also continued until Wednesday morning, with milk procurement centres refusing to collect milk from them. “Police have directed the centres to resume collection. If it doesn’t happen by evening, we will have to report it to the authorities,” she said.While the administration hailed the resolution as a step towards equality, some temple authorities admitted they were not entirely in favour. “We used to take care of everything at the temple during the Gajan fair. It is now a big question whether we will be able to maintain the purity and sanctity of the ancient tradition of puja at the temple,” said Sanat Mandal, a temple servant.Local political leaders welcomed the development. “It wasn’t easy to break the deadlock arising out of a long-standing tradition. Standing in the 21st century, such ideas cannot be entertained. God is with everyone. Together, we managed to convince everyone of this. That is what has resolved the dispute,” said Trinamool Congress MLA Apurba Chatterjee.","For centuries, Dalit families, traditionally cobblers and weavers, were not allowed to enter the temple.

"Air India clogged lavatories: Aging aircraft, old ducts, scaling in pipes and passenger behaviour lead to stink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aging-aircraft-old-ducts-scaling-in-pipes-and-passenger-behaviour-lead-to-stink/articleshow/118906475.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Clogged toilets are not new to Air India flights, but the legacy of the old govt-run airline has been flushed across to the new Tata Group-owned company, right in the middle of its modernisation and expansion spree.For years, cleanup crew of Air India’s long-haul flights has found in holding tanks of blocked lavatories everything from socks to hand towels, plastic bags, underwear and even small pillows given on board.Just as the Chicago-Delhi flight was forced to return to O’Hare International Airport last Wednesday when eight of its 10 lavatories were clogged, over the years, several of the airline’s Europe and US flights have been forced to divert or return after flying for hours with hundreds of bursting bowels and bladders for similar reasons.The dumping has gone on regardless of clear signage asking flyers not to throw anything in the commode as that could “clog the toilet and cause inconvenience to you and your fellow passengers”.As Air India’s legacy Boeing 777s, used for North America nonstops, age, the problem is worsening as the old ducts find it increasingly difficult to suck in whatever indiscreet passengers flush away. “These aircraft are very old. The lavatory ducts or suction pipes have got scaling due to which their available width has reduced. External particles like shawls, sheets or towels easily and immediately clog them up,” said an engineer who has spent decades maintaining aircraft. Aircraft toilets use a vacuum system to remove waste into a storage tank.According to Air India’s former executive director Jitender Bhargava, the airline got 21 of its 23 B777s between 2007 and 2010. The other two were inducted much later and are now used as dedicated long-haul VVIP planes operated by the Indian Air Force. The B787 Dreamliners, used on the Europe, Far East and Australia routes, came in a few years later, starting 2010, and are also getting old now.The problem of clogged toilets has shown up on both these long-haul planes in the airline’s fleet. Due to night curfew in Europe, Air India’s affected B777s have in the past returned to either India or North America after flying hours. An engineer explained, “A B777 has two waste tanks. If a duct leading from a lavatory gets clogged, it will affect only that particular lavatory. But if the duct close to the waste tank inlet gets clogged, it will affect all lavatories connected to it.”On AI 126 being forced to return to Chicago on March 5, Air India said in a statement on Monday, “Our teams found polythene bags, rags and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing. This led the lavatories to become unserviceable. While not found on AI 126 of March 5, 2025, our teams have previously also found objects such as blankets, innerwear, and diapers, among other waste, having been flushed down the toilets on other flights. We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for.”Is this problem faced by airlines of other countries as well? TOI spoke to officials of multiple leading foreign airlines, who said they have only experienced this problem sporadically. This suggests passengers behave differently in an Indian carrier than when they are aboard a foreign airline.“This is a very, very rare occurrence that can happen anywhere. Sometimes, a couple of lavatories may become unserviceable. If detected before taking off from a place that is not our engineering base, we resort to denied boarding and proportionately reduce the number of passengers on that aircraft,” said an official with a foreign airline.Apart from educating passengers, aircraft maintenance engineers have a word of advice for Air India. “Small bottles are kept in lavatories by AI and almost all other global airlines operating medium to ultra-long hauls. However given the peculiar situation of AI, it will be better to have bigger fixed dispensers that can be refilled by crew as a lot of small bottles end up getting flushed. Ditto for dental hygiene kits but those have to be given,” said an engineer.Crew members say passengers ignore the waste bins, which are right there, below or beside the wash basin, and flush everything down the toilet instead. Toilets in the economy section are more prone to clogging simply because the passenger load is higher. “Given the impact on reputation for Air India, the management must take a call on whether pre-flight instructions by crew should also include what not to flush in the lavs,” said a crew member.","The Chicago-Delhi flight was forced to return to O’Hare International Airport last Wednesday when eight of its 10 lavatories were clogged. Over the years, several of the airline’s Europe and US flights have been forced to divert or return after flying for hours with hundreds of bursting bowels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118911717,imgsize-1204919,width-400,resizemode-4/118911717.jpg"

Authorities call for inquiry into security lapses

Defence claims consent, police cite forensic proof

NEW DELHI: A Maharashtra court on Wednesday remanded Dattatray Gade , the accused in the Swargate bus rape case , to police custody until March 26. The incident took place in Pune where Gade had allegedly raped a 26-year-old woman inside a parked state transport (MSRTC) bus at the Swargate terminus in the early hours of February 25, police said.Gade was arrested from a sugarcane field in Gunat village, Pune district, following an extensive manhunt involving drones and sniffer dogs. The search operation lasted two days, with villagers assisting the police. According to officials, Gade made multiple suicide attempts while hiding but failed each time due to a broken rope. He was ultimately captured after leaving his hiding spot in search of drinking water.Upon his arrest, Gade was produced in court following a 12-day police custody. The crime branch sought his judicial custody while reserving the right to recall him for two additional days of police custody. The court granted judicial custody till March 26.Also read: Pune bus rape case: Cops to recover suspect's cellphone, clothes & quiz him about past crimes The survivor, who works as a preoperative counsellor at a hospital in Pune, was waiting at Swargate depot to catch a bus to Phaltan when Gade approached her, pretending to be a conductor. He convinced her to board a parked Shivshahi bus , locked the doors, and allegedly raped her before fleeing. Initially too shaken to speak out, the victim later gathered the courage to report the crime with support from a friend.The case has sparked public outrage, with protests erupting at the Swargate terminus. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and NCW Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar condemned the incident, calling for swift justice. Transport minister Pratap Sarnaik ordered an inquiry into security lapses, leading to the dismissal of 23 security personnel and investigations into two senior officials. Authorities have since ramped up security measures at major bus terminals across the state, installing additional CCTV cameras and increasing police patrols.During the court hearing, Gade’s defence lawyers argued that the encounter was consensual. However, the police refuted these claims, citing forensic evidence and CCTV footage. Authorities have sent the bus for forensic examination and are ensuring all evidence is properly documented.",Dattatray Gade remanded to police custody until March 26.

MUMBAI: Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt. On Monday, it tabled its first Budget after its landslide win in the assembly polls. It reveals that the state faces the highest debt projection in its history at Rs 9.3 lakh crore and the steepest revenue deficit (gap between income and expenditure) at an estimated Rs 45,891 crores for 25-26.With little financial elbow room, the Budget does not offer new big-ticket schemes. Promises in Mahayuti poll manifesto, including a hike in stipend of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month and a farm loan waiver, have been kept aside for another day. Instead, the Budget has focused on keeping existing schemes going and in trying to keep its debt and fiscal deficit within prescribed limits.Indeed, the estimated outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme, whose beneficiaries are being scrutinised and trimmed, is Rs 10,000 crore lower than last year. The estimated allocation is Rs 36,000 crore for Rs 2025-26.With local body polls looming, the Budget has hiked the district annual plan by 11% from Rs 18,165 crore to an estimated Rs 20,165 crore. In a gesture towards social justice, it has hiked the proposed scheduled caste component of the annual plan by 42% and the tribal component by an estimated 40%. It proposes new taxes, mainly related to motor vehicles, which are expected to generate revenue of Rs 1,125 crore. It has also hiked stamp duty on certain transactions.The financial strain is apparent in the figures. The debt projection is Rs 2 lakh crore, higher than it was in 2024-25 when the figure was Rs 7.1 lakh crore. It is almost thrice as high as it was a decade ago. Its revenue deficit – the gap between the state’s income and expenditure — is more than twice the estimate last year, which was Rs 20,051 crore.However, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who controls the finance portfolio, emphasised that the debt and fiscal deficit were within fiscal limits.The state’s fiscal deficit is estimated at 2.76% of its GSDP. Also, the estimated debt is 18.7% of GSDP while the prescribed limit is 25%.The infrastructure projects are mainly ongoing projects for which no fresh outlay has been mentioned.","Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt.

PATNA: For the second time in a week, chief minister Nitish Kumar and his predecessor Rabri Devi engaged in a heated exchange in the Bihar Legislative Council on Wednesday.While Nitish said Rabri was the “CM of circumstances”, the former CM accused the JD(U) leader of “insulting the women folks”.Trouble began when CPI-ML member, Shashi Yadav, rose from her seat to submit before the House that she was not satisfied with the govt’s reply to her question. The CM reacted by saying the govt is doing so much for women while the previous govt did nothing. This irked Rabri, who rose to intervene, asking the govt to bring the records of that period to know what was done by the previous govt.Reacting sharply to her observations, Nitish accused RJD chief Lalu Prasad of installing his wife as the CM when he was forced to step down. Rabri hit back, accusing the CM of “disrespecting” all women folk through his words, alleging no substantial work was done under his leadership before staging a walkout with opposition members in protest.Rabri first became the CM in 1997 when her husband Lalu Prasad resigned as CM, after the CBI submitted a chargesheet against him in the multi-crore fodder scam. She ruled the state for eight years.Nitish in his speech had informed the House how his govt had done a lot for every class, including women, who were granted 50% reservation in panchayati raj institutions and how it launched several initiatives to empower the women. He reiterated that he won’t go back to the opposition alliance any more asserting “Ab sab din ke liye saath rahange...idhar-udhar nahin jayenge (I won’t waver, will remain with the NDA always).”","Rabri first became the CM in 1997 when her husband Lalu Prasad resigned as CM, after the CBI submitted a chargesheet against him in the multi-crore fodder scam.

‘Indians among our biggest job applicants:’ Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indians-among-our-biggest-job-applicants-riyadh-air-ceo-tony-douglas/articleshow/118932650.cms,":

NEW DELHI: Aviation industry personnel in India have made a beeline for joining Saudi Arabia’s soon to be launched second national carrier Riyadh Air. The airline website’s career portal has been open for two years on which pilots, cabin crew members, ground, maintenance staff and others can evince interest by submitting their details. “In the last two years, we have received 14 lakh applications from 146 nationalities of which 52% are women. India is one of the biggest source countries for the applications. We are overwhelmed by the interest and faith in our brand despite the fact that so far we have not announced any salary structures,” Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas said here Wednesday.The upcoming full service airline has ordered up to 132 aircraft, Airbus A321neos and Boeing 787 Dreamliners. It is currently in talks with both Boeing and Airbus for placing orders for ultra long range wide bodies with the choice being between the B777 9X and A350-1000. It currently has one aircraft and 500 employees, including 36 cabin crew and pilots each. “After Saudis, the second biggest nationality of employees is Indians. Ditto for the population of Singapore,” he said.The airline, which is going to start operations in a few months, says India is a key market for it. “In 2024 Saudi Arabia saw 15 lakh tourists from India which was a 50% jump over previous year. Ninety-three per cent of flyers at Riyadh are point to point and just 7% are in transit. That shows the scope of growth from India as well as of our connecting potential from our hub, Riyadh, as our fleet grows. Nearby Doha has 80% transfer traffic and the figures for Dubai are also very high,” Douglas said.The Saudi Tourism Authority aims to welcome 75 lakh visitors from India per annum by the close of the decade. Unlike Dubai, Qatar, Singapore and many other countries/regions, Saudi still has a lot of unutilized bilaterals or flying rights for India that Riyadh Air will use. The CEO and his team are meeting both IndiGo and Air India management to discuss partnerships with them. “We have made good partnerships like Delta for North America; two airlines in China and some other countries. We have two gaps, one in northwestern Europe and the other in India which is a huge market,” he said. The Riyadh Air delegation will meet the officials at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for “requisite permissions and support to launch India operations.”Douglas said“India has long been a crucial part of Riyadh Air’s network planning ahead of our operations launch. India is a beautiful nation which will play a big part in the success story of our airline, as travel and business opportunities multiply with the expanded offerings we are set to provide. Beyond connecting people, fostering economic growth, and enhancing and diversifying the Saudi Arabian and Indian tourism sectors, Riyadh Air’s network will help develop even stronger bonds between the two great countries.”","The airline website’s career portal has been open for two years on which pilots, cabin crew members, ground, maintenance staff and others can evince interest by submitting their details. “In the last two years, we have received 14 lakh applications from 146 nationalities of which 52% are women,” Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118932629,imgsize-853913,width-400,resizemode-4/118932629.jpg"

LUCKNOW: Posters of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath at a rally in Kathmandu to welcome former Nepal king Gyanendra Bir Shah has created a flutter in the Himalayan country, though the ties of its erstwhile monarchy with Gorakhsh Peeth, headed by Yogi, is centuries old.The Shah dynasty , which ruled Nepal till monarchy was abolished in May 2008, calls itself Gorakhpanthi, or the follower of Guru Gorakhnath. Yogi was even called by the pro-monarchy group in 2015 to address a rally in Kathmandu, where he had made a strong pitch for reinstatement of Nepal’s ‘ Hindu nation ’ status.“Nepal has 82% Hindus, and a significant number of them revere Nath sect’s Guru Gorakhnath and his spiritual mentor, Guru Matseyndranath. For them, the Communist dispensation and China’s growing influence has not been conducive, leading to clamour for restoration of monarchy as well as Nepal’s status as a Hindu nation,” said a political analyst.Pradeep Bikram Rana, who claimed to have waved the Yogi poster at the Sunday rally, reached Gorakhpur on Tuesday. He claimed he was being persecuted by the authorities in Kathmandu, forcing him to flee. Rana admitted to idolising Yogi as a symbol of Hindu pride. “The connection between Nepal’s former ruling dynasty and Gorakhsh Peeth is very old,” says Dwarika Tiwari, who has been looking after the mutt’s administration since 1972. King Birendra, who was assassinated along with his entire family in 2001, shared a strong bond with Mahant Avaidyanath , Yogi’s guru.“Even today, when monarchy has ended in Nepal, an offering of Rs 10,000 during Makar Sankranti, Rs 5,000 on first king’s birthday and Rs 5,000 on Dussehra is sent by the royal family to Goraksh Peeth . The temple sends ‘prasad’ to the family through a representative every year,” Tiwari told TOI. “There is a legend that Guru Gorakhnath had blessed Prithvi Shah — considered the first king of modern Nepal — when he was a boy that his empire would flourish and expand wherever he would go. It is after this that Nepal, which was divided into several provinces, was unified.”","The Shah dynasty, which ruled Nepal till monarchy was abolished in May 2008, calls itself Gorakhpanthi.

NEW DELHI: The post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault, ruling out a “terrorist attack” angle.The trauma injuries , including to their heads, point to their death by “accidental fall from a height,” said sources.Sharing this, sources in the J&K govt also told TOI that two more minors, who went missing from the same district — they were reported by their family as missing only a couple of days ago though they have been gone since Feb 28 — had an argument with their family and possibly left home to work elsewhere on daily wages.This, the sources said, has happened before with the cousins, aged 12 and 15 and both herders, staying away from their family home for days to do daily-wage jobs. The police are making enquiries with their relatives and past employers to trace them.As per the post-mortem reports of the three Kathua residents — identified as Darshan Singh, 40, Yogesh Singh, 32, and Varun Singh, 15 — whose bodies were discovered on March 8 in a gorge next to a waterfall, the cause of their death was trauma and head injury, purportedly caused by their accidentally slipping in the dark, down a rocky gorge. A backpack carried by one of them got stuck on a branch as they fell. A mobile used by them was also recovered from the spot. A liquor bottle with half of its contents consumed was found, pointing to possible inebriated state of the two adults.“Their viscera reports are now awaited for further insight into the cause and circumstances of the deaths,” said a source.Interviews with the family members of the three deceased persons, who were on their way to a wedding in Lohai Malhar, revealed that they were in touch with them over phone till the evening of March 5 and had even communicated that they had lost their way while moving with wedding party. However, a couple of hours later their phones were found to be switched off.","Post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault.

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah backed his Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin’s campaign against the proposed population-based delimitation exercise with a call to action on Wednesday, contrasting with his deputy DK Shivakumar calling for a nuanced approach based on the party high command’s “final call”.A Tamil Nadu delegation met Siddaramaiah in Bengaluru and Stalin reached out to him over phone, proposing a joint action committee consisting of representatives of several states to collectively oppose the delimitation move.A statement from the CMO confirmed Karnataka’s alignment with the protest against what the southern states call “an undemocratic stance” to carry out delimitation without everyone on board.Stalin requested Karnataka to nominate a senior Congress representative to coordinate a unified strategy. A preliminary meeting is scheduled for March 22 in Chennai.The delegation led by TN forest minister K Ponmudy and Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Abdullah Ismail discussed with Siddaramaiah the need to challenge the alleged bias against southern states, the CMO said. Siddaramaiah said Congress “unequivocally condemns all actions of the Union govt that are against Karnataka’s interest, weaken democracy and go against the federal principles of the Constitution”.The proposed joint action committee could have members from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Odisha and Punjab. DMK has been reaching out to functionaries across party lines, including NDA allies like Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu.Shivakumar said DMK being Congress’s ally, the party appreciated its stance. “However, as a national party, we must consult our high command and proceed based on their guidance.”DMK member D M Kathir Anand in Lok Sabha on Wednesday said the impending delimitation exercise penalises progressive states like Tamil Nadu which have controlled population growth and asked the govt to ensure equitable representation of all states in Parliament and state assemblies.Flagging the issue during Zero Hour, he said, “ Govt should consider economic performance and vital indices like GSDP, per capita income, infrastructure improvement and not just population while doing the delimitation exercise”.The delimitation issue was also raised by BJP member Nishikant Dubey who flagged instances of Bangladeshi infiltrators entering India through the borders of West Bengal, and said Centre should exclude them when conducting delimitation.",Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah backed his Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin’s campaign against the proposed population-based delimitation exercise.

NEW DELHI: Socialite Shalini Passi , wife of businessman Sanjay Passi , has been summoned by the Meerut unit of Directorate General of GST Intelligence ( DGGI ) for questioning on Thursday in a case of alleged Goods and Services Tax evasion.According to sources, the matter pertains to alleged short payment of GST by Pasco Motors LLP of which she was a partner. Shalini Passi shot to fame after starring in the ‘Fablous Lives of Bollywood Housewives’ on Netflix.Pasco Motors LLP is an authorised dealer of Tata Motors and is in the business of sale of heavy motor vehicles, both chassis and fully built buses and trucks. The tax intelligence department had earlier served summons to Sanjay Passi and other executives of Pasco Motors but they are yet to join the investigation.J K Mittal, lawyer of Sanjay Passi, has denied any tax evasion and told TOI that the allegations are false. “GST summons issued by the DGGI is malafide and the information of tax evasion is not mentioned in the said summon at all,” he said, adding that the matter has already been challenged in the Punjab and Haryana HC and is presently sub judice. Mittal also confirmed that Shalini Passi was a partner in Pasco Motors LLP and DGGI was making an inquiry into alleged “short payment of GST” as mentioned in the summons.Sources said while supplying fully built-up buses and trucks, Pasco Motors issues a single invoice but splits the total value into two components: the value of the chassis, which is charged at a GST rate of 28%, and the value of body fabrication, which is charged at a GST rate of 18%.“As per the law, if a bus body builder constructs and supplies a fully built-up bus, the entire supply should be taxed at flat 28% GST. Therefore, Pasco Motors LLP is evading GST by charging different GST rates for the chassis and body fabrications in a single invoice,” a source said.GST Intelligence has asked the company to clarify the differential rate of GST billed to customers and provide supporting documents. After queries remained unanswered, the agency sent summons to the company and its partners to record statements and ensure compliance. Generally, summonses are issued after non-compliance and non-cooperation by the other party.",Shalini Passi shot to fame after starring in the ‘Fablous Lives of Bollywood Housewives’ on Netflix.

BENGALURU: Within 24 hours of announcing a CID probe into a police escort being provided to actor Ranya Rao at Bengaluru airport , where she was arrested by DRI sleuths last week for allegedly smuggling 14.2 kg gold from Dubai, Karnataka govt has withdrawn the nod for the investigation.Sources said the U-turn follows pressure from certain quarters, which feared any disclosure by the police constable intercepted by central revenue sleuths while escorting Ranya, daughter of DGP (Karnataka Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao, could put the police brass in a tight spot. The state home department justified the withdrawal, citing another investigation being carried out by senior IAS officer and additional chief secretary Gaurav Gupta to ascertain the role of the state protocol wing and that of DGP Rao.The head constable, identified as Basavaraj from the airport police station, on Tuesday gave a statement to CBI that he had “only complied with oral instructions from senior IPS officers” regarding receiving and dropping their family members at the airport, and had no clue about gold smuggling.On why the CID probe was withdrawn, a senior IPS officer said cryptically: “The CID probe was ordered by the home department; the decision to withdraw it, too, was made by the home department.”","Karnataka govt withdraws a CID probe into a police escort provided to actor Ranya Rao at Bengaluru airport.

WASHINTON: The Trump White House on Tuesday flagged New Delhi’s tariffs on American bourbon, accounting for a pittance of overall US exports, as a contentious issue at a time the World Health Organisation has said no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health.Ignoring India’s lowering of duty on American bourbon from 150% to 100% just before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Feb 13 visit to Washington, Trump’s spokesperson Karoline Leavitt insisted on Tuesday that India’s 150% tariff on American alcohol is unhelpful, even as the US President was outside promoting Tesla, which is also making inroads into India much to his disapproval of a prospective manufacturing facility there.“Look at India, 150% tariff on American alcohol. Do you think that’s helping Kentucky Bourbon be exported to India? I don’t think so,” Leavitt raged at the WH press briefing, pulling out what she called a “handy-dandy chart” of tariffs imposed by various countries on American products.“President Trump believes in reciprocity and it is about dang time that we have a president who actually looks out for the interests of American businesses and workers,” Leavitt fumed, even as Trump’s erratic tariff policy that changes by the day has caused turmoil in global markets.Leavitt also seemed not to take note of India’s well-publicised lowering of tariffs on bourbon from 150% to 50%, with an additional tax of 50%, bringing down the overall duty to 100%.Much of the grandstanding appeared to involve domestic politics where Kentucky, the fount of American bourbon and a solid red Republican state, has a Democratic governor who defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in the 2023 gubernatorial elections.India is a pitifully small market in the mini-millions for American spirits, which itself accounts for only around $2.2 billion — of about $3 trillion overall US global exports — with Europe being the major market for American alcohol.American whiskeys account for 63% of all US spirits exports, reaching $1.4 billion in 2023.But renowned for its fried chicken, Kentucky wants to supplement it with bourbon to India, a whisky-loving country that is famously said to drink more Scotch than is manufactured in Scotland. Kentucky’s Republican lawmakers eager to advance the state’s economy and keep it solidly red have taken note of India’s lowering of duties on bourbon but that’s inadequate for the White House.“Big win for Kentucky’s signature bourbon industry! Due to President Trump’s leadership, India is cutting tariffs on bourbon by 50%, expanding the global marketplace for our distillers. I met with treasury secretary Bessent and incoming commerce secretary Lutnick to ensure America’s signature spirit is treated fairly in all corners of the world,” Andy Barr, a GOP congressman from the state, said recently.But for a White House intoxicated with the prospect of making America richer, that’s not enough.It wants India to drink more, never mind the WHO advisory that alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen which also includes asbestos, radiation, and tobacco.","India is a pitifully small market in the mini-millions for American spirits, which itself accounts for only around $2.2 billion.

In an ingenious move, a group of villagers in Odisha’s Bhadrak district deployed a drone to monitor the movement of a thief who took refuge in a water body early on Wednesday and caught him after a couple of hours of vigil.Earlier, they captured the accomplice of the thief, foiling the duo’s bid to steal midday meal rice from the village school. The incident from Charibatia village took place at around 2am on Wednesday when locals spotted four people attempting to steal rice stored at the local school. As villagers raised an alarm and gave chase, one of the thieves jumped into a nearby pond while his accomplices fled. Villagers, though, caught one of them while two others managed to escape.“We promptly surrounded the pond and used dry grass to create a ring of fire around its perimeter. We kept vigil using a drone to monitor the pond aerially, ensuring the thief could not escape,” Manas Mohanty, a villager, said.",Villagers in Odisha's Bhadrak district deployed a drone to monitor the movement of a thief who took refuge in a water body.

Result shows people’s faith in BJP: Modi

CHANDIGARH: BJP dominated the municipal polls in Haryana, winning nine of the 10 mayoral seats Wednesday and dealing another heavy blow to Congress after the saffron party’s resounding assembly election victory to retain office for a third consecutive term last Oct.BJP’s triumph in the polls held on March 2 extended across key municipal corporations, including Gurgaon, Faridabad, Hisar, Rohtak, Karnal, Yamunanagar, Panipat, Ambala, and Sonipat. The lone exception was Manesar, where Union minister Rao Inderjeet Singh-backed independent candidate Inderjeet Yadav clinched victory.Woman candidates secured seven of the 10 mayoral positions. BJP’s Parveen Joshi won the mayoral post in Faridabad, defeating Congress’s Lata Rani by the largest margin of 316,852 votes.CM Nayab Singh Saini hailed BJP’s sweeping victory as a public endorsement of the party’s governance. “The results show that people want a ‘triple-engine’ govt and approve of our development work,” he said.State local bodies minister Vipul Goel presented the results in assembly, saying BJP also claimed 90% of the councillor seats.Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda suffered a setback in his stronghold of Rohtak, where BJP retained the mayoral seat despite Congress holding both LS and assembly seats in the region. Congress MLA Vinesh Phogat also failed to secure a win in Julana, where BJP candidates won the municipal committee polls.Hooda downplayed the defeat, attributing it to a focus on “local issues and bhaichara (brotherhood)” rather than party politics. “If you check the final tally, you may find more Congress councillors this time,” he said.Congress functionary Capt Ajay Yadav pointed to a weak grassroots structure as a key factor in the party’s poor performance.Three members of a Yadav family — Deepak, his wife Rashmi, and his brother Pawan —won as independent candidates in Faridabad’s municipal councillor elections.BJP lost in Kaithal district, where independents defeated the party nominees in Siwan, Kalayat and Pundri municipal committees.BJP’s sweep of urban body polls in Haryana on Wednesday had BJP in a joyous mood, with PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah leading the celebrations. This victory is an expression of unwavering faith of the people in the development work being carried out by the Saini govt, Modi said, adding, “I assure the people of the state that we will leave no stone unturned to fulfil their hopes and aspirations.”Shah congratulated CM Saini and state party chief Mohan Lal Badauli for the victory. “Haryana has faith only in Modi ji. After the landslide victory in the Haryana polls, I am very grateful to the people of Haryana for giving their blessings to BJP in the civic poll as well,” he said. Under the leadership of Modi ji, BJP has become the first choice of people from the ward to the Vidhan Sabha, and from the panchayat to Parliament,” he said on X.","Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini hailed BJP’s sweeping victory as a public endorsement of the party's governance. “The results show that people want a ‘triple-engine’ govt and approve of our development work,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118949888,imgsize-136958,width-400,resizemode-4/118949888.jpg"

"Coming soon, curbs on carrying power banks on aircraft",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coming-soon-curbs-on-carrying-power-banks-on-aircraft/articleshow/124752579.cms,"Representative AI image

NEW DELHI: India may soon adopt stricter rules for power banks carriage onboard aircraft following recent instances worldwide, including one in the country, of lithium-ion batteries catching fire. Last Sunday a passenger's power bank had caught fire on a Delhi-Dimapur flight when the aircraft was taxiing at the origin. Now, the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is “taking up this issue,” said a senior official.The regulator is learnt to be taking technical inputs on the issue and examining the options. While its decision could be known shortly, foreign airlines are increasingly putting restrictions on power banks. These include letting passengers carry only one power bank under 100 Watt Hours onboard but not use the same for charging any personal electronic devices (PED) or charging the power bank using the in-seat power supply system.Some foreign carriers even require the power bank to be kept in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front and not in the overhead bins so that if they catch fire, the same is quickly detected and doused by cabin crew.It will soon be known if Indian carriers are also required to follow any or some of these practices.Dubai-based mega airline Emirates has from Oct 1, 2025, “prohibited” using any kind of power bank on its flights. While it allows a passenger to carry one power bank under 100 Watt Hours but they can neither use it to charge any PED, nor charge the power bank in an aircraft cabin using the aircrafts’ power source. The new regulations also mandates that “all power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available. ”Emirates website says: “There has been a significant growth in customers using power banks in recent years, resulting in an increasing number of lithium battery-related incidents onboard flights across the wider aviation industry. Power banks primarily utilise lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries…. If the battery is overcharged or damaged, it may result in ‘thermal runaway’ (wherein) heat generation within a battery cell exceeds its ability to dissipate heat, leading to a rapid and uncontrollable temperature increase. This can result in dangerous consequences like fire, explosions, and the release of toxic gases.”Most phones and sophisticated lithium battery-powered devices have an internal trickle system which slowly adds current into the battery to prevent overcharging, but many basic power banks may not have this safeguard, increasing the risk.Singapore Airlines from April 1, 2025, does not allow flyers to charge portable power banks via the onboard USB ports, or use power banks to charge their personal devices, throughout the duration of the flight.The concern is real. Last week there was a case of lithium battery fire onboard an Air China flight from China to South Korea. Flight CA139, traveling from Hangzhou to Incheon was forced to divert to Shanghai for this reason. Then last Sunday, an IndiGo plane taxiing at Delhi to take off for Dimapur saw the same thing. Crew extinguished the fire and the aircraft returned to the terminal.In 2016, a particular model of mobile phone was barred from aircraft globally after there were several instances of it catching fire.","Last Sunday a passenger's power bank had caught fire on a Delhi-Dimapur flight.

Protecting Palk Strait’s fragile ecology crucial to India and Lanka: Justice Surya Kant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/protecting-palk-straits-fragile-ecology-crucial-to-india-and-lanka-justice-surya-kant/articleshow/124751702.cms,"Justice Surya Kant (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Wednesday said a vigorous collaborative effort must be made to protect the fragile yet crucial ecology of Palk Strait that geographically divide India and Sri Lanka and argued that judiciaries of the two countries have given rulings that has sensitized the executive towards this goal.Speaking on the “Indo-Sri Lanka Policy Dialogue: Environmental Sustainability and Regional Cooperation” at Colombo, Justice Kant said, “Judicial pronouncements influence Executive behaviour, compel environmental reporting, and often drive policy reform. The potential for structured judicial dialogue could formalise this exchange and strengthen the normative coherence of environmental law between the two jurisdictions. ”He said the time is ripe for the two judiciaries to champion a model of regional environmental constitutionalism - recognizing that certain imminent environmental rights and duties transcend borders.“Environmental cooperation between India and Sri Lanka is not a matter of charity or diplomacy - it is a matter of survival. The Bay of Bengal does not divide us; it binds us through a shared ecological fate,” he said.Referring to routine confrontation between Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen, Justice Kant said it epitomises a deeper ecological tragedy - competition for an exhausted resource base. “The impact of climate change and, consequently, rising sea levels threatens coastal zones in both Tamil Nadu and Northern Sri Lanka,” he said.Recounting the impact of the 2004 tsunami and recurring cyclones, he said both countries have experienced how environmental disasters transcend political borders. However, there is a lack of an integrated transboundary environmental governance mechanism, which may be a result of multiple factors, including inconsistent data collection, considering that environmental impact assessments rarely take cross-border effects into account, he said.India and Sri Lanka have, for centuries, been closely connected not merely by culture and trade, but by the ecology of the Indian Ocean itself, he said, adding that as environmental degradation accelerates, our shared geography imposes a collective responsibility.“The Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar are biodiversity hotspots, home to coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and endangered species. Yet these regions are under severe stress. Overfishing, destructive trawling practices, and unregulated coastal construction have caused ecosystem collapse in parts of this marine environment,” Justice Kant said.","Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, said a vigorous collaborative effort must be made to protect the fragile yet crucial ecology of Palk Strait.

India rises to ninth spot globally in forest area: FAO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-rises-to-ninth-spot-globally-in-forest-area-fao/articleshow/124750833.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: India has improved its global rank to ninth in terms of forest area as compared to 10th in the previous assessment, and maintained its third position in terms of annual net gain, showed the latest Global Forest Resource Assessment (GFRA) report.Released every five years by UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the report’s 2025 edition noted that though overall deforestation has slowed in all regions globally in the last decade, forest ecosystems worldwide continue to face challenges as the current rate of deforestation at 10.9 million hectares per year is still too high.Fire affected an average of 261 million hectares of land annually, nearly half of which is forested, whereas insects, diseases and severe weather damaged about 41 million hectares of forests, mainly in temperate and boreal regions in 2020, the report released in Bali on Tuesday underlined.Globally, forests cover 4.14 billion hectares which accounts for nearly one-third (32 percent) of the global land area, equivalent to 0.5 hectares per person. Nearly half of the world’s forests are located in the tropics.“The achievement comes on the back of Modi government's planning and policies for protection and enhancement of the forest and massive plantation efforts by state governments,” said Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav while reacting to India’s improved global rank in 2025 compared to its previous position.Yadav on X attributed India’s achievement to the Prime Minister Modi’s call to plant trees under 'Ek Ped Ma ke Naam' (a tree in tribute to mother) campaign and “push for environmental consciousness” which, he said, are building awareness and increasing involvement of communities and individuals for afforestation. “This will ensure a greener tomorrow for generations to come,” the minister posted on Wednesday.GFRA, based on official national data, has put India’s forest cover at 72.7 million hectares in 2025, accounting for roughly 2 percent of the world forest area. According to India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023, the country’s forest cover stands at 71.5 million hectares.Globally, Russia has the highest forest cover (832.6 million hectares) followed by Brazil (486 million hectares), Canada (368.8 million hectares), the USA (308.8 million hectares), China (227 million hectares), Congo (139 million hectares), Australia (133.5 million hectares), Indonesia (96 million hectares), India (72.7 million hectares) and Peru (67 million hectares). In fact, more than half (54%) of the total world forest area is concentrated in just five countries — Russia, Brazil, Canada, the United States and China.In terms of forest expansion, China recorded the highest annual net gain in forest area between 2015 and 2025 at 1.69 million hectares per year, followed by Russia (9,42,000 hectares), India (1,91,000 hectares), Türkiye (1,18,000 ha), Australia (1,05,000 ha), France (95,900 ha), Indonesia (94,100 ha), South Africa (87,600 ha), Canada (82,500 ha) and Vietnam (72,800 ha).The assessment report shows that Asia is the only region to record an increase in forest area between 1990 and 2025, led by gains in China and India.It shows that 91 countries reported agroforestry of 55.4 million ha in 2025. The majority (39.3 million ha) of this area is in Asia, mostly South and Southeast Asia, with India and Indonesia accounting for almost 100% of the regional total and for 70% of the global total.“FRAs are the most comprehensive and transparent global evaluations of forest resources and their condition, management and uses, covering all the thematic elements of sustainable forest management. The data they produce serve multiple purposes, from informing the global community of the status of forests and their changes, to supporting decisions, policies and investments related to forests and the ecosystem services they provide,” said FAO director-general, QU Dongyu, in the foreword to the report.","India has improved its global rank to ninth in terms of forest area as compared to 10th in the previous assessment.

Water ATMs and fishing for profit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/water-atms-and-fishing-for-profit/articleshow/124750796.cms,"Water sourced from coal mines is potentially valuable for much more than just domestic use. Beyond direct supply, several innovative projects are in development. In 2019, Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) pioneered a plant producing ‘Coal Neer’ — a bottled drinking water brand — near Nagpur, providing purified water to villagers and creating an income source for women’s self-help groups (SHGs). Similarly, the Atal Community Innovation Centre (ACIC) at IIT-ISM in Dhanbad is working on deploying water ATMs that will treat mine water at multiple levels to provide clean drinking water to the public at a nominal cost.“We have piloted a model for pure drinking water (PARAM JAL) incubated at the ACIC IIT (ISM) Foundation. We’ve already set up a 24X7 coin/UPI water-vending ATM, where discharged mine water is being treated to provide drinking water to people at a nominal cost of Rs 10 for 10 litres. Along with Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC), we are now working to set up these ATMs in five more places under the DMFT scheme,” said Akansha Sinha, CEO of ACIC.The use of mine voids is not limited to potable water. These are also emerging as a major source of livelihood. Studies by the College of Fisheries at Birsa Agricultural University in Ranchi have shown that abandoned opencast pits in Jharkhand can be transformed into fish farms.This is being achieved through targeted interventions — such as adding organic manure and fertilisers — to manage water quality and deployment of innovative aeration systems.Sashikar Mahto (38), secretary of Kuju Fisheries Cooperative Society in Ramgarh’s Kuju region, has emerged as a poster boy for mine-water fishing. Today, he leads a network of close to 70 local youths engaged in fisheries in CCL’s abandoned Ara mine numbers 8 and 13 in Kuju, with the local administration lending a helping hand.“While we began on our own a decade back, the local administration gave it a push through some funding two years ago. Today, a total of 22 (fisheries) cages have been set up that yield 50-60 tonnes of fish annually,” he said.Shambhu Prasad Yadav, deputy director of the state fisheries department, said, “Fish rearing is being done across 28 abandoned coal and stone pits across 12 districts of Jharkhand through 771 cages. Average production of fish from each cage is about three tonnes per annum.”","In 2019, Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) pioneered a plant producing ‘Coal Neer’ — a bottled drinking water brand.

""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

NEW DELHI: Punjabi singer Teji Kahlon was shot in Canada in an attack claimed by associates of gangster Rohit Godara, highlighting an ongoing transnational gang feud.In a social media post, the men named Mahender Saran Dilana, Rahul Rinau, and Vicky Phalwan said Kahlon was targeted for allegedly supplying weapons and money to rival gangs and acting as an informant.""We carried out the shooting in Canada at Teji Kahlon. He was shot in the stomach. If he understands, fine. If not, next time we will finish him,"" the statement read.The post accused Kahlon of providing financial support and arms to competing gangs and of informing on their members. Local authorities in Canada are investigating the attack.Earlier this month, 40-year-old businessman Ramesh Rulania was shot dead while exercising at a gym in Rajasthan’s Kuchaman town.Police said the assailant entered the gym around 5:20 am and shot Rulania at close range before fleeing. CCTV footage captured the gunman entering the premises shortly before the attack.Officials suspect the murder may be connected to an extortion threat Rulania had received from the Rohit Godara gang, which operates across western Rajasthan, including Didwana and Kuchaman districts. Several other businessmen in the region have reportedly received similar threats.Rohit Godara, also known as Rawatram Swami, is a notorious gangster from Lunkaransar in Bikaner.Police say he may be linked to several high-profile killings, including the December 2022 murder of gangster Raju Thehat in Sikar, the May 2022 killing of popular Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, and the December 2023 killing of Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi—both of which Godara reportedly claimed responsibility for.",Punjabi singer Teji Kahlon was shot in Canada in an attack claimed by associates of gangster Rohit Godara.

Lack of real match practice for India’s star batters Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shreyas Iyer could hurt India’s ODI plans leading up to the 2027 World Cup. The recent Perth ODI against Australia was a small warning sign.Kohli, Rohit, and Iyer form India’s top four, but all three are currently playing only one format. Rohit and Virat have retired from T20Is and Tests, while Shreyas Iyer, who has taken a six-month break from red-ball cricket, is not part of India’s T20I setup for the upcoming World Cup in February next year.The Indian cricket team was slated to play 27 ODIs according to the ICC’s Future Tours Program (FTP) 2023–27. The three-match ODI series against Bangladesh, which was scheduled for August, has been postponed, and the first ODI at Perth was not a promising start for India’s quest for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Rohit, Virat, and Shreyas lasted just 46 balls between them, managing only 19 runs.Rohit and Virat were playing a competitive match after a gap of five months and looked rusty. Meanwhile, Shreyas, who has played for India A and in the Duleep Trophy, had his technical flaws exposed again. Both Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who stand six feet six inches tall, have a high release point of almost 2.15 metres (nearly 7.05 feet).Whatever length they bowled, the duo generated extra bounce, with almost every ball hitting the top half of the bat. Perth was a bouncy track, and India’s top order looked all at sea.The ball that dismissed Rohit Sharma wasn’t particularly short, but it rose sharply to armpit height outside the off-stump, striking the upper portion of Rohit’s bat. He could have left it alone, but ended up poking at it. The unexpected bounce surprised him; yet it wasn’t due to the pitch — it was Hazlewood’s skill that gave it its sting.Virat Kohli, who registered his first duck on Australian soil, was also troubled by that length. Starc and Hazlewood had troubled Kohli in the past too. In 10 ODI innings, Hazlewood had dismissed Kohli five times — averaging a wicket every second innings. But it was Hazlewood’s new-ball partner, Starc, who sent Kohli back. Kohli went for a booming shot, chasing the ball away from his body, and Cooper Connolly, patrolling at backward point, took a spectacular catch. It was a shot born out of desperation to get off the mark, which we have rarely seen from Kohli in a format where he is an undisputed king.Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer’s struggles against short-pitched balls are well documented. The newly appointed ODI vice-captain had been prolific in the last two 50-over ICC tournaments. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, he was India’s leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings. Iyer had hammered 530 runs during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He had been pivotal in India’s success in both tournaments, but in Perth, Hazlewood exposed a chink in Shreyas’ armour again. Relentless Hazlewood denied Shreyas any width, hitting the deck hard and creating an angle from a good length, which tangled Shreyas up. As he tried to adjust and negate the extra bounce, rising around his ribs, the ball ended up brushing his gloves.The three dismissals have raised eyebrows as the next World Cup will be held in South Africa, where pitches will be bouncy. India will play only two away ODI series to tackle the bounce factor: the ongoing three-match series against world champions Australia, and another against England in July 2026. However, the spice in English pitches has lessened, as it doesn’t suit their “Bazball” approach.In the case of Shreyas, he is playing for India A and, after taking a break from four-day cricket, will likely be available for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. But the big question is whether the two senior stars, Kohli and Rohit, will play domestic 50-over tournaments to stay match-ready. It doesn’t matter how hard they train in the nets; having played enough cricket, they know there is no substitute for real match scenarios.Since Rohit and Virat now play only one format, their rustiness was visible in the first outing. Playing just the IPL won’t guarantee them a spot in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup squad. If they want to pursue their broken November 19 dream and win the trophy in South Africa, they must play domestic cricket to stay match-fit. If they choose not to, they are doing a disservice to Indian cricket and their own reputations.After India’s Test series win against West Indies in New Delhi, coach Gautam Gambhir was asked , “Are Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still part of India’s plans for the 2027 World Cup?”Gambhir said: “Look, the 50-over World Cup is still two-and-a-half years away, and it is very important to stay in the present. Obviously, they are quality players; their experience will be invaluable in Australia as well. Hopefully, those two will have a successful tour, and more importantly, the team will have a successful series.”Gambhir may have dodged the big question, but he knows the clock is ticking. If he and Shubman Gill want India to take a step forward in 2027, they will need their ageing superstars match-ready. If not, India must blood talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Tilak Verma, giving them limited matches to prepare for the 2027 ODI World Cup.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer produced paltry returns in the first ODI vs Australia in Perth. All three are currently playing only one format for India. Lack of real match practice could hurt India’s ODI plans leading up to the 2027 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday penned a letter to citizens on the occasion of Deepavali , highlighting the festival as a time of energy, enthusiasm, and reflection on the nation’s achievements. In his message, he noted that this is the second Deepavali after the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and emphasised Lord Shri Ram’s teachings on righteousness and courage in fighting injustice.PM Modi referred to “Operation Sindoor” as a recent example of upholding justice, adding that the festival is particularly special this year as lamps will be lit in many districts, including remote areas, where Naxalism and Maoist terrorism have been eradicated.

This is the second Deepavali after the grand construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Lord Shri Ram teaches us to uphold righteousness and also gives us the courage to fight injustice. We have seen a living example of this a few months ago during Operation Sindoor . During Operation Sindoor, Bharat not only upheld righteousness but also avenged injustice,"" he said.""This Deepavali is particularly special because, for the first time, lamps will be lit in many districts across the country, including remote areas.

Despite the recent show of bonhomie between PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, India and the US again seemed at odds over talks between the leaders as the Indian government denied that they discussed Pakistan in Trump’s Diwali phone call to Modi.It’s also learnt that India is exploring the possibility of Modi addressing the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings in Malaysia virtually later this week, apparently because of the elections in Bihar. This would rule out any likelihood in the near future of an in-person encounter with Trump. The US president said this week he will be in Malaysia for the annual event. He is unlikely to travel though to South Africa for the G20 summit next month, where Modi will be present.Modi has rarely skipped in-person participation in the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings. The PM had earlier this month declined Egypt’s invitation for the Gaza peace summit that was co-chaired by Trump. India has not been enthused by the prospect of a meeting with Trump in the absence of any breakthrough in the trade negotiations, as also the president’s claims ad nauseam about having ended a war between India and Pakistan, but government sources said the likely decision to opt out of in-person participation may also be related to the focus on Bihar elections Trump said at a Diwali event on Tuesday that he had spoken to Modi and that they had also discussed the need to avoid a war between India and Pakistan. The PM had later in a post on X expressed hope that the 2 countries will stand united against terrorism in all its forms, venting India’s concerns about Islamabad’s growing proximity with Washington under Trump but without naming Pakistan.“Pakistan was not discussed during the phone call between the PM and President Trump,” said a source here, on condition of anonymity.This was the second time in the past 2 weeks that India has denied Trump’s claim that he has tagged to conversations with Modi. India had said last week it wasn’t aware of the conversation between Modi and Trump during which, according to Trump, the Indian PM assured him India would stop buying oil from Russia.The India-US relationship has been making headlines because of the differences over trade but Trump’s unabashed courting of Pakistan has also been a source of unease in bilateral ties for India. Even as India maintains that the ceasefire after Operation Sindoor in May was directly negotiated between the 2 militaries, Trump has not backed down from his claim that he ended the conflict with his threat to impose trade tariffs on India and Pakistan. The relationship saw a dramatic downturn after Modi declined Trump’s invitation in June this year to visit the White House. The visit was always a non-starter for Modi, as Pakistan army chief Asim Munir was also being feted there at the same time.",India and the US again seemed at odds over talks between the leaders as the Indian government denied that they discussed Pakistan in Trump’s Diwali phone call to Modi.

NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday offered prayers at the Lord Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala, becoming the first woman head of state to do so. She is also the second Indian president to visit the temple, after V V Giri.Clad in a black Saree, Murmu arrived at Pamba around 11 am in a special convoy. According to temple's official website, ""Black is the recommended colour for clothes during the ‘Vruthum’ period as the colour denotes detachment from material things.""Following tradition, she washed her feet in the Pampa river and prayed at nearby temples, including the Lord Ganapathy shrine. Vishnu Namboothiri, the chief priest of the Ganapathy temple, filled her sacred bundle, or, at the Kettunira Mandapam. The president was accompanied by her ADC Saurabh S Nair, PSO Vinay Mathur, and son-in-law Ganesh Hembram, who also prepared their sacred bundles.They broke coconuts near the temple and then took four-wheel-drive vehicles to the Sannidhanam along the 4.5-km Swami Ayyappan Road and the traditional trekking route. At Sannidhanam, President Murmu climbed the 18 holy steps to the sanctum, where she was received by state Devaswom minister V N Vasavan and Travancore Devaswom board (TDB) president P S Prasanth. The temple, Kandararu Mahesh Mohanaru, welcomed her with aMurmu offeredof Lord Ayyappa with the sacred bundle on her head and placed it on the temple steps for. She later prayed at nearby shrines of Vavaraswamy and Malikappuram. Before leaving, TDB officials presented her with an idol of Lord Ayyappa.President Murmu’s visit holds comes years after the Sabarimala temple became the centre of intense debate and protests over women’s entry. In 2018, the Supreme Court had ruled that women of all ages could enter the shrine, overturning the traditional ban on those between 10 and 50 years of age, as Lord Ayyappa is worshipped as a(perennial celibate). The verdict had triggered widespread opposition from devotees and sparked a political and social divide in Kerala.Murmu’s pilgrimage conducted strictly within temple customs and age-old rituals is being seen as a moment of quiet symbolism. BJP leader Bandi Sanjay Kumar praised her visit on X, writing, “She is 67. She broke no rules, hurt no faith, she only honoured it. In doing so, she became the first president ever to carry theand bow before Lord Ayyappa. Her visit reminds us that devotion doesn’t shout; it simply stands tall. A moment that reflects the deep faith uniting millions of Ayyappa devotees across India. Those 18 steps have seen debate and defiance, yet devotion always finds its dignity.”",President Droupadi Murmu is the first woman head of state to visit the temple.

India to Belgian court: Arthur Rd jail has long walking area, fresh air with cross ventilation



NEW DELHI: Behind the cold steel bars, a surprisingly plush interior awaits one of India’s most wanted fugitives. Photographs presented by India to Belgium to secure Mehul Choksi ’s extradition reveal a dwelling place that's more akin to a boutique hotel room than a jail cell. The gleaming bathroom and tiled area are a far cry from the stark, unforgiving ambience one typically associates with prison life.Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi will be lodged at the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai upon extradition and the cell he will be lodged in has been spruced up to adhere to European standards of prisoner management. The photographs provided by India also offer a glimpse of the prison barrack (number 12), which houses Choksi’s cell. There are two cells with special facilities and Choksi will be kept in one of them post-extradition.“The barrack is protected by a steel structure after clearing the ground level of 20 feet on three sides so as to allow free passage of light and air inside the jail. The wide corridor leads to the cell.Police personnel are deployed round the clock for security and any emergency, the document submitted by the Indian govt states.Regarding the cell where Mehul Choksi will be lodged, the document says: “The cell has sufficient sources of natural light. The cell has one main door, three windows and five upper ventilators which ensure fresh air with cross ventilation.Once the lights are switched on, six hanging tube lights provide sufficient light in the cell. The three ceiling fans are there to maintain enough air circulation. A TV is also provided for news and entertainment.”The Indian prosecutors have also submitted (with images) to the Belgian court handling Choksi’s case that an attached passage from the cell leads to the toilet, which is equipped with all essential amenities. “There is a long walking area for the inmates outside the Barrack where they can take a stroll in the mornings or evenings,” the document adds.The development comes on the heels of the Union home minister urging all states to have at least one prison cell of international standards to deal with fugitives. The Belgian court recently upheld Choksi’s arrest — which happened at the Indian govt’s request — and ordered his extradition. It observed that the documents produced by Choksi to cite poor jail conditions were of Tihar prison and do not apply to his case.The court also observed that there was no “documentary evidence” to prove Choksi was kidnapped in Antigua in May 2021 on the instructions of Indian authorities and dismissed the charge that his extradition was being sought for a political or military offence.Choksi (65), wanted in bank fraud cases to the tune of Rs 13,000 crore, is learnt to be in process of filing an appeal against the extradition order.",Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi will be lodged at the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai upon extradition.

"Sugary ‘ORS’ a danger, good riddance, say doctors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sugary-ors-a-danger-good-riddance-say-doctors/articleshow/124748416.cms,"Strategies to Reduce Sugar Intake for Better Health

Doctor: No energy or sports drink can replace true ORS



After eight years of a relentless campaign against the term ‘ORS’ (oral rehydration solution) being used for many packaged beverages, often high in sugar, Hyderabad-based paediatrician Dr Sivaranjani Santosh has finally seen a breakthrough. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India issued an advisory last week banning food and beverage companies from using the term in product names, labels or trademarks, even as a prefix or suffix.Many doctors TOI spoke to said cases of parents mistaking flavoured “hydration” or “electrolyte” drinks for ORS are becoming increasingly common.“These drinks contain 10 times more sugar than the amount recommended by World Health Organization and are sold in pharmacies as ORS,” Santosh told TOI. “Instead of rehydrating, it worsens diarrhoea, especially in children, who are far more vulnerable... This is extremely dangerous...” While WHO recommends 13.5gm of sugar per litre in ORS, fake products contain 110g-120g.In India, diarrhoea accounts for around 13% of all deaths in children under five years, making it a leading cause of childhood mortality in the country. Santosh took up the fight after coming across many cases where children ended up in hospital with severe dehydration after having these drinks.“We received a four-year-old child in the emergency — listless, weak, and severely dehydrated.The parents said they had been giving her ‘ORS water’ for two days,” recalled Dr Dhiren Gupta, co-director, paediatric intensive care unit, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi. “But when we checked, it turned out they had been using a sweetened energy drink sold online as an ‘ORS substitute’. The child’s condition worsened instead of improving.”Gupta added that blood tests in such cases often show dangerously low sodium and high sugar levels. “Any solution meant to correct dehydration must have the right balance of salt and sugar,” he said. “We had another one-year-old patient who suffered brain bleeding and seizures after being given a concentrated salt solution. The sodium levels were extremely high. Both extremes — too little or too much salt — can be life-threatening. ”Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said, “We frequently admit children with moderate to severe dehydration because caregivers used sweetened or flavoured drinks thinking they were ORS. Correct WHO-ORS, if given early, could have prevented it.” “Glucose helps the body absorb sodium, which retains water. During diarrhoea, both are lost, leading to kidney failure or brain swelling. A properly mixed ORS restores this safely, but a diluted or sugary version can worsen dehydration,” explained Dr Dinesh Yadav, paediatric cardiologist at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.Doctors stressed that awareness, not fear, is key. “ORS saves lives — but only when made and used correctly,” Yadav said. “Parents must use WHO-approved sachets, mix them exactly as directed, and avoid all flavoured or commercial ‘hydration’ drinks. No energy or sports drink can replace true ORS.” “When parents walk into a pharmacy looking for ORS, they trust the product to save their child’s life. Around eight years ago, many children’s conditions worsened due to this ORS, though fortunately, no deaths were directly linked then. It was infuriating to see profits being prioritised above children’s health. Giving sugar-laden formulas like these could actually kill,” Santosh said.She claimed that the companies initially tried to silence her by offering her speaking roles at their events. “Later, they did not contact me directly, but I did face a significant backlash and threats on social media from anonymous accounts, which made the fight harder.” Though the journey was long and exhausting, Santosh is relieved after the FSSAI order. She spent years raising awareness online, sending complaints to drug and health authorities like CDSCO, FSSAI, and the central health ministry. “I gathered videos, patient testimonies, and evidence from doctors. I went through everything — dejection, anger, hope, exhaustion. Though it should not have taken this long, after seeing the order I was overwhelmed. I told people long back that this would become big but nobody listened.”Meanwhile, after the FSSAI ban, manufacturers moved the Delhi high court, arguing that the order came without prior notice or consultation and affects their existing stock worth about Rs 180 crore. The court granted temporary relief, allowing companies to sell their current stock, but stopped the production of new sugary drinks labelled as ORS.","The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India issued an advisory last week banning food and beverage companies from using the term in product names, labels or trademarks.

Army To Raise First 5 Bhairav Commando Units By Oct 31 For Swift Strikes On China, Pak Fronts

NEW DELHI: From inducting modern sniper rifles, machine guns, carbines, rocket-launchers, loitering munitions, tank-killing missiles and software-defined radios to raising new `Bhairav’ light commando units and `Ashni’ drone platoons, the Army is now progressively transforming its 382 infantry battalions to meet the myriad challenges of tech-driven warfare.“Multiple initiatives, institutional measures and technology transformations are being undertaken. The focus is on lethality, mobility, battlefield transparency, situational awareness, survivability, training and restructuring,” director general of infantry Lt-General Ajay Kumar said on Wednesday.The aim is to equip, upskill and enhance the capability of the humble foot-soldiers, who are often forgotten in the race to acquire big-ticket fighter jets, submarines and howitzers, to “fight as weapon systems”.The infantry is by far the largest arm of the 11.5 lakh Army. Moreover, boots on the ground will always be relevant because victory in conflicts, be it Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Hamas, will continue to be measured in the amount of land or real estate captured, Lt-Gen Kumar said.Towards this end, the Army has inked a wide array of deals for ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) drones, kamikaze drones, loitering munitions for precision strikes, night sights, bullet-proof jackets, ballistic helmets, foliage-penetration radars, light specialist and all-terrain vehicles, among others.The latest is the Rs 2,770 crore contract for 4.2 lakh close-quarter battle carbines, 60% to be manufactured by Bharat Forge and the rest by PLR Systems (Adani Defence-Israel Weapon Industries joint venture). “Deliveries will start in a year and be completed in two years,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.Similarly, with there being a huge deficiency in new-generation man-portable ATGMs, emergency procurements of a limited number of launchers and missiles are being undertaken till a viable indigenous option is available. One such deal is for 12 Javelin launchers and 104 missiles from the US.“The recent graduation to the philosophy of `shoot-to-kill’ (from the earlier shoot-to-wound) has also enabled upgrade of assault rifles and light machine guns from 5.56mm to 7.62mm calibre. Vintage sniper rifles are also being replaced with .338 sniper rifles,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.With drone warfare redefining the nature of conflicts, the infantry is also trial-evaluating nine different types of drones for ISR and `suicide’ missions, in addition to the deals already inked.This is also in tune with ongoing force restructuring under which all 382 infantry battalions (each has 800 soldiers) have now raised “first person view” Ashni drone platoons as part of the “eagle on the arm” concept. “Each platoon of 20-25 specially trained soldiers will have surveillance as well as short and medium-range loitering munitions,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.Parallelly, the infantry has also raised the first five `Bhairav’ light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China, as was first reported by TOI.“The raising of another four has started. In the next six months, we will have 25 such lean and mean battalions capable of carrying out deep strikes against high-value enemy targets. The aim is to bridge the gap between infantry units and Para-Special Forces,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.The first five units, equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones, have been placed under the 3 Corps (Dimapur), 12 Corps (Jodhpur) 14 Corps (Leh), 15 Corps (Srinagar) and 16 Corps (Nagrota).These Bhairav units are in addition to the Army’s 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training and are equipped with a wide array of specialized weapons and equipment.","The aim is to equip, upskill and enhance the capability of the humble foot- soldiers.

The latest livestock census paints a grim picture — the state now has just 3,052 donkeys, a sharp fall from 49,289 in 1997, marking a 94% decline in less than three decades.Nine of the 55 districts have reported zero donkeys, signalling near-total disappearance of the animal that once powered rural India’s transport and trade.While there are no specific studies behind disappearance of donkeys yet, Gurgaon-based animal rights activist Naresh Kadyan had urged the Centre to declare donkeys an endangered species, warning that China’s demand for donkey hide is pushing the decline. He blames China’s “ejiao” industry — where hides are boiled to extract gelatin used in traditional tonics, aphrodisiacs, and anti-ageing creams — for pushing the species toward extinction.Official figures show Narmadapuram has the highest number of donkeys (332), followed by Chhatarpur (232), Rewa (226), and Morena (228), while Vidisha, once home to over 6,400 donkeys, now has just 171, and Bhopal only 56.

"Staggered pan-India SIR likely in a week, 3 months for each phase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/staggered-pan-india-sir-likely-in-a-week-3-months-for-each-phase/articleshow/124748248.cms,"Timeline for pan-India SIR to be finalised in 2-3 days, say EC sources



NEW DELHI: A staggered pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls will get underway within four-five days, with each phase likely to be spread over three months, on the lines of the one completed in Bihar . The last intensive revision of the roll was undertaken over two decades ago.Sources indicated that the nationwide SIR may be held in phases, with certain states/UTs such as J&K and Ladakh, which will soon be snow-bound, and ones where nearly 75%-80% of the electorate has been mapped by matching current electors with entries in the 2003/2004 rolls published after the last intensive revision, being left out of the initial phase.“They can be taken up later as barely 20%-25% of electors in these states will need to submit documents to prove their eligibility as per Article 326 of the Constitution. The immediate priority will be the five states due for assembly polls next year,” said an EC official.Going by the three-month SIR schedule followed in Bihar, the final roll — to be published after claims and objections to the draft roll are settled — for states/UTs likely to be covered in the initial phase may be out by Jan-end or beginning of Feb.The preparation for the upcoming countrywide SIR — the intent for which was announced by EC in its June 24 notification for the SIR in Bihar — was the key topic of discussion at the two-day conference of chief electoral officers being held by EC on Wednesday and Thursday.The conference’s opening day, presided over by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, saw EC assess the preparedness of all state/UT CEO offices for the nationwide SIR. The meeting is a follow-up of the Sept 10 CEO’s conference, when all CEOs had briefed EC on the last SIR undertaken and the roll published thereafter.Sources said CEOs are upbeat about the upcoming nationwide SIR, with some states already having mapped up to 75% of their electorate based on the roll from the last intensive revision.In Bihar, nearly 80% of the electorate had matched with the 2003 roll. Three months, thus, were more than enough for the exercise, where only the remaining 20% — possibly comprising parents who never cared to enrol as electors or non-citizens — were required to submit documents.The fact that limited claims and objections were made despite a 30-day window and no appeals were filed with district magistrate (the sole appeal made was found incorrect) in the 15-day timeframe after publication of the final roll, stands testimony to the precision with which SIR was carried out,” said an EC official.EC sources, who indicated that the pan-India SIR timeline will be finalised in a day or two followed by its announcement in four to five days, said the list of documents to be accepted as proof of identity, age and citizenship would more or less remain the same as Bihar, though documents unique to a given state/UT may be considered.“In any case, the list of 11 documents is not exhaustive but only indicative,” said an official.Aadhaar card will only be accepted as a proof of identity. An alternative document, as per the list specified by the poll panel, will be needed to prove one’s citizenship and residence, the official added.","A staggered pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls will get underway within four-five days.

Police warn against 'misinformation'

West Bengal Police post

NEW DELHI: The alleged desecration of a Goddess Kali idol triggered outrage in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district on Wednesday, with the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-led state government of ""shielding"" the culprits.The incident occurred at a village under the Suryanagar gram panchayat area in the Kakdwip assembly constituency, where locals reportedly found the damaged idol inside a temple, news agency PTI reported.The idol was later taken awayin a prison van, further escalating tensions and fuelling political slugfest over the incident. BJP leaders shared videos of the idol being removed and accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of “insulting” Hindu sentiments — a charge the party has repeatedly levelled against the Trinamool supremo.Rejecting the allegation, a TMC leader accused the BJP of trying to ""vitiate the atmosphere.""""The BJP is trying to communalise the incident and vitiate the atmosphere. Let police complete the probe. We condemn any attempt to disturb the harmony in this area,"" the leader, a local party functionary, stated.Meanwhile, the West Bengal Police issued a statement, saying that ""misinformation"" was being spread about the incident.“Efforts are being made from certain quarters to spread misinformation about an incident in Kakdwip. Facts are: an idol of Goddess Kali in a village temple under Suryanagar GP was found to be damaged this morning. Efforts are on to identify the person/persons behind the mischief. Stern action will be taken against those responsible for the incident,"" it posted on X.The police added that locals had blocked the national highway in protest and refused to go ahead with the immersion.“Police persuaded the agitators for hours to withdraw the blockade, which was causing serious public inconvenience, with ambulances carrying patients also being stuck. When the agitators did not relent and started pelting stones at the police, minimum force was resorted to by the police to disperse the mob. The immersion of the idol was facilitated thereafter,” it said.The incident comes ahead of next year’s West Bengal assembly elections, where Mamata Banerjee will seek a fourth consecutive term as chief minister.","The alleged desecration of a Goddess Kali idol triggered outrage in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district.

All confusion over CM face will end today, says Gehlot



PATNA: RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav ’s long wait to be officially declared INDIA bloc’s CM face in Bihar looked set to end after Congress ’s designated troubleshooter, Ashok Gehlot, and the party’s state in-charge Krishna Allavaru met him and his father Lalu Prasad in Patna Wednesday to break a stalemate that has dragged into the business end of elections.Congress kept mum on the outcome of the meeting, but ally CPI(ML)’s general secretary, Dipankar Bhattacharya, suggested patience was running out within the alliance over the delay in declaring what he said was a no-brainer.“Tejashwi’s name as the opposition’s CM candidate could be officially announced at INDIA bloc’s joint press conference on Thursday. Entire Bihar knows Tejashwi will be the CM if INDIA bloc gets majority,” Bhattacharya said.“Our meeting with Lalu was highly positive. INDIA bloc is united and contesting the elections as a strong force. The full situation will be clarified at the presser,” Gehlot said, emerging from the meeting, along with Tejashwi.Ashok Gehlot, however, declined to go beyond proclaiming that “all confusion” would end at Thursday’s press conference.Congress has so far been cagey about naming Tejashwi as INDIA bloc’s unanimous pick, refusing to reciprocate the latter’s move of publicly acknowledging Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi as the alliance’s prime ministerial face for the next general elections.“Tejashwi becoming CM is as straight a choice as Nitish Kumar not becoming the CM again,” Bhattacharya said.On INDIA bloc allies contesting against each other in some places because of the seat-sharing dispute, Gehlot rejected the idea that “friendly fights” within INDIA bloc were an issue. “Such things are normal. Bihar wants a change, and people understand that our victory is in interest of the country,” he said.Allavaru, blamed for the mess, said Congress was “serious” about the assembly polls.Earlier in the day, Tejashwi downplayed talk of alliance being fragmented. “There is no controversy or confusion in INDIA bloc...Will talk tomorrow. You will get an answer to every question,” he said.The INDIA bloc brass was last seen together at the launch of ‘Ati Pichhda EBC Sankalp Patra’ in Patna on Sept 24.

Considering the objection, the judge decided not to take on record the report filed by Sony and chose to wait for the outcome of the application moved before SC.Insisting that the revenue report must be made available to the petitioner, Prabakaran submitted that the movie ‘Dude’, released on Oct 17, had earned Rs 75 crore so far.Pointing out that the petitioner must file a separate application for his grievances against the movie, the high court adjourned the hearing to Nov 27.","Music composer Ilaiyaraaja is fighting a copyright battle against a batch of music labels. ‘Dude’, starring director-turned-actor Pradeep Ranganathan, used two of his songs in the film without his authorisation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124750134,imgsize-497425,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Coal’s new ‘faucet’

TOI

Safe and sure

Water, water everywhere

Communities and officials grappling with the problem of tapped water supply in coal-belt states are courting an unlikely ally to bring about a change of fortune: abandoned coal mine pits. Hundreds of such pits have turned into reservoirs filled with water, emerging as a simple solution in areas that have only known perennial shortage. Though the idea is not new, the Centre is finally doubling down on it, identifying more than a hundred such pits to ease water woes across six states.The concerted push is the outcome of a recent study — the first of its kind — by the Ranchi-based Central Mine Planning & Design Institute (CMPDI). It said that 437 mine voids across both active and abandoned coal mines have an annual capacity of an estimated 2,760 lakh kilolitres of water — that’s enough to fill about 11,000 Olympic-sized pools. CMPDI followed up the findings by identifying 22 sites across six states for pilot projects. Eight of those sites are in Jharkhand, which is sort of the bellwether for this initiative.It was in Dec 2021 that the sound of running water greeted residents of Pondi panchayat in Jharkhand’s Ramgarh district.But it wasn’t a newly dug well, the common source of water for households and villages across large parts of the country. Sparing Pondi any spadework, quite literally, but endowing it with a ready lifeline was the abandoned ‘Ara mine’ number 8, a relic of Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) lying dormant for years.The Pondi experiment was part of a handful of pilots for using water collected in mines — which is essentially rainwater and also underground seepage — that had been undertaken in coal-bearing areas in the last few years. It is their success that has now prompted the Union coal ministry to scale up efforts. Speaking toduring his visit to Ranchi recently, Union coal minister G Kishan Reddy said utilisation of mine water was one of the priorities of their govt and that they are putting in place a detailed action plan to make it happen.“Unfortunately, mine closures earlier used to rarely take place per prescribed norms. But now we have decided to focus on sustainable closure of mines to reduce environmental woes and create livelihood linkages. We are now targeting as many as 143 mines, where mining activities are over,” he said.“The plan is to use the water accumulated in these mines for various purposes, including employment generation. So far, some nine closures have taken place, but an action plan is being prepared on priority for closures of the remaining ones in next three to four years,” he added.If abandoned coal mines are being pursued to address water scarcity it’s because they’ve been found to be a safe, and scalable, bet. Experts say the water in these mines poses no hazards, while filtration and treatment plants have been put in place to improve its quality. “Unlike Western scenarios, where mine water is acidic, water from most Indian coal mines is suitable for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use with only moderate treatment,” said the CMPDI report. The treated water is even considered viable for bottled-water production. The experience on the ground has certainly been encouraging.The quiet initiation of the project during the pandemic in Pondi has now grown to become a lifeline for 1,600 households across eight villages. People who had to walk miles in search of water can now just turn on their tap. Rural homemakers like Savita Devi (40) of Bongahara village hail the easy access to water at their doorstep. “Now, water from the mine directly reaches my house. I also use it for cooking. This leaves me with time for other work,” she said. Popal Devi (52), the Pondi panchayat mukhiya, said the project would perhaps reverse the trend of migration from the area due to severe water scarcity.Making the water potable involves a multi-step treatment process. A 1.4 million litres per day (MLD) capacity water treatment plant was set up in the village into which the water from the closed mine is lifted daily. It undergoes filtration using limestone, sandpit, and chlorine before being stored in a well and moved to two overhead tanks for daily supply. To ensure the system’s sustainability, the panchayat has appointed two women, known as ‘jal sahiyas’, to inspect the pipelines and collect a monthly water payment of Rs 62 per household.Tarun Paliwal, CMPDI’s public relations officer, said the study benchmarked mine water quality against Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) classifications and BIS:10500 standards. “In a review meeting held on Aug 8 this year, the coal secretary lauded CMPDI and directed coal companies to develop action plans for treating and reusing mine water to enhance local community well-being and water security,” he said.Pondi is not an isolated story. About 100km away in Piparwar, CCL rolled out a similar pilot. “In Bachra and adjoining villages alone, water from the closed mine pit is being supplied to around 3,000 households, besides the CCL’s Piparwar officers’ colony,” said an official of the environment wing of the Piparwar project area.“Across the Piparwar area, we have set up around eight mini water filtration plants from where people can access water. For example, the filtration plant at CCL hospital in Piparwar generates 2,000 MGD water/hour for in-house use,” the official added.Abhay Singh, chief scientist at the Dhanbad-based Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), said that except for NorthEastern India, their studies, too, have revealed that water from mine pits can easily be put to good use.“In Assam and Meghalaya, water in the mines has heavy metals and has 7-8% acidity vis-a-vis 1-2% in the rest of the country. Scaling up mine water usage in the country can provide answers to challenges of water scarcity,” he said, adding that although a few independent projects are underway across coal-bearing regions in India, there is a need for a consolidated push for a mine-water utilisation mission.According to a statement from Coal India Ltd (CIL), mine water usage for community benefit is not a new concept. In the fiscal year 202425, CIL’s mine discharge was approximately 5,717 lakh kilolitres, with over 45% (around 2,572 LKL) shared for community use. Minister Reddy has told Rajya Sabha that CIL, NLC India Ltd, and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) are all actively utilising treated mine water. CIL alone is supplying water to 878 villages, benefiting about 11.7 lakh people. NLCIL in Tamil Nadu supplies treated mine water for both power generation and drinking, benefiting 9.6 lakh locals.","Hundreds of abandoned mines have become reservoirs holding water that experts say is safe to use. Communities are now betting on them, not only for domestic supply, but also to drive livelihoods. Union coal minister G Kishan Reddy said utilisation of mine water was one of the priorities of their govt and that they are putting in place a detailed action plan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124750779,imgsize-837753,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

ED probe can go on even if one FIR is closed: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-probe-can-go-on-even-if-one-fir-is-closed-hc/articleshow/124749592.cms,"Chargesheets have been filed for 276

FIRs against Sahara group

NEW DELHI: Even if one FIR is closed, the existence of other FIRs with the same or similar allegations will be valid ground for continuation of ED's investigation under PMLA, Allahabad high court has ruled while dismissing a petition of Sahara group companies, which sought to restrict the ED from probing allegations of money laundering on the grounds that the predicate offence in this case was missing given that the original FIR was closed in 2020. In the Sahara case, the HC took cognisance of ED's submission that 502 FIRs were filed against Sahara group entities in various states.In the Sahara case, the HC took cognisance of ED’s submission that 502 FIRs were filed against Sahara group entities in various states across the country, out of which 315 FIRs were registered for commission of scheduled offences under PMLA. Chargesheets have been filed for 276 FIRs. “Regarding the first submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners that no proceedings can continue under the PMLA after filing of a closure report in FIR No. 142 of 2020, I am in agreement with the view taken by the Delhi high court in Rajinder Singh Chadha v. Union of India,” Justice Subhash Vidyarthi of Allahabad high court said.The judgment of Delhi HC in question stated that “there is no impediment in taking the third FIR on record which related to the same project forming the basis for registration of the first two FIRs, resulting in initiation of the impugned ECIR…” The ECIR is ED’s enforcement case information report, equivalent to a police FIR, for initiating an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The court, in its Oct 17 judgment, also held that a probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) does not in any way restrict the ED from carrying out its own investigations under PMLA, dismissing Sahara’s plea that once an investigation has been entrusted to SFIO under the Companies Act, investigation by any other agency becomes barred.“This submission also cannot be accepted because even after extension of the scope of investigation by SFIO, it does not include investigation against any of the petitioners, namely, Humara India Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Sahara Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Stars Multipurpose Cooperative Society Ltd and Saharayan Universal Multipurpose Society Ltd. Therefore, there is no illegality in continuation of proceedings under PMLA against the petitioners,” the judge said.The court also rejected the contention of Sahara entities that ED cannot investigate the matter since the case falls under the ambit of the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act (BUDS), which overrides IPC – and as BUDS offences are not scheduled offences under PMLA.“Merely because an act makes out commission of an offence under the BUDS Act, it cannot be said that although the act is punishable as an offence under IPC also, the offender cannot be prosecuted for commission of the offence punishable under IPC. Therefore, I find no force in the second submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner,” Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed.","Even if one FIR is closed, the existence of other FIRs with the same or similar allegations will be valid ground for continuation of ED's investigation under PMLA, Allahabad high court has ruled.

NEW DELHI: Representatives from Ladakh on Wednesday resumed dialogue with the Centre after a five-month hiatus, reiterating their general demands like statehood, Sixth Schedule status, and constitutional safeguards for their land, culture and language besides seeking the release of detainees of Sept 24 violence, including activist Sonam Wangchuk , reports Bharti Jain.Sources in the Centre said the standing committee on Ladakh has been requested by MHA officials to come back with a draft laying down specifics of their demands, particularly the proposed constitutional framework for their implementation.The standing committee comprises three representatives each of Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance, as well as Ladakh MP Mohd Haneefa Jan.For instance, an official told TOI, the draft may need to specify the fate of panchayats and the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council where Ladakh to be included in Sixth Schedule and how statehood shall align with Sixth Schedule status, which now covers only parts of northeastern states. Also, they were asked to pinpoint their specific requirements for protecting Ladakh’s land, culture and language, including under Article 371.“Today’s deliberations were positive in that the Ladakhi outfits agreed to return to the table after five months. All issues were discussed cordially, signalling a restoration of trust following the events of Sept 24. Though Wednesday’s deliberations stuck to generalities, the Ladakhi representatives agreed to return with a proposal laying down the specifics, at the next meeting,” a govt official told TOI.No time-limit has been set in this regard.Sources said withdrawal of NSA against Sonam Wangchuk and cases against those detained after Sept 24 violence was brought up by LAB and KDA. However, NSA already requires Wangchuk’s detention to be reviewed by an advisory board. As regards other detainees, the probe is on. The outfits demanded a Ladakhi officer for the panel probing the Sept 24 unrest, but were assured that the probe would be impartial under a retired SC judge.Ladakh MP Jan said talks were held Wednesday in a positive atmosphere, with both sides showing willingness to stay engaged. “There was mutual understanding on the need to safeguard Ladakh’s identity and ensure justice and fair representation for its people,” he said.Kargil Democratic Alliance member Sajjad Hussain Kargili said: “Our demand for the past six years has been democracy in Ladakh. A great solution for this is statehood...We discussed the implementation of reservation policy in Ladakh and talked about the release of detainees of Sept 24 incidents, which includes Wangchuk”.","Representatives from Ladakh resumed dialogue with the Centre after a five-month hiatus.

Bihar Assembly polls: Lack of unanimity on CM face may increase rift in opposition camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-polls-lack-of-unanimity-on-cm-face-may-increase-rift-in-opposition-camp/articleshow/124748308.cms,"Tejashwi Slams Double-Engine Govt on Corruption,Assures No Seat-Sharing Disputes in Mahagathbandhan

NEW DELHI: As speculation builds on whether or not the ‘mahagathbandhan’ formally names Rashtriya Janata Dal neta Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate, a strong view within the governing NDA is that it is on a firm footing to tackle the issue that has sharpened divisions in the opposition camp.In case of declaration of the RJD’s de facto leader as the CM choice of the alliance, which includes Congress , the Left and Vikassheel Insaan Party, its core support base, especially Yadavs, is bound to enthusiastically rally around his leadership.Several NDA functionaries are of the view that it will also allow them to ramp up their pitch of ‘jungle raaj’, a charge they have long levelled against the 15-year combined governance of his father Lalu Prasad Yadav and mother Rabri Devi between 1990 and 2005, with considerable electoral gains at successive hustings.As the charge of dominance by Yadavs, the most populous caste at over 14.2%, stuck, a large section of non-Yadav other backward classes and extremely backward classes besides Scheduled Castes steadily drifted away from RJD, leading to its string of electoral defeats.Chief minister Nitish Kumar successfully tapped into the resentment of these castes and emerged as the champion of their interests, and, in alliance with BJP, is hoping to repeat the success of weaving a winning social coalition.A lack of unanimity in the opposition alliance on Tejashwi as its leader in the polls, which has been the case so far, will accentuate differences among allies, who have so far failed to kick-start their campaign after being unable to arrive at a consensus over a seat-sharing arrangement.Congress has rushed its seasoned neta Ashok Gehlot to Patna to hold meetings with RJD top brass and other allies to sort out their differences.Tejashwi said Wednesday that alliance netas will hold a press conference Thursday, as he insisted there were no differences among them.The biggest question remains whether Congress comes around and agrees to his projection as the alliance’s CM pick. Congress has so far been lukewarm to the idea, even though he is being seen as an obvious choice in case of its poll victory.RJD is of the view that Tejashwi’s tenure as deputy CM has earned him goodwill, and his youthful candidature against Nitish’s “tired” persona will boost the alliance’s prospects. The framing of charges against Tejashwi and his parents by a court in a corruption case pertaining to the tenure of Lalu as railway minister will also come in handy for the NDA in case of his elevation.",Speculation builds on whether the ‘mahagathbandhan’ formally names Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate.

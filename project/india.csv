'Hanuman ji first to travel to space': Anurag Thakur’s interaction with students sparks row; DMK says 'science is not mythology',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hanumanji-first-to-travel-to-space-anurag-thakurs-interaction-with-student-sparks-row-dmk-says-science-is-not-mythology/articleshow/123493296.cms,"India’s Space Dream: PM Modi Vows To Build Nation’s Own Space Station After Gaganyaan On Space Day

DMK’s response: ‘Science is not mythology’



Thakur hails India’s space strides



NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur, during an interaction with school children on National Space Day, asked “who was the first person to travel to space.” When the students answered “Neil Armstrong,” Thakur responded, “I think Hanuman ji was the first person to travel to space. ” The exchange has drawn sharp criticism from the opposition, with the DMK accusing him of “confusing fact with fable.”While interacting with students at Shri Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Una, Himachal Pradesh, on National Space Day, Thakur argued that knowledge traditions should extend beyond what he described as “textbooks given to us by the British.” He urged teachers to look towards “our veds, our textbooks and our knowledge,” saying this would allow students to see “a lot more.”The remark triggered an immediate backlash from the DMK. Party MP Kanimozhi, in a post on X, said: “A member of parliament and former union minister asking school children who first set foot on the moon, and insisting that it was not Neil Armstrong but Hanuman, is deeply troubling. Science is not mythology. To mislead young minds in classrooms is an insult to knowledge, reason, and the spirit of scientific temper enshrined in our Constitution.India’s future lies in nurturing curiosity, not confusing fact with fable.”At the same event, Thakur highlighted India’s recent achievements in the space sector, noting the Chandrayaan-3 success in 2023 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s role in supporting scientists. He said India is aiming to set up its own space station by 2035 and achieve a crewed lunar landing by 2040.He also pointed to India’s growing space economy, the development of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, and milestones such as launching 104 satellites in one flight and the successful testing of the reusable launch vehicle. “Earlier we had to seek help from foreign countries to launch our satellites, but now foreign nations seek help from us,” Thakur told students.The occasion marked the second National Space Day, commemorating India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission. This year’s theme, “Aryabhatta to Gaganyaan: Ancient Wisdom to Infinite Possibilities,” linked India’s ancient astronomical traditions with modern space ambitions.Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel into space in 1961, while American astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot on the Moon in 1969.","BJP MP Anurag Thakur asked school children who was the first person to travel to space.

SC makes granting sand-mining leases more difficult,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-makes-granting-sand-mining-leases-more-difficult/articleshow/123491912.cms,"NEW DELHI: In an important judgment, the Supreme Court has linked quantum of sand mining to the river's replenishment capacity, a ruling that would prevent degradation of riverbeds, consequently making grant of leases for extraction of a key construction raw material from riverbanks difficult.Taking the regulatory regime for sand mining a step forward, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said extraction of sand from riverbeds must be in sync with the river's capacity to replenish, akin to felling of timber in a forest being linked to its capacity to grow trees.The bench said, ""Just as forest conservation requires assessment of tree growth rate before permitting timber harvesting to ensure that felling of trees does not exceed tree growth, a replenishment study enables us to take an informed decision as to whether sand mining can be permitted without degrading the rivers' natural balance.""The Justice Narasimha-led bench mentioned its judgment earlier this year declaring that a valid and subsisting District Survey Report (DSR) is mandatory for grant of environmental clearance (EC) for sand mining. ""The purpose and objective of preparing such District Survey Report is to scientifically locate the place for sand mining after calculation of annual rate of replenishment for allowing mining in the area,"" it said.""It is, therefore, compelling to hold that a DSR is valid and tenable only when a proper replenishment study is conducted,"" the bench said, adding that absence of a replenishment study renders a DSR fundamentally defective.This ruling came from the bench while dismissing appeals by the J&K govt and the National Highways Authority of India, which had challenged a National Green Tribunal order setting aside the permission for sand mining, without a proper replenishment study, to a project proponent which awarded the construction of a four-lane bypass-ring-road around Srinagar city.","Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said extraction of sand from riverbeds must be in sync with the river's capacity to replenish.

Adlam, 60, was in India from Feb 24 to 28 on a tourist visa.The court's three-page order quotes Sharma, a former lieutenant commander of the Indian Navy, as terming the alleged breach ""a threat to national security"".The ordnance factory recently received ""brake parachute technology transfer"" for Sukhoi Su-30 aircraft, and contributes to space projects like Gaganyaan and drone development.Deputy general manager Himmatlal Kumawat, a 2011-batch Indian Ordnance Factory Services officer, stands accused of trying to pressure Sharma into allowing Adlam to visit the facility by bypassing the mandatory security clearance.The complaint names another official of the same rank, Vipin Kathiyar, as siding with Kumawat.When Sharma didn't relent, Kumawat allegedly facilitated Adlam's unauthorised tour without his knowledge. The DGM had allegedly assaulted Sharma in his office on Feb 21 after an argument over the foreigner's planned visit. The court document states that witnesses, including a security guard and a contract worker, intervened to separate the duo.The alleged breach occurred barely two weeks before UP Police's Anti-Terrorist Squad arrested Ravindra Kumar, a chargeman who reported to Kumawat at the factory. Ravindra was arrested on March 14 for allegedly using his smartphone to share classified documents with a suspected ISI agent.An internal investigation revealed that Himmatlal and Vipin had previously allowed staff to use smartphones inside the facility in violation of security protocol.CJM Diwakar said during a hearing on Aug 8 that entry into a defence facility without authorisation was a cognisable offence. He directed police to register an FIR and submit the findings of the investigation within 24 hours.

In Hinduism, the day of the New Moon, or Amavasya, is regarded as the most significant day. The sole purpose of this day is to honor the ancestors or forefathers. Every month, Amavasya falls, and this may be determined using Daily Hindu Panchang.Amavasya days are regarded as unlucky for carrying out any auspicious rituals, including Griha Pravesh, Mundan, Marriages, and Engagements. However, Amavasya days are seen as auspicious for carrying out religious rites including bathing in the holy Ganga, conducting hawan, feeding Brahmins, participating in charitable activities, and offer prayers to ancestors by performing Pitru Tarpan, Pitru Puja, and Pind Daan.Among the most well-known Amavasya celebrations in Hinduism are Mauni Amavasya, Somvati Amavasya, Shanichari Amavasya, Kartik Amavasya, Mahalaya Amavasya or Sarva Pitri Amavasya, Hariyali Amavasya, and Vat Amavasya.Since this day is dedicated to the Moon and the Moon is in its waning phase, which is unlucky for people with the Moon positioned poorly in their natal birth chart, astrology does not view it as a powerful day.Therefore, we are providing some remedies to help you eliminate the negative effects of the Moon.In addition to doing different religious activities, such as performing hawan dedicated to ancestors, one must perform remedies linked to Saturn on Amavasya day.Your mood, feelings, and emotions will be greatly impacted, and the impact will be significantly greater, if the Moon is in an unfavorable position in your natal birth chart. Since you won't feel well or have much energy on this particular day, you should offer water to the moon in the evening after sighting the Moon and worship Lord Shiva as well, since only Lord Shiva can protect you from the negative effects of Moon.","In Hinduism, the day of the New Moon, or Amavasya, is regarded as the most significant day.

"Cleanliness in toilets & coach, major irritants for long-distance train passengers: CAG audit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cleanliness-in-toilets-coach-major-irritants-for-long-distance-train-passengers-cag-audit/articleshow/123489089.cms,"The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains, conducted by audit offices from 16 zones.

NEW DELHI: In a telling indicator of the persistent cleanliness issues on long-distance trains — from choked toilets and unclean washbasins to lack of water and dirty vestibule areas — an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has found that over 40% of passengers were dissatisfied with toilet cleanliness, while more than half expressed dissatisfaction with on-board housekeeping.The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains, conducted by audit offices from 16 zones. The results are a part of the CAG’s report titled “Cleanliness and Sanitation in Long Distance Trains” for 2018-19 to 2022-23 period.However, the auditor noted that 89% of complaints related to toilet cleanliness were addressed within the stipulated time frame, indicating a degree of responsiveness.The audit has highlighted inadequate deployment of manpower and cleaning equipment, along with poor and irregular monitoring by railway officials, as key reasons behind the poor sanitary conditions on long-distance trains.According to the report, bio-toilets in AC coaches were found to be in better condition than those in non-AC coaches. Passenger dissatisfaction exceeded 50% in five zones, including East Coast, Western, and Eastern Railways.In contrast, satisfaction levels crossed 90% in Northern and North Central Railways.Identifying improper usage as a major contributing factor, the CAG recommended “special efforts to raise passenger awareness regarding the proper use of bio-toilets, especially in cases involving non-availability of water or filth in common areas such as near sinks.”On the issue of water availability, the audit surveyed six selected trains in each zone and recorded passenger feedback. Out of the 2,426 passengers surveyed, 366 (15%) reported lack of water in toilets or washbasins. The report also noted that over one lakh complaints regarding water shortages in train toilets and washbasins were registered via the Rail Madad app in 2022-23.To address this, the CAG recommended ensuring enroute water refilling arrangements, especially for long-distance trains and at stations which recorded more frequent complaints.For the assessment of On-Board Housekeeping Services (OBHS), joint inspections were conducted along with railway officials on 15 trains. Service deficiencies were found in 13 of them, which included choked washbasins at doorways, dirty lavatories in sleeper coaches, waterlogging in toilets, and unclean vestibule areas.The audit also reviewed the performance of the Clean Train Stations (CTS) scheme, introduced to provide mechanised cleaning of key coach areas, such as bio-toilets, doorways and vestibules, during brief halts at enroute stations. The report stated that the intended benefits of the scheme were not fully realised due to railway authorities failing to enforce contractual obligations, including the deployment of adequate resources within the scheduled halt time.During joint inspections of 29 CTS across 12 zones, the audit observed limited cleaning of toilets and other areas, and shortfall in usage of machines and deployment of manpower.The report also flagged how the authorities at zonal level failed to ensure compliance with the norm of police verification of contractual staff deployed on trains despite several instances of crime involving such staff having been reported, including rape of a passenger by an attendant on Delhi-Ahmedabad Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani train.","The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains. The results are a part of the CAG’s report titled “Cleanliness and Sanitation in Long Distance Trains” for 2018-19 to 2022-23.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123489139,imgsize-1354328,width-400,resizemode-4/123489139.jpg"
"Hyderabad horror: Pregnant woman chopped in pieces by husband; threw hands, legs in Musi river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hyderabad-horror-pregnant-woman-chopped-in-pieces-by-husband-threw-hands-legs-in-musi-river/articleshow/123484907.cms,"NEW DELHI: A brutal case of murder has emerged in Hyderabad, where a five-month pregnant woman was allegedly killed by her husband, who then dismembered her body and disposed of the parts in the Musi river.The incident took place at around 4.30 pm on Saturday at their residence in Medipally. The accused, a 27-year-old driver with a ride-hailing company, throttled his 21-year-old wife following frequent quarrels over family disputes.To hide the crime, he had cut the body into pieces with a hexa blade. He threw the head, hands, and legs into the Musi river at Prathapsingaram, and kept the trunk without the head and legs in his room, DCP (Malkajgiri Zone) P V Padmaja told reporters.The accused packed the body parts separately in plastic covers and made three trips to the river to dump them. Later, he called his sister claiming his wife had gone missing. When his sister grew suspicious and informed a relative, he was taken to a police station, PTI reported.He again tried to portray the murder as a missing incident, but during questioning he confessed to killing his wife, the DCP said.A case has been registered under relevant BNS sections for murder and causing disappearance of evidence, and the accused is now in custody.The remains were recovered from the house and sent for post-mortem.“We have to ascertain the deceased (is wife of the accused) and a DNA test will be conducted,” Padmaja added.Asked about the recovery of the missing body parts, she said teams of NDRF personnel and GHMC swimmers have launched searches, but nothing has been found so far.Police revealed that both the accused and the victim were from Vikarabad district and had been neighbours before marrying through a love-cum-arrange marriage in January 2024 at Arya Samaj. They moved to Hyderabad and lived in a rented house in Boduppal.However, after a month of living together, disputes began.In April 2024, the woman lodged a complaint of domestic violence with Vikarabad police, following which a case was registered. Elders later intervened and the matter was settled in a village panchayat.The woman briefly worked at a call centre in Punjagutta but was forced to quit by her husband, who suspected her movements. She became pregnant in March 2025, but quarrels continued.On August 22, she told her husband she wanted to visit Vikarabad for a medical check-up and then stay with her parents. He refused, an argument broke out, and she abused him. On the same day, police said, the man decided to kill her.The investigation is ongoing.","Five-month pregnant woman was allegedly killed by her husband in Hyderabad.

Political Row Erupts After Rahul Gandhi’s Convoy ‘Crushes’ Cop During Vote Adhikar Yatra

NEW DELHI: In a light-hearted remark, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday joked that “talks are on” with RJD chief Lalu Prasad regarding his earlier suggestion that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha should get married.The 55-year-old made the comment at a press conference in Araria district during the ongoing ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’. Gandhi noted that he had received a similar suggestion from Lalu Prasad two years ago.The comment dates back to a press conference in Patna two years ago, where Lalu Prasad humorously urged Gandhi to get married, saying it was a wish of his mother, Sonia Gandhi , and that they wanted to see him as a ‘dulha’ (groom) and join the ‘baraat'.Gandhi’s remark came after RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had suggested to Union minister Chirag Paswan that he should consider getting married.During the press conference, a journalist asked Yadav about Paswan’s attempts to portray the Congress as a “pichhlaggu” (sidekick) of the RJD.Yadav, the INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, responded humorously, saying he could mock Paswan’s claims of being a “Hanuman” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi , but he preferred not to take issue with him, whom he regards as an elder brother.“I would only advise him to get married. It is high time,” Yadav said, drawing laughter from the audience.Rahul Gandhi, who is often referred to by Yadav as ‘bade bhai’ during the Yatra, then remarked, “The advice is applicable to me as well.

Heavy rains over the weekend have battered Himachal Pradesh, closing hundreds of roads, cutting power and water supply, and flooding several homes.Officials said on Sunday that a total of 484 roads, including two national highways, have been closed for vehicular traffic as moderate to heavy showers continue across the state.The local meteorological office has issued a ""yellow"" warning for heavy rainfall in isolated areas of two to seven districts until August 30.Mandi district reported the highest number of closures with 245 roads blocked, followed by 102 in neighbouring Kullu.National Highway 154A (Chamba–Pathankot) and NH 305 (the Aut–Sainj road) are among those shut, according to the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC).The road linking Pathankot to Mandi came to a halt between Kandwal and Jachh in Nurpur in Kangra district after it turned into a drain following intense rainfall.The worst-affected stretch was near Chhatrauli, where waterlogging on a diversion created for an under-construction flyover caused hours of traffic standstill.The flooding also entered homes in Nagabari village in the Nurpur Assembly constituency after a local ""nallah"" (drain) overflowed.Residents alleged negligence in highway construction and poor drainage planning for the chaos.Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Arun Sharma confirmed the water had entered several houses, saying he was inspecting the affected areas.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, reported ANI.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20) The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,imgsize-58496,width-400,resizemode-4/123458210.jpg"

'SC Inciting Religious Wars': Nishikant Dubey EXPLODES On Supreme Court Over Waqf Scrutiny

NEW DELHI: After focusing for decades on ensuring fair trial to accused persons and their unfettered right to appeal against conviction, Supreme Court in a significant interpretation of criminal law has conferred similar rights on victims of crime, and even their legal heirs, to challenge acquittals.Till now, in the case of acquittal of an accused by trial court or high court, either the state or complainant had the right to file an appeal. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan last week extended the right to appeal against acquittal of accused to two more categories of people - those who suffered injury or losses in the crime and legal heirs of victims of the crime.Writing the 58-page precedent-setting judgment, Justice Nagarathna said, ""The right of a victim of a crime must be placed on par with the right of an accused who has suffered a conviction, who, as a matter of right, can prefer an appeal under Section 374 of CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure).""""We find the victim has every right to prefer an appeal as against a conviction for a lesser offence or for imposing inadequate compensation or even in the case of an acquittal ...as stated in the proviso to Sec 372 of CrPC,"" the bench said.Threading analogous SC judgments and law commission reports, the bench concluded that the right of victims of crime to file appeal in a higher court against acquittal of the accused, or award of lenient punishment ""cannot be circumscribed"".The bench expanded the ambit of ""victims of crime"" for the purpose of filing an appeal and said their legal heirs could continue prosecution of such appeals in case the appellant-victim dies during the pendency of appeals.Also read - Treaty binds Russia to provide information on woman’s whereabouts: SC ""A person convicted of a crime has the right to prefer an appeal under Section 374 of the CrPC as a matter of right and not being subjected to any conditions. Similarly, a victim of a crime, whatever be the nature of the crime, must have a right to prefer an appeal as per the CrPC,"" she said. Justices Nagarathna and Viswanathan said if the victims of an offence had the right to appeal against acquittal or lesser punishment awarded to the accused, then their legal heirs would have identical right to prosecute the appeal if after filing of the appeal, the injured person dies.SC said in the event of acquittal of accused, the state through the public prosecutor can file an appeal with permission of the appellate court even if the complainant does not challenge the acquittal.""It is not always that the State or a complainant would prefer an appeal. But when it comes to a victim's right to prefer an appeal, the insistence on seeking special leave to appeal from the HC under Section 378(4) of the CrPC would be contrary to what has been intended by the Parliament by insertion of the proviso to Section 372 of the CrPC,"" it further said. ""Hence, the statutory rigours for filing of an appeal by the State or by a complainant against an order of acquittal cannot be read into the proviso to Section 372 of the CrPC so as to restrict the right of a victim to file an appeal on the grounds mentioned therein, when none exists,"" SC said.","Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan last week extended the right to appeal against acquittal of accused to two more categories of people.

The agency then sent the seized NRI certificates to Indian embassies and missions for verification. Most of them were found to be forged or fake. The probe further revealed these medical colleges were paying agents to have fake NRI documents prepared.The agents also prepared fake family trees of NRIs, wherein these unrelated NRIs were shown as relatives of students to help secure admissions under the NRI quota. In some cases, the agents and medical colleges used documents of one NRI for admissions of multiple candidates, who were unrelated to the NRI sponsor and to each other.The promoters of these medical colleges were found to be behind the illegal admission racket, with their agents spread across the country bringing ""clients"" and helping them generate huge ""proceeds of crime"".The Centre has since revised its NRI admission policy, with the DG of health services issuing fresh guidelines wherein each NRI certificate has to be authenticated by embassies and missions before admission is granted on its basis. This happened after coordinated action involving multiple Union ministries.The MEA too has issued fresh guidelines to its embassies and missions abroad, for strict due diligence in issuance of NRI certificates, outlining the eligibility criteria and clearly delineating 'first degree' and 'second degree' relatives in respect of whom NRIs can get certificates for admissions under the quota in India.The involvement of some NRIs has also come to light. They allowed their names to be used after receiving bribes from the agents of the medical colleges. ""The agents approached and obtained credentials of unrelated NRIs by paying money to them,"" the investigation found.The existing rules specify that the fees of the NRI student must be paid by the NRI sponsor. However, the investigation found that in a majority of the cases fees were paid by the family of the student and not the NRI sponsor, thereby defeating the very purpose of the policy, which is to earn foreign exchange, sources said.Probe revealed many NRI sponsors were not present in India on the dates affidavits were notarised and signed, a senior official said.","ED had conducted searches at various medical colleges in West Bengal and Odisha.

PATNA: RJD 's Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday alleged that EC's credibility had been largely eroded due to controversies surrounding the SIR of electoral rolls in Bihar. ""At each booth, the names of at least 50 living electors have been deleted on grounds that they are dead. We have proof,"" Tejashwi told reporters in Araria during INDIA bloc's press conference and 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' led by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi.Terming NDA as ""Nahin Denge Adhikar,"" Tejashwi accused BJP of indulging in stealing votes of the poor and deprived. ""At his Gaya rally, the PM said EC is working to drive away infiltrators from the country, but in its affidavit before SC, EC has not mentioned this issue,"" Tejashwi claimed, adding that Bihar, as a land of democracy, would not let it be destroyed.Dipankar Bhattacharya, CPI(M-L) general secretary, said EC failed in its job of preparing ""accurate poll rolls."" He added, ""BJP has largest number of BLAs, but they haven't filed any complaint related to the SIR.

NEW DELHI: The seven-day deadline set by Election Commission (EC) for Congress MP Rahul Gandhi to submit an affidavit along with evidence to back his 'vote chori' allegations with respect to Karnataka, Maharashtra, Haryana and Bihar has ended, with no sign of any signed declaration from the Congress functionary.Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar had, while serving the ultimatum to Rahul at a press conference on Aug 17, said that he should either submit a declaration under oath, along with proof of electoral roll irregularities alleged by him, or apologise to the nation, as his 'vote theft' claims would then be rendered baseless.With no evidence or declaration forthcoming from Rahul, the second option has, by default, become valid, said a source. ""Rahul's 'vote theft' claims stand invalidated, not meriting any further proceedings by the chief electoral officers (CEOs) concerned,"" said an EC official.However, the poll body is unlikely to release any formal statement or make further comments in this regard.Explaining the procedure for pointing out errors in electoral rolls, Kumar had, at the Aug 17 press conference, said an elector of any assembly constituency (AC) or booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by parties can file claims and objections on the draft voter list with the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) - a state govt employee who is also the electoral registration officer (ERO) - or use the two-point appellate process to get corrections made after the final electoral roll is published.""If one does not point out errors within the timelines and also fails to file an election petition within 45 days to challenge the result and yet tries to mislead voters with false allegations of 'vote chori', is this not a subversion of the Constitution?"" the CEC had asked.""A lie, if repeated several times, does not become a truth,"" he had noted.Elaborating on EC's insistence on a signed declaration from Rahul, the CEC had explained that any elector from an AC has the right to complain about exclusion; similarly, BLAs can also complain under oath.""But if the complainant is not a voter in that AC and is making serious allegations about the exclusion of 1.5 lakh voters while calling EC a 'chor', it warrants an escalated response as per Rule 20(3)(b),"" he underlined.","The seven-day deadline set by Election Commission (EC) for Rahul Gandhi to submit an affidavit along with evidence to back his 'vote chori' allegations has ended.

Schools in a fix after direction to go 'hybrid'

NEW DELHI: Schools, colleges and other educational institutions in Delhi and neighbouring cities can resume physical classes but must simultaneously keep the online option open wherever feasible, pollution watchdog CAQM said Monday after SC allowed relaxation of these provisions while keeping other Grap-4 curbs in place.Classes can be conducted in hybrid mode from Tuesday, CAQM said.""The option to exercise the online mode, wherever available, shall vest with students and their guardians,"" its order said.Earlier, SC asked CAQM to take a call on relaxing Grap curbs on online classes. With physical classes suspended, the court said poor students couldn't avail of midday meals and many didn't have facilities to join online classes.Other conditions imposed under Grap-4 would stay till further orders, the court said while slamming the authorities for not complying with CAQM's order barring trucks from entering the capital.Delhi AQI slipped back to 'very poor' at 339 after improving to 'poor' on Sunday.All lessons up to Class XII in schools and other educational institutions will be conducted in a hybrid mode in Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar from Tuesday, the Commission for Air Quality Management ordered on Monday.Following the direction of the Supreme Court on Monday to relax certain restrictions under GRAP Stage-IV, CAQM announced that NCR cities would conduct classes in a hybrid mode comprising physical and online modes until further orders. ""The option to exercise the online mode of education, wherever available, shall vest with the students and their guardians,"" theCAQM order said.In its order, the commission also stated that NCR govts might consider conducting online classes in all other districts in addition to those named in the order. ""Further, wide publicity shall be given for immediate implementation (of the order) by all the authorities concerned in Delhi-NCR,"" CAQM stated.The apex court asked air management panel on Monday to take a call on relaxing the order on mandatory online classes under GRAP stages III and IV, noting that many students would miss out on the benefit of mid-day meals, many of them didn't have facilities to take online classes and many educational institutions too didn't have facilities to provide online education. The court also noted that the ""residences of many students do not have air purifiers, and therefore, there may not be any difference between the children sitting at home and the children attending school"".Meanwhile the schools in the city geared up for the new challenge. Sunita, principal, Ravi Shankar SKV in Bawana, said, ""We won't probably opt for hybrid, but if it happens, we will need to reorganise our timetable and teachers' work because we will require teachers to be available for both modes simultaneously. We will have to combine sections for lessons on similar subjects, especially in online mode. Offline mode will depend on classroom strength.""Rooma Pathak, principal, MM Public School, Pitampura, stated, ""It's difficult to function like this. We tried the hybrid mode once but it proved ineffective for the students. A camera recorded the teacher taking classes as usual. Students at home could watch this footage.""On November 14, chief minister Atishi had announced that all primary classes were to shift to the online mode in the wake of the city's air quality reaching 'severe' levels. Three days later on Nov 17, CAQM ordered the implementation of GRAP Stage IV, which, in respect of school education, gives govt the option to shift more classes to online mode.And then as the air quality kept on worsening, the Supreme Court stepped in and on Nov 18 - the most polluted day of the current winter season - directed all the classes to be held online. The court had also kept the GRAP Stage IV restrictions intact until further orders. On Monday, with AQI having moved out of the 'severe' zone in the past few days, it said CAQM could consider the order on compulsory online classes in schools.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) allowed hybrid classes in Delhi-NCR schools, hours after the Supreme Court asked it to examine the grant of relaxation of actions in relation to educational institutions.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to relax the strict Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-4 measures being enforced in Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution, but suggested that educational institutions in the National Capital Region (NCR) can reopen for physical classes.The court also directed the Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) to consider relaxing norms to allow schools to reopen, noting that a large number of students cannot avail mid-day meals, online classes and do not have access to air purifiers, reported news agency ANI.The top court also came down heavily on the authorities, asking the CAQM to take action against the Delhi government, city police and others responsible for not complying with its order under GARP-4 to prevent the entry of trucks into the national capital.Despite permitting relaxation of GRAP-4 measures in order to allow physical classes, the court noted that it could not order curbs below GRAP-3 or GRAP-2 unless it is satisfied with the consistent decrease in the Air Quality Index (AQI).The court also asked the state governments to use the labour cess it collected for the subsistence of the labourers during the construction ban.As of now, schools have been instructed to conduct classes online, with the heads of educational institutions ensuring that parents are informed promptly. The latest updates from the government have provided no clarity on when physical classes might resume.While the air quality in Delhi has improved slightly, with AQI levels dipping below the 300-mark on Monday morning, the pollution levels still remain in the ‘poor’ category.

There are indications that the decision will soon be conveyed to Sena which has pressed for the continuation of incumbent, Eknath Shinde BJP insiders expressed hope that Shinde would come around because of the huge numbers at BJP's disposal: it won 132 seats and reach the magic mark of 145 with the support of Ajit Pawar's group of 41 as well as its ""silent"" supporters scattered among other parties.Sources said the party will offer the post of deputy CMs to Sena (Shinde) and Ajit Pawar's group, though other crucial details, such as who gets what portfolios and how many, are yet to be worked out.While Shiv Sena and NCP have elected Shinde and Pawar as their legislative party leaders respectively, BJP has not yet made its official announcement, but Fadnavis's selection as the leader of the party has looked a foregone conclusion since Saturday when BJP romped home with a record-shattering tally on the strength of the strategy and ground game he had scripted.It's understood that both Fadnavis and Shinde are heading to the national capital to meet home minister Amit Shah to resolve the leadership issue and discuss government formation.Shiv Sena spokesperson Naresh Mhaske cited the Bihar model, suggesting Shinde should continue as CM.

Women COs' 'lack of empathy' among concerns flagged

NEW DELHI: A top Army officer has called for a comprehensive policy on "" gender neutrality "" as well as a ""pragmatic performance analysis"" of Colonel-rank women commanding officers (COs) in the force, citing several instances of them not measuring up to requisite standards due to their lack of training for command, among other factors.Lt General Rajeev Puri, who completed his tenure as the commander of the China-specific 17 'Brahmastra' Mountain Strike Corps at Panagarh on Nov 20, stressed the need to ensure gender neutrality in postings and selection of COs, in a letter addressed to Eastern Command chief Lt-General R C Tiwari last month, with copies to the Adjutant General and Military Secretary at the Army HQs.Women officers have from last year onwards begun to command units in air defence, signals, ordnance, engineers, intelligence, service corps and the like.Women officers are still not allowed in main 'fighting arms' of infantry, armoured corps and mechanised infantry of the over 11 lakh-strong Army. With eight such women COs in his corps, Lt Gen Puri said an analysis was conducted after an ""in-house review"" based on ""demonstrated performance"" of the officers. Women COs have been exhibiting poor ""interpersonal relations"", with an ""exaggerated tendency to complain"" to senior commanders about their subordinates rather than exercising their own authority and powers first, as well as ""lack of empathy"" for officers and troops in their units. ""Any professional disagreement or minor argument is viewed as insubordination... The lack of empathy may be attributable to a need to overcompensate,"" he said.Women COs have also been found to over-centralise decision-making without proper consultations, in a ""my way or highway"" kind of approach, instead of a ""directive style of command"".Some even have a ""misplaced sense of entitlement"", Lt Gen Puri said, citing the case of a woman CO who insisted the unit's subedar major (SM) open her vehicle's door whenever she arrived, contrary to orders on the subject. ""Occasionally, when the SM would get delayed in doing so, the CO would continue sitting in her vehicle and not disembark,"" he said.Some women COs exhibit ""over-ambition"", leading to repeated incidents of ""unreasonable performance demands"" on officers and troops, and consequently, high levels of stress in their units. ""An uncontrolled urge to make derogatory statements regarding juniors to usurp credit, rather than encouraging them, is routine,"" Lt Gen Puri said. On the other end of the spectrum, a few women COs have taken a ""low profile, low initiative route"" to command, he added.With Supreme Court enforcing permanent commission and command roles for women in the armed forces, who had long opposed it because of what they called ""operational, practical and cultural problems"", the Army had finally empanelled 108 women officers for command assignments through a special selection board after ""multiple policy waivers"" early last year, as was then reported by TOI. These women colonels, however, were not trained and groomed for challenging role of COs, unlike their male counterparts who do 'junior command', staff college and other adjunct courses as well as the requisite appointments as young officers.Apart from lack of command training, he said, ""The postings of these officers did not expose them to command roles. Hardly any woman officer has tenanted high-pressure command/staff assignment prior to her role as the CO."" With women officers not getting much exposure to operational tasks, ""preferential treatment"" has led to ""lack of understanding of hardships and resultant lack of compassion for the troops involved in these tasks"", he said.""The desire to prove oneself in a field which was supposed to be a male bastion is likely a driver behind the over-ambitiousness in some women COs... In order to be perceived as strong individuals and avoid being judged as soft-hearted, women COs handle HR issues with a firmer hand than their male counterparts,"" he added.","Lt General Rajeev Puri has called for a comprehensive policy on "" gender neutrality"" in postings and selection of COs.

The woman told the caller she had not sent any parcel to anyone. The caller then said her Aadhar card details were used in the crime and asked her to talk to a Mumbai police officer.

She was ordered not to disconnect and not to tell anyone about the case. A man posing as Anand Rana, IPS officer, sought details of her bank accounts.

The accused also sent her a fake Mumbai crime branch notice with a police logo.The accused also asked the woman to continue her WhatsApp video call 24x7. She switched on the video call on her family computer. ""If the complainant disconnected the call or it got disconnected, the accused would call her up and ask her to connect again and keep checking her location,"" said a police officer.She was then instructed to go to the bank and transfer money and told if the bank inquired why she needed it, she could tell them that she wanted to buy a property.She transferred the money and the accused returned Rs 15 lakh into her account, saying it was clear. By returning the money, they gained her trust. They then asked her to send all her money from her and her husband's joint accounts. Over a period of time, she transferred Rs 3.8 crore into six bank accounts.She suspected something was amiss when she did not get her money back while the accused kept demanding more funds for taxes and ""clearing money"" while keeping her under ""voluntary surveillance"". She spoke to her daughter over the phone, who told her she was being conned and asked her to approach the police. She called the 1930 cyber helpline.

A discussion will soon be held in this regard,"" the Yevla constituency winner told reporters, signaling the party’s aspirations in shaping the new government.Pune NCP president Deepak Mankar also voiced support for Pawar, describing him as a capable leader.

MUMBAI: A Shiv Sena neta close to Eknath Shinde said there was an agreement after the Lok Sabha elections that Shinde would take over the reins of the state if Mahayuti won the assembly polls. The neta said that after the Mahayuti's debacle in the LS polls, there were a series of meetings to draft a strategy for the assembly elections. In these meetings, it was decided that BJP would contest the maximum number of seats followed by Shiv Sena and NCP, but ""irrespective of the number of seats the Mahayuti constituents win, Shinde will continue to be the CM if Mahayuti secures a clear majority,"" the neta said.However, BJP has taken a different view on this claim, saying that when Union home minister Amit Shah was in Mumbai, he had made it clear that Mahayuti was no doubt contesting the assembly polls under the leadership of Shinde, but in the event Mahayuti secured a clear majority, the new CM would be decided by BJP's parliamentary board and heads of Shiv Sena and NCP. ""Shah's statement on the appointment of the new CM is clear. He never said Shinde would be made the CM,"" a BJP neta said.NCP has already appointed Ajit Pawar as group leader of its legislative party and Shiv Sena too has elected Eknath Shinde as leader of the Shiv Sena legislature party. BJP is yet to convene a meeting of its legislature party. A BJP leader said that was owing to a procedural wrangle. According to BJP procedure, the leader of the legislature party is appointed in the presence of a central observer.

Will NCP play the kingmaker?

Will Fadnavis sacrifice, again?

NEW DELHI: Who will be the next chief minister of Maharashtra? It's advantage Devendra Fadnavis amid suspense over which Mahayuti leader gets the top job. The BJP, with 132 seats - only 12 less than the half-way mark in the 288-member assembly, is the strongest contender for the post and needs only one ally to form a government. But, the Shiv Sena, despite winning only 57 seats - which is less than half of BJP's tally, is not giving up easily.The leaders of Shiv Sena, according to reports, feel that it was their leader Eknath Shinde , who as the incumbent chief minister, paved the way for the historic win of the ruling alliance with his governance. They also cite data from opinion poll surveys to claim that Shinde is the most popular leader of the Mahayuti.Shiv Sena spokesperson Naresh Mhaske on Monday pitched for Eknath Shinde as the chief minister citing BJP's arrangement with Nitish Kumar in Bihar. ""We feel Shinde should be the chief minister, just like in Bihar where BJP did not look at the numbers but still made JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar the CM. Senior leaders of the Mahayuti (in Maharashtra) will ultimately take a decision,"" Mhaske said.The Lok Sabha member compared the situation to the leadership dynamics in Haryana, where the BJP contested the assembly elections recently under Nayab Singh Saini's leadership.""The election in Maharashtra was contested under the leadership of Shinde, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar . This shows that the alliance's leadership should be respected,"" he said and added: ""Shinde has established himself as a commoner. He is the most popular leader in recent surveys by some news channels. His name is the frontrunner.""Shinde, who has emerged as a strong contender for the post, is not missing any opportunity to assert that his government's 'Majhi Ladki Bahin' scheme was the gamechanger in the elections. On Sunday he met with beneficiaries of the scheme and expressed his gratitude to them for the historic win of the Mahayuti alliance.Addressing the gathering, CM Shinde said that the government will soon increase the amount to Rs 2100 as promised.""I am with you all, I thank all Majhi Ladki Bahin for electing me. You all chose Mahayuti, as we promised we will be giving Rs 2100 to all my sisters. This government is yours and you choose this government again. I feel blessed you all came here and gave me blessings. This is a common people's government and we are working for the growth of Maharashtra,"" he said.However, going by the numbers there's no way Shiv Sena can dictate terms with the BJP.The NCP, which had hoped to be the kingmaker in government formation, may end up playing a key role in deciding between Fadnavis and Shinde as the next chief minister of the state. Ajit Pawar's party proved several experts wrong as it won an impressive 41 seats and established its rightful place in the alliance. Ajit Pawar, who was blamed for the drubbing of Mahayuti in Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, is now in a position to play the kingmaker.Ajit Pawar on Monday said no ""formula"" was being discussed for the chief minister's post and a decision on it will be taken together by the Mahayuti partners. ""Yesterday, NCP selected me as the party's leader in the assembly. Eknath Shinde was also elected as Shiv Sena's leader in the assembly and BJP will also do the same. We will sit together and discuss and will provide a stable government,"" he said.Ajit Pawar also said they will decide what formula to work out on the cabinet formation among the three parties. ""There are news reports that government should be formed before November 27 or else there will be President's rule, but there's nothing like that,"" the NCP leader said.The NCP supremo may prefer Fadnavis over Shinde as his boss given the fact that as a regional leader Shinde and Shiv Sena would be a bigger future rival.Fadnavis, who served as chief minister of Maharashtra from 2014 to 2019, has led the BJP to its best-ever performance in the state. In 2019, he could not become the chief minister as pre-poll ally Uddhav Thackeray parted ways from the NDA and formed the MVA government with Congress and NCP. In 2022, Fadnavis worked closely with Eknath Shinde to oust the MVA government and pave the way for the return of NDA government. However, the top BJP leadership then decided to give the top job to Eknath Shinde. Fadnavis, who had then announced to stay out of the government, was asked by the party leadership to work as Shinde's deputy.With Shinde's Shiv Sena making strong claims for the top job, it will be interesting to see if Fadnavis, after helping the party win record 132 seats, is ready for another sacrifice in the name of alliance.While Shinde remained the chief minister of the Mahayuti during the elections, Fadnavis, as deputy CM, played an important role in the governance. In the run up to the polls, when asked by reporters who is the CM face of the Mahayuti vis-à-vis the MVA, Fadnavis evaded a direct reply and said ""Our chief minister is sitting here, who is the CM face of the MVA?"" He did not say that Shinde was the CM face of the alliance.","The BJP, with 132 seats, is the strongest contender for the post and needs only one ally to form a government.

The notice, issued by local SDM, warns that strict action will be taken against anyone found violating this order. Additionally, instructions were given to the Municipal Corporation to confiscate any construction material lying on roads immediately.Around 20 people have been taken into custody following the alleged stone-pelting and clashes that erupted during a survey of a mosque in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal on Sunday morning, police said.The tension started on Sunday morning as a large group of people gathered near the mosque and started shouting slogans as the survey team began their work in the Shahi Jama Masjid.The protesters tried to torch vehicles and pelted stones at the police who used tear gas and batons to disperse the mob.""Gunshots were fired by the miscreants and some pellets struck our policemen. We are investigating where the shots were fired from, particularly in the Deepa Sarai area,"" an officer said.Tension has been brewing in Sambhal over the past few days after the Jama Masjid was surveyed last Tuesday on the orders of a local court following a petition that claimed that a Harihar temple stood at the site.""Some miscreants in the crowd threw stones at the police team. The police used minor force and tear gas to bring the situation under control,"" Superintendent of Police Krishna Kumar Vishnoi said.""We are in the process of registering an FIR in the incident. The accused will also be booked under the NSA,"" the police officer added.Petitioner Vishnu Shankar Jain had said the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) ordered the constitution of an ""Advocate Commission"" to survey the mosque. The court has said that a report should be filed after conducting a videography and photography survey through the commission, he had said.The Central and Uttar Pradesh governments, the mosque committee and the district magistrate of Sambhal have been made parties in the petition concerning the mosque, Jain.Uttar Pradesh minister Yogendra Upadhyay condemned the stone pelting at an ASI team surveying a Mughal-era mosque in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal and asserted that everyone has to live according to law and order under UP CM Yogi Adityanath 's governance.""I condemn this action. It is reprehensible to disobey the order given by the court. Failure to follow the court's order is a big crime... Under Yogi Adityanath's rule, everyone has to live according to law and order, despite their class or status in society,"" Upadhyay said.Union minister Giriraj Singh reacted to the stone pelting incident on the survey team and said that it was not just an assault on the government but an attack on India's democracy and rule of law.Singh criticised the community responsible for the attack, accusing them of showing distrust in the country's democratic institutions and emphasized that the nation will not tolerate such actions.""The attack that was carried out by a community in Sambhal and that too on the government machinery, this attack is not on the government machinery but on the democracy and law of India on which they do not trust. Now the country will not tolerate how this attack was carried out,"" Singh said,Meanwhile, Congress alleged that the Yogi Adityanath administration is squarely responsible for killing innocents and only the BJP-RSS is guilty of ""setting fire"" to the peace and harmony there.The opposition party said the videos of direct firing on the protesters in Sambhal depict the horrifying result of a ""well-planned conspiracy"" by Adityanath and the BJP-RSS.""In this entire matter, the BJP neither wanted the survey to proceed nor to stop it; its sole objective was to destroy harmony,"" Khera said.""No citizen in Uttar Pradesh is 'safe' under CM Adityanath, who gave the reprehensible slogan of 'Batenge toh Katenge'. This is evident by the highly deplorable incidents of Sambhal today,"" he added.Western Uttar Pradesh, which has been a symbol of goodwill and harmony for years, has today witnessed three people killed and many injured under a ""well-planned conspiracy"", the Congress leader said.""We say with full responsibility that the Adityanath administration is squarely responsible for killing innocents and only the BJP-RSS is guilty of setting fire to the peace and harmony of Sambhal. Modi-Yogi 'double assault' governments, which consider the minority community as second-class citizens, hurriedly got a petition filed in court,"" Khera said.It is public knowledge that the court ordered an immediate survey without hearing the other side, he said.""No action was taken against the rioters who accompanied the survey team. This makes it clear that after the by-elections in the state, the Yogi government has further intensified the politics of violence and hatred,"" he added.Khera said Rahul Gandhi has been continuously and stridently talked about 'Nafrat Ke Bazaar Mein Mohabbat Ki Dukaan' and in such a situation, an appeal is made to the people of Sambhal to recognise the politics of hatred, maintain mutual unity, amity and harmony, and take steps to protect their rights in a legal manner.","At least 5 people were dead and several others, including over 20 police personnel, were injured in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal.

"Trial results pending, but TB supplement gets govt nod",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trial-results-pending-but-tb-supplement-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/115676820.cms,"File photo

Instead of providing food, govt has decided to introduce Energy Dense Nutritional Supplementation (EDNS), a sachet of sweetened peanut paste, milk powder and oil, for 12 lakh underweight TB patients for two months even before results of a trial to establish efficacy of EDNS have been published. Experts questioned the haste in introducing this before publishing efficacy study and cautioned that this could commercialise the intervention and end up costing much more than supplying food to patients.The largest trial showing efficacy of nutritional support for underweight TB patients, which was published in Lancet in Sept last year, had recommended providing a monthly 10kg food basket (rice, pulses, milk powder and oil) and multivitamins for six months to help underweight TB patients gain weight and reduce mortality.This trial, called RATIONS (Reducing Activation of Tuberculosis by Improvement of Nutritional Status), funded by ICMR, involved 2,800 patients and was done between Aug 2019 and Jan 2021.RATIONS trial estimated monthly cost of the food basket at Rs 1,100 per patient at 2019 prices. However, govt estimate of Rs 1,040 crore to provide EDNS to 12 lakh patients for two months works out to roughly Rs 4,300 per patient per month. Moreover, EDNS is only for 2 months though nutritional support was recommended for six months.EDNS was being considered as an intervention for TB well before RATIONS trial results were published.A small study on acceptability of EDNS, involving 102 patients, was done between Sept 2018 and Feb 2019 by the same authors who did the efficacy trial later. It was published in Sept 2020. However, with RATIONS trials conclusively proving how effective distributing a food basket is in improving TB cure rates and reducing mortality, it has come as a surprise to many TB experts that govt has pushed ahead with EDNS.According to clinical trial registration website, efficacy trial with 329 participants, with 167 in intervention arm (given EDNS) and 162 in control arm (only given dietary advice), was funded by ICMR. It started in Jan 2020 and was completed in Feb 2023. ""Though results of the main trial have not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal, they have been presented to experts and have been accepted for presentation during Union World Congress on Lung health,"" said Dr Anand Krishnan, of Centre for Community Medicine in AIIMS Delhi, who is one of the study authors.Dr Veena Shatrugna, former deputy director of National Institute of Nutrition, said: ""The message of improving home diets in TB patients is not possible if such a programme is launched. It will be a fertile ground for the food processing industry to provide EDNS.""There was no response from health ministry, ICMR or TB division to queries sent to them.","Energy Dense Nutritional Supplementation (EDNS) is a sachet of sweetened peanut paste, milk powder and oil.

EW DELHI: Delhi Police on Monday arrested Lokesh Sharma , then OSD of former Rajasthan CM and Congress veteran Ashok Gehlot , in the phone-tapping case. Although Sharma secured bail, police are likely to seek his remand for custodial interrogation, sources said. Police didn't confirm reports of Sharma turning approver.The allegations date back to July 2020 when Gehlot faced a rebellion from deputy CM Sachin Pilot and the latter's loyalists.An FIR was registered on March 25, 2021, on complaint by Gajendra Singh Shekhawat , Union minister and Jodhpur BJP MP.The FIR accused Sharma of circulating audio clips of alleged telephonic conversations between Shekhawat and Congress functionaries, apparently discussing toppling the Gehlot govt.Sharma arrest is expected to open a can of worms. He was questioned multiple times over the last four years, with the last interrogation in Sept this year. He is learnt to have said Gehlot handed him a pen drive containing audio recordings. Sharma had alleged that Gehlot instructed him to release the recordings to the media, while insisting that only the former CM could provide further details. Sharma submitted the pen drive and other evidence to Delhi Police.Delhi HC had lifted the stay on his arrest on Nov 15 after Sharma withdrew his plea for such protection. Sharma had told the HC that he had cooperated with the investigation from the beginning and would continue to do so.Sharma alleged that Gehlot placed several netas, including Pilot and his allies, under surveillance and their movements were monitored. He submitted a seven-page statement describing the sequence of events on July 16, 2020. He claimed to have transferred the recordings to a laptop and then to his phone before uploading them on social media.","Lokesh Sharma, then OSD of former Rajasthan CM and Congress veteran Ashok Gehlot, arrested in phone-tapping case.

"'Socialist' and 'secular' to stay in Preamble, rules Supreme Court; junks PIL",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/socialist-and-secular-to-stay-in-preamble-rules-supreme-court-junks-pil/articleshow/115672041.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ending a five-decade-old debate on insertions of words 'socialist' and 'secular' in the Preamble of the Constitution, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the Emergency-era amendment to the Preamble and said these words neither impede private entrepreneurship nor fetter govt from getting rid of obnoxious religious practices.Throwing out challenge to the 42nd constitutional amendment that inserted these two words along with 'integrity' in the Preamble in 1976 by the Indira Gandhi govt, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said secularism mandates the govt not to favour any religion but it does not prevent elimination of religious attitudes and practices impeding development and right to equality.It said despite freedom of religion guaranteed to the citizens and their non-discrimination on the ground of their faith, the Constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy permits the govt to strive for a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a hot topic in the Indian polity since the Shah Bano case judgment of the SC in 1985.The bench said socialism in the Indian context does not restrict economic policies of an elected govt. ""Neither the Constitution nor the Preamble mandates a specific economic policy or structure, whether left or right. Rather, 'socialist' denotes the State's commitment to be a welfare State and its commitment to ensuring equality of opportunity,"" it said.It said the socialism practised in India aims to achieve the goal of economic and social upliftment of citizens and in no way restricts private entrepreneurship and the right to do business, which is guaranteed as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(9g).CJI Khanna-led bench said, ""India has consistently embraced a mixed economy model, where the private sector has flourished, expanded and grown over the years, contributing significantly to the upliftment of marginalised and underprivileged sections in different ways. In the Indian framework, socialism embodies the principle of economic and social justice, wherein the State ensures that no citizen is disadvantaged due to economic or social circumstances.""The challenge to the 42nd amendment was mounted by a PIL in 2020, a good 44 years after the insertion of the words 'socialist' and 'secular' in the Preamble on the grounds - the framers of the Constitution had omitted these two words from the Preamble after long deliberations; the word 'socialist' restricted the govt's choice of economic policy; and, that the amendment was passed on Nov 2, 1976, nearly eight months after the term of Lok Sabha got over on Mar 18, 1976. ""We do not find any legitimate cause or justification for challenging the constitutional amendment after nearly 44 years,"" the bench said.The SC said the power to amend the Constitution rests only with Parliament and this power extends to amending the Preamble. On the validity of insertion of 'secular' in Preamble, the SC said, ""Over time, India has developed its own interpretation of secularism, wherein the State neither supports any religion nor penalises the profession and practice of any faith.""Listing several fundamental rights under the Constitution, which bars govt from discriminating citizens on the ground of faith and allows people to profess a religion of their choice while allowing minority communities from establishing and administering their educational institutions, the bench said, ""Despite these provisions, Article 44 in the Directive Principles of State Policy permits the state to strive for a uniform civil code for its citizens.""",Supreme Court throws out challenge to 42nd constitutional amendment that inserted these two words along with 'integrity' in the Preamble in 1976 by the Indira Gandhi govt.

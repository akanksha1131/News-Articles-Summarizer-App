Ladakh violence: MHA sets up judicial commission to investigate September clashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladakh-violence-mha-sets-up-judicial-commission-to-investigate-september-clashes/articleshow/124652857.cms,"Image/ANI

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

NEW DELHI: Conceding a key demand of the Ladakh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the home ministry on Friday ordered a judicial inquiry into the “serious law and order” situation created in Leh town on Sept 24, 2025, which resulted in police action that claimed four lives.The judicial inquiry will be conducted by former Supreme Court judge B S Chauhan, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said in a notification issued on Friday. He will be assisted by retired district and sessions judge Mohan Singh Parihar, who will serve as judicial secretary, and former IAS officer Tushar Anand who shall be the administrative secretary.The notification on the “impartial” judicial probe — which came on the eve of a planned silent march and blackout by the two outfits in Ladakh — could brighten the prospects of early resumption of talks with the two Ladakh outfits through the high-powered committee set up by the Central govt. However, despite the MHA having conceded LAB and KDA’s central demand to have a retired SC judge look into the Sept 24 events, their leaders had not called off their protests until the time of going to the press.Before the Sept 24 violence broke out, LAB and KDA had reached an agreement on reviving the HPC parleys after a gap of four months and were scheduled to meet home ministry representatives on Oct 6. In fact, some MHA officials were in Leh at the time of the violence, preparing the ground for the parleys in New Delhi.The violence, coinciding with the protest fast by activist Sonam Wangchuk to press for statehood and Sixth Schedule status, and the death of four individuals in police firing, however, upset these plans. LAB and KDA decided to put off a meeting with the Central govt until their demand for a probe led by a retired SC judge into the Sept 24 violence was conceded.The Govt had on Sept 29 stated that it has always been open for dialogue on Ladakh matters with LAB and KDA at any time and on any platform. In fact, the dialogue mechanism has already yielded some good results, in the form of 85% reservation to Scheduled Tribes of Ladakh, 33% quota for women in Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) and protection to local languages, it added.",The judicial inquiry will be conducted by former Supreme Court judge B S Chauhan. He will be assisted by retired district and sessions judge Mohan Singh Parihar and former IAS officer Tushar Anand.

16 judges recused from this whistleblower’s suits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/16-judges-recused-from-this-whistleblowers-suits/articleshow/124652793.cms,"Sanjiv Chaturvedi

Magsaysay winner Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s petitions are piling up at courts across the country. The whistleblower has fought cases alone, and even found Presidential support. So why are his battles being stalled?

.

In a judicial system where recusals are rare and typically explained, 16 judges — across district courts, high courts and even Supreme Court — recused themselves from hearing one man’s cases, most without offering a reason. That man is Sanjiv Chaturvedi, a 2002-batch Indian Forest Service officer known not for fiery speeches or media attention but corruption reports so meticulously documented that they have prompted Presidential interventions. After nearly a decade of legal drift and avoidance, the chief justice of Uttarakhand high court has now, finally, agreed to hear all his pending cases himself.Chaturvedi walks into courtrooms alone. Sometimes, he argues his own cases, quietly quoting from case law. He avoids press interviews. He has no legal entourage. And yet, the names in his vigilance reports include senior bureaucrats, ministers, and institutional heads. What he lacks in theatre, he makes up for in records. But courtroom after courtroom has turned him away — not with judgment, but with absence.An electrical engineer from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology in Prayagraj, Chaturvedi became a public name not by choice, but by consequence.In Haryana, where he was first posted, he flagged illegal tree-felling, sand mining, and wildlife poaching — operations that, according to his findings, were protected by elements within the state’s bureaucracy and political leadership. He was transferred 12 times in five years. In 2007, he was suspended — an action later reversed by Presidential order in 2008.The Haryana govt filed a departmental chargesheet against him, accusing him of procedural lapses — charges he maintained were retaliatory. His complaint to the Centre led to the formation of a two-member inquiry committee. The panel reviewed the case and named then chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and senior officials, holding them responsible for corruption, abuse of power, and targeted harassment of the officer. The committee concluded that the disciplinary charges were “baseless”, and recommended their annulment. It also advised that “action be considered against those who initiated them in bad faith”.In Jan 2011, the President accepted the committee’s recommendation and quashed the chargesheet. In Feb that year, the Haryana governor implemented the Presidential order, reversing Chaturvedi’s suspension and validating his actions. But in 2014, the same Congress-led Haryana govt filed a case seeking to quash both the inquiry report and the Presidential order — omitting the fact that its own governor had already implemented it. Chaturvedi filed his reply in 2016, which was taken on record by judge P B Bajanthri. In Feb 2018, the same judge fined him Rs 50,000, citing delay. A three-judge SC bench, led by the chief justice, waived the fine at first hearing. When Chaturvedi requested transfer of the matter to SC under Article 139A, citing similarity with other pending cases, SC left the issue to Punjab and Haryana high court.By then, Chaturvedi had been posted as chief vigilance officer at AIIMS, Delhi. Between 2012 and 2014, he initiated over 200 corruption inquiries — ranging from purchase scams to appointment irregularities. Among those named was Vineet Chawdhary, a 1982-batch Himachal Pradesh cadre IAS officer and former deputy director (admin) at AIIMS, who was later appointed chief secretary by the BJP govt in Himachal Pradesh.As CVO, Chaturvedi was authorised to report on the vigilance status of deputed officers. In Aug 2014, he sent a confidential letter to Himachal’s chief secretary about pending CBI and departmental cases against Chawdhary, based on investigations conducted under his watch. In 2016, Chawdhary filed a criminal defamation complaint. A trial court issued summons in 2018.Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code protects govt servants from prosecution for official acts without sanction. Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code exempts official communication from defamation. Both provisions have been repeatedly upheld by SC and HC. However, when Chaturvedi approached Himachal Pradesh high court, chief justice Sanjay Karol refused to quash the proceedings. SC later observed that HC had failed to consider Chaturvedi’s submissions — but instead of halting the trial, it remanded the matter back to the same bench. The same HC had granted protection under section 197 CrPC in other cases, including to a top IPS officer.Citing threats to his life, Chaturvedi had requested a cadre transfer, which was approved in Aug 2015. Of course, new challenges awaited. In 2016, the Union health ministry gave him a ‘zero’ appraisal for the financial year 2015-16. He filed a writ in Uttarakhand HC. Then chief justice K M Joseph refused to admit the petition, citing a 1997 SC ruling (L Chandrakumar), which required service matters to be routed through tribunals. However, records show that Joseph had previously entertained — and soon after resumed hearing — similar petitions, including by IFS officers under investigation.Chaturvedi then approached the Central Administrative Tribunal, which stayed the appraisal report in Sept 2017. The stay remains in place as the central govt has not responded.Meanwhile, a new pattern emerged: judges began recusing themselves. Sixteen in total, across SC, HC and district courts. Some stepped aside after reading case files, others during initial hearings. Most gave no reason. Chaturvedi had no legal remedy to challenge this trend.“Recusals are meant to protect judicial impartiality. But here, they’ve become a wall,” said SC advocate Pramod Choudhary. Chaturvedi’s counsel Sudershan Goel cited SC rulings in R C Chandel (2012) and a 2019 verdict, both underscoring that judges are bound to decide cases based solely on facts and applicable law. “There is no precedent for this many recusals,” Goel said. “It amounts to a constitutional breakdown of judicial accountability. ”Though courts have often turned him away, national institutions have recognised Chaturvedi’s work. He has delivered lectures on preventive vigilance at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy and Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. He donated his entire Magsaysay award money to the Prime Minister’s Fund, gave Rs 2.5 lakh from an arbitration case to Pulwama victims, and redirected court costs in his favour to the PM’s National Relief Fund.He was 40 when he received the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2015, making him one of the youngest Indian civil servants to win the honour — Kiran Bedi and T N Seshan were older. The citation praised his “exemplary integrity, courage and tenacity” in exposing corruption. His legal ability has also been recognised. A chief justice of Uttarakhand HC remarked that Chaturvedi argued “better than most counsel”.Now posted in Uttarakhand, he has shifted focus to conservation. He has led efforts to develop India’s first moss garden, forest healing centre, and pollinator park. In Corbett, he stopped unauthorised VIP safaris and fake tourism portals. In 2024, he submitted a 500-page report on an illegal tree-felling scam in Pithoragarh, recommending a CBI and ED probe.The cases he filed years ago continue to move slowly through the system. Judges still step aside. And he still walks in, alone, quoting law from memory, steadfast in his faith that truth will eventually triumph and he will be able to declare Satyameva Jayate.","Sanjiv Chaturvedi is a 2002-batch Indian Forest Service officer.

Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train Project Reaches Key Milestone with Ghansoli Tunnel Completion

New Delhi: Finding that a temple as well as commercial and residential properties were demolished for widening a road in Ahmedabad, the Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea against partial demolition of 400-year-old Mancha Masjid, saying the municipality is serving a public purpose.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi refused to accede to persistence of the counsel representing Mansa Masjid Trust for protecting the prayer hall of the mosque as Ahmedabad municipal corporation through Astha Mehta said the civic body had categorically stated before the HC that only a vacant piece of land and portion of a platform of the mosque will be affected by the road-widening project to ease traffic congestion.Mehta said the main structure of the mosque would not be affected at all and drew the court’s attention to the demolition of a temple and residents voluntarily giving up their properties to enable the civic body to widen the road in the larger public interest.The bench said it is not a case of infringement of right to religion under Article 25. “The wakf board may be entitled to compensation for utilising the mosque land only if the board could prove that the land belonged to wakf.You may be entitled for bigger land to build a mosque for namaz. But the HC is right in finding that the civic body had scrupulously followed the provisions of Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act while proceeding to take a portion of mosque land for road widening. ”When the counsel for the mosque insisted for a court order to protect the prayer hall, the bench said, “No such action is contemplated. A temple has been dismantled, and they did not claim any compensation. We are saying you will be entitled for compensation under GPMC Act if the wakf board could prove it is a wakf property.” State govt had told the HC widening of the road in Saraspur was crucial for easing congestion and boosting urban development along the stretch connecting Kalupur railway station and Ahmedabad Metro.",The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea against partial demolition of 400-year-old Mancha Masjid.

perumai’

For some, fault-finding is not an occasional lapse, it is a way of life. They thrive on pointing fingers, for criticism offers a fleeting sense of control , a feeling of superiority that conceals inner insecurity.We often speak of Type A and Type B personalities. Type A is the perfectionist, structured, driven, precise. Type B flows with life, flexible, unhurried. To be a Type A person is not your choice, it is how you are made. Yet even for those who notice every flaw , there is a choice inyou point it out.I learned about this when I was part of the organizing committee of a ten-day workshop. Each day brought new participants and speakers. Amid the bustle, name tags were sometimes printed wrong. My friends and I devised what we called the ‘name tag test’When a name tag was incorrect, some smiled and said, “Not a problem.” There are others who would be wild. One such looked at us frostily and said, “You should be more careful. My name isnotThere are ‘correctors’ all around us. We sometimes learn from them, but often their intent is not to help, but to savour the small thrill of superiority that comes from finding an error.It reminded me of a meme. The devil was showing a newcomer to hell, the lake of fire and said, “This is the lava you’ll be spending eternity in.”The newcomer corrected him: “It’s. Lava is molten rock that erupted on the earth’s surface, magma is beneath it. We’re underground, so it’s magma.”The devil sighed, “This is why you’re here, you realize?”Correct a mistake, if you must. But be gentle. Instead of telling people they were wrong, Greek philosopher Socrates asked questions that led them to realize it themselves. Thispreserved dignity while revealing truth.Thiruvalluvar, who lived perhaps around the same time, offered something even nobler:This truth echoes in our epics too. One episode fromstill melts my heart.At Sita’s insistence, Rama sets out to capture the magical golden deer, despite Lakshmana’s warning. When the demon, disguised as the deer, falls to Rama’s arrow, it screams in Rama’s voice, “Hey Lakshmana! Hey Sita!”Terrified, Sita pleads with her brother-in-law to go save Rama. Lakshmana refuses to leave her alone. In her panic, Sita loses reason and utters something unthinkable: “Your brother is in danger, and you still wish to remain here by my side?”When Rama had slain the deer and saw Lakshmana, he asked why Sita was left alone. Lakshmana did not speak of the cruel words hurled at him by the very person he revered as a mother. He merely bowed his head and said softly that Sita was terrified, and so he came.Not once did he speak of her accusation. The words that had wounded him so deeply remained buried within him, sealed by affection and restraint.Later, when Sita sat imprisoned in Lanka, she wept in remorse. She recalled her abominable words against her innocent brother-in-law and feared that Rama, hearing of them, had turned away from her. But she never knew that those words had not travelled beyond Lakshmana’s heart.Like Lord Shiva who swallowed poison to preserve the world, Lakshmana swallowed pain to preserve peace. He chose silence, not because he was weak, but because he valued harmony more than vindication.In life too, there are moments when words are better swallowed, faults better overlooked, and forgiveness a greater act than correction.Thiruvalluvar calls such restraint ‘— greatness.For true greatness is not in catching another’s slip, but in having the grace to let it pass.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124632548,imgsize-57620,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124632548.jpg"

Both gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum and investors should look to buy on dips, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

He shares his views on gold and silver:

MCX Gold Outlook:

MCX Gold Trading Strategy:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Both gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

Holiday list of key Diwali days

Advisory for students and parents

Diwali 2025 falls on Monday, October 20, and most schools across India have declared a holiday on this day to mark the main festival. However, confusion remains in certain regions over whether schools will remain closed on October 20 or extend the holiday to October 21 for Govardhan Puja.The variation in school holiday dates is largely due to differing state-wise calendars and board affiliations. While CBSE and ICSE schools typically follow a standard national schedule, several state boards have announced extended breaks, affecting the exact holiday dates.The holidays typically include major days such as Dhanteras, Chhoti Diwali (Narak Chaturdashi), Diwali, Govardhan Puja, and Bhai Dooj. Students from CBSE, ICSE, and various state boards are expected to get leave during this period to celebrate with their families.The standard Diwali break in 2025 begins on October 18 and ends on October 23. Schools will observe holidays for Dhanteras, Chhoti Diwali, the main Diwali festival, Govardhan Puja, and Bhai Dooj. However, this schedule differs in some states due to additional festivals such as Chhath Puja or other administrative closures.Most CBSE and ICSE schools will follow this six-day holiday schedule unless specified otherwise by local authorities.A number of state governments and local education departments have issued specific school holiday notifications. These variations are outlined below:Most CBSE and ICSE affiliated schools are expected to follow the general national pattern from October 18 to October 23. This includes leave for all five key days of the Diwali festival. However, schools located in states with regional observances may adopt longer or altered schedules based on local directives.According to school calendars and state announcements, the following key days are observed during the Diwali holidays:• Dhanteras – October 18, 2025 (Saturday)• Chhoti Diwali (Narak Chaturdashi) – October 19, 2025 (Sunday)• Diwali – October 20, 2025 (Monday)• Govardhan Puja – October 22, 2025 (Wednesday)• Bhai Dooj – October 23, 2025 (Thursday)Although most schools follow their respective board guidelines, the final holiday schedule may vary by institution. Parents and students are advised to confirm dates directly with their schools. Certain private and government schools may extend or shorten breaks based on administrative decisions or local customs.","Diwali 2025 falls on Monday, October 20, and most schools across India have declared a holiday on this day to mark the main festival.

Durgapur rape case: Victim's father apologises to 'mother-like' Mamata; seeks justice for daughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/durgapur-rape-case-victims-father-apologises-to-mother-like-mamata-seeks-justice-for-daughter/articleshow/124579824.cms,"NEW DELHI: Days after criticising chief minister Mamata Banerjee over her remarks on women's safety, the father of the Durgapur gang rape victim on Wednesday described her as a ""mother-like figure"" and sought forgiveness, urging her to help secure justice for his daughter.""Mamata Banerjee is like a mother-like figure to me. If I have said anything wrong, I ask her to forgive me. I will render countless obeisance at her feet. But I ask her to help my daughter get justice,"" the victim’s father told TV channels, according to PTI.""I have been demanding a CBI probe into this case. I think that would be good. But that depends on the state administration as well,"" he added.His remarks come days after he criticised the chief minister for her comment that ""women should not venture out at night,"" following the assault of his daughter, a second-year MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur.Earlier on Monday, the survivor's father stated that, ""She (Mamata Banerjee) is also a woman. How can she say such an irresponsible thing? Should women quit their jobs and sit at home? It seems Bengal is under the rule of Aurangzeb.""He further expressed a loss of faith in West Bengal's law and order situation and said he wanted to take his daughter back to Odisha for her safety. ""I want to take my daughter back to Odisha. Her life comes first, her career later,"" he added.The controversy began after Mamata Banerjee, while addressing the media about the crime, said, ""I learned that she was outside the campus at 12.30 am. Students residing in hostels should refrain from venturing out at night. Private medical colleges must ensure the safety of their students, particularly female students, who should not be permitted to leave the premises at night. Girls should protect themselves as well. ""Defending the police, Banerjee had said it was not possible for officers to monitor everyone's movements or stand guard outside every house.Her comments, however, drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders, women’s rights groups, and the Odisha government, who accused her of victim-blaming.Mamata later clarified that her statement had been ""distorted and taken out of context."" ""The media distorted my words. You ask me a question, I answer it, and then you distort it. Do not try this kind of politics,"" she asserted.The 22-year-old MBBS student was allegedly gang-raped on October 10 after she stepped out of her college campus with a male friend to get food.Police have so far arrested six people, including the friend, in connection with the case, which has triggered widespread outrage and political uproar across the state.","Mamata Banerjee is like a mother-like figure to me.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-demerger-what-does-it-mean-for-investors-why-did-the-share-price-drop-40-explained/articleshow/124544495.cms,"The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. (AI image)

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Belgian court clears Choksi’s extradition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/belgian-court-clears-choksis-extradition/articleshow/124647606.cms,".

Belgian Court Clears Fugitive Jeweller Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India

New Delhi: A Belgian court on Friday upheld the arrest of fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi by Belgian police on India's request and approved his extradition to face trial in Rs 13,000 crore bank fraud case. This significant development comes after Choksi's arrest in Antwerp in April this year.Choksi, uncle of another high-profile fugitive Nirav Modi who is in jail in UK, can appeal the order in a higher court in the next 15 days. However, officials in India expressed satisfaction over the development saying that Belgian court's order marked an important step towards his return to India. Declared a flight risk, Choksi was denied bail and has been lodged in an Antwerp prison. With his arrest upheld, he is likely to stay in prison until the Belgian judiciary decides India's case for him being sent back.Earlier in Aug, at least two Belgian courts rejected Choksi’s bail plea after the Indian law enforcement argued that Choksi was a habitual absconder and was likely to flee to another country if granted bail. The CBI gave Belgian prosecutors with details of of his involvement in economic offences in India and his escape from US and Antigua in the past besides the two open warrants against him.The last extradition hearing took place in Sept.According to a filing by the Indian govt, Choksi will be lodged at Arthur Road jail in Mumbai upon extradition which adheres to the European standards of prisoner management. He will be provided all facilities, including clean drinking water and adequate food besides access to newspapers and TV and medical treatment of his choice.The Global Operations Centre of CBI is monitoring the developments in the case in direct coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies besides Interpol channels. It has also hired the services of a local law firm to bolster their case. Wanted in bank fraud cases to the tune of over Rs 13,900 crore, Choksi fled India in Jan 2018. He went to the US and to Antigua whose citizenship he had obtained a year before.","Belgian court on Friday upheld the arrest of fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi by Belgian police on India's request and approved his extradition to face trial in Rs 13,000 crore bank fraud case.

What is the case against Mehul Choksi?



A Belgian court on Friday ordered the extradition of fugitive Mehul Choksi to India, news agency PTI reported citing officials. Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.""The order has come in our favour. The court has termed his arrest by the Belgian authorities on India's request valid. The first legal step in getting him extradited is now clear,"" a senior official told PTI.Officials stated that the order marks a significant validation of India's efforts to secure Mehul Choksi's extradition, although he still has the option to appeal the decision in a higher Belgian court. Prosecutors argued before the court that Choksi poses a flight risk and should not be released from custody, the officials told PTI.Choksi, who relocated to Belgium in 2023 after leaving Antigua and Barbuda, was arrested there in April following India’s extradition request. He and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused of defrauding the bank of over Rs 13,000 crore.India had earlier assured Belgian authorities that if extradited, Choksi will be housed in Barrack No. 12 at Arthur Road jail, Mumbai, with adequate space and no risk of overcrowding or solitary confinement.The Union home ministry, in a September 4 communique, confirmed that the cell meets the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) of Europe’s minimum space standards.Choksi fled to Antigua and Barbuda, where he acquired citizenship, before being apprehended in Belgium. India’s agencies swiftly coordinated to secure his extradition. The cell assigned to Choksi measures roughly 20 by 15 feet, with a separate toilet, ventilation, and security measures. Inmates receive daily cleaning, fresh water, outdoor exercise, board games, yoga sessions, and access to media and telemedicine. Weekly family visits and daily legal consultations are permitted.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in a Rs 13,000 crore fraud involving fraudulent Letters of Undertaking issued by Punjab National Bank. Nirav Modi, a declared fugitive economic offender, is currently jailed in London and contesting extradition. The CBI’s extradition request cites the UN conventions against corruption and organised crime, supported by arrest warrants from Mumbai courts. The fraud involved PNB issuing 165 LoUs and 58 Foreign Letters of Credit in 2017 without limits or proper records, leading to massive losses covered by the bank.Authorities allege that loans were obtained from overseas banks across locations including Mauritius, Hong Kong, Antwerp, and Frankfurt based on these fraudulent guarantees. When the companies failed to repay, PNB was forced to pay over Rs 6,300 crore, including interest, to these foreign banks.","Fugitive Jeweller Mehul Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.

Not the first messy start

NDA's campaign mode on

NEW DELHI: As nominations for Phase 1 of the Bihar assembly elections closed on Friday, the NDA appeared battle-ready, its candidate list finalised, campaign plan rolled out.Across the aisle, the opposition's Mahagathbandhan (or INDIA bloc), led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), continues to debate who fights where. Congress and RJD, which are still holding talks, have also declared a few of its candidates for the high-prestige contest.This, obviously, has given a big ammunition to the NDA which has claimed that the Mahagathbandhan has crumbled even before the contest.Yet, despite the optics of confusion, alliance leaders insist the delay signals expansion, not disarray.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been part of the opposition bloc's discussions, said such coordination takes time. ""Coordination matters more than speed,"" he quipped, adding that the bloc’s final list would be announced soon.Congress leader Pawan Khera on Thursday also questioned why NDA was concerned about Mahagathbandhan's deal.Khera informed that candidates were filing their nominations and the procedure for seat distribution was under way. He affirmed clearance on the situation and mentioned that the Mahagathbandhan government will be formed in Bihar.""The work is going on very well, symbols are being distributed. Those who have to file nominations are also doing so. The process has started... Very soon, the entire situation will be clear to everyone. The Mahagathbandhan government is going to be formed. Why is the NDA raising questions? They should think about themselves,"" Khera told ANI.CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya dismissed speculation of infighting within the opposition alliance.""People may feel there is chaos in the INDIA bloc. But the delay in announcing seats is because more constituents are on board this time. It’s definitely not a sign of disintegration,” he told PTI.Bhattacharya revealed that his party, which won 12 of the 19 seats it contested in 2020, would field roughly the same number this time.This year's Mahagathbandhan is more crowded than in 2020, when it included the RJD, Congress, and the three Left parties — CPI(ML), CPI, and CPI(M).Now, Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has joined the fold, while talks are under way with Hemant Soren’s JMM, which wants to contest a few border seats.Congress, meanwhile, has released its first list of 48 candidates even before the seat-sharing formula was finalised - a move that signalled both impatience and self-confidence. Among the key names are state chief Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), CLP leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa), and Youth Congress chief Prakash Garib Das (Bachhwara).In Bachhwara, however, CPI’s Awadesh Roy has also filed papers, creating what insiders call a ""friendly contest"", a common phenomenon in Bihar’s multi-party coalitions.Sources within the bloc told PTI said RJD has tentatively agreed to allot 61 seats to the Congress, with some negotiations still underway over high-stakes constituencies.In India’s electoral playbook, such overlaps between allies are common. When alliances negotiate till the last minute, parties often field 'friendly' candidates in the same seats, using the withdrawal window to clean up overlaps once the deal is sealed.The withdrawal window, which opens after nominations close, gives them room to tidy up overlaps once the final deal is sealed. Candidates in overlapping seats typically withdraw nominations at the last minute, leaving only the officially endorsed name in the fray.With the Phase 1 withdrawal deadline on Monday, and Phase 2 deadline on Thursday, several overlapping candidates are likely to quietly withdraw once the bloc finalises its list.This isn’t the first time Bihar’s opposition has walked into an election season with unresolved seat-sharing issues.In 2020, the RJD and Congress sparred till the eleventh hour over key constituencies, and yet, the alliance went on to deliver one of its strongest performances in years, falling just short of defeating the NDA. The Grand Alliance registered win on 110 seats out of 243. Tejashwi Yadav's RJD emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and he was election leader of opposition in the assembly.The Left parties contested as part of the alliance and performed notably well, especially CPI-ML(L) that won 12 seats. Congress secured 19 seats.That precedent might have made leaders more relaxed about the optics of delay.The NDA, by contrast, has its machinery in motion. The JD(U) and BJP are contesting 101 seats each, with allies LJP (Ram Vilas), RLM, and HAM covering the rest.The BJP’s 40-member star campaigner list, led by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, signals a high-energy campaign. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking his 10th term, is pitching continuity and stability, while the opposition bets on discontent, voter fatigue and anti-incumbency.The first phase of voting will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14. For now, the NDA may have the early advantage in optics, but Mahagathbandhan's late start may not necessarily have an impact on the final results.","BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls.

NEW DELHI: It was 11 years ago that Supreme Court recognised transgender people as the ‘third gender’ and upheld their fundamental right to equality and dignity.Observing that discrimination still continued, however, the court on Friday appointed a committee headed by a retired Delhi HC judge to frame a comprehensive equal opportunity policy for the community in the arenas of employment and education. It also directed setting up of a transgender protection cell and a dedicated nationwide toll-free helpline number.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan expressed its anguish over the “lethargic” attitude of the Centre and states to protect the community’s rights. It said the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 — which sought to prevent social exclusion, discrimination, unemployment and lack of educational and medical facilities faced by transgender persons — remained in law books and was never implemented in true spirit. The law was “brutishly reduced to dead letters”, SC said, for which both Centre and states were to blame.“We are pained to observe that there has either been a superficial and sporadic, or a complete lack of implementation of measures to ensure the prevention of discrimination against transgender persons in various spheres of life, both public and private... The right against discrimination of transgender and gender diverse persons has long been recognised by this court ever since the judgment in NALSA (supra) wherein it was held that the ground of ‘sex’ under Article 15 of the Constitution also includes the analogous ground of gender identity,” SC said.The court said all stakeholders concerned had not only exhibited “a serious and perennial lack of action”, but also reinforced discrimination towards the community despite the existence of a statutory framework. It said govt authorities must provide due respect and consideration to the constitutional value underlying public participation.“There is no gainsaying that the Union of India and the states need to do a lot more to create mechanisms for the transgender persons to translate their rights into reality. The lethargy exhibited on part of the govt concerned has also led the non-state establishments to put the compliance of the 2019 Act and of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020 in a cold freeze. This abeyance of rights is a matter of serious concern,” it said.",It was 11 years ago that Supreme Court recognised transgender people as the ‘third gender’ and upheld their fundamental right to equality and dignity.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday sought to know from the ministry of home affairs and CBI what pan-India action was required to unearth cybercrime syndicates extorting money from people, especially senior citizens, by threatening them with digital arrest.“We are of the prima facie view that stern action on panIndia basis with coordinated efforts between central (agencies) and state police is required to unearth the full extent of this criminal enterprise involving forgery of judicial documents, cyber extortion and cyber arrest of innocent people, especially senior citizens,” a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said.The order came in a writ petition registered suo motu by SC after a septuagenarian couple from Ambala alleged that fraudsters forced them to part with over Rs 1 crore by displaying forged SC orders through WhatsApp and video conferencing. “We are aghast that the fraudsters fabricated judicial orders in the name of SC and various other documents,” the court said.The bench said ordinarily it would have ordered the Ambala cyber cell to expedite the probe but when judicial orders and judge’s signatures were forged with impunity, and the crime appeared to be spreading to many parts of the country, coordinated investigation was required. It requested attorney general R Venkataramani to assist the court in the matter.“Forgery of documents and brazen criminal misuse of the name, seal, and judicial authority of SC or (Bombay) HC is a matter of grave concern. The fabrication of judicial orders bearing forged signatures of judges strikes at the very foundation of public trust in the judicial system, besides the rule of law,” SC said. “Such acts constitute a direct assault on the dignity and majesty of this institution; therefore, such grave criminal acts cannot be treated as ordinary or routine offences of cheating or cybercrime. ”",Supreme Court sought to know from the ministry of home affairs and CBI what pan- India action was required to unearth cybercrime syndicates.

If guv was to test repugnancy of bills, then he should be in SC: TN

Delhi: Supreme Court on Friday spurned the Tamil Nadu govt’s plea for a direction to the President not to take decision on two bills — one to establish Kalaignar University and the other amending the TN Physical Education and Sports University Act — which according to the state were “unconstitutionally” referred to her by the governor disregarding the advice of council of ministers, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.“We cannot pass an order preventing the President from taking a decision,” said a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran when senior advocate P Wilson pleaded that the governor had acted in violation of the constitutional mandate to act in aid and advice of the council of ministers.Adjourning hearing on two writ petitions filed by TN challenging the governor’s decision, the bench said, “You would have to wait at most for four weeks to get a clear picture.” A five-judge bench led by the CJI had on Sept 11 reserved verdict on President’s Reference, questioning the jurisdiction of SC to fix time limits for the President and governors on granting or refusing assent to bills passed by a state assembly.Since CJI Gavai is retiring on Nov 24, the judgment would have to be pronounced before that by the five judge-bench, which also comprises Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar.The President had framed 14 questions related to jurisdiction of SC and the ambit of its exclusive powers under Article 142 after a two-judge bench led by Justice J B Pardiwala had on Apr 8 granted deemed assent to 10 TN bills pending for months before the governor.Appearing for TN, senior advocates A M Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi said the governor cannot scrutinise the bills clause by clause to declare its repugnancy to central laws and refer it to the President.“If the governor was to test the repugnancy of bills, then he should be sitting in SC and not in Raj Bhavan,” Rohatgi said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said governors, since the coming into force of the Constitution in 1950, have been testing the repugnancy of bills and it is not a recent practice. Moreover, he presented statistics before the court to show that only a minuscule of the bills sent to governors have been referred to the President.He said of the 6,942 bills sent to governors in all states since 2015, assent has been granted in 6,481 bills, 50 have been returned with a message to assemblies, assent has been withheld in 11 and 381 bills have been reserved for consideration of the President.","Supreme Court spurned Tamil Nadu govt’s plea for a direction to the President not to take decision on two bills. “We cannot pass an order preventing the President from taking a decision,” said a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124647137,imgsize-42646,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-07-15-152225.jpg"

HAL Celebrates Maiden Flight of the First Tejas Mk1A Fighter Jet Manufactured at its Nashik Facility

Tejas-Mk1A fighter aircraft

NASHIK: The first Tejas-Mk1A fighter aircraft produced at defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's (HAL) Nashik complex completed its maiden flight here on Friday. The aircraft was rolled out after defence minister Rajnath Singh formally inaugurated the LCA and HTT-40 (trainer aircraft) assembly complexes here.The formal induction of Tejas-Mk1A into the Indian Air Force (IAF), however, will depend on the successful completion of ongoing weapon and radar integration trials.Nashik now hosts the third LCA production line and the second HTT-40 production line. The rollout event, which included a traditional water cannon salute for the Mk1A, comes even as HAL races to meet Tejas-Mk1A delivery timelines for the IAF.The aircraft must clear trials involving the Astra beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, short-range missiles, and laser-guided bombs.The pre-induction tests will also validate integration with the Israeli-origin ELTA ELM-2052 radar and fire-control system. Earlier tests had encountered software-related snags, prompting modifications before final validation.The Mk1A rollout from Nashik is part of HAL’s broader production ramp-up plan. In addition to its two operational lines in Bengaluru, HAL has established a third line at Nashik, designed to produce up to eight aircraft annually.The PSU has also developed a parallel private-sector supply chain — VEM Technologies (centre fuselage), Alpha (rear fuselage), and L&T (wings) — to support an additional six aircraft each year. Once stabilised, this ecosystem is projected to enable annual production of 30 fighters from 2026-27.HAL is currently grappling with delays in the delivery of 99 GE F404 engines contracted in Aug 2021 for Rs 5,375 crore. Only four engines have been received so far. GE has assured the supply of eight more engines by March 2026 and around 20 engines per year thereafter. Despite the lag, HAL maintains that it has managed to keep production moving by rotating available engines for test flights.The initial order for 83 Tejas Mk1A aircraft, cleared in 2021, was to be delivered between 2024 and 2028. In Aug 2025, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved an additional 97 Mk1A fighters for Rs 66,500 crore, taking the total order to 180 aircraft.Air Chief Marshal AP Singh has repeatedly flagged the urgency of new inductions, saying the IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs at least 40 fighters a year to sustain combat readiness. HAL officials have said they are confident of meeting this requirement once the production ecosystem stabilises and integration issues are resolved.Friday's event also saw a formation flying of the Tejas-Mk1A, HTT-40 and Su30-Mki.",First Tejas-Mk1A fighter aircraft produced at defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's (HAL) Nashik complex completed its maiden flight on Friday.

Relief to SHUATS VC, SC junks action in conversion case

New Delhi: Raising questions on the state’s “involvement and interference” in conversion procedures under the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act and terming it conspicuous, Supreme Court Friday quashed criminal proceedings under the law against the vice-chancellor and other officials of Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture Technology and Science after finding infirmities in the probe.Without going into the validity of the UP law, which is pending in the apex court, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra touched upon the interplay of privacy, the right to freedom of free profession and practice of religion, and the role of govt authorities. It said an individual’s autonomy is supreme in the choice of faith and belief that are intrinsic in matters such as marriage and in which the court has prohibited the state as well as the law from controlling the choice of choosing a partner or even limiting or regulating the ability to decide on such matters. “The constitutional validity of provisions of the Act does not fall for our consideration in the instant case. Nonetheless, we can’t help but observe that the provisions of the Act pertaining to the pre-and post-conversion declaration seem to introduce a very onerous procedure to be followed by an individual seeking to adopt a faith other than the one he professes, the bench said.It said, “The involvement and interference of state authorities in the conversion procedure is also conspicuous, with the district magistrate having been legally obliged to direct a police enquiry in each case of intended religious conversion.Further, the statutory requirement of making public the personal details of each person who has converted to a different religion may require a deeper examination to ascertain if such a requirement fits well with the privacy regime pervading the Constitution. ”The bench quashed the multiple FIRs filed in the case on various grounds, including that the UP law mandates that only an aggrieved person or their relative by blood, marriage or adoption can lodge an FIR with respect to acts of unlawful conversion and the case cannot be filed by a third party.Raising questions on the state’s “involvement and interference” in conversion procedures under the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act and terming it conspicuous, Supreme Court Friday quashed criminal proceedings under the law against the vice-chancellor and other officials of Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture Technology and Science after finding infirmities in the probe.","Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra touched upon the interplay of privacy, the right to freedom of free profession and practice of religion.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested 7 seats, winning 4, achieving 0.9% of the vote share and a 32.9% strike rate.","BJP, Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan have 40% chance of retaining power.

Cong covered up Maoists’ atrocities: PM

New Delhi: “The success against Maoist terrorists, who committed unspeakable atrocities against Dalits, tribals and the youth, has been the cause of immense satisfaction in life,” PM Modi said on Friday, emphasising that this was the first time that he was speaking on the success of operations against left-wing extremists.“During the last 50-55 years, thousands of lives were lost due to Maoist terror. A large number of security personnel were killed. They would not allow construction of schools and hospitals, would not let doctors work. The situation was such that those who were supposed to provide security to others could not move without security. The writ of the govt did not run in the ‘red corridor’,” he said while speaking at NDTV World Summit.PM Modi termed Maoist terror an injustice towards youth. “Many joined Maoists as they were misled, while others were forced to follow them. I know many mothers who lost their sons,” he said.The speech was marked by a sharp attack on those “who call themselves the defenders of the Constitution but were indulgent towards Maoists who would not accept the Constitution in their spheres of influence”, as well as “Congress and its ecosystem, who along with urban naxals, used their control of institutions to ensure brutalities by Maoists did not become known”. The PM added, “The day is not far when the country is totally free of Maoist terror. This is also Modi’s guarantee.” He said ‘red zone’ has shrunk to 11 districts from 125 over a decade back due to his govt’s measures.","PM Modi said Maoist terror an injustice towards youth. ‘Many joined Maoists as they were misled, while others were forced to follow them.

Operation Sindoor was one such mission. HAL provided 24x7 support at operational sites, ensuring the IAF’s readiness by maintaining fighter jets and helicopters. The Nashik team’s installation of the BrahMos missile on the Su-30, which destroyed terrorist hideouts, proved that we can design, build, and defend ourselves with our own systems,” he said.He described the Tejas-Mk1A’s flight as a “shining symbol of India’s growing Aatmanirbharta in defence” and praised HAL for transforming itself into the backbone of the sector.Pointing to the defence sector’s transformation over the past decade, Singh said India, which once imported 65–70% of its military hardware, now manufactures about 65% of it domestically.Defence production, he said, had risen from Rs 46,429 crore in 2014–15 to Rs 1.5-lakh-crore in 2024–25, while exports had climbed from less than Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crore.The govt now aims for Rs 3-lakh-crore in production and Rs 50,000 crore in exports by 2029.He urged HAL to expand its innovation into next-generation aircraft, unmanned systems, and civil aviation. “Modern warfare is evolving rapidly with artificial intelligence, drones, and cyber technologies. India must stay ahead in this race,” he said.Secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar said the inauguration of the two (HTT-40 and LCA) production lines in Nashik marks “a new chapter in India’s technological confidence and industrial strength.”He added: “The Tejas-Mk1A is not just a fighter aircraft, but a statement of India’s design and manufacturing excellence—conceived, developed and produced indigenously through collaboration between HAL, ADA, DRDO, and the IAF.”HAL CMD DK Sunil said the Nashik division’s expansion had created about 1,000 jobs and developed over 40 industry partners. “Our capacity to produce advanced indigenous fighters in addition to the Su-30Mki gives fresh momentum to delivery timelines and reinforces our public-private partnerships,” he said.The event also featured a Tejas Mk1A sortie piloted by HAL chief test pilot (fixed wing) Group Captain (retd) KK Venugopal, followed by aerial displays by Su-30Mki and HTT-40 aircraft.",Defence minister Rajnath Singh said India’s defence ecosystem had demonstrated its growing confidence in indigenous platforms during Operation Sindoor.

MUMBAI: The ghats at Ayodhya are getting ready to transform into a sea of light for Deepotsav 2025. A staggering 26.11 lakh diyas (earthen lamps) will light up on October 19, an effort expected to secure a new Guinness World Record and serve as a monumental testament to faith and community spirit.This year's festival relies heavily on the unmatched involvement of the people. Approximately 33,000 volunteers, comprised of students, teachers, and local organizations and coordinated by Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, meticulously arrange the lamps across 56 ghats.By the afternoon of October 17, workers completed almost half the massive undertaking—about 7 to 8 lakh diyas were already positioned on key areas like Ghats 8, 9, 10, and 11.""The enthusiasm among young volunteers inspires all. Their dedication shows how deeply the next generation connects with ‘Ram Kaaj’,"" said Nodal Officer Prof. Sant Sharan Mishra, acknowledging the spirit that fills the banks of the Saryu River.Deepotsav 2025 acts as both a grand spectacle and a significant source of support for local artisans. Around 16 lakh diyas were handcrafted by about 40 potter families from Ayodhya and nearby villages such as Jaisinghpur, Pura Bazar, and Gosaiganj. Industrial units, social organizations, and rural women from across Uttar Pradesh supplied the remaining 10 lakh lamps.The event requires considerable logistics: organizers will use 55 lakh cotton wicks and 73,000 litres of oil to sustain the illumination.Tourism and Culture Minister Jaiveer Singh guaranteed every visitor to Ayodhya will experience a divine and lifelong memory, stating that planners designed Deepotsav 2025 on a ""larger, more meaningful scale so that people not only see the light but feel the devotion behind it.""The three-day celebration runs until October 20. Highlights include a 3D holographic musical laser show and a drone show featuring 1,100 'Make in India' drones, both open to the public from October 18 to 20. The most revered moment occurs on October 19 with a majestic Maha Aarti performed by 2,100 devotees.Minister Singh also noted a significant surge in tourism, with a rise to 23.82 crore visitors in the first six months of 2025 alone, reaffirming Ayodhya’s place as a global spiritual destination.As the final lamps take their place, devotees from states like Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and across Uttar Pradesh arrive in the city, transforming Ayodhya into a vibrant center of faith ready for an unparalleled display of devotion.","A staggering 26.11 lakh diyas (earthen lamps) will light up on October 19.

It must first be understood that the survey is not exclusively for backward communities. Are the people at Infosys akin to gods? The government has already clarified that this is not a survey of backward communities. This is a survey that includes all people.""Siddaramaiah further emphasised that the survey covers all sections of society, not just backward communities and questioned whether the Murthys would also refuse to cooperate if the central government conducted a caste census.""It is wrong to assume that the survey is only for backward communities. In the coming days, the central government will also conduct a caste census; will they refuse to cooperate then as well? Their non-cooperation may stem from misinformation.

Siddaramaiah told reporters, responding to the Murthys’ refusal to participate.This comes after Sudha Murty in a self-attested letter to the Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission, stated that the family would not participate in the survey as they do not belong to a backward community.“We and our family will not participate in the census, and we are confirming it through this letter,” she wrote.The Karnataka socio-economic and educational survey, launched on September 22, seeks to assess the living standards and social conditions of all residents.While participation is voluntary following a High Court directive, the government has urged all citizens to take part to ensure accurate data collection and effective implementation of welfare schemes such as Shakti and Gruha Lakshmi.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah slammed Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy and Rajya Sabha MP Sudha Murty for refusing to participate in the state’s socio- economic and educational survey.

Rahul Gandhi Slams PM Modi After Trump Claims India Assured Him to Cut Russian Oil Imports

Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India. Don’t damage the country’s relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties',"" Congress posted on X.Trump claimed on Wednesday that PM Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after he imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican leader added.Meanwhile, Russia remains India's single-largest source of oil, accounting for 34% of inbound shipments in September, although volumes have slipped 10% in the first eight months of 2025, according to commodities and shipping markets tracker Kpler.The agency’s latest report pegs India’s crude imports in September at more than 4.5 million bpd (barrels per day).This is an increase of 70,000 barrels over August but flat when compared to the year-ago period, says the report, adding Russian oil accounted for a tad under 1.6 million bpd, or 34% of crude imports. India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

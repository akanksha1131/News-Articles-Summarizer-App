The recent carpooling picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin found a place at US Congress discussion on India-US ties.""This poster is worth a thousand words,"" said US representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove, pointing towards the image, as she went on to slam the Donald Trump administration's foreign policy towards India.""Trump's policies towards India can only be described as cutting our nose to spite our face...

And this poster is worth a thousand words,"" she said.""You do not get a Nobel Peace Prize by driving US strategic partners into the arms of our adversaries,"" Dove said in a pointed attack at Trump's demands for the peace prize for what he has repeatedly claimed for having stopped eight wars, including India and Pakistan.""We must move with incredible urgency to mitigate the damage that this administration has done to the US-India partnership and return to the cooperation that is essential to US prosperity, security, and global leadership,"" she added.These comments were delivered during the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia’s hearing on 'The US-India Strategic Partnership: Securing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific'.Trump has already slapped 50% tariffs on most Indian exports in August 2025 amid wider trade tensions and worries over India’s imports of Russian oil.A US trade delegation was in India on December 10–11 for discussions that have so far made little headway.

"Can Sharjeel, Umar speeches be deemed terror acts: Supreme Court to cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-sharjeel-umar-speeches-be-deemed-terror-acts-supreme-court-to-cops/articleshow/125900689.cms,"The Supreme Court questioned Delhi Police on invoking stringent UAPA provisions against riot accused for speeches, seeking justification for linking terror acts to their words. Justices sought clarity on how Section 15, pertaining to terrorist acts, applies when arms weren't directly used by the accused, who have been jailed for over five years.

Sharjeel seems to be a punching bag: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court questioned Delhi Police Wednesday over how Section 15 of UAPA, which pertains to terrorist acts, can be invoked against Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and other accused in a Delhi riots case for giving speeches and how terror acts can be linked with such speeches.A bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria, which reserved its order on bail pleas of the six accused, sought a response from additional solicitor general S V Raju in light of senior advocate Siddharth Dave's contention that at most Section 13 (unlawful activities) and Section 18 (conspiracy) could be invoked for the speeches.The ASG submitted that the riots took place because of a conspiracy hatched by the accused and whatever they had said in their speeches became reality. Raju said Imam's speech on blocking Chicken's Neck was an attack on the integrity of the country and Khalid's speech on chakka jam was an attack on economic security and justified invoking Section 15.The court thereafter pointed out that Delhi Police had not attributed the wielding of arms or explosives to the six accused, which is a requirement under the provision. Raju, however, said that petrol bombs were used in Delhi riots.""It is a case of conspiracy. It is not my case that they used petrol bombs. My case is that they are part of the conspiracy to create the situation for the use of petrol bombs. For use of petrol bombs, there is a separate case against other people,"" he said.The bench then wrapped up the hearing, which had stretched over 11 days, and reserved its order. As the Delhi Police's arguments were particularly focused on Imam's speeches, which were also played in the courtroom to oppose the bail plea, and the other five accused - Umar Khalid, Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed and Mohd Saleem Khan - had distanced themselves from him, the bench observed that Imam seemed to be a punching bag for both sides.The accused, who have been in custody for more than five years, approached the apex court after their bail plea had been rejected by Delhi High Court. Opposing their bail plea, Delhi Police accused them of indulging in regime change and told the court that they were behind ""well-crafted, orchestrated, preplanned, choreographed riots"" to divide the country on communal lines to achieve ""the final regime change goal"".The accused, however, told the court that holding protests and opposing the govt was not an offence, and they are being prosecuted to send a message to others that anyone who raises their voice would be similarly punished. Invoking Gandhi, they said that non-violent protest and civil disobedience was a part and parcel of democracy and cannot be criminalised, as happened in the colonial era. As Delhi Police played their allegedly inflammatory speeches, the accused brought to the court's notice clippings of their speeches in which they had talked about the constitutional spirit and responding to hate with love, to violence with non-violence and enmity with brotherhood.","Justices sought clarity on how Section 15, pertaining to terrorist acts, applies when arms weren't directly used by the accused.

Now the airline has to submit its entire operational details to govt and then its schedule will accordingly be approved to avoid a rerun of the disruption being seen this month.Elbers and his team on Thursday will have to tell the regulator on Thursday the status of flight restoration, how affected passengers are being accommodated and the monitoring mechanism to ensure timely completion of restoration.

'Detect, Delete, Deport': Amit Shah Blasts Rahul Gandhi Over Infiltrators, Oppn Stages Walkout

CIC has been without a chief since September 13

The three-member selection committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that met on Wednesday to appoint the new Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), eight information commissioners (ICs) and a vigilance commissioner is learnt to have finalised the names. However, Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have registered his strong dissent to the choices and submitted the same in writing, sources said.Gandhi is said to have strongly objected to the absence of names from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and OBC communities. The issue raised by the Congress neta is likely to be a key talking point in the upcoming mega rally against ""vote chori"" being organised by Congress on Dec 14.The details of the appointments were not known till late in the evening.The meeting that lasted for nearly one and a half hours was held at the Prime Minister's Office. It was also attended by home minister Amit Shah. Sources said the LoP sought more details of the appointees and also questioned the criteria adopted for the selection of CIC and ICs.According to sources, Gandhi was of the view that the govt's proposal on the names was completely ""biased"".He apparently said that the absence of weaker communities from constitutional positions was unacceptable, given the need to strengthen their participation across the board, including higher positions. The LoP is learnt to have forcefully put forth his differences on the govt proposal.There were three parts to the meeting: One on appointment of CIC, another on choice of eight ICs & third on vigilance commissioner.While Gandhi registered his ""dissent"" in writing separately on the govt's proposal for CIC and vigilance commissioner, he gave his ""observations"" on the eight names for the post of ICs, sources said. The Central Information Commission has been without a chief since incumbent Heeralal Samariya demitted office on Sept 13 on attaining the age of 65 years.Besides the chief, the commission can have up to 10 commissioners. Currently, it is making do with just two - Anandi Ramalingam and Vinod Tiwari. According to commission's website, the pending caseload stands at over 30,800.The eight posts of information commissioners have been vacant since Nov 2023. With Samariya demitting office, the chief's post fell vacant for the seventh time since 2014.There was a total of 53 names in the panels prepared by the govt and presented before the collegium for the 10 positions. On the objection raised, the govt is said to have agreed to include a few from the marginalised communities in the panels. But there was still no clarity about their inclusion in the appointments.Under Section 12 (3) of the RTI Act, the prime minister is the chairperson of the search committee, which also comprises the LoP and a Union minister nominated by the PM.According to the procedure for the appointment of CIC, the particulars of interested candidates are invited through advertisements in newspapers and through the DoPT website.","The Central Information Commission has been without a chief since September 13.

NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to Haryana govt cutting 40 fully grown trees in a green belt to build a road to make the office of BJP in Karnal accessible, Supreme Court on Wednesday directed it to restore the green belt within three months after the govt and Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) failed to convince it of the legality of the action.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan noted in its order that the explanation given by the state and HSVP was merely an ""eyewash to mislead the court"".The state authority claimed that the trees were felled to widen the road. Additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee, appearing for HSVP, told the bench that Resident Welfare Association of Section 9 was also consulted and its consent taken prior to the felling of trees.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Goa Police have detained Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, after a devastating fire at the Arpora establishment killed 25 people. Gupta, who was held in Delhi on Tuesday, insisted he had no role in the day-to-day running of the club. “I am just a partner. I don’t know anything,” he said soon after being picked up, following a Lookout Circular issued against him.The arrest comes as investigators widen their search for the club’s primary owners, brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, who fled to Phuket hours after the blaze. Interpol has issued a Blue Corner Notice to help trace them, and officers say this was processed unusually quickly. Goa Police are coordinating with the CBI and Interpol, and Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said a team will be sent to Thailand to bring the accused back.Also read: Goa authorities trashed own report on violations by club The Bureau of Immigration earlier informed police that the Luthras boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 from Delhi to Phuket on Sunday morning. A notice seeking an explanation for why their passports should not be impounded has been issued by the regional passport office. A Blue Corner Notice has also been issued against the property owner, British national Surinder Kumar Khosla.Gupta is expected to be flown to Goa on Wednesday and placed under arrest once formalities are complete.Five others connected with the nightclub — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, general manager Vivek Singh, bar manager Rajiv Singhania, gate manager Riyanshu Thakur and employee Bharat Kohli — have already been arrested.Goa Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte called the fire “a very tragic episode”, saying accountability must be fixed and that an inquiry should deliver a factual report. On Tuesday, the district administration also demolished part of the Romeo Lane restaurant in Vagator, owned by the Luthras, citing illegal construction.","Goa Police detain Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub.

The complainant gets summoned. She confesses to have filed a false case to avoid her boyfriend's questions about marks on her neck

BENGALURU: A 22-year-old nursing student's claim of being gang-raped by a cab driver and his accomplices near Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal has been revealed as false. Police found CCTV footage and WhatsApp chats indicating a consensual encounter. The woman, who filed the complaint on Dec 6, allegedly fabricated the story to avoid her boyfriend's questions about the scratch marks on her neck.The investigation is ongoing, and the driver, who has pleaded his innocence, remains in police custody.On the night of Dec 6, the nursing student from a private college and originally from Kerala, reported to Madiwala police station that she had been gang-raped by a cab driver and several of his friends inside the vehicle near Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal on the night of Dec 2.In response, police quickly registered a gang-rape case and transferred it to Banaswadi police station due to jurisdictional issues. Before this transfer, senior police officers were informed of the incident, and based on the student's statement, the driver was arrested at his residence in east Bengaluru.The cab driver, a 33-year-old father of two with a homemaker wife, was in shock upon hearing the allegations against him.Throughout the process, he maintained his innocence.Meanwhile, police reviewed CCTV footage from the incident location and were surprised to see the nursing student and the cab driver together at the railway station between 11.30pm on Dec 2 and 5.30am on Dec 3. Additionally, they were unable to find the alleged ""gang members"" mentioned by the student.The footage clearly showed the two moving together after exiting the cab, re-entering the vehicle during the night, and then walking around the station. Eventually, the woman boarded the Ernakulam train after 5.30am.Authorities also checked the cab driver's WhatsApp messages and discovered that the nursing student had sent him numerous messages from Dec 3. Some of these messages suggested a consensual interaction and indicated a good relationship between them even after the encounter. Police then summoned the woman for questioning.When pressed, she admitted to have made the false claim to avoid her boyfriend's questions about the scratch marks on her neck, which had occurred during her time in the vehicle with the cab driver. According to the cab driver, he was familiar with the student because they both were from Kerala, and he had dropped her off at the railway station that night. After getting into the cab, the nursing student had even called her boyfriend in Ernakulam to inform him that she would be catching the early-morning train.","A 22-year-old nursing student's claim of being gang-raped by a cab driver and his accomplices has been revealed as false.

NEW DELHI: India started their T20 series against South Africa on a dominating note, thrashing the visitors by 101 runs in the first T20I at Cuttack. Batting first, India posted a competitive 175 for six in 20 overs, with Hardik Pandya ’s blistering 59* off just 28 balls, studded with six fours and four sixes, leading the charge.

Dewald Brevis offered some resistance with 22 runs, but the Indian bowling unit, led by Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah , Varun Chakravarthy, and Axar Patel, dismantled the opposition, each picking up two wickets. Hardik and Shivam Dube claimed one each. The all-round performance earned Hardik the Player of the Match award, as India took a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.However, more attention than the match itself has been drawn to former India cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra , who took playful pot shots at Pakistan opener Sahibzada Farhan .During South Africa’s innings, when the team were 28/2 in the fourth over, Bumrah bowled a good-length delivery on the last ball after Aiden Markram had smashed a six.Commentating at the time, Chopra said, “Bumrah ko chhakka maarna itna aasaan nahi hota. Kabhi lag jaaye to kuch log documentary bana lete hain [It’s not so easy to hit Bumrah for a six. If someone manages to do it once, some people even make a documentary on it].”Watch the video here The remark, delivered without naming anyone, clearly referenced Sahibzada Farhan, who had hit Bumrah for sixes during the Asia Cup T20 2025.Farhan had even shared a clip of a documentary made on his innings after Pakistan lost to India in the final, making him a target for Chopra’s humorous dig.The commentary clip has gone viral, with fans praising Chopra’s wit.The second T20I between India and South Africa will be played on December 11 in Mullanpur.","India beat South Africa by 101 runs in the first T20I at Cuttack.

Amit Shah gives point-by-point rebuttal on 'vote chori' charge

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in the Lok Sabha turned heated on Wednesday as leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged home minister Amit Shah to an open debate, prompting a firm response from the minister: ""I will decide.""As Shah countered the opposition’s allegations of 'vote chori' and referred to Rahul Gandhi’s charge of ""multiple voters at one Haryana house,"" the Congress leader stood up, interrupting the speech.""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.""You tell us ... actually, let us have a debate on my press conference, very good idea, let us go, let us have a debate,"" he added.""Amit Shah ji, I challenge you, I challenge you to have a debate,"" Rahul declared in the House.Amid uproar, Shah responded, ""Speaker sir, I want to clarify first, I have been elected as an MLA or MP for the last 30 years. I have a long experience of the procedures.""Looking directly at Rahul Gandhi, he said in a stern manner, ""Parliament will not proceed according to your wishes.I will decide the sequence of my speech. The Parliament will not work like this.""""Speaker sir, he should have some patience to listen to my answer. I will reply to each and everything. But he will not decide the sequence of my speech, I will decide it,"" Shah reiterated.""This is a completely defensive response, a scared response,"" Rahul retorted.Resuming his address with a noticeably calm tone, Shah told Speaker Om Birla, ""I can see worry lines on your face. Do not worry, I will not be provoked by them. I will continue with my reply.""Shah then went on to address the 'vote chori' accusations, stating that such issues occurred during the tenures of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. He also referenced a case in the Delhi high court, alleging that Sonia Gandhi became a voter before becoming Indian.Amit Shah offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.During the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in the Parliament, Shah took a jibe at the Congress leader's ""nuclear bomb"" press conference said that his press conferences are not ""Constitutional provisions.""""Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi dropped a “nuclear bomb” in a press conference on 5 November 2025. In that ‘nuclear bomb’, he claimed that 501 votes had been cast from a single house in Haryana. The Election Commission has clarified that House Number 265 is no small dwelling, but rather a joint residence for multiple families built on a one-acre ancestral plot,"" the home minister said.""However, separate house numbers have not been assigned to each family, so their house number is simply listed as 265. And in one of those families, three generations are living together. This numbering has been in place since the Congress government was elected in Haryana. It is neither a fake house nor fake votes,"" he added.Shah also said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.""Congress has claimed that some individuals are registered in two different locations on the electoral roll. It is unfair to blame the people who appear twice, as this is often a result of systemic issues. Since 2010, the Returning Officer's authority to remove duplicate entries has been revoked, which has led to such discrepancies. In fact, there are several leaders whose names are registered in more than one place. These are common mistakes caused by the updated rules,"" Shah said.",Amit Shah offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI:Goa police said the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on December 7, even as firefighters and local authorities were struggling to contain the flames and rescue staff at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, North Goa.By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073. Goa DGP Alok Kumar described their rapid exit as “a clear attempt to evade investigation.”In the days since, the brothers have approached a Delhi court seeking four weeks of transit anticipatory bail, claiming they left for Thailand for work purposes, not to slip away from the law. Filing their plea in Rohini court on Wednesday, they asserted through their counsel, “We want to come back,” and said they do not handle the nightclub’s daily operations.A beach shack owned by the brothers — who also run the Arpora club — is now set to be demolished, according to reports citing Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant.Despite their departure, Saurabh posted a message online expressing “profound grief” and “unwavering solidarity” with families of the victims. Soon after, the Bureau of Immigration issued Look Out Circulars for both men.A Goa police team reached Delhi on Sunday with an arrest warrant and searched their homes and offices but found no trace of them.Immigration officials in Mumbai later confirmed they had already left India. The court, meanwhile, declined to grant them interim relief and listed their anticipatory bail plea for Thursday.The investigation in Goa is underway. Four staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, and general manager Vivek Singh, have been arrested and remanded to six days' custody. Three suspended Goa government officials have also been summoned.",The Luthra brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on December 7.

NEW DLEHI: Home minister Amit Shah ’s remarks during the Lok Sabha debate on election reforms sparked strong protests from Congress MPs on Wednesday, after he listed three instances across different eras in which he alleged the party engaged in “vote chori”, naming former prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, and referring to a case involving Sonia Gandhi over voter registration.Shah countered the Opposition’s accusation of “vote theft” by citing what he described as “three phases” of electoral malpractice linked to the Congress, including a pending case in a Delhi court that, according to him, disputes whether Sonia Gandhi was registered as a voter before acquiring Indian citizenship.“ ... when you’re not eligible, still you become a voter. A while back, a case was brought up in a Delhi court where the dispute is that Sonia Gandhi became a voter even before she became a citizen of the country,” the home minister said.“There are three instances of vote-chori, first when Jawaharlal Nehru became PM even after losing the vote to Sardar Patel to choose the country's first PM ... second when Indira Gandhi’s election from Rebareli was set aside in 1975 by Allahabad HC and to cover it up she brought in bill in Parliament to provide immunity to PM’s – that no case can be brought against the PMs ... third, when you’re not eligible still you become a voter.A while back, a case was brought up in a Delhi court where the dispute is that Sonia Gandhi became a voter even before she became a citizen of the country,” he said.The opposition benches erupted, prompting Shah to respond, “I have just said what is a fact that there’s a case in court, Sonia ji needs to respond in court why they’re replying here?”Congress MP KC Venugopal raised a point of order, insisting the allegation was baseless.“The case from the 80s that was filed against Ms Sonia Gandhi, the Rouse Avenue court dismissed that case; there is no substance in that case. Ms Gandhi didn’t even vote in that election and I’m challenging HM, Ms Sonia Gandhi didn’t even vote in that election. Can you prove it otherwise? HM is making misleading statements,” he said.Shah clarified that he had drawn no conclusions and merely spoke a fact.“I haven't said anything like that, I haven't made any conclusion. The conclusion would come out once she responds to the court order, and then I’ll discuss it again. I only said, a case has been registered in which a notice has been issued to Ms Gandhi. What is there to be so angry about?”The heated exchange marked yet another flashpoint in the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in Parliament.",Amit Shah's remarks sparked strong protests from Congress MPs on Wednesday.

'Sabke andar ek tarah ka dar samaya hua hai’

We work alone — one person has to collect data, upload it, categorise it and attach photographs. In terms of technology, all we have is a mobile phone. How much can we do? Chotelal Paswan, a BLO posted in West Bengal

‘Days and nights have become the same for me’

I am extremely busy. I mean, what should I even tell you — there is a lot of pressure. Rita Mandal

Who said what

NEW DELHI: The Booth Level Officers (BLOs), who have been a silent and almost invisible part of India’s electoral machinery for decades, have suddenly found themselves at the centre of attention. The Election Commission ’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls has placed them at the centre of one of the largest verification drives in recent years, making their day-to-day labour impossible to ignore.What was once routine verification has now become a high-intensity, deadline-bound exercise. With the first phase scheduled to end on December 11, BLOs across West Bengal say they are clocking 12–16 hour days, making multiple visits to the same households, filling forms for those unable to do so, and uploading details late into the night on their phones. For many, the pressure has blurred the line between work and exhaustion, day and night.It is in this backdrop that The Times of India spoke to several BLOs in West Bengal to understand what the job looks like on the ground — the rush, the numbers, the fatigue, and the uneven experiences.“Pressure bahut zyada hai. Sabke andar ek tarah ka dar samaya hua hai (The pressure is extremely high. Everyone seems to be filled with fear),” said Chotelal Paswan, a Booth Level Officer, in conversation with TOI.Posted as a teacher in a middle school in West Bengal’s Bardhaman district, Chotelal is the sole breadwinner for a family of five. After being notified for BLO duty, he now leaves home every day at 8am and spends the entire day distributing and collecting forms. Once the field work ends, he uploads voters’ details, a process that often keeps him occupied till midnight.“The Election Commission informed us just four days before that we would be assigned this duty. Our training began two days before the work started. We receive instructions from the BDO office to begin data collection early in the morning. We carry forms and go door to door. If someone has already filled theirs, we collect it. After that, we have to submit a report to our supervisor mentioning how many forms were collected, how many were pending and how many death-related cases were found,” he said.“In a day, we are able to collect details of about 80–100 voters, that too if everyone is at home,” he added.Chotelal says delays on the ground often slow down the process. He frequently has to revisit houses, sometimes multiple times, and many voters aren’t aware of the urgency of the exercise.“We have to visit each house at least 5–6 times. Even then, many people who have filled their forms refuse to hand them over. They say, ‘Come after ten days,’ or ‘We are busy right now,’” he said.“This causes us a lot of trouble. Many people don’t understand the importance of this exercise. They say, ‘What difference will it make? We’ll give it later.’ But our official responsibility is to submit everything on time. For those who are not literate, we even have to fill out the forms ourselves,” he added.When asked whether there is pressure from political parties or senior officials, he paused before responding: “What can I say… this is an internal matter. But we are under so much pressure that we cannot speak freely. There is pressure from the BDO, pressure from the panchayat pradhan, pressure from the supervisor. On top of that, local party leaders and BLAs exert separate pressure. If we don’t follow their instructions, we fear consequences. ”He estimates that 30–40% of his work is still pending with the deadline looming. He is also required to attend school duties occasionally as examinations approach — despite the BLO Handbook 2011 stating that officers should be relieved of regular office responsibilities during revision periods.“So far, about 70% of the work is completed. We must submit the report by December 11. But if urgent work comes up in the school, I have to go there too,” he said.He also highlights the limitations of technology on the ground.“We work alone — one person has to collect data, upload it, categorise it and attach photographs. In terms of technology, all we have is a mobile phone. How much can we do?” he asked.“Most nights, it is 11pm or even midnight by the time we end our day's work and we are back in the field the next morning. Because of this, the error margin rises, almost up to 30%,” he added.On reports of BLOs allegedly dying by suicide due to work stress, he says the strain is visible around him.“In Bardhaman district, two women BLOs have committed suicide — we heard this from the news. The pressure is extremely high. Even yesterday, 2–4 women BLOs sitting with us were in very bad shape. Everyone seems to be filled with fear,” Chotelal said.“Everyone is scared. The workload is so heavy that sometimes responding properly becomes difficult. Yet the supervisor and BDO keep demanding answers. They tell us, ‘You must finish the work somehow,’” he added.Rita Mandal, a BLO posted in Kolkata’s Dumdum, says her routine has been consumed by SIR work since she was assigned duty. She admits that she has been working late nights under significant stress.“I am extremely busy. I mean, what should I even tell you — there is a lot of pressure,” she told The Times of India.“I have also been extremely busy at night. Because of this work, days and nights have become the same for me,” she said.In contrast, a BLO from Palpara Chandakh described a smoother experience, saying the workload was manageable in her area and that she received adequate support.“Look, this is not my personal work — this is government work. Everyone has a different experience, and my experience has been more or less good,” she said, requesting anonymity.She added that her supervisor and BDO had arranged an assistant BLO given the high voter density in her assigned area.“Our job was simply to distribute the forms, then collect them, and now I have submitted all the forms. There were a lot of voters, so the BDO office provided me with an assistant BLO. My supervisor and other seniors helped me a lot. We got so immersed in the work that we lost track of date and time. Training happened in phases, and whenever we faced difficulty, we called the BDO office and received immediate updates,” she said.She also denied reports of political pressure from local BLAs or party workers, adding that the BLAs in her area were helpful.“BLAs in my assigned area were very helpful. There were too many voters, and I could not know everyone personally, so they assisted in collecting forms and verifying addresses. The BLAs supported me throughout,” she said.Both the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have acknowledged that BLOs are working under heavy strain. The BJP has alleged that BLOs are functioning under the threat and pressure of “TMC goons”, while the ruling TMC party in Bengal has blamed the Election Commission, calling the SIR timeline “inhuman” and “unplanned”.""Why are BLOs dying only in Mamata's Bengal? Because in Bengal, TMC goons threaten teachers, Anganwadi and ASHA workers: 'Finish the voter list fast or lose your job, face transfers, face violence'. The pressure is not from the ECI – it is from TMC’s terror mafia,"" BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has argued that an exercise earlier spread across three years is now being compressed into two months “to please political masters”, thereby placing “inhuman pressure” on ground-level staff.“A process that earlier took three years is now being forced into two months on the eve of elections to please political masters, putting inhuman pressure on BLOs,” Mamata said.Whether the SIR will deliver a smoother voter list may take time to show. But for now, the immediate reality for BLOs is clear: the work has been heavy, and the days have been long.",Booth Level Officers (BLOs) have been a silent and almost invisible part of India’s electoral machinery for decades. The Election Commission ’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls has placed them at the centre of one of the largest verification drives in recent years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125890297,imgsize-1350721,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.During the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in the Parliament, Shah took a jibe at the Congress leader's ""nuclear bomb"" press conference said that his press conferences are not ""Constitutional provisions. """"Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi dropped a “nuclear bomb” in a press conference on 5 November 2025. In that ‘nuclear bomb’, he claimed that 501 votes had been cast from a single house in Haryana. The Election Commission has clarified that House Number 265 is no small dwelling, but rather a joint residence for multiple families built on a one-acre ancestral plot,"" the home minister said.""However, separate house numbers have not been assigned to each family, so their house number is simply listed as 265. And in one of those families, three generations are living together. This numbering has been in place since the Congress government was elected in Haryana. It is neither a fake house nor fake votes,"" he added.Shah also said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.""Congress has claimed that some individuals are registered in two different locations on the electoral roll. It is unfair to blame the people who appear twice, as this is often a result of systemic issues.Since 2010, the Returning Officer's authority to remove duplicate entries has been revoked, which has led to such discrepancies. In fact, there are several leaders whose names are registered in more than one place. These are common mistakes caused by the updated rules,"" Shah said.""The SIR is meant to prevent such occurrences, yet we are being accused of 'Vote Chori',"" he added.Amit Shah also replied to the three questions Rahul Gandhi had asked a day earlier.""I want to ask three questions which will make it very clear that the BJP is directing and using the Election Commission to damage India's democracy,"" Rahul had said.""Why the Chief Justice of India was removed from the selection panel for Election Commissioners?; Why, in December 2023, the government granted unprecedented immunity to Election Commissioners?; Why CCTV footage of polling stations is destroyed after 45 days?"" he had asked.Replying to Rahul Gandhi during his address, Amit Shah said, ""For 73 years, there was no law governing the appointment of the Election Commission in this country; the process was overseen directly by the Prime Minister. From 1950 to 1989, the Election Commission operated as a single-member body. Throughout this period, the Prime Minister was responsible for all appointments to the Commission, and these appointments were never contested. ""“From 1950-1989, the Election Commission was a one-person panel. The PM used to send a file to the President, and the latter would notify the same – it was fine then. From 1989-91, a multi-member panel was introduced to govern the poll panel,"" he said, adding, “In 2023, we made a law that there would be a Prime Minister, a minister chosen by him and the Leader of Opposition who will elect the Election Commissioner. We brought transparency,"" he added.On CCTV footage being destroyed after 45 days, Shah said that keeping footage record of a polling booth is for internal management, not an admissible document. “This is just a simple thing…They don’t understand…Sense can’t be injected,"" said Shah, adding, “The CCTV footage of a polling station is deleted after 45 days as per law. Why do they question it? Why don’t they ask for it before 45 days of voting?""“Discussion on EVMs was stopped in 2004 and 2009 because they (Congress) won. In 2014, when they lost, they started complaining again. Chunav main chori bandh hui hai isiliye pet mein dard ho raha hai,"" he said.This comes days after Rahul Gandhi held two press conferences and claimed that Election Commission and Bharatiya Janata Party are hatching the conspiracy of stealing the mandate.Rahul addressed said that his team has ""100 per cent"" proof that around 25 lakh voters in Haryana are either duplicate, non-existent or manipulated.""We have the word 'H' Files and this is about how an entire state has been stolen. We suspected that this is not happening in individual constituencies, but at the state level and at the national level,"" Rahul said.""We got a lot of complaints in Haryana, from our candidates, that something was wrong and not working. Their predictions all went upside down. We had experienced this in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra but we decided to zoom into Haryana and go into details about what had happened there,"" he added.The Congress leader shared a breakup for the unaccounted votes and claimed that ""vote chori"" happened in Haryana assembly elections to the tune of 25 lakhs under 5 categories -- Duplicate voters, invalid addresses, bulk voters, and others.He had further claimed that a lady, who turned out to be a Brazilian model, voted 22 times at 10 different booths with different names in the Haryana assembly elections.","Amit Shah said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.

NEW DELHI: A Maharastra MLA on Wednesday chose a unique way to present his stance in the state legislative assembly. Sharad Sonawane, the MLA from Junnar, arrived at the Maharashtra legislature dressed in a leopard-print outfit to protest the rising number of leopard-related incidents across the state.His demonstration came hours after a leopard in Nagpur’s Pardi area injured seven people before being captured by the forest department. On being asked by reporter about his dress-up, Sonawane said, ""An emergency should be declared for leopard attacks in the state. I have been raising this issue since 2014, but the government has kept ignoring me.""Further offering suggestions to deal with the issue, he added, ""Rescue centres should be made, and the leopards should be trapped and kept in the centres...""At Vidhan Bhavan, the Shiv Sena legislator said leopard attacks had claimed 55 lives in Junnar taluka of Pune district in the past three months. He said residents were living in constant fear and urged the state to set up rescue facilities capable of accommodating up to 2,000 leopards in both Junnar taluka and Ahilyanagar district.Additionally, responding to Forest Minister Ganesh Naik’s statement a day earlier that goats would be released in forests to divert leopards, Sonawane said the measure would not work, arguing that leopards increasingly occupy sugarcane fields and areas near human habitation.He demanded that the government declare a “state emergency” and initiate the capture of at least 2,000 leopards for placement in rescue centres.","Sharad Sonawane, the MLA from Junnar, arrived at the Maharashtra legislature dressed in a leopard-print outfit.

Cops to counter bail petition of Sharjeel today





NEW DELHI: Analysing the alleged inflammatory speeches of Sharjeel Imam, being prosecuted under UAPA in connection with the Northeast Delhi riots, Supreme Court said Tuesday his speech on blocking “Chicken’s Neck”, or Siliguri Corridor, was objectionable, but his lawyer pointed out other parts of the speech in which he appealed to protesters to adhere to the constitutional spirit and non-violence, and admitted that it could have been better-worded.Senior advocate Siddharth Dave, appearing for Sharjeel, also told the court that there was no credible evidence against him because of which he was rightly not made an accused in any one of the 750 cases related to the 2020 riots registered in the capital.Dave made the court hear other clippings of Sharjeel’s speeches in which he had appealed to people not to resort to violence while protesting.Dave contended that Sharjeel was being prosecuted in 10 different cases in different states arising out of his speeches and he had been granted bail in all the cases and cannot be prosecuted again under the anti-terror law. He told SC that he was already in custody when the riots broke out and there was no evidence against him as he was not associated with the rioters.“There is a legislation in Parliament. He was resisting the legislation. He is entitled to protest. Some of his speeches are unpalatable. It could have remained within the four corners of law. But today he is standing, asking for bail after six years in custody. He was not physically present or an accused in any of the cases when the riots actually took place,” he said.Dave also questioned why the govt did not bring NIA to probe the cases in view of Delhi Police’s allegation that it was an attempt for regime change. He concluded by quoting from a poem Faiz Ahmed Faiz penned during his incarceration in Pakistan: “Dil naummeed tou nahin nakaam hi to hai. Lambi hai gham ki shaam, magar shaam hi toh hai… (My heart is not unhopeful even if I have failed.

As IndiGo Spirals Into Crisis, PM Modi Stresses Rules Must Ease Citizens’ Lives, Not Burden Them

NEW DELHI: The ministry of civil aviation has constituted an oversight team to monitor IndiGo’s operations amid large-scale disruptions reported across multiple airports.In an order dated December 10, 2025, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced that the move aims to address passenger inconvenience caused by flight delays and cancellations.The team comprises senior officials, including deputy and senior flight operations inspectors.Two members from the group will be stationed at IndiGo’s corporate office in Emaar Capital Tower 2, Gurgaon, on a daily basis.They will review key parameters such as total fleet, network details, number of pilots, crew availability, standby crew strength, split duties, training status, and all unplanned leave taken by crew. The officials will also monitor total daily flights, available crew and sectors affected due to manpower shortage.In addition to the oversight team, the DGCA has deployed Aishveer Singh, Deputy Director (AED), and Mani Bhushan, Senior Statistical Officer, to the same office. Their mandate includes tracking domestic and international cancellation status, refund progress through airlines and online travel agents, on-time performance, compensation provided to passengers under Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), and baggage return timelines.Both teams are required to submit a daily report by 6 pm to the Joint Director General.The instructions have been issued with the approval of the Director General (Civil Aviation), the order stated.The flyers faced severe inconvenience on December 2 when IndiGo cancelled thousands of flights nationwide after failing to adjust operations to tighter safety regulations.The fallout has caused major bottlenecks at airports, sent airfares soaring on other carriers and triggered widespread complaints over poor communication, long queues and baggage chaos.The DGCA has already issued show-cause notices to Elbers and Chief Operating Officer Isidro Proqueras, who is also the airline’s Accountable Manager, while the Civil Aviation Ministry has capped fares and ordered flight curtailment to “stabilise the airline’s operations”.","The team comprises senior officials, including deputy and senior flight operations inspectors.

NEW DELHI: Under govt scrutiny for unprecedented flight disruptions, IndiGo chairman Vikram Singh Mehta on Wednesday denied the same were deliberate. Apologising multiple times in his about 8-minute video message, he said “external technical experts (will) work with the management; help determine the root causes, and ensure corrective action so that this level of disruption never occurs again. ”The DGCA is probing IndiGo’s fiasco that unfolded this month. It is examining whether the airline caused the same to avoid abiding by the new pilot rest rules. Mehta denied the same.“Over the past week there has been a ot of criticism. Some fair. Some not. The fair criticism is that the airline let down you down. We owe answers to customers, govt, shareholders, employees. We will examine every aspect of what went wrong. We will learn from it,” he said.“However, there are some allegations that are untrue. That IndiGo engineered the crisis. That we tried to influence govt rules. That we compromised safety. That the board was not involved. These claims are incorrect. IndiGo has followed the pilot fatigue rules as they came into effect. We operated under the new rules throughout, both in July and in Nov. We did not attempt to bypass them.Nor did we anything that impacted our unblemished track record of safety. The disruptions of last week did not happen because of any deliberate actions,” said the former chairman of Shell Group of companies in India.“On Dec 3, an unexpected chain of events led to large scale flight cancellations. This continued into Dec 4 & 5. Thousands of our passengers were left stranded. We did not meet your expectations during those days. This happened because of a combination of of internal and external events including minor technical glitches; schedule changes linked to start of winter; adverse weather conditions; increased congestion in the aviation system and implementation of and operation under the updated crew rostering rules. This is not an excuse, this is simply the truth. This combination of events pushed our systems beyond their limits,” Mehta said.He said the board was constantly involved in tackling the issue and that things are back on track much before expected. The airline operated 1,900 flights to 138 destinations with normal punctuality, he said.Although he admitted: “Last week’s events are a blemish on this company’s pristine record.

'PM Modi Hacks Hearts, Not EVM': Kangana Ranaut Lambasts Rahul Gandhi During SIR Debate In Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: With several opposition members pushing for reverting to the old ballot paper system in elections, BJP MP and former Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday hit back, saying it would mean going back to the days of booth capturing.Participating in a debate inthe Lok Sabha on 'election reforms', Prasad said there are at least two dozen Supreme Court and high court judgments validating the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs). The govt has repeatedly ruled out going back to the ballot paper system as EVMs have made the election process faster and safer, he added.Prasad recalled that the Election Commission had invited parties to hack EVMs in its presence, but none turned up. ""Now they are raising a hue and cry (against EVMs),"" he said.Prasad lashed out at the Congress for levelling allegations of 'vote chori' ahead of the Bihar elections, noting that ""not one plea"" was received to check the EVMs after the recent state elections.On allegations of EVM tampering, another BJP member Kangana Ranaut said Congress politicians were unwilling to accept electoral defeats. ""Let me tell the Congress people that the Prime Minister does not hack EVMs, he hacked people's hearts"".She mocked demands for a return to the paper ballot system, calling it an ""outdated relic of another era"". Ranaut also took on the opposition members for repeatedly disrupting Parliament. She said watching them often felt ""traumatic"", adding that the MPs had repeatedly ""jumped into the well, shouted 'SIR, SIR'' created a spectacle, tried intimidation and misbehaved in every possible way"".""May be, barring the last two or three days, they did not let the House run at all.

Shah counters Cong, lists 'vote chori' by Nehru, Indira, Sonia

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah Wednesday launched a sharp rebuttal to opposition's ""vote chori"" pitch, asserting that Congress's poll defeats stemmed from leadership failure rather than vote irregularities. Instead of introspection, he said, they were deflecting blame by peddling a false narrative of vote theft.""One day, Congress cadre will question their leadership,"" he said, intervening in the LS debate on poll reforms.Shah challenged LoP Rahul Gandhi's allegation that RSS had ""captured"" institutions, questioning - ""Is there a law in this country that bars a person with RSS ideology from holding constitutional posts? The PM is from RSS, and so is the home minister.""New Delhi: Intervening in the Lok Sabha debate on electoral reforms, Union home minister Amit Shah emphasised that RSS ideology was to live and die for the nation, to make Bharat more prosperous and stronger. Recalling his youth, he said, ""When I was 10 years old, I shouted slogans - 'Assam ki galiyan suni hain, Indira Gandhi khooni hai'.""He said that whenever the opposition faced a setback, it tries to shift the blame.""The people's mandate is the blessing of 'janta janardan', and dubbing the poll process as 'vote chori' is an insult to the country's voters, who are watching,"" Shah said.Delivering a point-by-point rebuttal to the opposition's charges, the home minister mounted a strong defence of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by EC. ""If someone asked a question in a press conference, they were labelled a BJP agent; if they (opposition) lost a court case, they accused the judge; and if they lost an election, they blamed EVMs. When the EVM narrative failed, they shifted to 'vote chori', and they still lost in Bihar. "" Enumerating what he called Congress's ""anti-people"" stand that led to its electoral decimation, Shah listed its objection to Article 370's abrogation, CAA, triple talaq abolition, surgical strikes, Ram Mandir construction, and now 'one nation one election' and SIR. ""This is why you lost election after election. Keep opposing SIR, you will be wiped out in West Bengal and TN too,"" hesaid.Shah cited the 1969 presidential polls, recalling how then-PM Indira Gandhi defied her party's decision and called for voting on ""antaratma ki awaaz"" as she supported V V Giri against official candidate Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy. ""Since Indira Gandhi's position in the party was precarious and Reddy had majority support, she took the communists' help and obliged them with appointments in key institutions. The country's institutions were diverted towards communist ideology by Indira Gandhi, which are being reformed by PM Modi since 2014. "" Shah said the opposition wanted to retain ""avaidh ghuspathiye (illegal immigrants)"" on the voter list, which was why they raised the SIR issue. Modi govt's policy, however, was clear - detect all aliens, delete their names from voter list and deport them.In his 90-minute speech, Shah provided a detailed rebuttal to opposition's charges on SIR. The session witnessed interruptions from Rahul, who challenged Shah to debate his three press conferences on ""vote chori"". This led to heated exchanges, culminating in an opposition walkout. Taking a swipe at Rahul's claim that ""they held only 33% influence"" in the collegium selecting election commissioners, Shah said, ""Those who draft your speech should work harder. You had 100% control earlier when your party was in power - the PM was the sole appointing authority, with no specific law. You should thank us for giving you 33% say now.""Addressing Rahul's query on deletion of CCTV footage after 45 days, Shah said, ""Common sense is not an injection. As per the Constitution, a writ petition challenging an election can be filed within 45 days. After that, keeping recordings serves no point. Besides, it's not possible to provide footage to anyone.""Shah said three instances of ""vote chori"" by Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. ""Post-independence, Sardar Patel was backed by 28 persons, while Nehru was supported by two, yet Nehru became PM - this was vote chori,"" he said, adding the second was by Indira Gandhi, who granted herself immunity after a court set aside her election. The third dispute, he said, had reached civil courts regarding how Sonia Gandhi ""became a voter before becoming a citizen of India"" - a remark that drew sharp protests from Congress MPs. Shah accused the opposition of spreading falsehoods on SIR, asking whether democracy could be safe if PMs and CMs were decided by ""ghuspathiye"". Fiery exchanges ensued, with Rahul saying, ""Let us have a debate on my press conference. Shah ji, I challenge you to debate on the three pressers."" Shah said he would not frame his speech according to LoP's wishes or change its sequence on demand.Hailing Shah's speech in the Lok Sabha, PM Modi said on X: ""An outstanding speech by home minister Shri Amit Shah ji. With concrete facts, he has highlighted diverse aspects of our electoral process, the strength of our democracy and also exposed the lies of the Opposition.""","Home minister Amit Shah launched a sharp rebuttal to opposition's ""vote chori"" pitch.

Why did you not ensure flight duty norms are implemented in time?

Non-usage of helmets and seatbelts also contributed significantly to fatalities. Despite some dips, these dangerous behaviors continue to pose a major challenge to road safety across the nation.

NEW DELHI: Speed kills - and it claimed nearly 1.2 lakh lives in 2024, around 70% of all road deaths (1.8 lakh). Non-wearing of helmets and seatbelts caused 69,088 deaths (39%), showing how road users' behaviour remains the biggest challenge to making roads safer.Crash and fatality details of past five years, submitted by road transport minister Nitin Gadkari in Rajya Sabha Wednesday, show speeding continues to dominate as the main cause of fatal accidents. Its share in deaths rose from 65% in 2020 to 69% in 2021 and a little over 71% in 2022. It dipped to 68% in 2023 but increased again last year.Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of speed-related fatalities - 12,010 out of 24,118 road deaths. Karnataka saw nearly 92% of its 11,360 fatalities caused by speeding, while Madhya Pradesh recorded nearly 81% (11,970).Globally too, speeding is a key factor. According to WHO, even a small rise in average speed sharply increases crash risk and severity. ""Every 1% increase in mean speed produces a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk and a 3% increase in the serious crash risk. The risk of death for pedestrians hit by car fronts rises rapidly (4.5 times from 50 kmph to 65 kmph).In car-to-car side impacts, the fatality risk for occupants is 85% at 65 kmph,"" WHO states.Govt data showed a slight dip in deaths due to non-wearing of helmets and seatbelts - 69,088 in 2024 compared with 70,518 in 2023.Tamil Nadu again topped in helmet-related deaths with 7,744 fatalities, followed by MP (6,541) and Maharashtra (5,946).

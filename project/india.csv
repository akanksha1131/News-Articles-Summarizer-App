"On eve of Bangladesh victory day, Sheikh Hasina says Yunus 'secretly helping communal forces'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-eve-of-bangladesh-victory-day-sheikh-hasina-says-yunus-secretly-helping-communal-forces/articleshow/116350252.cms,"Bijoy Dibos

NEW DELHI: On the eve of, deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday called the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus an ""undemocratic group"" that is ""secretly supporting anti-liberation extremist-communal forces.""In a statement to commemorate the defeat of Pakistani forces in Bangladesh’s Liberation War of 1971, Hasina dubbed Muhammad Yunus as a ""fascist"" seeking to stifle the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.The statement released by her party revolved around the role of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the Awami League in the struggle that culminated in the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. Hasina took the opportunity to criticise Nobel laureate Yunus, who formed an interim government shortly after she stepped down and fled to India.""This undemocratic group, led by the fascist Yunus, has no responsibility towards the people,"" she said.""They are seizing power and obstructing all public welfare work,"" she added.Hasina slammed the Yunus-led administration, claiming that the people of Bangladesh were burdened by rising prices.""As this government is not democratically elected, it has no accountability to the people. Their main aim is to suppress the spirit of the Liberation War and the pro-liberation forces, silencing their voices,"" Hasina said.""The lack of sensitivity of the leaders of this government, including the fascist Yunus, towards the Liberation War and its history is evident in every step they take,"" she further said.Sheikh Hasina, who fled Bangladesh after massive student protests, accused the interim government of attempting to erase “progressive ideals,” the history and spirit of the Liberation War, and “all traces of the Great War of Liberation from national life.”In her statements after reaching India, Hasina has repeatedly accused Yunus of perpetrating “genocide” and failing to protect Hindus and other minorities. Yunus reportedly raised concerns about Hasina’s presence in India with Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri during a visit to Dhaka last week, claiming that the statements did not go well with the people of Bangladesh. Yunus and other high ranking leaders of the caretaker administration have sought Hasina’s extradition from India.","Sheikh Hasina calls interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus an ""undemocratic group"" Hasina says Yunus is seeking to stifle the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.

"My career was made by the Gandhis & unmade by the Gandhis, says Aiyar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-career-was-made-by-the-gandhis-unmade-by-the-gandhis-says-aiyar/articleshow/116348830.cms,"NEW DELHI: His political career was ""made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis,"" said veteran Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar in an interview, while asserting his continued commitment to the party. He also lamented that for 10 years, he was not given the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one or spend any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi, except for once.Reflecting on how he was ""completely isolated in the party"" even though he ""had it all"", Aiyar, in an interview with PTI news agency on his forthcoming book 'A Maverick in Politics', however, strongly professed his commitment to his party. ""I'll never shift, and I will certainly not go to BJP,"" he said.Aiyar also reflected on crucial developments in 2012 when Sonia Gandhi fell very ill and former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh had six bypasses. ""So, we were crippled at the head of the govt and at the head of the party. But there was one man who was still full of energy, full of ideas, had a certain amount of charisma, and could have run either the party or the govt or even both. And that was Pranab Mukherjee ,"" Aiyar is quoted in the interview.""If Manmohan Singh had become the President and Pranab had become the PM, I still think we would have lost in 2014 (Lok Sabha polls), but not by this massive humiliating defeat that we actually had, where we fell to 44 seats... "" Aiyar said.Asked about the patronage from the Gandhis, the Congress veteran said, ""I only had patronage. I had the favour of (former) prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. I then had the favour of Sonia Gandhi. But that's a very, very uncertain basis on which to be in politics. So when Sonia Gandhi got angry with me in 2010, that patronage got withdrawn. And yet not completely withdrawn."" ""So, it was a very slow decline. But it was a decline that took place over a period of about 15 years... ,"" Aiyar said.Aiyar, in the interview, goes on to detail several controversies, including the 2017 ""neech"" remark row and his subsequent suspension from the party. He narrates how his distance with the Gandhi family increased with that incident, saying one could date his fall precisely to Dec 7, 2017, when he had made the comment. He highlights that though the suspension was eventually revoked but the meeting with Rahul Gandhi did not materialise.","Mani Shankar Aiyar says his political career was ""made by the Gandhis and unmade by them"" He also lamented that for 10 years, he was not given the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one or spend any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi, except for once.

MUMBAI: In a surprise move, NCP president and deputy CM Ajit Pawar dropped veteran NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal , a prominent OBC face in the previous govt, from the cabinet. ""I have no comments to offer on the NCP leadership's decision. It is the prerogative of the NCP president; I will abide by it,"" Bhujbal told TOI.The cabinet expansion took place soon after Ajit Pawar hinted at introducing a two-and-a-half-year ministerial term for certain portfolios, instead of a full five-year stint. The strategy aimed at ensuring broader representation from various districts and regions, was formulated with the approval of CM Devendra Fadnavis and deputy CM Eknath Shinde, he said.Along with Bhujbal, Ajit Pawar has dropped senior NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil, Dharamrao Baba Atram, Anil Patil and Sanjay Bansode. Walse Patil handling the cooperation portfolio, Patil relief and rehabilitation, Atram food and drug administration and Bansode sports in the previous govt led by Shinde.Senior NCP leaders expressed surprise over the unceremonious removal of Bhujbal, who had taken up the cause of OBCs during the storm caused by the Maratha quota stir. ""It was wrong to drop Bhujbal from the cabinet when he had stood against Maratha leader Manoj Jarange,"" said a senior NCP neta.Apparently, Ajit Pawar felt that it was high time that senior NCP leaders, particularly those aged above 70, should be retired and replaced by new faces. ""We agree with Ajit Pawar, but this was not the proper time for it. He should have waited for a brief period, at least till Jarange's importance subsides,"" said the NCP neta.As per reports, there was strong opposition to Bhujbal's induction from newly elected legislators, including all from Nashik district, led by Manikrao Kokate from Sinnar.Another senior NCP functionary said Walse Patil, a veteran party leader, had told Ajit Pawar that he was not keen on joining the cabinet owing to health concerns. Walse Patil, who was present at the swearing-in ceremony, may take up a gubernatorial assignment at a later stage, as per the understanding between NCP and BJP.","Chhagan Bhujbal had taken up the cause of OBCs during the storm caused by the Maratha quota stir.

""It's an all-encompassing cabinet with a good number of women ministers . It also did a good balancing act between the OBCs and Marathas ,"" he added.The dropping of Fadnavis's 'trusted lieutenant' Ravindra Chavan, who was in charge of the Konkan region for the assembly elections, came as a shock to many. ""It is clear that Fadnavis did not have a free hand in the selection of candidates from BJP,"" said sources. ""Chandrakant Patil is a close aide of Union home minister Amit Shah and makes it to the cabinet irrespective of his performance. Pankaja Munde and Ashish Shelar being brought into the cabinet, and the inclusion of Nitesh Rane also indicates that the central leadership had a role to play. MLAs from Amravati and Washim, two crucial districts in Vidarbha, were not considered, while novices like Phundkar were.""While Munde is not a favourite with the Centre either, social equations in Marathwada, the polarisation between the VJNT community and Marathas played a crucial role in her selection. To appease the Marathas, there is Shivendra Raje Bhosale, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and Patil. And by picking Ashok Uike, a tribal MLA from Yavatmal, BJP has looked beyond Nandurbar and Palghar, said sources.Political analyst Abhay Deshpande said the inclusion of state BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and Shelar is a message to party workers that working hard for the party pays dividends. ""Girish Mahajan, a confidant of Fadnavis who was tipped to be state party president, found a place in the cabinet. Rane's inclusion is indicative that the party will use him to further its Hindutva agenda along with ensuring a face in Konkan, that is dominated by the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena,"" he added.The presence of ministers from every region in the cabinet will also prove useful for the coming local elections as they would be put in charge of winning these polls, said sources.","The dropping of Fadnavis's 'trusted lieutenant' Ravindra Chavan, who was in charge of the Konkan region for the assembly elections, came as a shock to many.

""Are you married?"" he asked a surrendered cadre from Telangana who replied in the negative. ""Go get married now,"" said the minister promptly.After the interaction, Shah said, ""I am the happiest person today, more than you or your family as our painstaking efforts to convince you to surrender and join the mainstream has bore fruit.""Shah said the event may be small but was very significant.

Newly crowned chess world champion D Gukesh responded to critiques regarding the quality of his World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren .He emphasised that victory in high-stakes matches isn't solely determined by gameplay. He believes willpower and character are equally crucial, qualities he feels he amply demonstrated.At 18, Gukesh defeated Liren in the 14-game world championship match, scoring 7.5-6.5. This victory makes him the youngest world champion in chess history.Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the championship match, which concluded on Thursday.Carlsen remarked that the match resembled ""a second round or third round match of an open tournament.""Kramnik's assessment was even more critical, stating that the match represented the ""end of chess as we know it.""Asked if he was hurt by Carlsen's comments, Gukesh told BBC World, ""Not really"".Gukesh acknowledged the validity of some of the criticisms regarding the quality of play. However, he underscored the importance of non-chess factors in determining the outcome of a world championship match.""I get that maybe in some of the games, the quality was not high but I think the world championship matches are decided not purely by chess but by who has the better character and who has the better willpower. And I think those qualities, I did show quite well.""While acknowledging the pressure of the world championship, Gukesh admitted he aspired to a higher level of play. He recognised the unique demands of such a high-profile competition.""And the pure chess part, it was not at a very high level as I would have liked it to be because it's a new experience for me. So the workload was different, the pressure was different.""It's understandable that I was a bit off but I managed to strike at the critical moments, which I am happy about,"" said Gukesh.Ding Liren's critical error, which ultimately cost him the championship title, also drew criticism.FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich offered a different perspective on the error. He suggested that such mistakes add to the excitement of the sport.Indian chess legend Viswanathan Anand offered his congratulations to Gukesh. He advised the young champion to disregard the criticism.""I feel very happy. I was literally watching history being made yesterday. It (criticism) comes with every match. To be honest, I think it just comes with the territory. You ignore it and that's all,"" said Anand.",D Gukesh is the youngest chess world champion in history. The 18-year-old defeated Ding Liren in the 14-game world championship match. Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the match.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116295294,imgsize-204360,width-400,resizemode-4/116295294.jpg"

MUMBAI: The BJP-led govt in Maharashtra has inducted several ministers who are still facing Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigations. This includes Pratap Sarnaik, Hasan Mushrif, Dhananjay Munde and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar . None of them have been chargesheeted, but no closure reports have been filed in court indicating that investigations against them have come to an end.BJP's Girish Mahajan, on the other hand, has joined the cabinet after receiving clearance through a CBI closure report recently.Pawar, Munde, Mushrif, Sarnaik were opposition members when accused by the ED of money laundering , but later became the BJP's alliance partners. The cases continue and chargesheets have been filed against some persons and companies with which they are alleged to have links.Regarding Mahajan's case, he faced police charges during MVA govt's tenure for extortion and kidnapping. He maintained his innocence and requested a CBI investigation . The Eknath Shinde government had transferred the case to CBI, which cleared Mahajan. Subsequently, the CBI filed charges against IPS officer Bhagyashree Navtake and others for criminal conspiracy and providing false information on people associated with Mahajan.Hasan Mushrif, an MLA from Ajit Pawar's NCP, who also became a minister after taking oath on Sunday, had had his premises searched by the ED over money laundering allegations.Dhananjay Munde faces an ED investigation regarding a 17-acre plot in Pus village, Beed district.

"Over 750 animals rescued from mass sacrifice, but 4,200 buffaloes slaughtered at religious festival in Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-750-animals-rescued-from-mass-sacrifice-but-4200-buffaloes-slaughtered-at-religious-festival-in-nepal/articleshow/116258982.cms,"Representative Image /AI Generated

NEW DELHI: The mass animal sacrifice at the Gadhimai festival in Nepal kept India’s border guarding force, Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), and local administration across several districts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh on their toes. This resulted in saving more than 750 animals, including buffaloes and goats, from being slaughtered early this week. The festival, nevertheless, witnessed the slaughter of 4,200 buffaloes at the Gadhimai temple on December 8-9.Nearly 400 of the rescued animals, including 74 buffaloes saved before they headed for the mass sacrifice, have found homes for future care at Vantara, a wildlife and rehabilitation centre of the Reliance group in Jamnagar, Gujarat.This first-of-its-kind rescue operation was possible with the intervention of the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and animal welfare groups such as People for Animals (PFA) and Humane Society International/India (HSI/India). Their volunteers worked on the ground with district administration and stopped the illegal transportation of hundreds of buffaloes, goats, pigeons, and chickens to Nepal ahead of the mass sacrifice that took place over two days on December 8-9.Held every five years in Bariyarpur village in the Bara district of Nepal, the festival is estimated to see the sacrifice of as many as 5 lakh animals at the Gadhimai temple. Though these animals are mostly procured locally, a substantial number comes from Bihar and UP despite the Supreme Court of India directing the govt in 2014 to stop the illegal transportation of animals to Nepal for sacrifice at the Gadhimai temple.When asked about the number of animals sacrificed this year, Arkaprava Bahar of HSI/India, who led the rescue efforts at the border, said, “It is challenging to determine the exact number, as only buffalo sacrifices are officially tracked. However, it is estimated that 2.5 to 5 lakh animals were sacrificed during that period, including 4,200 buffaloes, based on the temple committee’s receipts.”At Vantara, the rescued animals will receive veterinary care, including necessary medical treatment to help them recover from the hardships they endured. “We are filled with joy knowing they have been saved from the horrors of the Gadhimai sacrifice and will now live and flourish in a safe, loving environment (at Vantara). Their successful relocation will ensure the best possible long-term care and well-being for these animals,” said Gauri Maulekhi, trustee at PFA.The AWBI wrote in October to police chiefs of both Bihar and UP, asking them to prevent the illegal transportation of animals ahead of the festival. The Board member, Girish J Shah, also coordinated the campaign with the district administration to rescue the animals.The Gadhimai festival, whose origins date back around 265 years, involves a month-long celebration culminating in the ritual slaughter of hundreds of thousands of animals. Though the Supreme Court of Nepal ordered in 2019 an end to animal sacrifices at Gadhimai and urged authorities to create a plan to phase out this practice, the neighbouring country has, so far, not been successful in controlling it.When asked about the reason, Bahar said, “As per Nepal’s Supreme Court, the practice of animal sacrifice is inappropriate from religious, social, cultural, environmental, moral, and logical perspectives, and efforts should be made to phase it out. However, the court also conveyed that reforms must respect social and cultural contexts to avoid disrupting societal structures. A direct ban without addressing these factors would be premature.“To achieve a gradual cessation of animal sacrifice, a few directives have been issued to relevant ministries and authorities in Nepal to develop and implement a phased plan to ban animal sacrifice, considering social, cultural, and religious sensitivities.”He said the temple committee, along with the local administration, however, uses these social and cultural contexts as protection to continue the sacrifice.","Nearly 400 of the rescued animals, including 74 buffaloes saved before they headed for the mass sacrifice, have found homes for future care at Vantara, a wildlife and rehabilitation centre in Jamnagar, Gujarat.

Congress general secretary in-charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh in a post on X asked what would the PM do without Nehru.""Nehru is necessary to distract the nation's attention from his own failures. Nehru is necessary to divert the nation's attention from current challenges on which he maintains a complete silence,"" Ramesh said.""French philosopher Voltaire had said that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him. For our self-anointed divinity - if Nehru had not existed - it would have been necessary to invent him,"" he added.On PM Modi's attack in his speech on first PM Jawaharlal Nehru over amending the Constitution through an ordinance to put curbs on freedom of press in 1951, Jairam Ramesh in another post explained why the first amendment to the Constitution was brought.He said it was done for three reasons: ""One, to deal with communal propaganda at a most sensitive time.

Leadership has to be earned: Omar on Congress

helming INDIA

NEW DELHI: J&K CM Omar Abdullah's dismissal of Congress's allegations of tampering with EVMs and his assertions that he has never blamed the machines for election outcomes put his ally in the state and INDIA bloc on a sticky wicket.Congress has been stepping up its attack on EVMs since its poll losses in Haryana and Maharashtra.""When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs, and you celebrate that as sort of a victory for your party, you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to,"" Abdullah said in a PTI interview.When told he sounded suspiciously like a BJP spokesperson, he was quoted saying, “God forbid!” He then added, “No, it’s just that... what’s right is right.” “One day voters choose you, the next day they don’t,” Omar Abdullah said. He gave his own example of facing defeat in Lok Sabha polls while winning a majority in the Sept assembly polls. “I never blamed the machines,” he said.He said parties should not contest elections if they do not trust the voting mechanism. “If you have problems with the EVMs, then you should be consistent in those problems,” he said while replying to a question about whether he thinks that the opposition in general, and Congress, in particular, is barking up the wrong tree by focusing on EVMs.National Conference has been “exasperated with Congress” over the way it fought the J&K elections. Abdullah had said midway during the campaign that Congress is unnecessarily focusing on Kashmir when the elections are about how Congress will perform in Jammu.Acknowledging growing discontent among INDIA bloc partners with Congress, Abdullah asked the latter to justify its leadership role in the alliance as it holds a significant position as the largest opposition party in the Parliament. In the interview, he emphasised that leadership has to be “earned and cannot be taken for granted”. The Congress leadership, however, refrained from reacting to the remarks.","Congress has been stepping up its attack on EVMs since its poll losses in Haryana and Maharashtra. “One day voters choose you, the next day they don’t,” Omar Abdullah said.

HYDERABAD: Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents such as study permits, visas and educational records, including marks and attendance.The request from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a government department that deals with foreign students, caused widespread panic among international students, many of whom hold visas with up to two years' validity.The development comes as IRCC tightens its policies to regulate the influx of international students, introducing stricter financial requirements and exploring potential caps on student admissions. ""I was a bit shocked when I received the email. My visa is valid until 2026, yet I was asked to submit all my documents again,"" said Avinash Kaushik, a postgraduate student from Hyderabad studying in Surrey, British Columbia. ""They even want proof of attendance, marks, where we are working part-time, etc.,"" he added.Last week, a similar surge in such emails was reported among students from Punjab.

'Some allies feel Congress isn’t doing enough to justify its role'

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Sunday criticised INDIA bloc ally Congress for its inconsistent stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), taking a pointed swipe at the party's selective trust in the voting mechanism.In an exclusive interview with news agency PTI, Abdullah said, “When you get over a hundred members of Parliament using the same EVMs and celebrate that as a victory, you can’t then turn around and blame them when the results don’t go your way.”""If you have problems with the EVMs, then you should be consistent in those problems,"" he added.Continuing to toe a different line from Congress, Abdullah praised the new Parliament building, a project the grand old party had sharply criticised.""Contrary to what everybody else believes, I think that what's happening with this Central Vista project in Delhi is a damn good thing. I believe constructing a new Parliament building was an excellent idea. We needed a new Parliament building. The old one had outlived its utility,"" the J&K CM said.His remarks add to growing friction between the National Conference and Congress, allies within the INDIA opposition bloc. Abdullah expressed disappointment over the Congress’ performance during theJammu and Kashmir Assembly elections , where the National Conference carried much of the campaign burden. The NC secured 42 seats compared to Congress’ six in the 90-member assembly.Addressing criticism of dynasty politics, Abdullah rejected the notion that family lineage guarantees political success. Drawing from personal experience, he told PTI, “Belonging to a political family is not a lifelong ticket to success. I’ve lost elections despite my family’s legacy.”Abdullah criticised the BJP for its selective outrage against dynasties, pointing out that the party tolerates such politics among its allies. “The BJP has no problem with political families that align with them. It’s convenient hypocrisy,” he said. Abdullah underscored that dynastic politicians in opposition are often unfairly targeted while similar practices within the BJP’s ranks remain unchallenged.He also reflected on his own family’s political journey, noting that his sons would need to build their careers independently. “Nobody is going to give them anything on a plate,” he remarked.Omar Abdullah also took aim at Congress’ role as the leader of the INDIA bloc, questioning whether the party has done enough to justify its leadership position.“By virtue of being the single largest party in Parliament, and also having the leader of opposition in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the fact that they have a pan-India footprint, which no other party can lay claim to, they are natural sort of leaders of an opposition movement,” he acknowledged.However, he added, “Yet there is a sense of disquiet among some of the allies because they feel the Congress is ‘not doing enough to justify it or to earn it or to keep it. That’s something the Congress might wish to consider.”Abdullah criticised the bloc’s sporadic engagement, arguing that its activities can’t be limited to a few months before elections saying, “you just come alive once Lok Sabha elections are announced and suddenly start talking and trying to work things out.”","Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah criticised INDIA bloc ally Congress for its inconsistent stance on Electronic Voting Machines.

Did Lord Hanuman's centuries-old idol appear overnight? Did the ancient jyotirlinga just emerge out of nowhere? Was this not a matter of faith? Why have the culprits responsible for the massacre in Sambhal 46 years ago not been punished to date? Why is there no discussion about the innocent lives lost back then? What was the fault of those who were brutally killed in Sambhal 46 years ago?""He further questioned, ""What if the Ayodhya verdict on the Ram temple had not been delivered? What if the Ram temple had not been built? Would an international airport have been established in Ayodhya? Would the streets of Ayodhya have been developed into four-lane roads? Would Ayodhya have been connected with a double railway line? Would Ayodhya have achieved such excellent connectivity?""He said that while Ayodhya's residents and pilgrims appreciate the city's transformation, certain groups express dissatisfaction. He criticised these groups for inserting the term ""secular"" into the Constitution, which he believes diminished its original meaning.""They are troubled by the transformation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, the construction of the Ram temple, and the divine grandeur of Ayodhya. Their grievance is that despite ruling for decades, they accomplished nothing. Instead of introspecting, they blame our success for their own failures,"" he remarked.The statements followed the discovery of a 400-year-old Lord Shiva and Hanuman temple in Sambhal, closed since 1978. The temple was found during an encroachment and electricity theft inspection, with officials planning its restoration.Opposition leaders responded strongly to the chief minister's comments. Samajwadi Party MP Zia Ur Rehman Barq said, ""These kinds of remarks are being made to divert attention from issues like unemployment and inflation. The public wants development, and the Samajwadi Party government will be formed in the state.""RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha said, ""UP CM Yogi Adityanath is in a very tough competition. There is a very tough competition going on with 'Gujarat wale bhaiya'. Either you are with the Constitution or with this kind of hate-mongering language.""The temple's reopening has drawn significant attention. UP Police have been stationed outside, and the premises have been cleaned and equipped with electricity.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday said that changes in foreign policy should not be seen as a political attack.""When we speak about changing foreign policy, if there is talk about post-Nehruvian construct, it should not be seen as a political attack. It (the change in foreign policy) didn't require Narendra Modi to do it. Narsimha Rao started it,"" Jaishankar said.Speaking at an event in Delhi, the EAM said, ""There are four big factors which should cause us to ask ourselves 'what are the changes which are necessary in foreign policy?'""1: For many years we had the Nehru development model. The Nehru development model produced a Nehruvian foreign policy. It wasn't just about what was happening in our country, there was an international landscape in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, which was bipolar.2: Then there was a unipolar landscape.3: On top of it we have seen, particularly in the last 25 years, a very intense globalization, a very strong interdependence between countries. So, in a way, the relationship and the behaviour of States towards each other has also changed.4: Finally, if one looks at the impact of technology, technology on foreign policy, technology on State capability, and technology on our daily existence, that too has changed. So if the domestic model has changed, if the landscape has changed, if the behavioural patterns of States have changed, and if the tools of foreign policy have changed, how can foreign policy remain the same, EAM Jaishankar remarked.EAM Jaishankar also outlined India's evolving global role, and said, ""Today, India is a country of whom there are greater expectations, a country which has greater responsibilities. The idea of India as a first responder will get more frequent. In the expanded neighbourhood region would be an expectation that India be part of an international response whenever wanted. Because the world is changing, there will be new ideas and initiatives... The whole construct is going to be more open architecture and more multiple choices, but much deeper involvement and more complex decisions.""Jaishankar also underscored the importance of deeper engagement with the world, saying, "" We have to do very much more with the world. It's for the good of this country that our progress and development will accelerate with a deeper engagement with the world. So my sense for the foreign policy ahead would be to think big, to think long, but to think smart.""Acknowledging both continuity and change in foreign policy, Jaishankar said, ""In all frankness, (foreign policy ) is a mix of the old and new. The issues that we have historically confronted, many of them have not gone away. We have yet to secure our borders. We are still combating terrorism on a very serious scale. There are the hangovers of the past. There are the requirements of the present. We have already moved to a foreign policy which is much more directly tasked to advance national development.""He noted a shift in focus within India's foreign policy apparatus over the past decade. ""If you look at all the joint communiques the foreign ministry policy apparatus puts out, you would see in the last 10 years much greater stress on economic diplomacy . When the prime minister or foreign minister goes out, there is much more about technology, capital, best practices, collaborations and investments. These occupy a much larger space... We have taken some valuable lessons from other countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia, who were doing it much longer than we were doing,"" the external affairs minister said."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar said that changes in foreign policy should not be seen as a political attack. He listed the four factors which should cause us to ask ourselves 'what are the changes which are necessary in foreign Policy?'""1: For many years we had the Nehru development model.2: Then there was a unipolar landscape.3: On top of it we have seen, particularly in the last 25 years, a very intense globalization.4: Finally, if one looks at the impact of technology, technology on foreign policy,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116339894,imgsize-1303016,width-400,resizemode-4/116339894.jpg"

JAGDALPUR: Dealing yet another blow to Left-wing extremists in their 'core' area of south Bastar, counter-Naxal forces have set up a security camp in the den of Bastar's most-dreaded Maoist leader Madvi Hidma , commander of the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army's 'Battalion No. 1'.The forward operating base in Golla Konda on the Bijapur-Sukma border was opened on Saturday, coinciding with the visit of home minister Amit Shah as security forces move deeper into the remaining Maoist bastions in their quest to completely eliminate Left-wing extremism by March 2026.Hidma is the youngest member of the CPI (Maoist) central committee and the mastermind behind many fatal ambush-attacks, including the 2010 Dantewada massacre in which 75 CRPF personnel were killed and the 2017 attack in Sukma that left over two dozen people dead. He has a Rs 1 crore bounty on his head but has managed to evade capture. Golla Konda is the operating base of PLGA's 'Battalion No. 1' and 'Pamedh Area Committee', considered the most battle-hardened unit of the CPI (Maoist).As many as 25 forward operating bases or security camps have been set up by forces this year in Bastar division alone, covering the once Naxal-infested zones in Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Kanker. The setting up of these security camps is an exercise in area domination as well as creating a secure bubble to enable development, governance and welfare outreach by the administration in the surrounding villages.This security-cum-development strategy has been fired up in recent months, with Shah taking frequent reviews to monitor the response to his call for uprooting LWE from the country by March 2026.A key Maoist bastion brought down by the forces recently was Tekalgudam, where Left-wing extremists were in total control until a few months back. When the forces moved in and established a security camp in Jhidpalli here, there was intermittent firing by extremists for 2-3 days on security personnel manning the outer cordon. Now, of course, the Naxals are on the back foot. In the past couple of days alone, nine Maoist were killed in Bijapur and Narayanpur districts.",Counter-Naxal forces have set up a security camp in the den of Bastar's most- dreaded Maoist leader Madvi Hidma.

Shah: Anti-Maoist fight intensified after BJP took office in Chhattisgarh

JAGDALPUR: Home minister Amit Shah delivered a firm message to Left-wing extremists during the closing ceremony of Bastar Olympics Sunday, urging them to shun violence and choose rehabilitation.""Give up the path of violence and we shall take care of your rehabilitation or ignore our appeal for surrender and face resolute action by the security forces... I appeal to you all with folded hands to surrender. Have trust in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and join the mainstream. If you give up arms, then your rehabilitation is our responsibility. But we will not allow you to destroy peace in the land of Goddess Danteshwari any more. If you give up arms, we shall welcome you with open arms but if you continue on the path of violence, the forces will tackle you head on,"" Shah said as the battle against Naxals reaches their last bastion deep inside Abujhmad region in Chhattisgarh.The action against Maoists is part of a decisive war to achieve the Modi govt's goal of a Left-wing extremism-free India by March 2026.Shah said the fight had gathered pace after installation of a BJP govt in Chhattisgarh. As many as 287 Maoists were eliminated by counter-Naxal forces, while 837 surrendered and 952 were arrested in the past one year, said the minister, who also presented the 'President's Colours' to Chhattisgarh Police earlier in the day.Later in the afternoon, Shah met surrendered Naxalites from several states. He lauded Chhattisgarh govt's surrender policy as the most attractive in the country.Shah said the Modi govt's multi-pronged strategy of fortifying the security cordon in Maoist-hit zones (by setting up forward operating bases there), devising an attractive surrender and rehabilitation policy for those willing to give up arms and also pushing development and welfare schemes in areas liberated from Maoists' hold, had helped bring down deaths of security forces and civilians by 73% and 70%, respectively, in the past 10 years.Talking of the road ahead, Shah assured that the govt was committed to creating more avenues for local youth, including surrendered Naxals, by promoting small-scale industries, dairy and other cooperatives, tendu patta reform, etc.He said of the 15,000 dwellings approved under PM Awas Yojana for Chhattisgarh, 9,500 were for Bastar region alone.Shah said the Bastar Olympics, with 1.6 lakh participants, told the tale of ongoing transformation of the once Maoist-dominated belt and would lay the foundation of lasting peace and development. ""The event is the last nail in the coffin of Naxalism ,"" he said.""Bastar is changing. And when I visit Bastar again for the 2026 Bastar Olympics, I am confident I will be able to say that Bastar has changed,"" he added.Highlighting the unparalleled natural beauty of Bastar, Shah also declared the govt's intent to develop the region into an attractive tourist destination. ""I have visited Chitrakote waterfall. Bastar's natural beauty is boundless. I assure you that this region will one day get more tourists than Kashmir,"" he said.",Home minister Amit Shah delivered a firm message to Left-wing extremists.

Krishna stays alone in Dhaka often while Ghosh is travelling.""I have been in constant touch with my parents. After the Chittagong court incident, I spoke to my father in Dhaka.

""My daughters have asked my wife and I to move to Canada several times. Why should I leave my motherland and the oppressed?"" Ghosh told TOI.He even refuses to let age catch up with his fight. ""I appealed to several local lawyers to fight the case for the monk, but there was no positive response.

NEW DELHI: States should gear up and lead in bringing reforms for ease of business, cutting red tapes, and reducing compliance burdens, to grab the opportunities of overseas investment coming to India due to changing global scenario, PM Narendra Modi told chief secretaries from states who were in Delhi for a three-day conference.The PM also told the top bureaucrats from states to prepare proper plans for development of tier -2 and tier-3 cities and towns, which are set to emerge as the major hub of economic activities, sources said. “Each such city has its own unique selling proposition (USP) and this must be harnessed while making development plans to attract investments. The PM’s focus was on creating more employment opportunities by getting higher investments and the states need to take lead,” said an official.Global investors are looking at India as a better destination for investment considering good returns compared to other nations, safe environment and huge domestic consumption propelled by the large middle class population. Industries are also looking at setting manufacturing units in India and to export to other countries.“The PM suggested to the chief secretaries that states hold thematic brainstorming sessions to prepare the plan for taking correct steps for growth and development. We have an opportunity to harness the demographic dividend that each state has. For this we need to have a shared vision amongst departments in states and at the national level,” said another official.The PM, on Sunday, spent the full day with chief secretaries and top central govt officials, going through thematic presentations as well. He had spent a few hours at the conference on Saturday as well.This was the fourth such national conference of chief secretaries. The focus of this year’s conference was to prepare a collaborative action to harness India’s demographic dividend by promoting entrepreneurship, enhancing skilling initiatives, and creating sustainable employment opportunities for both rural and urban populations. The conference focussed on manufacturing, services, rural non-farm, urban, renewable energy, and circular economy.","PM Narendra Modi told top bureaucrats from states to prepare proper plans for development of tier -2 and tier-3 cities and towns.

It also has provisions for empowering 'safai karamcharis' (cleanliness workers) in cities to levy fines/penalties on unsegregated waste and to refuse waste collection. The rules will come into force from October 1 next year.Apart from municipal bodies, the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2024, cover waste generation and management activities of hotels, malls, residential complexes, wholesale markets, govt institutions, PSUs, industrial units, schools, colleges, and universities among other bulk waste generators.The rules also make provisions for environmental compensation (penalty) based on the polluter pays principle on persons/entities who do not comply with their mandated tasks.""All hotels, restaurants, resident welfare, market associations, and gated communities and institutions with more than 5,000 sqm area shall, within one year from the date of notification of these rules and in partnership with the local body, ensure segregation of waste at source by the generators as prescribed in these rules, facilitate collection of segregated waste in separate streams, hand over recyclable material to either the authorised waste pickers or the authorised recyclers,"" said the draft rules, issued by the environment ministry on December 9.It said, ""The bio-degradable waste shall be processed, treated, and disposed of through composting or bio-methanation within the premises as far as possible. The residual waste shall be given to the waste collectors or agency as directed by the local body.""The rules, published on Saturday, enlist the duties of all waste generators in detail and also formulate guidelines on how to use it in economic activities, including the 'waste to energy' process and product manufacturing through circularity.Besides elaborating on the responsibilities of local bodies and central/state pollution watchdogs on managing municipal and industrial waste, the proposed rules also have detailed guidelines on managing agri-residue such as paddy stubble and other farm waste in rural areas. It will be the responsibility of gram panchayats to ensure that ""there are no instances of burning of agriculture & horticulture waste and levy heavy penalty on persons involved in open burning of agriculture & horticulture waste.""Under the rules, the gram panchayats will ""facilitate the establishment of collection and storage"" of agri-residue in its jurisdiction for its utilization. The gram panchayats will also have to file “annual returns” by June 30 every year regarding the agri-residue generated, agri-residue utilized in-situ, and agri-residue transported for ex-situ utilization within its jurisdiction on the centralised online portal.These provisions will be quite helpful in managing paddy stubble, particularly in Delhi-NCR, where the episodes of biomass burning substantially contribute to air pollution during every winter season.The draft rules seek to address the adverse effects of unmanaged solid waste; implement principles of circular economy; further strengthen monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of rules covering both urban and rural areas; promote bio-economy and improve the quality of the environment across the country.The ministry has, meanwhile, invited stakeholders and experts to share their objections, if any, on the draft rules within the next sixty days. Their views/suggestions will be considered before issuing the final rules in the gazette.","The rules will come into force from October 1 next year.

Flagging off voyage of cargo ships and barges Union shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal said the advantage of moving cargo through waterways being an economical, ecologically sound and efficient mode of transportation, govt wants to boost freight transportation via waterways, to decongest the railways and roadways.He said the Jalvahak scheme incentivises long haul cargo on NW1 (Ganga), NW2 (Bramhaputra) and NW16 (Barak), and provides an opportunity for the trade interests to explore movement of cargo via waterways with positive economic value proposition.Under the scheme, cargo owners transporting goods over distances exceeding 300 km via waterways will receive up to 35% reimbursement on operating costs. The scheme will be for three years and is designed to optimise supply chains for major shipping companies, freight forwarders, and trade bodies. The cargo promotion scheme is projected to facilitate a modal shift of 800 million tonne-kilometres with an estimated investment of Rs 95.4 crore by 2027, a statement said.“The regular scheduled freight service, which began from Kolkata, will ensure that the cargo is transported and delivered within a stipulated time frame,” Sonowal said.

BENGALURU: Researchers in India have developed a new way to generate truly random numbers using quantum computers, a breakthrough that could make digital security systems harder to crack.The work was done by scientists at the Raman Research Institute (RRI) in Bengaluru, working with colleagues from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the University of Calgary. Their findings were published this year.Random numbers are vital for digital security. They protect bank accounts, encrypt messages, and secure online transactions. But regular computers cannot make truly random numbers. They follow set rules, which means their “random” numbers can theoretically be predicted.Quantum mechanics, however, is inherently random. The researchers found a way to harness this randomness using quantum computers.Previous methods for generating certified random numbers required complex laboratory setups with multiple particles separated over long distances. The Indian team simplified this. They used just one qubit—the basic unit of a quantum computer—and measured it at different times rather than separating particles in space.This approach worked on IBM’s quantum computer, which is available through the cloud. Anyone with internet access could potentially use it.The research builds on work the team started in 2022. That year, they proved quantum mechanics was correct by testing how single particles of light behaved over time. They closed all possible loopholes in their experiment, making their results conclusive.In 2024, they built a quantum random number generator that produced nearly 1 million certified random bits. Now, in 2025, they have shown the same process works on commercial quantum computers, not just in specialised laboratories.“The trilogy advances one idea across three frontiers—rigorous foundational validation, practical certification of randomness, and deployment—culminating in certified randomness running on quantum computers in the cloud,” Prof Urbasi Sinha, who heads the Quantum Information and Computing (QuIC) lab at RRI, said.The simplicity of the new method is its main advantage. Current quantum computers are small and prone to errors, but they can still generate certified random numbers using this technique.This matters for cryptography, where security depends on digital keys being completely unguessable. The new method makes such systems more practical to implement. It also helps test how well individual qubits in quantum computers are working, providing a way to check the quality of quantum hardware.RRI is funded by India's department of science and technology. The work shows quantum computers can do more than solve specialised mathematical problems. They can now provide practical tools for secure communications.","Researchers in India have developed a new way to generate truly random numbers using quantum computers.

Trump's 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan



Gaza will be transformed into a demilitarized, terror-free zone with no threat to neighbors. The region will be redeveloped to improve the lives of Gazans, AFP reported. If both sides accept, the war will stop immediately, Israeli forces will pull back, and hostages will be prepared for release. Within 72 hours of Israel’s approval, all hostages—alive or deceased—will be returned. After hostages are freed, Israel will release 250 prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans detained after October 7, 2023, including women and children. For each deceased Israeli hostage, Israel will return 15 Gazan remains. Hamas members who disarm and commit to peace will be granted amnesty, while others can leave Gaza with safe passage. Full humanitarian aid will immediately flow into Gaza, covering infrastructure repair, hospitals, bakeries, and rubble clearance. Aid delivery will be managed by the UN, Red Crescent, and neutral international agencies, with Rafah crossing opened under agreed terms. Gaza will be run temporarily by a technocratic Palestinian committee, overseen by a new international “Board of Peace” chaired by Trump, until the Palestinian Authority reforms and takes over. An economic plan will be launched to rebuild Gaza with input from global experts, attracting investment and creating jobs. A special economic zone with preferential trade terms will be created for Gaza. No one will be forced to leave Gaza; people may leave or return freely, with incentives to stay and rebuild. Hamas and other factions will have no role in governance. Gaza will be fully demilitarized, with weapons destroyed under international monitoring and buyback programs. Regional partners will guarantee Hamas and other groups comply, ensuring Gaza remains threat-free. A temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF), supported by Arab and global partners, will deploy in Gaza, training Palestinian police and securing borders with Egypt and Israel. Israel will not annex Gaza. As security improves, the IDF will withdraw gradually, handing control to the ISF, except for a limited security perimeter. If Hamas rejects or delays, aid and redevelopment will still proceed in areas controlled by the ISF and free from terror. An interfaith dialogue program will promote tolerance, coexistence, and peace narratives among Israelis and Palestinians. Once Gaza is rebuilt and the Palestinian Authority reforms, conditions may allow progress toward Palestinian self-determination and eventual statehood. The US will foster Israel-Palestine talks to set a long-term political framework for peaceful coexistence and prosperity.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday welcomed US President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan for Gaza, calling it a ""significant step"" toward ending the conflict.Sharing a post on X, PM Modi said, ""We welcome President Trump's leadership as peace efforts in Gaza make decisive progress. Indications of the release of hostages mark a significant step forward. ""He further underlined that India will ""continue to strongly support all efforts towards a durable and just peace.""The comments come as Trump pushes for a breakthrough in the Gaza crisis, with hopes pinned on the release of hostages and renewed talks between the warring sides.Trump on Friday issued an ultimatum to Hamas to agree to a Gaza peace deal with Israel by Sunday, 6pm (Washington DC time), warning that ""all hell, like no one has ever seen before,"" would break out if the deadline was missed.In a fiery post on Truth Social, Trump declared, ""An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, DC time. Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.""Trump also urged Palestinians to move out of conflict zones ahead of what he hinted could be intensified strikes if Hamas rejected the deal.The ultimatum follows Trump's announcement of a 20-point Gaza peace plan earlier this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House.Talking about the 20-point Gaza plan, he said that the Middle East nations had agreed to a peace plan ""after 3000 years,"" assuring to ""spare the lives of remaining Hamas fighters.""""Great, powerful, and very rich Nations of the Middle East, and the surrounding areas beyond, together with the United States of America, have agreed, with Israel signing on, to PEACE, after 3000 years, in the Middle East. THIS DEAL ALSO SPARES THE LIVES OF ALL REMAINING HAMAS FIGHTERS! The details of the document are known to the WORLD, and it is a great one for ALL! We will have PEACE in the Middle East one way or the other. The violence and bloodshed will stop. RELEASES THE HOSTAGES, ALL OF THEM, INCLUDING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT ARE DEAD, NOW!"" he added.Hamas further responded to Trump's proposal stating that it agreed ""to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula"" - if the proper conditions for the exchanges are met.Also Read | Who will govern Gaza?

He who fails to guard against calamities beforehand will repent, too late,

When disaster strikes

The wordcan be traced back to the Spanish ‘, an uproar. Yet, what it leaves behind is never noise; but silence, of those who lose their kin in the crush of humanity.History has recorded such incidents too often. In AD 80, Josephus wrote of Passover pilgrims in Jerusalem. A soldier’s taunt, a moment’s panic, and thousands were trampled into death. Since then, the list has grown: Mecca Tunnel, Mina, Baghdad Bridge, Kumbh Mela, New Delhi Railway Station, Bangalore’s RCB rally, Pushpa II’s premiere in Hyderabad—and now, Karur, where more than 40 lives were snuffed out, some of them children. What began as a gathering of hope became that of despair. The patterns are cruelly familiar: crowds underestimated or dismissed, brittle barricades, packed paths, first responders unable to reach the fallen.Unanswered questions linger. Why was a narrow venue chosen for a rally that all locals knew could not hold such a crowd? Why did the leader arrive late? Were miscreants planted to unleash chaos? None of these questions find easy answers. But each whispers of carelessness that borders on disrespect for life itself.German physicist Dirk Helbing once coined the term. When there are more than six bodies in every square meter, even the slightest motion unleashes a shock wave. At that moment, people are pushed, pulled, and crushed like twigs. To survive, experts advise: move with the crowd, place your arms around your chest to avoid breaking of your ribcage by pressure, avoid walls and do not scream as you have to conserve oxygen, stay upright as much as possible. But what of the children of Karur? Could they shield their tiny chests? Could they ‘flow’ with the sea of bodies? No instruction manual can answer their shrill cries, now frozen in our memories.And the cycle repeats. Each time, organizers and authorities play their parts in the tragedy; grief is turned into blame, inquiries, and eventual forgetting.But the families who watched their children disappear in the chaos will never forget. Their silence will remain an open wound.In the corporate world, there is a practice called a. Before any launch, be it product, marketing or event, a group brainstorms on all that could go wrong, lists down what would be the worst that can happen and then mitigation is planned. What if our leaders, event organizers, and police, practiced this? What if duty meant not afterthoughts but foresight?Thiruvalluvar, with timeless clarity, had already given us the warning in—Do not neglect your duties:The verse is not just a counsel; it is a mirror. Every stampede reflects our failure to heed it. Karur is not merely an accident—it is an indictment of negligence, of blindness to the obvious.The cries beneath the crowd may be hushed, but they will not vanish. They ask us, relentlessly: will we continue to learn nothing, or will we at least listen to wisdom that has echoed for centuries?","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124292845,imgsize-87400,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124292845.jpg"

National Medical Commission (NMC) is yet to act against 30 doctors found guilty of accepting a foreign trip funded by pharma company AbbVie as the matter is still “under consideration”. An audit committee of the department of pharmaceuticals had in Dec last year found them guilty, and their names were sent in July to the commission for action.New chairperson of NMC, Dr Abhijat Sheth, confirmed to TOI that matters pending before the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) could not be taken up. Four out of five posts in the board, including that of its president, are vacant.Speaking to TOI, Sheth said NMC was considering constituting a temporary board of NMC members to take up matters pending before EMRB. “Since this (the charge against 30 doctors) is a serious matter, it will be taken up as soon as possible,” he said. “Govt has reassured us that the vacant posts will be filled up soon. Until then, there is little we can do. We are aware that a lot of matters are pending,” said Sheth, who added he was out of the country and would be back by Oct 12.Of the four autonomous boards in NMC, EMRB, which deals with regulation of the medical profession, has only one part-time member, Dr Surinder Pal Singh, from Punjab Medical Council, who was appointed in July.Many of the posts have been vacant for more than one year though the NMC Act stipulates that three months before the end of a member’s tenure, the matter must be referred to a search committee for filling up the vacancy. NMC had issued a circular inviting applicants for the vacant posts in 2023 and again in Aug 2024.The list of 30 doctors has not been made public by the department of pharmaceuticals though its audit committee and later apex committee had found them guilty of accepting foreign vacations to Monaco and Paris funded by AbbVie. Despite the apex committee stating in Dec 2024 that NMC should be requested to take action against the guilty doctors, the department had failed to forward the names of the doctors to NMC till July.","NMC yet to act against 30 doctors found guilty of accepting foreign trip funded by AbbVie.

Khalistani Leader Pannun Cornered: NIA Files New Case After Aide Gosal’s Arrest Over Terror Links

Transnational organised crime is a concern for India & Canada, says govt

NEW DELHI: While Canadian police focus on tackling the Bishnoi syndicate, pro-Khalistan elements attempted arson at a cinema theatre in Ontario twice within a week. The theatre has stopped screening Hindi movies since. The attacks were carried out on Oct 2 and Sept 25. In the second incident, the suspects fired gunshots to cause a scare.Designated terror group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) released a statement on Friday calling on the Carney govt to ban all “Made In India” films.In the first incident, two masked suspects wearing black clothing attempted to ignite a fire at the theatre’s entrance using flammable liquid from red gas cans, CCTV footage released by Khalistani elements shows. The fire was contained outside, causing moderate damage. This happened at 5.30am on Sept 25.On Oct 2, around 1.50am, a single suspect, described by local police as a heavy-built male wearing black and a face mask, fired multiple shots at the theatre’s entrance doors.Halton Regional Police said they were probing both incidents as targeted attacks.The threatre’s CEO Jeff Knoll linked the attacks to the screening of south Asian films, adding that due to safety concerns, it had halted the screenings of Indian films ‘Kantara: A Legend Chapter 1’ and ‘They Call Him OG’.SFJ chief Pannun claimed “Make in India” was no longer a cultural label but had become a political weapon for Modi’s regime. “Every screening and every product stamped ‘Made in India’ carries the imprint of a violent ideology that is driving India toward a Hindutva totalitarian state,” he said . Allowing Indian films and products into Canadian markets, he warned, was equivalent to opening the door to propaganda that normalises violence against pro-Khalistan Sikhs and undermines the values enshrined in Canada’s Charter.India and Canada had productive talks in the recent NSA-level meeting on advancing the bilateral relationship in areas such as counter terrorism, combating transnational organised crime and intelligence exchanges, said the govt responding to queries on Ottawa’s listing of the Bishnoi gang as a terrorist entity.MEA said security cooperation is an important agenda of continued bilateral collaboration. “Transnational organised crime is a particular concern to both countries. All countries, in fact, must come together to fight this menace,” said MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal. “They agreed to strengthen security cooperation and further reinforce existing mechanisms of engagement.”",Pro-Khalistan elements attempted arson at a cinema theatre in Ontario twice within a week.

NEW DELHI: A scuffle broke out between ABVP and Left-affiliated outfits and charges and counter-charges were traded in JNU over a Ravan Dahan and a Durga immersion on Thursday.The Leftist outfits alleged that an effigy of former students Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam - who are facing trial in a 2020 Delhi riots case - along with Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, was burnt during a Ravan Dahan. They accused ABVP of communal propaganda. ABVP, on the other hand, alleged that its Durga immersion procession was attacked.Videos from the campus showed groups of students raising slogans and flashing slippers, while security personnel formed a chain to prevent an escalation.TOI was unable to independently confirm the details of the two events.ABVP said the effigy burning was symbolic of the end of ""Naxalism, Leftism, Maoist violence and anti-national ideologies"". Khalid, Imam, Guru and Naxal movement leaders Charu Mazumdar and Kanu Sanyal had replaced Ravan's heads. ABVP, on the other hand, said the Left groups threw stones and abused students at the Durga Visarjan. JNUSU joint secretary Vaibhav Meena, who is from ABVP, said it was a ""direct assault on the cultural harmony of the university"" and ""the soil of JNU will no longer be the centre for glorifying Naxalism and Leftist mentality"".ABVP's statement said that the Left groups ""attacked"" the immersion procession near the Sabarmati T-Point around 7 pm"". It said several students were injured, PTI reported.The Left-affiliated outfits rejected the claim. They asked why Nathuram Godse or Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh were not depicted as Ravan.

Poll Do you agree with the Delhi high court's ruling on personal use of luxury items? Agree Disagree





NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court recently clarified that a single Rolex watch cannot be deemed a commercial quantity and allowed the redemption of the detained item, while emphasising caution in future adjudications.A division bench of Justices Pratibha M Singh and Sahil Jain was hearing a petition challenging an order passed by the office of the Commissioner of Customs, IGI Airport , New Delhi, regarding the detention and proposed confiscation of a Rolex watch belonging to a Dubai resident.The bench observed that while the order by the Customs Commissioner correctly allowed redemption of the detained goods, it erred in concluding that a single Rolex watch constituted a commercial quantity.The court said, “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The petitioner, a Dubai resident, had travelled to India and, upon arrival at the airport, his single Rolex watch was detained for alleged non-declaration.He approached the high court, challenging the order—particularly the classification of a single watch as a commercial quantity—and sought clarity on the redemption procedure.Counsel for the petitioner argued that a single Rolex watch could not be considered a commercial quantity and could legitimately be kept for personal use.The petitioner requested the court to allow redemption without dispute over the personal use claim, while upholding the payment of the previously imposed redemption fine.Highlighting the need for careful adjudication, the court allowed the petition, directing the petitioner to pay the redemption fine by October 31 and redeem the detained Rolex watch in accordance with the original order.","The Delhi high court recently clarified that a single Rolex watch cannot be deemed a commercial quantity.

Recruiter timeline and tracking

Significance and pressure points

The University of Delhi (DU) will conduct a large-scale job fair on 8 October 2025, bringing recruiters to campus for placements and internships across disciplines. The clock is tight: student registrations shut on 5 October and the portal auto-closes after 5,000 submissions—whichever comes first. The drive is organised by the Central Placement Cell (CPC) under the Dean of Students’ Welfare. The fair will run across the Indoor Stadium, Multipurpose Hall and Gate No. 2 facilities on the university campus. Candidates who receive a confirmation email must report by 9:00 a.m. on 8 October.Participation is open to regular undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students, as well as DU alumni. However, School of Open Learning (SOL) students are not eligible, a line of exclusion that leaves a large distance-learning cohort outside the ambit of this placement exercise.Registration is free and can be completed via a Google form. It requires:The form’s 5,000-entry cap means late applicants can find the portal locked before the date, and incomplete/incorrect entries risk disqualification.All participating students are required to carry multiple hard copies of their CVs for direct submission to employers. Digital uploads alone will not suffice.Recruiting organisations are expected to complete their own sign-ups by 6 October, allowing the CPC to finalise schedules.Students have been advised to regularly check the official placement site (placement.du.ac.in) and the registration form page for job descriptions and the evolving list of participating companies in the run-up to the fair.The job fair arrives in a demanding labour market where entry-level roles are fiercely contested. For final-year students and recent graduates, the event is a decisive springboard; for DU, it is a public test of employability readiness—from logistics and recruiter mix to actual offers made. Pressure points are clear: the exclusion of SOL candidates, the compressed registration window, and the strict documentation regimen. Each will influence both student experience and outcomes.","The University of Delhi will conduct a large-scale job fair on 8 October 2025.

Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad among top biz destinations



Room boom

Faith rules, and so does Rishikesh when it comes to remaining the priciest desi destination in terms of average hotel room rates. Though business travel gathered steam last fiscal — Mumbai and Delhi knocked off Srinagar and Udaipur from the second and third spots — leisure was the buzz, with 10 out of top 15 on the list being non-business destinations.Leading hospitality consulting firm Hotelivate’s recent report for 2024-25 shows the holy town in Uttarakhand on top of the pile for the second consecutive year, though its revenue per available room (RevPAR) declined marginally by about 4% to Rs 9,691 from Rs 10,086 in FY 24.The top 10 leisure destinations are: Rishikesh, Ranthambore, Udaipur, Srinagar, Goa, Varanasi, Jodhpur, Mussoorie, Lonavala and Agra. The five business destinations are Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Gurgaon and Bengaluru. “In recent years, rising demand for leisure destinations, particularly emerging ones with limited supply, has propelled these locations to the top of the country’s RevPAR (revenue per available room) rankings. The broader top 15 reflects similar trends: leisure markets like Coorg and Srinagar have dropped in rank due to the arrival of new, lower-tier hotels, whereas established urban markets such as Hyderabad, and Gurgaon have posted robust RevPAR growth,” says Hotelivate.Indian hospitality industry was on a roll last fiscal thanks to a booming economy and domestic travel, even as international inbound continues below pre-Covid 2019 levels. The report says India’s proposed supply crossed the 1 lakh-room mark for the first time in over a decade and the average room occupancy in April 2024-March 2025 “stood at 68.0%, the highest in recent memory and comfortably above the pre-pandemic levels. ”The fallout of the Pahalgam terror attack, including impact on commercial flights both in India and international ones due to prolonged airspace closures, did affect travel. The overall travel industry remains confident of coming out of that and continue their best post-Covid success story seen last fiscal. “Despite turbulence — economic slowdowns, geopolitical headwinds, and investor caution — India has kept its pace strong. Domestic demand has been powering the industry forward, even when international arrivals remained inconsistent.” While leisure “markets found a rhythm, posting records in performance” last fiscal, places like Goa are “showing signs of fatigue.”“Mumbai secured pole position yet again, leading the country in room revenue per key and ranking on the podium in all other key metrics. Bengaluru and New Delhi complete the top three by inventory.” Existing hotels outperformed on both occupancy and rate last fiscal, but their strength tends to get diluted when averaged with newer supply.

Poll Should the government clarify the events of Operation Sindoor? Yes, transparency is crucial No, it's not necessary

NEW DELHI: Congress on Friday expressed doubt over Operation Sindoor , saying ""something is fishy"" and raised questions alleging conflicting statements from top defence officials.Talking to reporters, Congress leader Ajay Rai said, ""The CDS says something, the Army Chief says something else, and different people give different statements in completely different ways. This clearly indicates that there is something fishy.""He further urged the government to bring ""truth and reality"" in front of the country, saying, ""the whole matter should be clarified.""His statement followed Air Force chief Amar Preet Singh's remarks dismissing Pakistan's claims of shooting down Indian fighter jets during Operation Sindoor, calling them ""Manohar Kahaniyan.""Singh, who was addressing the press conference on the 93rd Air Force Day celebrations in New Delhi, said Pakistan has no evidence to support its claim, while India had shared images of damage caused to Pakistani targets during Operation Sindoor.He further said that the Pakistani government is making such claims to save face and mislead its public.Pakistan have repeatedly claimed that it downed several Indian fighter jets during Operation Sindoor.""If they think they shot down 15 of my jets, let them think about it. I hope they're convinced about it, and they will cater for 15 less aircraft in my inventory when they come to fight again. So why should I talk about it? Even today, I won't say anything about what happened, how much damage was done, how it happened, because let them find out,"" Sindh said during the press conference.""Have you seen a single picture where something fell on any of our airbases, something hit us, a hangar was destroyed, or anything like that? We showed so many pictures of their places. However, they couldn't show us even a single picture. So their narrative is 'Manohar Kahaniyan'. Let them be happy, after all, they also have to show something to their audience to save their reputation. That doesn't matter to me,"" he added.Earlier in June, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, during an interview with Reuters, had said that India suffered initial losses during the conflict, but declined to give details.""What was important is, why did these losses occur, and what we'll do after that,"" Chauhan had told Reuters, addressing Pakistani claims of downed aircraft.","Congress leader Ajay Rai said, ""The CDS says something, the Army Chief says something else, and different people give different statements in completely different ways"" He further urged the government to bring ""truth and reality"" in front of the country, saying, ""the whole matter should be clarified""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124291851,imgsize-1029301,width-400,resizemode-4/39something-fishy39-cong-seeks-39truth39-about-op-sindoor-flags-39different-statements39.jpg"

CHENNAI: Criticising actor-politician Vijay and his Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) members for first causing a stampede that killed 41 people in Karur on Sept 27, and then abandoning their cadres and followers, Madras HC ordered a probe by an SIT Friday.Citing two accidents involving Vijay’s campaign vehicle, which did not stop even after dashing against the bikes of his accompanying cadres, HC also ordered registration of a hit-and-run case against the politician. “Both the driver and the leader (Vijay) saw the accident but left the place without stopping... This court highly condemns the attitude of the party (TVK)... There was not even a remote sense of feeling expressed by the party taking responsibility for organising such an event. This only shows the mental state of the leader and the party,” Justice N Senthilkumar said.“The SIT will be headed by Asra Garg, IGP (north zone), and comprise Vimala, SP, Namakkal, & Shyamaladevi, SP. Garg is at liberty to select additional members under any category/designation as he deems fit,” said the judge. All CCTV footage from place of the incident, and in particular footage inside and outside the bus carrying the head of the political party, shall be seized.The bus involved shall also be seized, the court said.“In both cases (campaign vehicle hitting two bikes), police have not registered an FIR for hit-and-run. Court expresses its deep anguish and agony that even if no complaint is filed by the aggrieved, state has suo motu responsibility to register a case, bring the perpetrators of the crime on record, and make them face trial,” Justice Senthilkumar said.“Neither the politician nor his followers were there at the scene of occurrence after the incident. The President, the PM, Union home minister, CM of Tamil Nadu , and leader of opposition condoled the incident. This court could not understand how the political party that organised the rally abandoned the scene of occurrence immediately after the incident,” the judge said.“Unfortunately, the organisers, right from the leader... vanished, leaving their own cadres, leaving their own followers, leaving their own fans in the lurch,” the judge said, adding, “Such irresponsible attitude of any politician or organisation can’t be taken lightly. Court owes its responsibility towards its citizens. It is unfortunate to record such leadership quality.”Court prohibited political rallies, roadshows and similar public events along state and national highways in the state until standard operating procedures were formulated.HC also dismissed the anticipatory bail petitions of two TVK members, state general secretary Bussy N Anand and deputy general secretary CTR Nirmal Kumar, who have been named in the FIR in connection with the incident.","Madras HC orders probe by an SIT Friday.

HC, while denying him pre-arrest bail, said, “We have perused the probe papers and, the alleged conversation between Nikam and the complainant. There is a sufficient incriminating material against the applicant to connect him with the crime in question.”“This conduct of the applicant, prima facie, corroborates prosecution case. Considering overall facts and circumstances, I am not inclined to release the applicant on anticipatory bail,” said judge NR Borkar in his March 17 order.","Shaikh, during his stint as additional chief metropolitan magistrate at Ballard Pier court, was involved in a road accident in 2022.

Who Cut the Fuel? Inside the Mystery of the Air India 171 Cockpit Audio

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has declined a request from the pilots’ body ALPA India to include its representative in the team probing the June 12 Air India crash that killed 260 people.“AAIB expressed its inability to include pilots from ALPA as subject matter experts in the team probing the Air India plane crash, citing government norms,” Airline Pilots Association (ALPA) India president Sam Thomas told PTI after the group’s representatives met AAIB DG GVG Yugandhar in the national capital.“There was not much discussion on the Air India plane crash due to the ongoing investigation. We have been given assurance that we would be invited for the quarterly meetings in the future,” Thomas added.ALPA India, an associate member of the global pilots’ body IFALPA, has been demanding that its representative be included in the probe into the aviation disaster that occurred in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. On Thursday, it said the meeting was meant to deliberate on its role as a “subject matter expert” in accident investigations.“ALPA India is optimistic of a positive outcome from this engagement, particularly with regard to participation as part of the investigation into the AI 171 crash.Such collaboration is expected to strengthen investigative processes by incorporating the critical perspective of pilots, thereby contributing to safer skies for all,” the body had stated.The Air India Boeing 787-8 operating flight AI 171 to London Gatwick crashed soon after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 260 people, including 241 passengers. In its preliminary report released on July 12, AAIB said, “Fuel supply to both engines of the plane was cut off within a gap of one second, causing confusion in the cockpit soon after take-off.”On September 22, the Supreme Court called the selective publication of the preliminary report—which outlined lapses on the part of pilots—a “media narrative” and described it as “unfortunate and irresponsible.”","The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) declined a request from the pilots’ body ALPA India to include its representative in the team probing the June 12 Air India crash.

Series of land purchases

Indulging in fraudulent land deals

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor , election strategist-turned-politician and the founder of Jan Suraaj Party, has triggered a political storm in poll-bound Bihar with his explosive corruption allegations against several state leaders. Interestingly, Prashant Kishor, who has often been accused by opposition parties of helping the BJP, has unleashed his tirade against the members of ruling NDA in the state. His targets till now include Bihar's deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary, ministers Ashok Choudhary, Mangal Pandey and BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal.The Jun Suraaj chief has levelled serious allegations against these leaders. The charges against BJP leader and deputy CM Samrat Choudhary include:Minister Ashok Choudhary, whom Prashant Kishor has called ""Bihar’s most corrupt leader"", has been accused of:The leaders in question have denied the charges, but Prashant Kishor has claimed he has papers to prove his allegations against them. The BJP's Bihar unit launched a counter-offensive against Prashant Kishor describing his Jan Suraaj party as ""a political startup based on fraud"". The state BJP has accused PK of raising ""hundreds of crores of rupees"" through ""shell companies"".BJP's state media in-charge Danish Iqbal accused Kishor with indirectly helping the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and asked, ""Why is his party is still receiving funds from states ruled by INDIA bloc parties which had sought his professional help during elections.""""More than Rs 370 crore have come from West Bengal where he had worked for Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress in 2021 assembly polls. Besides, Kishor is getting huge funds from states like Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,"" he alleged.Responding to these charges, Prashant Kishor has dared the NDA leaders to unleash investigative agencies against him. ""The Union home minister and the Prime Minister are from the BJP, let them send investigative agencies to probe charges against me,"" the Jan Suraaj chief said. The Jan Suraaj chief also shared details of his finances to counter funding charges against him and his party.Interestingly, the top BJP leadership has maintained a silence on Prashant Kishor's allegations. Political analyst NK Choudhary feels that the BJP does not want to give credence to PK's allegations by opening a front against him.""For the BJP, the principal opponent in the state as of now remains Lalu and his party the RJD, so they are focussed in their attacks on them. Prashant Kishor has managed to gain a lot of traction, support and also media attention but he is still far away from emerging as the principal challenger to the BJP politically. Any counter action or reaction to Prashant Kishor now would give credence to his allegations and that is perhaps why the top BJP leadership is not reacting to his campaign,"" NK Choudhary says.However, he has a word of caution for the BJP insofar Prashant Kishor's attacks against Nitish Kumar are concerned. ""Nitish Kumar remains the best bet for BJP in Bihar. The electoral gains that NDA makes in Bihar is courtesy the strong image of Prime Minister Modi and the popularity of chief minister Nitish Kumar. If any campaign weakens the chief minister, the NDA as a whole may suffer electorally.""Now, this could be a tricky proposition for the BJP leadership, which may want its own chief minister in the state after playing second fiddle to Nitish Kumar for nearly two decades. In the 2020 elections, the saffron party for the first time became the senior partner in the state alliance winning 75 seats. But the BJP allowed Nitish Kumar, whose party was reduced to 45 seats in the assembly, to continue as the chief minister.However, that may change this time around if the BJP manages to repeat or better its performance. As the NDA partners gear up for the upcoming assembly elections, the top BJP leadership has been reluctant to announce that the next government will be formed under Nitish Kumar. For now, the BJP leaders say that they will contest the elections under Nitish Kumar, which is quite natural as the JDU chief is the chief minister of the coalition government.By levelling corruption allegations against Ashok Choudhary, who is viewed as the right-hand man of Nitish Kumar, Prashant Kishor may be actually piling pressure on the chief minister, who anyway is battling reports of his ill health. Nitish, whose clean image has always stood him in good stead electorally, stands to suffer if a leader of his party and who is perceived very close to him is accused of corruption.Little wonder, the JD(U) immediately swung into action to defend Nitish Kumar. “Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has redefined politics with his honesty and integrity throughout his 20-year tenure. No one has been born who can prove even a single allegation of corruption against him. Those who have been accused of graft should respond. Nitish Kumar is equal to 'Zero Tolerance',” JD(U) chief spokesperson Neeraj Kumar posted on social media a day after after Kishor levelled allegations against Ashok Choudhary.The Jan Suraaj Party has dropped enough hints that it will take these allegations to their logical conclusion. It has submitted a memorandum to the Bihar governor seeking the removal of Samrat Choudhary. Party's national president Uday Singh and Bihar unit chief Manoj Bharti said they have also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claims to be a firm believer in probity in public life. ""We have no hopes from the Nitish Kumar government in the state. If no action is taken by the PM or the Governor, we will move the court as a last resort,"" the Jan Suraaj Party leaders have warned.Clearly, Prashant Kishor has made the Bihar elections interesting by highlighting corruption cases against leaders of the ruling combine. There is a strong possibility that in the run up to elections, he could be targeting more leaders, perhaps from the Mahagathbandhan also. So, the suspense over who is next in his line of fire is unlikely to end anytime soon.(With inputs from agencies)","Prashant Kishor, the founder of Jan Suraaj Party, has triggered a political storm in poll-bound Bihar.

PUNE: The season’s first cyclonic storm over the Arabian Sea has intensified into ‘Cyclone Shakti’ on Friday, the IMD stated. Currently centred about 250km west-southwest of Gujarat’s Dwarka, the system is expected to strengthen into a severe cyclonic storm by Saturday. While forecasters said it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Indian landmass, sea conditions are expected to be rough over the weekend.As of 11.30am Friday, Cyclone Shakti lay over the northeast Arabian Sea near latitude 21.7°N and longitude 66.8°E, around 270km southwest of Naliya, 300km west of Porbandar , and 360km south of Karachi. The system was moving northwestwards at 8kmph and is expected to track west-southwest towards the central Arabian Sea, likely reaching central parts of the north and adjoining central Arabian Sea by Oct 5.“Though the system will intensify into a severe cyclone, it will weaken considerably before nearing Gujarat’s coastline. Rainfall is expected in parts of Gujarat, but no major impact is anticipated in India,” said a weather blogger from Vagaries of Weather.Independent forecaster Abhijit Modak added, “The storm’s remnants may bring some rain to Saurashtra and Kutch.” An IMD official confirmed the storm’s trajectory is away from the Indian landmass and warned that while it won’t directly impact land, rough sea conditions will persist.Fishermen are advised not to venture into the sea.According to IMD, sea conditions are very rough to high over the northwest Arabian Sea and adjoining northeast and central Arabian Sea till the afternoon of Oct 3, turning high to very high between Oct 4-6. Rough to very rough seas are expected along/off Gujarat-north Maharashtra and Pakistan coasts till Oct 5.Meanwhile, light to moderate rain and storms are likely at most places in Madhya Maharashtra & Marathwada on Oct 3-4, influenced by a depression over interior Odisha.","Cyclone Shakti is currently centred about 250km west-southwest of Gujarat’s Dwarka.

Poll Have you or someone you know ever fallen victim to online investment fraud? Yes No

Some transactions layered via ‘fake import of services’

NEW DELHI: Its promoters are based in Russia, technical support in Georgia, its India operations are handled from Dubai and the servers are in Barcelona.Illegal online trading platform OctaFX, which is being investigated by ED for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens over the past few years, has become part of a unique study by the agency into transcontinental operations that convert proceeds of crime into cryptocurrencies and use services of international payment gateways.A multi-agency probe has revealed that OctaFX, which deals in forex, commodities and cryptocurrencies and is incorporated in Cyprus, made Rs 800 crore of alleged proceeds of crime from its India operations in just nine months.Some of the transactions were layered through “fake import of services” from Singapore to launder duped funds generated in India.In a particular case, ED has attached Rs 172 crore worth of assets in India and abroad, including a yacht, a villa in Spain, Rs 36 crore in banks, 39,000 cryptocurrency (USDT), land and Demat holdings of Rs 80 crore.OctaFX, being investigated by the ED’s Mumbai zonal unit, is not the only illegal online platform indulging in investment frauds. The others under probe include Power Bank, being investigated by the Bengaluru zonal unit; Angel One, TM Traders and Vivan Li, being investigated by the Kolkata zonal unit; and Zara FX, being investigated by the Kochi unit. The ED’s cases are based on several FIRs registered by police in different cities.“Cyber frauds in the name of cryptocurrency included Birfa IT and related firms acting as brokers, converting huge amounts of money to and from crypto to help clients send money to China for under-invoiced imports, laundering the PoC (proceeds of crime) through cryptocurrency,” the ED study revealed. The probe further found that in the Birfa case “remittances of Rs 4,818 crore were sent to Hong Kong and Canadian entities controlled by scammers, under the pretext of paying for leasing servers, escrow services, etc” on fake invoices.The ED document estimated that Indians have lost more than Rs 22,800 crore in around 36.4 lakh financial frauds reported in 2024 — a more than 206% jump in estimated losses from Rs 7,465 crore in 2023 and an over 50% jump in number of cases from 24.4 lakh in that year.Investigation against a similar cyber investment fraud found that the masterminds, operating from Laos, Hong Kong and Thailand, hired agents in India to set up shell entities using forged documents and issued fake IPO allotments, stock market investments and indulged in fake digital arrests.PoC was collected in shell companies, converted into cryptocurrencies and remitted overseas as payment for fake “import of services”.While international payment gateways act as intermediaries for many of these illegal transactions, a part of the booty is laundered using hawala channels. In some cases, Enforcement Directorate has found PoC are brought back to India “disguised as legitimate investments” into stock markets.",Illegal online trading platform OctaFX is being investigated by ED for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens.

No contamination found in 9 of 19 cough syrups: Govt

Rajasthan halts supply of all 19 Kaysans meds

BHOPAL/JAIPUR: Alarm bells are ringing over the deaths of 12 children in MP and Rajasthan following complications after use of cough syrups, prompting the Centre to issue an advisory on Friday against prescribing cold and cough medications to children aged below 2.The advisory to all states and UTs by Directorate General of Health Services came even as the Union health ministry claimed that none of samples picked up from MP contained diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol — toxins known to cause severe kidney damage. The samples were collected after there were reports linking the deaths of children from renal failure to consumption of contaminated cough syrups.With the Centre ruling out contamination in the cough syrup samples from MP, the mystery over the cause of kidney failure in children continues. Nine children have died in Chhindwara district over a month, while five are undergoing specialised treatment in Nagpur in neighbouring Maharashtra, said district collector Harendra Narayan Singh.Following deaths of children who consumend cough syrups, Union health ministry claimed that none of samples picked up from MP contained diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol — toxins known to cause severe kidney damage.The suspected link between the deaths and cough syrup had earlier prompted the district administration to impose a ban on two brands as a precaution. Dr Sanjay Mishra, joint director, health services, told TOI that the stock with a Jabalpur distributor, who was supplying the suspected cough syrups, had been sealed.State officials said lab tests of nine out of 19 samples, collected by ICMR and state teams, have shown no signs of contamination, but the report of 10 samples, which include two medicines whose sale has been prohibited for now in Chhindwara, are yet to be received. Authorities are awaiting detailed forensic and biochemical analysis before reaching a final conclusion.The cases, first reported in late Aug, were largely concentrated in Parasia and surrounding villages in the district. Children, mostly under the age of five, initially showed symptoms of cold and mild fever. They were administered cough syrup along with routine medicines. Within days, their condition worsened with reduced urine output and subsequent kidney-related complications.In Rajasthan, three deaths have been reported in the past one week, with many other children developing complications after taking a cough syrup distributed under the state govt’s free medicine scheme. The state health department denies the deaths were linked to the dextromethorphan-based formulation, even though it has banned the syrup’s distribution/sale pending test results and a formal investigation by a three-member committee.While a five-year-old boy died in Sikar district on Sept 29 after his condition deteriorated upon taking the cough syrup, another death was reported from Bharatpur. At least five other children in the two districts also reported similar symptoms — vomiting, drowsiness, anxiety, dizziness, restlessness and unconsciousness.The third case has been reported from Weir town in Bharatpur district, where a two-and-a-half-year-old died on Sep 27 at Jaipur’s JK Lone Hospital. He had been prescribed Amodroxol cough syrup.While the family alleges that their child died after consuming the cough syrup, a fact-finding report by Bharatpur’s chief medical officer says the boy had a previous history of febrile seizures — a convulsive event that accompanies fever and viral infections in children aged between 6 months and five years.The health department is also investigating reports of at children in Banswara reporting complications after consuming cough syrup, between Sept 16 and Sept 30.Since 2012, a total of 10,119 samples of medicines manufactured by Jaipur-based Kaysans Pharma, which supplied the dextromethorphan-based cough syrup that has been blamed for three deaths, have been subjected to quality test, of which 42 have been found to be sub-standard, Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited’s managing director Pukhraj Sen revealed on Friday.As a precaution, the state health department has stopped the supply of all 19 types of medicines being provided by this company until further orders.",12 children have died in MP and Rajasthan following complications after use of cough syrups.

MUMBAI: Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar recounted on Friday how his 13-year-old daughter, Nitara, dealt with sexual harassment while gaming online.A few months ago, while playing an online game that allowed strangers to interact, she was befriended by someone who initially engaged her with friendly messages.“The person started with polite messages like ‘thank you’, ‘well played’, and ‘fantastic’. He seemed like a nice person. After some time, he asked if she was male or female, and when she replied ‘female’, the tone of the conversation changed,” Kumar said. The stranger asked his daughter to send him nude pictures of herself.“My daughter immediately shut down the game and informed my wife. Thankfully, she didn’t hesitate to share what happened,” the actor said, speaking at the inauguration of Cybersecurity Awareness Month at the Maharashtra Police headquarters.The actor said the incident reflects a cybercrime pattern where predators first build trust and then attempt to exploit minors — a modus operandi that often ends in extortion and in tragic cases, suicide.CM Devendra Fadnavis emphasised the importance of reporting cybercrime on helplines 1930 and 1945 within the Golden Hour — which is the hour immediately after the crime has occurred. This, he said, is crucial in cases of cyber fraud, as it improved the odds of recovering stolen money.He said the state plans to raise awareness among school and college students on cybercrime. Fadnavis launched two resources that will be used in this awareness campaign — a documentary on cyber security and a comic book for children called ‘Cyber Warrior’.Fadnavis said the state needed to enhance capabilities to counter deepfakes. He said fraudsters use AI to trick people through phishing, OTP scams, deepfakes, voice and face cloning. “We share personal information on social media and through online transactions and payment platforms. Once cookies are accepted, personal data can be misused, leading to fraud, extortion and cyberbullying,” he said.Also present at the ceremony were actor Rani Mukerji , VJTI dean of R&D and consultancy Dr Farooq Kazi, associate professor at IIT Bombay Manjesh Hanawal, and IAS and IPS officers. Activists working to raise awareness on cybercrime were felicitated.","Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar recounted on Friday how his 13-year-old daughter, Nitara, dealt with sexual harassment while gaming online.

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh High Court has termed right to a dignified death and cremation an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. The observation came Monday in response to a PIL registered suo motu by division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Bibhu Datta Guru over poor state of Muktidham (cremation ground) in Bilaspur’s Rahngi gram panchayat. The pronouncement followed the CJ’s visit to the site for a funeral on Sept 28 when he found the facility in a “pathetic condition”.The bench said a body “deserves a respectable send-off” and the State had a constitutional obligation to provide decent conditions at public funeral facilities. Failure to do so amounted to an abdication of duty. The CJ found several glaring deficiencies, including absence of fencing to demarcate the area, lack of proper road, no sanitation, lighting, shed, or seating for mourners and absence of caretaker, signboard, or helpline.The bench issued an 11-point directive and asked administration to immediately undertake corrective measures, including comprehensive cleaning drives at all cremation/funeral grounds, fencing, installation of water, electricity, toilets, shelters, and seating, provision of firewood/LPG, and functional electric/gas crematoria. HC asked panchayat and social welfare department secretary, chief secretary, and Bilaspur collector to file personal affidavits on state’s roadmap for improving cremation grounds.

Undertrails as % of total inmates

Occupancy & duration of stay

Around three-fourth of all prison inmates in India in 2023 were undertrials, according to the latest report released by NCRB. The numbers are staggering: India has 5.3 lakh people in jail; of them, 3.9 lakh are yet to be convicted — they are on trial.But this is actually an improvement over the previous years. The percentage of incarcerated undertrials in 2021 was 77%. This fell to 76% in 2022, and then to 74% in 2023.Of these undertrials, 150 died while in jail; 64% of them were suicides.The share of undertrials in jail keeps fluctuating, but an analysis of the data for the past 25 years shows it has never dropped below 65%. Several studies have suggested that delays in investigation, shortage of judges, and lack of access to legal aid because of poverty are the main reasons why undertrials end up spending a long time in prisons. There are 3.6 crore pending criminal cases in district courts, 17.5 lakh cases in high courts and 14,667 cases in the Supreme Court.In answer to a Parliament question last Feb, it was revealed that the judge-to-population ratio in India is estimated at 21 judges per million population, which is less than half of what the Law Commission recommended in its 120th report.With so many undertrials in jail, our prisons have also become overcrowded. Although the occupancy rate has improved from 131% in 2022 to 121% in 2023, jails have more inmates than their sanctioned capacity and this has been the case for the past 25 years. Twenty years ago, the situation was even worse as the occupancy rate had touched 145% in 2005. Since then, jails have been equipped to handle 1.9 lakh more prisoners, but that has clearly not been enough.","India has 5.3 lakh people in jail; of them, 3.9 lakh are yet to be convicted.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan HC Thursday ordered the commercial taxes department to release within seven days the full salary and arrears of one of its officers who has been without pay for over a year since slipping into a coma in Aug 2023.HC passed the order after hearing a plea by the officer’s wife. The petitioner’s counsel said the officer, Surendra Singh Chawra from Bhilwara, had been appointed to the department in 2006. He went on to become an assistant commercial tax officer, Pratapgarh circle, after several promotions.“On Aug 7, 2023, he suffered a brain haemorrhage and underwent surgery. He slipped into a coma soon after and remains in that state to this day,” the petitioner’s counsel told HC. The department paid Chawra’s salary for a year after the mishap, until Aug 2024, against pending leaves and other administrative entitlements. Following this, the salary was stopped, and he was classified as “on leave without pay”, the counsel added.Chawra was the sole breadwinner of his family, which included his wife, two kids, and parents, the counsel told HC. Concerned about the family’ plight, a single-judge bench of Justice Ravi Chiraniya told the dept to clear any administrative hurdles in the process of releasing Chawra’s salary.“If one month’s salary is not paid, the whole family suffers adversely. In this case, the employee is in a coma, and the family also faces heavy medical expenses. How will they survive in such circumstances?” the judge asked. “...Since Diwali is ahead, ensure outstanding payment in this case in next 7 days”, the HC order read.","HC passed the order after hearing a plea by the officer’s wife.

'Put Swadeshi Boards Outside Shops': PM Modi's Local Push As More US Tariffs Loom | Ahmedabad

NEW DELHI: The NCERT has rolled out special classroom modules on ‘swadeshi’, tracing its roots from 1905 anti-partition agitation in Bengal to PM Narendra Modi ’s call for a self-reliant India.The publications, ‘Swadeshi: Vocal for Local’ (for middle stage) and ‘Swadeshi: For a Self-Reliant India’ (for secondary stage), revisits the historic movement that urged Indians to shun imported British goods and connects it with govt’s contemporary programmes such as ‘Make-in-India’, ‘Startup India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Vocal for Local’, & ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.The modules cite the PM’s Independence Day address this year, where he described ‘self-reliant Bharat’ as the bedrock of a developed India. They also include his recent interactions with national awardee teachers, where he quipped that while teachers usually assign homework to students, he wished to reverse roles and give teachers “one homework” — to mobilise campaigns with students promoting ‘swadeshi’ products, in line with ‘Make-in-India’ and ‘Vocal for Local’.“The ‘Swadeshi’ movement began during India’s freedom struggle when the British divided Bengal in 1905... ‘Swadeshi’ was not just about boycott but also about creating Indian alternatives such as Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works (1901, Prafulla Chandra Ray) and Tata Iron and Steel Company (1907, Jamsetji Tata),” one module explains.“In 1905, it gave strength to fight colonial exploitation. In 2025, it guides us towards ‘Atmanirbharta’ in a globalised, technology-driven world,” the modules notes, urging research-driven innovation and robust domestic industries in semiconductors, renewable energy, agriculture and AI. Significantly, the texts also introduce a contemporary twist by placing AI at the heart of modern ‘swadeshi’.NCERT underscores that ‘swadeshi’ today is not just a relic of history but a framework for navigating global uncertainties and positioning India as a leading economy.",NCERT rolls out special classroom modules on ‘swadeshi’ tracing its roots from 1905 anti-partition agitation in Bengal to PM Narendra Modi’s call for a self- reliant India. ‘Swadeshi: Vocal for Local’ (for middle stage) and ‘ swadeshi for a Self-Reliant India' (for secondary stage) revisit historic movement that urged Indians to shun imported British goods.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124298274,imgsize-19298,width-400,resizemode-4/books.jpg"

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

Govt using police to silence victims, oppn: Bhim Army chief

MEERUT/BAREILLY: Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon amid fears of unrest on Friday when people will gather to offer juma namaz. According to a govt notification, internet services will remain suspended in Bareilly from 3 pm on Oct 2 to 3 pm on Oct 4.Security has been tightened across four districts in Bareilly division, with heavy deployment of forces on streets and drones in air. Some sensitive areas in the city looked like fortresses, and many roads and lanes in localities remained deserted.City magistrate Alankar Agnihotri said, “Internet will remain suspended for 48 hours, considering the sensitivity of the situation.” The precaution follows last week’s clashes during a procession after Friday prayers over ‘I Love Muhammad’ row. Police resorted to lathi charge to control the situation. So far, over 80 people, including local cleric and Ittehad-e-Millat Council president Tauqeer Raza Khan, his close associates Dr Nafees Khan and Nadeem Khan, have been arrested.On Thursday, Ala Hazrat Association urged the people to offer Friday namaz peacefully and return home promptly.From the Sunni Markaz at Dargah Ala Hazrat, Jamaat Raza-e-Mustafa national vice-president Salman Hasan Khan appealed to imams and the public to maintain peace, avoid rumours and cooperate with authorities. He also requested special prayers during Friday sermons for harmony.In Muslim-majority areas fears of impending action by the administration prevailed. Teams from Bareilly Development Authority are surveying properties to identify violations. Structures without approved maps or violating building regulations will face notices, sealing and demolition.The authority’s vice-chairman Manikandan A said, “Action is being taken at every level against those accused of rioting and their supporters. Every illegal brick will be accounted for. This drive will serve as a lesson to accused and a warning to others who break the law”.In Saharanpur, Chandrashekhar Azad was put under house arrest as he was planning to meet families of those affected in last week’s violence. Azad accused govt of “using police to silence victims and opposition voices” and demanded an impartial probe into the violence.“Following a letter from Bareilly district magistrate, police force from Fatehpur and Dehat police stations were deployed outside Azad’s house in Chhutmalpur area of Saharanpur. His presence in Bareilly might lead to law-and-order issues in that city,” Saharanpur SSP Ashish Tiwari told TOI.On Wednesday, two Congress leaders — Saharanpur MP Imran Masood and former MP from Amroha Kunwar Danish Ali —were put under house arrest to stop them from visiting Bareilly.","Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon.

'Pakistan Could Not Kill Him But...': Father On Kargil War Veteran Killed In Ladakh Clashes

Poll Do you think Ladakh should have more local governance powers? Yes, more autonomy is needed No, current administration is sufficient

LEH: At Martyrs’ Park, about 1km from the Ladakh Hill Development Council (LAHDC-Leh) office, the gate stood open during curfew relaxation. Inside, chairs were stacked and a tent was dismantled. Labourers were quietly loading chairs, tent covers and iron rods into a vehicle, their faces grim.It was here that environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh. “We provide tents on rent. They called us to take it back,” a worker said. Startled at the sight of a reporter, he said, “Please go away, cops will come and we will be in trouble.”A woman entered with her child. “I was on hunger strike on Sept 24 when the situation worsened outside,” she said. “Out of fear, some of us ran in different directions. My husband later picked me up. I came back to collect my belongings.”On Sept 24, security forces opened fire on protesters demanding Sixth Schedule status, killing four and injuring dozens. Wangchuk called off his hunger strike hours later. Authorities said the police fired in self-defence after protesters tried to set ablaze a vehicle carrying security personnel.Police also claimed that without CRPF deployment, “the whole of Leh would have burnt”.Outside the park, another woman voiced her anger. “Why were people fired upon? Four people are dead. Will they give us Sixth Schedule?”About 1km away BJP’s Ladakh office, which was set on fire, was under heavy guard with spools of concertina wire around it. Cops prohibit photography of the building.At the LAHDC-Leh office, the main gate was open but there was no one there. “Since Sept 24, chief executive officer Tashi Gyalson and others haven’t come to office. In fact, no one comes,” a peon said.Mustafa Ladakhi, 36, a PhD from JNU, is among a growing number of Ladakhis at the country’s top universities concerned about home. At a hotel near Leh airport, he said the region is still in shock.“On Sept 24, my mother was on a hunger strike led by Wangchuk. There was chaos when she called me. I found her in the middle of the road. I will never forget the pain that day brought to Ladakhis,” he said. “No official has stepped down. There is no empathy. There is no apology. Instead, we are accused in the national media of destabilising the central govt... How can we be a threat when we have paid with our lives for the nation?”He argued that UT status without statehood had buried local governance under bureaucracy. “Instead of empowering local govt, we have the lieutenant governor’s office and its bureaucracy, commissioner secretaries, the DC’s office, and the police bureaucracy. They have nothing to do in Ladakh. All we see is pomp and a show of bureaucracy... Allow us to govern ourselves,” he said.“When we were part of J&K, AFSPA was never extended to Ladakh because govt knew we were Indian nationalists. Why this labelling now?” he asked.Ladakhi’s friend, a hotel owner, said, “I don’t want to talk about tourism. This is a colossal tragedy. Four deaths in a place like Ladakh are like 400 in Delhi. Sept 24 will remain etched in our memory.”In Upper Tukchal area of Leh, Rigzin Wangmo Lachic, president of All Ladakh Hotel and Guest House Association, echoed similar sentiments and demanded a judicial inquiry. “The events have shattered us and left a wound on our collective soul,” she said.At a hotel serving Kashmiri wazwan on Oct 1, during curfew relaxation, the receptionist from Doda said he no longer felt safe. “I’ve been here 10 years and never faced hostility. But after the lieutenant governor described workers from Doda and Nepal as ‘external forces’ responsible for the crisis, we are not stepping out much.”As curfew returned, shops shut ahead of the 6 pm deadline. “We comply with every direction. But govt must fulfil our four demands, including Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Gelek Punchok, 42, a member of Leh Apex Body, said. Punchok was outside the district jail, with many others, to receive around 26 prisoners released Thursday after they were given bail. Many of the released detainees said they had nothing to do with the Sept 24 violence but stated that they were with the “peaceful” struggle for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.","Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath Singh warns Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region.

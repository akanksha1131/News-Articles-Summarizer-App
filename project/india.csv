When will the PM speak up?"" the grand old party's national spokesperson said in a post on X on Saturday.This came after Trump said that Pakistan and US were set to discuss trade in next week noting that he ""wouldn't have any interest in making a deal with either if they were going to be at war with each other.""""I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India, we're dealing with Pakistan, and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade as opposed through bullets. You know, normally they do it through bullets. We do it through trade. So I'm very proud of that. Nobody talks about it. But we had a very nasty potential war going on between Pakistan and India. And now, if you look, they're doing fine,"" he said.In a series of posts noting the number of times Trump took credit for the truce, which is at least thrice in the past 24 hours, Ramesh said, ""Donaldbhai keeps repeating the same sequence of events of how he got the 4-Day India-Pakistan war to stop - US intervention and the use of the trade instrument to stop nuclear escalation.""""The equivalence of India and Pakistan gets reiterated yet again. President Trump's Commerce Secretary has made exactly the same claims in his submission to the New York-based Court of International Trade on May 23rd. But Donaldbhai’s friend Mr Narendra Modi continues to ignore his claims with absolute silence. Why doesn't the PM speak up? Is President Trump also doing what Mr. Modi does all the time and so well (i.e. lying)? Or is he speaking even 50% truth?"" he added.While Trump's recent claims have not drawn a categorical denial from New Delhi, the ministry of external affairs has consistently maintained that the India-Pakistan ceasefire was a bilateral decision, and there have been no trade discussions with the United States related to or following Operation Sindoor.","Congress leader Jairam Ramesh stepped up his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding answers on US President Donald Trump's continuous claims that he used trade as a war deterrent.

NEW DELHI: An email threat received by secretary, ministry of heavy industries warning of the use of “suicide IEDs” in Udyog Bhavan, prompted an alert on Friday afternoon, though a search mounted by the Delhi Police and CISF eventually found it to be a hoax.Udyog Bhawan is located in a high-security area of the Capital that houses Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House and key Central government offices.An email dated 30.05.2025 was delivered to secretary, heavy industries, with a threatening message about the use of suicide IEDs on Udyog Bhawan premises and asking that they the building be evacuated by 3.15 pm. This prompted the ministry of heavy industries to inform the Delhi Police, which rushed its personnel and bomb disposal squad there. Sources told TOI that CISF, which secures Udyog Bhavan, was not simultaneously informed about the email and possibly learned of it when the Delhi Police arrived there.CISF eventually also received a formal letter from the ministry of heavy industries, with the threat email attached. A look at the email prima facie led the CISF to view it as part of the pattern of similar email threats received over the past couple of months warning of bomb attacks in different high-value buildings across the country, but which were later found to be a hoax.These email threats, suspected to be originating from the same IP address outside the country, have a common link – the mention of the “unjust arrest” of Tamil YouTuber Savukku Shankar, though the sender is careful to also bring in the “unjust hanging” of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru and “custodial death” of 2G accused Shahid Balwa.Anyway, not wanting to leave anything to chance, CISF along with Delhi Police conducted a thorough search of the Udyog Bhawan premises, even though no evacuation was carried out to avoid panic among the people. After floor-by-floor search of the area, the CISF declared the premises to be safe and ruled out the presence of any IED.Similar email threats were received earlier, warning of bomb threats at the Mapusa deputy collector’s office in Goa on April 3, the Jaipur collectorate on April 4, the Taj Palace Hotel and Chhatrapati Shivaji airport terminal in Mumbai on May 17 and the Punjab and Haryana High Court premises on May 22. All were found to be a hoax.","An email threat received by secretary, ministry of heavy industries warning of the use of ‘suicide IEDs’ in Udyog Bhavan prompted an alert on Friday afternoon.

'Pakistani abroad often use Indian names to hide identity'



'IMF must see how its loans to Pakistan are being used'



'Opium was trafficked from Pakistan into Punjab'



'Pakistan has to be called out for atrocities'



NEW DELHI: Former minister of state for external affairs MJ Akbar, part of the all-party delegation led by BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, strongly criticised Pakistan during an address to the Indian diaspora in Copenhagen on Saturday.Calling Pakistan a ""double-faced"" nation, Akbar questioned, “Which face do we talk to?” He described Pakistan’s government as having a ""forked tongue"" and said its approach to dialogue is nothing but a “bluff.”Speaking at the event, Akbar declared, ""Even well-meaning friends will ask you, why don't you talk to Pakistan? Tell them Pakistan has a government with a double face, which face do we talk to? Pakistan has a government with a forked tongue; whose tongue do we address?""""Pakistan talks with a poisoned tongue that gets hurt when a tongue is poisoned. The talks are nothing but a bluff. We now have a leader who has actually called the bluff, Narendra Modi... Nobody has made as much effort to bring a nation with a genetic disorder to its senses,"" he added.The delegation led by Ravi Shankar Prasad, includes BJP MP Daggubati Purandeswari, Samik Bhattacharya, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, Congress MPs Ghulam Ali Khatana and Amar Singh, former Union Minister MJ Akbar, and Ambassador Pankaj Saran.Akbar further referred to the recent Pahalgam terror attack and drew comparisons with instances of communal terrorism in Europe.""The recent Pahalgam terror attack was a brutal form, barbaric form of communal terrorism of the kind that Europe had also witnessed...The remarks that they made were enough to show that the mission that the delegation Prime Minister has sent is having an impact,"" Akbar noted.Further, addressing the Indian diaspora, BJP MP Samik Bhattacharya said the delegation’s main goal was to raise global awareness about terrorism. He also pointed out that many Pakistani businesses abroad often avoid revealing their Pakistani identity.""We are not seeking help from anyone with folded hands. We are going everywhere in the world - and we have only one objective: to alert them that what is happening with us is bound to happen with them. Hence, this terrorism must be uprooted. Every Pakistani knows what they are; they can't even open a shop in the name of Pakistan outside their country, they use Indian names, Bhattacharya said.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi emphasised Indian unity against Pakistan, referencing her party's historical stance.She said, ""I am from the same Shiv Sena that dug up the cricket pitch to not allow Pakistan to play a cricket match in India and with the same commitment, I'm part of the joint delegation that has come from all political parties to say that as Indians we stand one and nobody can divide us.""Chaturvedi additionally questioned the IMF's decision to provide financial aid to Pakistan, suggesting the funds were misdirected to Pakistani disruptors outside the venue. ""As we were coming here, we saw some flags, and you all would know what those flags are. And I thought to myself, the IMF loan is coming in handy, and I hope those who are giving them the IMF loan realise what it's being used for,"" she added.During the event, Manish Prabhat, India's Ambassador to Denmark, addressed anti-India protests by a small group outside the venue where the Indian parliamentary delegation was present. Criticising the protesters, Prabhat said, ""This community is unlike the community, a representation of which you saw outside on the street. And we know that how much amount they have been paid to put their duty here.""He commended the Indian diaspora in Denmark for their constructive contributions and successful cultural assimilation.Congress MP Amar Singh expressed apprehension regarding Pakistan's role in cross-border terrorism and drug trafficking activities. He called for unity amongst Indians when dealing with such external challenges.""In Punjab, especially after 1971, what happened was that opium was used to be sent from Pakistan. Punjab is the centre in North India for transporting drugs to Delhi and other parts of India. And I'm an eyewitness to those things. As a child, as a school student, then college student, and now for the last eight to ten years, again, as an eyewitness, that drugs and weapons are coming through drones,"" he said.He noted the recent recovery of numerous drones carrying narcotics and weapons in Punjab's border villages. Discussing previous terror incidents, he stated ""When we know the reality that our neighbouring country, Pakistan, is doing this thing, how can we be quiet on this issue? And this issue has to be shared, and we all want to share with the international community that the issue of terrorism is now very serious. And in India, you will all remember Mumbai and then Pulwama, Uri, Pathankot and now Pahalgam. We all have to be united, oppose it. Terrorism is bad. Drugs are bad, weapons are bad, it damages the society.""Earlier on Friday, former Danish Ambassador to India Freddy Svane praised the delegation's efforts to raise global awareness about terrorism. He supported their initiative to communicate the importance of unified action against terror.Svane backed India's position regarding Pakistan, emphasising the necessity for joint action against terrorism, stating ""Pakistan has to be called out for atrocities."" Speaking to ANI, Svane said, ""We have this all-party delegation visiting Denmark is just really securing that we not only are listening but we also talk and we have a dialogue, and now it's time for us to stand shoulder to shoulder to take action.""The Indian delegation in Copenhagen during the visit engaged with several former Danish MPs, including Freddy Svane (former Danish ambassador to India), Manu Sareen, Helle Degn (vice president of the Mandela Center), and Niels Ahlmann-Ohlsen (now CEO of Strategic Alliance International ApS). The discussions aimed to boost bilateral relations and promote mutual cooperation.During their visit, the delegation also met with Christian Friis Bach, Chairperson of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, and Danish MP Trine Pertou Mach. The group also attended a luncheon interaction hosted by the Indian Ambassador, where they exchanged ideas with former Danish parliamentarians.","Former minister of state for external affairs MJ Akbar strongly criticised Pakistan during an address to the Indian diaspora in Copenhagen on Saturday.

Then their handlers in Pakistan must have told them, ""What are you doing? Do something!"" So out of desperation, they came here.

We're very pleased to learn that that statement has been withdrawn as you've also mentioned, and we are also very pleased that you, as representatives of the people of Colombia, are determined to stand with us for our sovereignty, for peace in the world, for peace in the subcontinent of India and that you are very, very happy that this kind of dialogue will continue between our peoples and our representatives. ""Taranjit Singh Sandhu, former Indian ambassador to the United States and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, said that the delegation's comprehensive briefing was instrumental in prompting Colombia to reverse its stance.""This morning we had a detailed interaction with the acting Foreign Minister and our leader and the entire team made specific points to them explaining to them the timeline which perhaps to an extent they might have missed out. The end result was that they are withdrawing one of the other statements which had come out and have promised and stated, actually quite clearly, on terrorism and the issue. The importance of Colombia, apart from other reasons, is also that it will be a member of the Security Council soon,"" he said.Noting that Colombia understood India's position as it was once plagued by terrorism, BJP MP Shashank Mani said, ""It is notable that terrorism has affected Colombia as well. However, after a long struggle, Colombia is now a peaceful country. We have come here with a message of peace. We have clearly stated that we will give a fitting response to every terrorist attack, and when it is over, we want nothing but peace.""Tharoor voiced disappointment during a press conference in Bogotá on Thursday over Colombia’s stance. He noted that India was disheartened by the Colombian government’s decision to offer condolences for the casualties in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, instead of expressing solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism,"" said Tharoor.""We will say to our friends in Colombia, there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them. There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. We are only exercising our right of self-defence, and if there is any misunderstanding here, on this core, we are here to dispel any such misunderstanding"", he added.Tharoor is heading the multi-party delegation on a tour across the Americas as part of India’s global outreach to emphasize its zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism.

Amul's widely publicised launch of ""India's first liquid infant formula"" has outraged activists who have complained to the government that it is a violation of the Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) Act. The Act prohibits the promotion of any breastmilk substitute meant for children below two years of age.The launch of Amul's liquid ready-to-feed infant milk substitute and its coverage in the media highlighted its convenience, particularly describing it as ""ideal to carry"" and ""good for working mothers"". ""Such framing directly positions the product as a substitute for breastfeeding and this action as promotion,"" argued public health activists who have complained to the secretaries of the women and child development ministry, the health ministry, the CEO of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), and chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.In response to the objections, Amul tweeted: ""Amulspray is one of India's oldest and most trusted infant milk food brands and is in complete compliance of the IMS Act..."".Public health advocates argued that Amul's actions constitute a clear case of promotion of an infant milk substitute - an act explicitly prohibited under Section 3(c) of the IMS Act, which states: ""No person shall... take part in the promotion of infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles or infant foods"".The law also prohibits having any pictures or other graphic material or phrases designed to increase the saleability of infant milk substitute or infant food. Amul's use of a teddy bear graphic on the product's label could be considered a breach of this provision, they stated.The complaint has demanded an enquiry into the launch and promotion of Amul's product, immediate removal of the graphic of a teddy bear from the product label, media guidelines for IMS-compliant reporting and strong enforcement of the IMS Act.","Amul's widely publicised launch of ""India's first liquid infant formula"" has outraged activists.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): Deadline to file income tax returns extended from July 31,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2025-26-deadline-to-file-income-tax-returns-extended-from-july-31-check-new-date/articleshow/121438210.cms,"ITR Filing 2024-25: 10 Key Updates You Need To Know Before Filing Income Tax Return

Advantage taxpayers

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025. This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121438242,imgsize-1565741,width-400,resizemode-4/121438242.jpg"

India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines, broadening its defense ties beyond the US as it faces mounting security challenges and looks to shore up its indigenous aerospace capabilities, a Bloomberg report said. Senior officials told Bloomberg that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will evaluate these proposals, with the aim to start the project swiftly.The countries in talks-UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s Safran, and an undisclosed Japanese partner-are all offering technology transfers and potential co-production arrangements, according to people familiar with the matter. Rolls-Royce offered to jointly produce and transfer technology to India during a visit by senior defense ministry officials to the UK in April, while Safran is reportedly open to sharing intellectual property rights, the Bloomberg report said.India’s push to diversify its fighter jet engine partnerships signals a strategic rebalancing in its defense policy. For decades, India’s defense ties leaned heavily on Russian suppliers, with growing partnerships with the US in the past decade. However, India’s decision to explore new partners highlights a shift: an urgent focus on reliability, supply chain security, and technological self-sufficiency amid global uncertainties.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh warned at an industry event on Thursday that delays in acquiring critical weapons “pose a serious challenge to national defense readiness,” adding bluntly, “Not for a single project that I can think of that has been completed on time.” His remarks underscore why India is moving beyond a single-source approach, especially after penalties were imposed on General Electric for delivery delays on engines that power India’s locally-made Tejas light combat jets.India’s military modernization push has been a long time coming, with delays plaguing every step of the way. Singh’s remarks-“once a timeline is given… not a single project that I can think of has been completed on time”-reflect growing impatience within India’s defense establishment.State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) has faced flak for delays in delivering Tejas Mark-1A jets, forcing the government to pivot to private sector involvement to speed things up. The new execution model for the AMCA is a radical shift, designed to harness private innovation and global expertise while ending HAL’s monopoly on fighter production.India’s ambition is to power its twin-engine fifth-generation fighter jets-currently under the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) project-with engines co-developed or built domestically in collaboration with global partners. The AMCA program is part of India’s larger vision to modernize its aging, largely Russian-made air force fleet and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.Defense minister Rajnath Singh has approved a new “execution model” for the AMCA, which for the first time allows private sector firms to bid for the project alongside the HAL. Officials say the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), which is leading the project, will soon issue an expression of interest to domestic and international players.The project’s significance is clear: China’s rapidly advancing J-20 and rumored sixth-generation jets have raised alarm bells in Delhi. Meanwhile, Pakistan is set to acquire at least 40 Chinese J-35A fifth-generation fighters. With only 30 active fighter squadrons against an authorized strength of 42, India needs to catch up-and quickly.Michael Rubin, a South Asia analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, described India’s drive as part of a “broader effort to secure the supply chain for critical defense equipment.” He noted that the “military lesson from Ukraine’s war has been clear: self-sufficiency and reliable partnerships are paramount.”Meanwhile, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh emphasized in his CII Business Summit remarks, “We need to quickly get our act together… while design in India continues to produce results in the near future or maybe later, what is required today is required today.”India’s defense collaborations are moving from traditional vendor relationships to true joint development. Rolls-Royce, for example, offered to share cutting-edge engine technology, while Safran has expressed willingness to co-create intellectual property within India-key for India’s ambitions to be more than just an assembly hub.Japan, too, has signaled openness to deeper defense industrial ties, aligning with India’s vision of a broader Indo-Pacific security network. Defence minister Rajnath Singh held talks in May with his Japanese counterpart, exploring potential collaborations in tank and aero engine development.These moves do not indicate a cooling of India-US ties-joint manufacturing of GE’s F414 engines is still a cornerstone of Indo-US defense cooperation. But delays in that deal have prompted India to cast a wider net, underscoring that while Washington remains a top partner, India wants alternatives to hedge against risks.Indeed, India’s engagement with the UK, France, and Japan is about more than just hardware-it’s about building strategic resilience in the defense sector. A senior official involved in the negotiations said the goal is not to sideline US defense ties but “to ensure we have multiple options, as this is about national security.”India aims to finalize the AMCA’s prototype phase by developing five aircraft before moving to series production.For the first two AMCA squadrons, India will rely on the US-made GE F414 engines. But for the remaining five squadrons-over 100 jets-it wants more powerful 110-kilonewton engines built with technology partners outside the US, according to officials.India’s broader defense transformation, its AMCA program, and its engagement with multiple global players highlight a fundamental truth: for New Delhi, defense self-reliance and resilient supply chains are no longer optional-they are non-negotiable in a rapidly changing world.","India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines.

What’s at stake for Turkey

What’s next

(With inputs from agencies)

Turkey’s much-hyped Bayraktar TB2 drones, hailed as revolutionary weapons in conflicts from Ukraine to Libya, have suffered a devastating reputational blow after Pakistan’s Turkish-origin drone fleet failed spectacularly during Operation Sindoor. Indian forces, using indigenous Akashteer air defense systems, shot down every single Turkish-origin drone in the May conflict, leaving the Turkish defense industry scrambling to defend its once-prized exports.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long touted Turkish-made drones as a symbol of his “Islamist vision” and a centerpiece of Turkey’s defense ambitions. The drones were not only instruments of hard power but also a diplomatic tool for Turkish influence in Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. But as India’s Akashteer system intercepted Pakistani drones with 100% accuracy, Turkey’s arms export ambitions took a direct hit.Also read: Turkish drones to Chinese missiles, India beat them all This collapse of performance-described by a senior Indian officer as “not a single drone achieving its objective”-has raised fresh doubts about Turkish drones’ battlefield credibility and the broader promise of Turkey’s defense industry.Pakistan’s military imported hundreds of Turkish drones, hoping to overwhelm Indian air defenses and showcase Turkish technology as a regional power equalizer.Instead, the attack ended in humiliating defeat. Indian Air Defence officers confirmed that 300-400 Turkish drones, including Byker YIHA III kamikaze drones and Turkish-origin micro-drones like Songatri and eYatri, were neutralized in mid-air before they could even scratch Indian defenses.A Pakistani source told Reuters that Turkish drones were meant to provide cover for manned aircraft and artillery strikes, but “the drones failed to reach targets” as India’s integrated air defenses, from legacy L70 guns to cutting-edge Akashteer radars, kicked in.Michael Rubin, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, minced no words: “Erdogan may offer a hard sale to promote his Islamist vision or simply to enrich his family, but the product he is selling is now subpar. Just as socialism stymies development as bureaucrats fail to adjust for competition, so too does nepotism ruin industries. Baykar, knowing it had full state support, simply stopped innovating effectively. ”Pakistani officials have tried to downplay the losses, insisting they are re-evaluating drone deployment strategies. But the magnitude of the failure is hard to hide: Indian Air Defence sources say they recovered hundreds of drone parts along the border-clear evidence of Turkey’s failure to deliver.The real star of this clash? India’s homegrown Akashteer system. Developed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Akashteer integrates seamlessly with Indian Army and Air Force radars. It automates threat detection, tracks targets, and assigns weapons in real time-a feature that proved decisive in the face of Pakistan’s drone swarm.“It didn’t roar or flash - it listened, calculated and struck with precision,” an official told PTI. “Every threat was intercepted, every target neutralised.”This level of precision is no fluke. Indian officers compared Akashteer’s performance to Israel’s Iron Dome, noting that while Iron Dome specializes in missile defense, Akashteer has shown exceptional versatility against low-flying drones and loitering munitions.For Turkey, the reputational hit goes beyond this one conflict. The Bayraktar TB2 had become the face of Turkish defense sales, with celebrated success stories in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and early phases of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But cracks were already showing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted last year that “those or other drones can help, but do not affect the result,” as Russia’s electronic warfare systems jammed Bayraktar drones.The India-Pakistan clash has underscored these vulnerabilities, exposing Turkish drones as poorly adapted to modern electronic and radar-dense battlefields.This is not the first time that battlefield performance has shattered weapons myths. In 1982, Israeli Air Force F-15s and F-16s downed over 80 Soviet-built Syrian MiGs without losing a single plane-an outcome that punctured the myth of Soviet invincibility in Arab states. Analysts say Turkey is facing a similar reckoning now.“Any African despot or Central Asian country still purchasing Turkish hardware should recognize they risk wasting hundreds of millions of dollars,” Rubin warned.For President Erdogan and his son-in-law’s company Baykar, the India-Pakistan conflict is more than just a marketing setback. It’s a blow to Turkey’s entire narrative of self-sufficiency and regional influence.Analysts are already warning that countries in Africa and Central Asia that relied on Turkish drones may now look elsewhere. China and the US remain key players in the global drone market, and Turkey’s stumble has opened the door for rivals to push their systems as more reliable and battle-proven.As Pakistan rebuilds its airfields and grapples with the aftermath of this clash, Turkey’s defense industry is facing questions that go well beyond the battlefield. In Africa, Somali and Libyan leaders had turned to Turkish drones to prop up their regimes. In Ethiopia, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed used Bayraktar drones to devastating effect against Tigray forces. But after this fiasco, prospective buyers may pause-fearing that the Turkish drones they once saw as cost-effective alternatives to Western systems may be little more than paper tigers.Meanwhile, India’s success with Akashteer has emboldened its push for indigenous defense technology. Smit Shah of the Drone Federation India said that India plans to triple its drone investments in the next two years-leveraging the lessons of Operation Sindoor to build a robust domestic drone and counter-drone ecosystem.","Turkey's much-hyped Bayraktar TB2 drones have suffered a devastating reputational blow.

More than two years and eight months after a 19-year-old receptionist was murdered in cold blood, the gavel finally fell. Resort owner Pulkit Arya, along with Saurabh Bhaskar and Ankit Gupta, was sentenced to life imprisonment.For those who had followed the case, one that had stunned Uttarakhand and the nation, it was a grim vindication. The verdict, delivered by the additional district and sessions judge, came after a painstaking trial involving around 100 witnesses of which 47 were produced in court with their testimonies stretching over nearly three years.The charges were as damning as the headlines that once blazed across national media. The trio stood convicted under multiple sections of murder, destruction of evidence, criminal conspiracy, and sexual harassment. The court also found them guilty under the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, lending judicial weight to early suspicions that the Vanantra Resort in Rishikesh, where the victim worked, was a front for something far darker.One witness didn’t mince words, calling the resort “a den of vice.”The girl had only been 19, employed at a property owned by Pulkit Arya, son of a now-expelled BJP leader. In the weeks before her death, she had reached out to those she trusted. A former colleague and a close friend both later revealed she had confided in them - terrified, desperate, and deeply uneasy. She told them she was being pushed to provide “special services” to an incoming VIP guest.“She wanted to escape from there,” said an officer from the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which later took over the probe.But she never got the chance. On September 18, 2022, she was killed for refusing those demands. Her body surfaced six days later, dumped in the Chilla canal. The crime, horrifying in its brutality and made more incendiary by the accused’s political connections, lit a fuse of public outrage. Protests broke out across the state. A high-level investigation was ordered.At the centre of it all was the SIT, led by DIG P Renuka Devi. Their investigation produced a 500-page chargesheet. The evidence was exhaustive: about 100 witness statements and 30 pieces of documentary proof. Yet, it was two voices that ultimately helped crack the case wide open - the victim’s confidantes. Her friend and the ex-employee both confirmed what she had feared: the resort was not what it seemed, and she was desperate to leave.Initially, much of what was known came from WhatsApp chats with her friend, some of which were later leaked online. But investigators discovered she had also spoken to the former employee, warning them about the illegal activities at the resort and her fear of being forced to serve a powerful, unnamed VIP.Senior officers later confirmed that narco-tests were requested for the accused in hopes of identifying this shadowy figure. His name, even today, remains unknown.When the day of the verdict arrived, Pauri Garhwal’s courtroom was transformed. Security was tight. Officers from nearby districts were brought in. The area around the courthouse was designated a “zero zone” - a perimeter of 100 metres where only government staff and approved attendees were allowed entry.Outside, emotions overflowed. Soni Devi, the victim’s mother, broke down as she addressed the media. “May the criminals be sentenced to death,” she told ANI. Her words rang heavy with grief and fury, echoing the pain that first gripped Uttarakhand back in 2022 and the demand for justice that never wavered.","Pulkit Arya, Saurabh Bhaskar and Ankit Gupta sentenced to life in prison.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra police have launched a probe against a senior doctor in Latur for allegedly directing a colleague to ""kill"" a Covid patient during the pandemic in 2021.According to officials, the probe follows the release of an audio clip of a conversation between the accused, Dr. Shashikant Deshpande, and Dr. Shashikant Dange on social media platforms.Dr Deshpande was then posted as additional district surgeon at the Udgir Government Hospital in Latur, while Dr Dange, who was posted at a Covid-19 care centre, news agency PTI reported.In the conversation, Dr Deshpande was heard saying, ""Don't allow anyone to go inside, just kill that Dayami woman,"" To this, Dr Dange responded cautiously, noting that oxygen support had already been reduced.The patient, Kausar Fatima, wife of Dayami Ajimoddin Gaussoddin (53), had later recovered from the disease.After a complaint, the Udgir city police filed an FIR against Deshpande on May 24 under legal provisions for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings and other offences.As per the FIR, the complainant said that in 2021, during the pandemic, his wife Kausar Fatima (then aged 41), tested positive for Covid.She was admitted as an inpatient at the government hospital in Udgir on April 15, 2021, and Covid treatment was being provided in a building opposite an eye hospital on Nanded Road, under the management of the hospital. Dr Dange was treating Covid-19 patients at that centre.The woman remained admitted there for 10 days. Around the seventh day of her admission, her husband was sitting beside Dr Dange while he was having lunch.At that moment, Dr Dange, who received a call from Dr Deshpande, placed the phone on speaker and continued the conversation regarding hospital matters.During the call, Dr Deshpande enquired about bed availability.When Dr Dange informed him that there were no vacant beds, the man claimed that he distinctly heard Dr Deshpande saying, ""Kill the Dayami patient. You're used to dealing with such people."" He also allegedly made a caste-based slur during the conversation, as per the man's complaint.The man said he was shocked, but chose to remain silent at the time since his wife was still undergoing treatment. A few days later, his wife recovered and was discharged.However, on May 2, 2025, the audio clip of the purported conversation surfaced on social media.The man said hearing the same disturbing remarks again deeply hurt him and offended his religious sentiments, especially the alleged use of derogatory caste-related comments, following which he lodged the police complaint.According to officials, Deshpande's statement has been recorded and his phone has been seized.According to inspector Dilip Gade, the police were verifying the authenticity of the audio clip.""He is out of district and will come tomorrow. After that, we will collect his mobile phone and conduct an inquiry,"" Gade said.","Dr Shashikant Deshpande allegedly directed a colleague to ""kill"" a Covid patient during the pandemic in 2021.

Salman Khurshid praises Article 370 move; BJP questions if Congress will 'turn on him' like Tharoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salman-khurshid-praises-article-370-move-bjp-questions-if-congress-will-turn-on-him-like-tharoor/articleshow/121519903.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday questioned whether the Congress would now target senior leader Salman Khurshid for what it called “speaking an inconvenient truth” after party leader Shashi Tharoor faced backlash from within the grand-old party for supporting the Centre over Operation Sindoor stance.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya, in a post on X, pointed to Khurshid’s remarks during the ongoing multi-party MPs delegation tour, saying they signaled cross-party support for the government's actions in Jammu & Kashmir and a firm stand on India’s sovereignty.""Mr Khurshid’s stance reflects bipartisan support for the Centre’s actions in Jammu & Kashmir, underscoring a broader sense of national unity against cross-border terrorism and a strong reaffirmation of India’s territorial integrity,"" Malviya said.""Will the Congress now turn on him for speaking an inconvenient truth, just as they did with Shashi Tharoor? Or is Tharoor being punished simply for daring to challenge the Gandhi camp’s chosen candidate for Congress President?"" he asked.Former external affairs minister Khurshid, who is in one of the 7 all-party delegations to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called Article 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated and it was finally put to an end,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation in the election. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people who want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir,"" he added.This comes after Tharoor faced criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks, not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.Tharoor's ""India breached the LoC for the first time during the 2016 surgical strike"" remark prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed the LoC and the International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicising the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.","BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya, in a post on X, pointed to Khurshid’s remarks during the ongoing multi-party MPs delegation tour.

DGCA gives 'last & final' 3-month extension to IndiGo for 2 Boeing 777s wet leased from Turkish Airlines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-gives-last-final-3-month-extension-to-indigo-for-2-boeing-777s-wet-leased-from-turkish-airlines/articleshow/121519413.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has given “one time last and final three-month extension” to IndiGo for the two wide body Boeing 777s it has wet leased (hired with operating crew) from Turkish Airlines. The airline can use them till Aug 31, instead of Nov 30, 2025, as it had applied for. The DGCA gave this final extension “in order to avoid passenger inconvenience due to immediate flight disruption” after getting an “undertaking from the airline that they will terminate the damp lease with Turkish Airline within this extension period, and not seek any further extension for these operations,” said a senior aviation official.“Indigo is currently operating two Boeing 777-300 extended range aircraft under damp lease from Turkish Airline, which was permitted upto May 31, 2025. IndiGo requested for a further extension of the same for another six months, which was not agreed to. However, in order to avoid passenger inconvenience due to immediate flight disruption, IndiGo has been granted a one-time last and final extension of three months,” said the official.Turkey’s steadfast supported to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, apart from Pakistan using Turkish drones to attack Indian cities near the western border, has led to a rethink in New Delhi. India had a fortnight back revoked the security clearance of Turkish ground handling company Celebi which led it from being barred at the nine Indiana airports where it used to operate. DGCA’s Friday ruling comes in that backdrop.IndiGo had requested Indian aviation authorities to extend the lease period by another six months for two Turkish Airlines’ wide body Boeing 777 which the budget carrier uses on routes between Delhi/Mumbai and Istanbul. IndiGo has since early 2023 used these wet leased (hired with operating crew) Turkish planes to operate a daily direct between Delhi & Istanbul and Mumbai & Istanbul. Turkish has the same two daily routes, with no more room for any more flights between the two countries under current bilaterals that Turkey has unsuccessfully tried with the Modi govt to be revised upwards for some years now.IndiGo since 2018 has a code share with Turkish. A significant number of passengers on Turkish and IndiGo flights fly between India and rest of the world via Istanbul on Turkish network — something that hurts Air India’s multi billion dollar plan for providing direct connectivity to & from India. In the past, AI has frowned at the long term wet lease of wide body aircraft done by IndiGo.On the Turkish wet lease issue, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said Friday: “We operate under the ambit of the air service agreement between India and Turkey. A large number of passengers, mostly Indians, are booked on these flights (to & from Istanbul) to travel between India and other countries (via Istanbul). The (wet lease) is as per regulatory approvals and we will be in conformity with those requirements.”",IndiGo had requested Indian aviation authorities to extend the lease period by another six months for two Turkish Airlines’ wide body Boeing 777 which the budget carrier uses on routes between Delhi/Mumbai and Istanbul.

Seema Praharis

JAMMU/NEW DELHI: BSF dismantled 118 Pakistani forward posts and surveillance networks along the Jammu frontier that will take years to be repaired, Union home minister Amit Shah said Friday, lauding the force for its tenacious response to Islamabad’s aggression in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor Shah was speaking while meeting BSF troopers in Jammu’s Poonch, his first visit after Operation Sindoor to J&K, where he also vowed to leave “no stone unturned” for Amarnath Yatra from July 3 to Aug 9 with full security measures and facilities.“When Pakistan responded to our anti-terror operations by attacking our borders and civilian areas, it was the BSF jawans of Jammu frontier who retaliated,” Shah said, referring to the May 7 strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan after terrorists killed 26 people, mostly tourists, on April 22 in Pahalgam.Commending the “(border sentinels)” for “knocking down Pakistan’s surveillance systems one by one” and which the adversary may take at least 4-5 years to reinstall”, Shah highlighted that this done in “just three days (May 7 to 10)”. He attributed this to information BSF had discreetly gathered through keen observation of Pakistani border posts during peacetime.“Pakistan has suffered the biggest blow to its communication systems and surveillance equipment.This proves that even during peacetime, you (BSF) kept a vigilant eye... Based on your accurate intelligence, a precise counter-strategy was prepared well in advance. When the opportunity arose, you implemented it with success,” Shah said amid cheers from the jawans.Lauding BSF personnel deployed in Jammu, Rajouri and Kutch for “guarding the border with utmost alertness, dedication and valour”, Shah said he was among them to convey the gratitude of the country’s 140 crore citizens. “When the enemy commits any type of aggression on the international border, BSF, being the first line of defence, is the first to take it on its chin,” Shah said.The home minister was accompanied by J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, Union home secretary Govind Mohan and other top officials. “In any situation -- be it snow-clad areas, desert, deep forests, swamps or mountains, for 365 days a year and 24 hours a day, BSF personnel remain in position, vigilant, and dedicated. No attack can cause much damage within the hinterland, as the first line of defence is always the chest of a BSF soldier,” Shah said.Shah also addressed a gathering in Poonch town after distributing appointment letters to family members of those killed in recent Pakistani shelling. At least 13 civilians, including three minors, died in Poonch alone. The govt will soon unveil a separate package for shelling-affected families, Shah said, adding 90,000 bunkers have been built along LoC and more will be set up to protect civilians.“I admire the courage of the people of Poonch and its administration for the way they responded to Pakistani shelling,” Shah said. The minister contrasted the Pakistani shelling on civilian areas in J&K, including religious sites, with India’s precise and targeted strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan when Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7.Referring to last month’s Pahalgam attack, Shah lauded the J&K people’s unity against terror. “India under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi has sent a clear message that any attack on civilians will not be tolerated and will be responded to more effectively and with accuracy. Terror and trade cannot go together. Blood and water cannot flow together. This is our policy and we will fight every terrorist activity on our soil,” Shah said.Chairing a security review meeting in Jammu late Thursday in the presence of LG Sinha, Shah reaffirmed enhanced security for the 38-day-long Amarnath Yatra. Union home secretary Mohan, Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, J&K chief secretary Atal Dulloo and J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat were among top officials who attended the meeting.“Evaluated security arrangements and preparedness meant for the pilgrims.

""If one has not preferred an appeal in the higher court, his right to stay in India is forfeited.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday directed the National Board of Examinations (NBE) to conduct the NEET-PG exam in one sitting for all 2.4 lakh candidates instead of the scheduled test in two shifts in 900 centres across India on June 15.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Kumar and N V Anjaria said it was not ready to accept that the body conducting the examination could not find enough centres to accommodate all candidates in one shift. ""Holding the examination in two shifts is arbitrary and does not allow candidates to have the same question paper. Any two different question papers will vary in their difficulty levels,"" the bench said.When counsel for NBE said the norm in IIT-JEE was to have multiple sets of question papers and then apply normalisation of marks according to difficulty levels of questions, SC said normalisation of marks could be adopted only in exceptional circumstances and not routinely year after year.It directed NBE to set up an adequate number of additional examination centres to conduct NEET-PG in one sitting. When the counsel said the process for identifying additional secure examination centres could result in postponing the June 15 exam date, the bench said if the authorities require postponement of the test for finding more centres, it would have to seek permission from the court.","The Supreme Court on Friday directed the National Board of Examinations to conduct the NEET-PG exam in one sitting for all 2.4 lakh candidates instead of the scheduled test in two shifts.

There is nothing like wealth that

Brings the insignificant to prominence.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.A friend and co-speaker, Raja, has often shared a deeply personal episode from his youth. He was then unknown, and without means. A wedding in the family required financial help, and he turned to a wealthy relative with a humble request for Rs. 5,000.He was told to wait outside the house. And so, he waited—from 11 in the morning—under the harsh sun, parched, hesitant to step away for a sip of water. Hours passed. Finally, at 5pm, household help emerged—not with help, but with a verdict: “You are not lucky enough to receive support.” That day, Raja said, the truth struck him with greater force than the sun above—This truth does not apply to individuals alone but in the fate of nations as well.After nearly two centuries of British rule and another seven decades of struggles, India is now poised to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. According to IMF reports, India’s nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by the end of the year, slightly ahead of Japan’s $4.18 trillion. If this momentum continues, India may overtake Germany and claim the third spot by 2028.This ascent has not been easy. For generations, India has been a cautionary tale of lost wealth and squandered dignity. When the British arrived, India held 23% of the global economy which reduced to less than 4% when they left. The famed Industrial Revolution of England was built on the ruins of Indian craftsmanship. India’s wealth funded the British empire, its taxes paying the British officials, its famine feeding their fortunes. Historians estimate that between 15 and 29 million Indians died from starvation during British rule, much of it linked directly to exploitative policies.Even in the 1960s, we were staggering under the weight of poverty. Food shortage forced us to seek grain aid from countries like the United States. Former CIA official Bruce Riedel’s book cites letters written in 1962 from Indian leadership to John F Kennedy pleading for advanced fighter jets, transport aircraft, and supersonic air forces, as India was losing ground to China in a border war. Kennedy refused the request—gently, but firmly.From seeking food and defence aid to now becoming the world’s fourth economic power is a journey steeped in struggle and silent grit.Economists may credit reforms and policies but the efforts of its people—especially the young—should also be credited. With a median age in the early 30s, India is more open to adopting change and new technology than societies like Japan, with a much older population.Among the new revolutions in technology, the UPI remains my favourite. Nearly a decade ago, I attended a meeting with the creators of UPI—then a nascent idea under the Reserve Bank of India. It felt like science fiction when they spoke of a future where every payment will happen via mobile phones.Today, it’s part of everyday life. Last year alone, India saw over a billion UPI transactions. On a street corner,, a 72-year-old idli vendor, refuses to extend credit when customers say they have no change. “You can GPay, RuPay or PhonePe—but please pay,” she says. She never went to school. That is the India we are becoming.There is still a long way to go. The per capita GDP of Japan is over $33,000, while India’s still hovers below $3,000.Saint poet Valluvar did not limit his wisdom to spiritual wealth but also material wealth, and gave the most prudent advice about earning prosperity.","After nearly two centuries of British rule and another seven decades of struggles, India is now poised to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. For generations, India has been a cautionary tale of lost wealth and squandered dignity. Last year alone, India saw over a billion UPI transactions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121518845,imgsize-68178,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/121518845.jpg"

PUNE: The first batch of 17 women National Defence Academy (NDA) cadets passed out Friday, scripting a new chapter in the annals of the Indian Armed Forces.Unlike previous parades during their three years at the academy, when they had a separate contingent, the 17 marched with male cadets at the Pune academy's Arun Khetarpal Parade Grounds, indistinguishable from their military crew haircut and confident stride.The passing-out parade (PoP) marked a culmination of the hard work, determination, motivation and high standards of physical fitness. The women, part of a total of 336 cadets who passed out, celebrated later with a ""push-up"" competition.Former Army chief and Mizoram governor V K Singh, who reviewed the parade, described it as a unique moment in NDA's history. ""These young women are the inimitable symbol of nari shakti, embodying not just women's development but women-led development. I envision a future not far from now when one of these women rises to the highest echelon of the service they go to. The moment shows the uniqueness of the NDA as we could not distinguish male and female cadets during the parade,"" said Singh, who passed out of NDA in 1969.Academy Cadet Captain Udayveer Singh Negi, who commanded the parade, echoed the views. ""The women cadets performed well. They outshone male cadets in many aspects,"" Negi said.The hours-long rehearsals for the parade in scorching heat and rain culminated with impressive results, said Ishita Singh, one of the women cadets. ""PoP is one of the most important events in military life. I always wanted to celebrate this occasion in front of my parents and dear ones. Today, I could fulfil my wish,"" Ishita told TOI.According to NDA commandant Gurcharan Singh, when girls first came to the academy, they were staying separately. ""Today, they are integrated completely with squadrons and battalions. They are running, playing and training together. Every activity is gender-neutral,"" Gurcharan said.The parents could not be more delighted. ""My daughter is not only mine now. She is the daughter of the nation. She is our only daughter. When she decided to join NDA, we supported her. She was inspired by her grandfather, who had served in the Army,"" said Ashok Mehalan, father of cadet Sheetal Mehalan and businessman from Rohtak in Haryana.According to C Sangwan, father of cadet Ishita, his daughter has given him ""a new identity"". ""When we got to know about entry for women in NDA, we asked her to submit her form 20 days before the exam. She cleared it. Today, she proved her mettle and made us very proud,"" said Sangwan, who hails from Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan.Ajit Duhan, father of Ritul Duhan, the first Battalion Cadet Captain of the women's batch, fell ""short of words to praise her achievement"".

'Not a binary choice': SC quashes Bombay HC order to demolish park to revive 100-year-old lake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-a-binary-choice-sc-quashes-bombay-hc-order-to-demolish-park-to-revive-100-year-old-lake/articleshow/121527009.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Friday greenlighted Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai's theme garden that came up at the site of the more than 100-year-old Khajuria lake in Kandivali (West), overturning a 2018 judgment of the Bombay HC directing the Maharashtra government and MCGM to demolish the constructions and restore the lake.However, SC asked MCGM to maintain and preserve the existing park as a green area in perpetuity, exclusively for public use without any predominant commercial activity. The park serves as a vital recreational nucleus for children, offering them safe spaces for play and physical activity; provides senior citizens dedicated areas for walking and social interaction; and creates opportunities for community engagement and leisure. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh also directed MCGM to ""constitute an expert committee within three months to explore the feasibility of developing an alternative water body in nearby areas to compensate for the ecological functions of the original water body"".Writing the judgment, Justice Kant further asked MCGM to undertake a comprehensive exercise within a year for the ecological restoration of water bodies that are dying, and file compliance reports before HC.It requested HC ""to see that the directions issued by the SC are complied with in letter and spirit"".Interestingly, HC's 2018 judgment was passed by a bench of which Justice A S Oka, who retired recently as an SC judge, was a part. The case lingered on in the SC, with the verdict finally delivered five days after Justice Oka's retirement. Allowing MCGM's appeal, the bench said though HC's views were well-intentioned and, prima facie, a correct interpretation of settled notions such as the public trust doctrine, they required reconsideration through the ""prism of practical realities and evolved ground conditions"". Justice Kant said, ""There cannot be a simplistic binary choice between a park or a pond, as each serves distinct ecological and social functions contingent upon specific circumstances, geographical location, and evolving usage patterns"".The verdant recreational park that came up over the so-called lake, one that had been reduced to a garbage dump over the years and could not support flora and fauna, is now a well-maintained urban oasis, teeming with mature trees, as the appeals are being finally decided more than 15 years after it came up at the site, he added. ""It provides an essential green space in an increasingly concretised urban environment, with trees and other foliage contributing significantly to oxygen generation, air purification, and microclimate regulation,"" the bench said. Implementing HC's directives at this stage would engender consequences that contravene the very environmental principles they sought to uphold.",The Supreme Court Friday greenlighted Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai's theme garden.

Terming Shukla's remarks ""scathingly scandalous"", the bench said, ""No doubt the Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech, but at the same time, this right is subject to reasonable restrictions specified under Article 19(2) of the Constitution.A person cannot be permitted to make allegations defamatory and contemptuous in nature which brings the highest institution in judiciary to disrepute.""SC directed its registry to lodge a suo motu criminal contempt case against Shukla and the YouTube channel. SC sought Shukla's response and posted further hearing in July.SC sought the assistance of attorney general R Venkataramani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who said Shukla's comments were defamatory and contemptuous. The bench directed the YouTube channel to take down the video and restrained social media platforms from exhibiting the clip.In SC's judgment punishing advocate Prashant Bhushan for contempt in 2020, a three-judge bench, of which Justice Gavai was a part, had said, ""If a scathing attack is made on judges, it would become difficult for them to work fearlessly and with the objectivity of approach to the issues.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand is pursuing a free trade agreement (FTA) purposefully with India for which negotiations were launched earlier this year, visiting Deputy PM and foreign minister Winston Peters said Friday.Peters discussed with his counterpart S Jaishankar issues related to trade, economy, defence and security in a bilateral meeting, while unequivocally condemning the Pahalgam terrorist attack and expressing solidarity with the people of India.They also affirmed their shared commitment to a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.Speaking at the Ananta Centre later, Peters said that FTA talks were continuing with a real meaning now and described it as a breakthrough in economic ties with India. Differences remain over tariffs on dairy products though and the minister said he was aware of the concerns of the dairy industry in India.""Despite India's economic scale, it remains our 12th largest partner in trade, accounting for just 1.5% of our exports. We are determined that we're going to work to change that. Our strengths, from food and beverage products to agriculture, forestry, horticulture, education and tourism, are world-class. And our innovation in areas like outer space and renewable energy will find a welcome partner in India,"" said Peters, describing India as an emerging geopolitical giant. Peters added, ""we are not in it to enrich ourselves, we are in it to enrich both peoples"".Peters said that enhancing defence security with India remained a top priority in the Indo-Pacific.","New Zealand is pursuing a free trade agreement (FTA) with India for which negotiations were launched earlier this year.

With India having resolved its 2020 border standoff with China in Ladakh, Russia is pushing India to restart the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral mechanism. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said an understanding had been reached between India and China on how to ease the situation on the border and it's time now for the revival of the RIC troika.""I would like to confirm our genuine interest in earliest resumption of the work within the format of troika - Russia, India, China - which was established many years ago on the initiative of Yevgeny Primakov (former Russian PM), and which has organised meetings over 20 times at the ministerial level since then, not only at level of foreign policy chiefs, but also heads of other economic, trade and financial agencies of three countries,"" said Lavrov, speaking at a conference, as per Russia's TASS agency.Lavrov is likely to take up the issue with Indian authorities during his upcoming visit to India. As TOI had reported on May 26, the Russian minister is likely to travel to India in June to finalise the agenda for the upcoming India-Russia summit that will see President Vladimir Putin visiting India for the first time since the Russia-Ukraine war started in Feb 2022.The Russian agency also quoted Lavrov as saying that Nato is blatantly trying to lure India into anti-China intrigues.""I have no doubts whatsoever that our Indian friends, and I say this based on confidential conversations with them, obviously see this trend that can be actually deemed as a large provocation,"" Lavrov said.India last hosted a meeting of RIC foreign ministers in a virtual mode in Nov 2021. The minister had then pledged to strengthen cooperation under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) saying the group played a constructive role in securing peace and sustainable development, advancing regional cooperation and consolidating ties of good-neighbourliness and mutual trust.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday affirmed the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation's decision to cancel allotment of 125 acres of land in Sultanpur to Kamla Nehru Memorial Trust (KNMT), named after Congress politician Rahul Gandhi's great grandmother, saying a huge tract of industrial land was allotted without evaluating benefits to the public.Dismissing KNMT's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said that though the land was allotted in 2003, the trust failed to make timely payment of the cost of the land and kept seeking ""unwarranted concessions, including waiver of interest and rescheduling of dues"". It also cancelled the subsequent allotment of the same land to Jagdishpur Paper Mills.Terming KNMT a chronic defaulter, the bench said, ""UPSIDC's action in treating KNMT as a defaulter was, therefore, both justified and necessary to preserve the integrity of the allotment process. Allowing such deliberate defaults to persist unchecked would undermine the entire framework of land allocation and set a detrimental precedent.""Writing the judgment, Justice Kant faulted UPSIDC for not following the public trust doctrine in allotment of lands. ""While we have upheld the cancellation due to KNMT's default, the circumstances reveal systemic concerns in the original allocation process. UPSIDC allotted the land to KNMT within merely two months of application (in 2003), raising questions about the thoroughness of the evaluation.Furthermore, during the pendency of this dispute, UPSIDC demonstrated remarkable alacrity in considering alternative allotments to Jagdishpur Paper Mills Ltd,"" it said.Justice Kant said the public trust doctrine required that allocations must be preceded by a thorough assessment of public benefits, beneficiary credentials, and safeguards ensuring continued compliance with stated purposes. None of it was enforced while allotting the land to KNMT or the paper mill, the bench said and cancelled the allotment to the paper mill.SC said, ""UPSIDC ought to have considered verifiable evidence of economic benefits, employment generation potential, environmental sustainability, and alignment with regional development objectives to demonstrate that the decision serves the collective benefit.""""The failure to adopt transparent mechanisms not only deprived the public exchequer of potential revenue, as evidenced by the substantial appreciation in the value of such a large tract of land, but also created a system where privileged access supersedes equal opportunity. This betrays the fiduciary relationship between the State and its citizens,"" it said.SC directed the UP government and UPSIDC to ensure that all future land allotments must be made in a transparent, non-discriminatory and fair manner, and fetched maximum revenue while achieving the larger public interests - industrial development, environmental sustainability and regional economic objectives.",Supreme Court: UP nixing land allotment to Kamla Nehru Trust justified.

MUMBAI: Property experts estimate a free sale component of roughly 140 million sq ft to be unlocked by the Dharavi redevelopment plan, yielding revenues of Rs 1.2-1.7 lakh crore for the joint venture between the state government and the Adani group Said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group, ""At a rough estimate, the Dharavi redevelopment project presents the builder with about 140 million sq.ft. of overall saleable area for sale on the open market, with a separate allotment for rehabilitation of the current inhabitants. We are roughly looking at over Rs 1 lakh crore of gross revenue. The anticipated profit margins are anywhere between 18-25%. It is also important to note that the Dharavi redevelopment project permits the developer to monetize TDR, or Transferable Development Rights, as well as commercial spaces. ''Nav Bharat Mega Developers is a special purpose vehicle between the Adani Group and the state for Dharavi's revamp. Total rehab cost including housing units for eligible beneficiaries and other for affordable rental housing is projected at Rs 95,790 crore, of which construction cost will be Rs 23,800 crore. This factors in the cost of building and handing over 72,000 units free of cost (residential rehab units, residential renewal units, commercial and industrial rehab units and commercial renewal units).Since 270 acres have been demarcated as net developable area, all the land left over after providing 72,000 units will be available to develop in the free sale component.Pankaj Kapoor, MD of Liases Foras, a realty research firm, said he expects profit margins to be 25-30%. ""This is on a projected revenue of Rs 1.2 lakh crore to Rs 1.7 lakh crore from the sale component at average market price of Rs 25,000 a sq ft,'' he added.""Projected saleable area is expected to range between 40.7 million sq ft and 60 million sq ft, depending on extent of FSI utilized for the rehabilitation portion,"" said Kapoor.However, he cautioned that the project's seven-year completion timeline was ""highly ambitious''. ""To stay on track, achieving annual sales of approximately 6.5 to 9 million sq ft will be a challenge and necessitate highly competitive pricing,'' he said.Architect Alan Abraham said at Rs 95,000-plus crore, the Dharavi project is cheaper than the bullet train, only 3x the cost of Mumbai Metro 3 and 6x the cost of the coastal road. ""It seems really inexpensive to transform our city centre, to better the lives of millions of our citizens. If the development of Dharavi is so important to our city, then I wonder why the government couldn't just do this themselves - while keeping these and the additional lands public, and earning all the revenue from the TDR,'' he said. ""In my opinion, the sale price of the Dharavi project will exceed those in Bandra-Kurla Complex, and perhaps even Linking Road,'' he added.Aditya Thackeray, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader, said the Adani Group was given incentives for this project in the form of 1,300 acres across the city free. ""BMC is being denied a premium of Rs 7,500 crore for its land and the TDR incentive."" He said the MVA government showed a better model of redevelopment for BDD chawls through a government agency.","Property experts estimate a free sale component of roughly 140 million sq ft to be unlocked by the Dharavi redevelopment plan.

This also helps explain, sources said, why the 11th anniversary of the Modi govt passed without large-scale events or publicity campaigns.","PM Narendra Modi has twice taken top central government bureaucrats by surprise by flagging public grievances that had reached him directly.

BENGALURU: Congress in Karnataka is heading into a critical phase as internal tensions between CM Siddaramaiah and deputy, DK Shivakumar , escalate, raising concerns about the stability of the govt and the party's long-term prospects, reports Manu Aiyappa Kanathanda.At the heart of the conflict is the unresolved issue of a change of guard. An unwritten understanding is believed to have been reached when Congress formed the government in May 2023 - that Siddaramaiah would serve as CM for two-and-a-half years, after which Shivakumar would take over. If honoured, this transition would take place in Nov.However, with no official word from party high command and no signs of preparation for a handover, the issue is becoming increasingly contentious. Both netas remain indispensable to Congress in Karnataka - Siddaramaiah with his Ahinda (backward classes, minorities and Dalits) clout and administrative experience, and Shivakumar with his fundraising abilities and control over the organisation. Buoyed by loyal support, Siddaramaiah is showing no signs of stepping aside. Instead, he is consolidating his position and intends to serve a full term, sources say.This has left Shivakumar's camp testy. The latest face-off was the transfer of engineers from the water resources department which he oversees. Shivakumar's decision to record his displeasure in writing marks a significant shift. Sources say the move signals a deliberate attempt to assert his position.""The fact that he put it in writing is a message to the party,"" said a senior Congress functionary. ""He's not going to remain passive as the CM strengthens his grip.""It is said Shivakumar views the reassignments as an effort to weaken his administrative authority. The timing of the rift, too, is significant. ""Siddaramaiah believes these developments are part of a larger plan to push him out. His focus now is to prove that his leadership remains strong and that he can withstand political and personal attacks,"" said an MLA from Bengaluru.","Internal tensions between CM Siddaramaiah and deputy, DK Shivakumar, escalate.

Bhutia said a body was seen floating in the river, but an operation to look for the missing was hampered due to inclement weather and heavy currents in the river.The identity of the deceased was yet to be ascertained, he added. Itishree's elder brother Sishir Nayak, who was travelling in another vehicle at the time of the accident, said Itishree, along with her children, brothers, and sisters, travelled to New Jalpaiguri from Jajpur Road by train on May 25 to visit Sikkim.The missing included Itishree, her 20-year-old son Sahil, her brother Ajit Nayak, and his wife Sunita, said Sishir. Family sources said Itishree had pushed her son Sairaj out of the vehicle before it plunged into the river. Ajit did the same to save Supratim.

'Supporting one simple idea called India': Salman Khurshid's message amid Centre vs opposition over all-party outreach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supporting-one-simple-idea-called-india-salman-khurshids-message-amid-centre-vs-opposition-over-all-party-outreach/articleshow/121525421.cms,"Salman Khurshid

NEW DELHI: Former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid on Friday showed his displeasure over opposition's remarks on MPs supporting the Centre with his statements on Operation Sindoor While interacting with the Indian community in Indonesia's Jakarta, Khurshid said that all-party MP delegations are not supporting each other's parties but a ""simple idea called India. """"India is waiting to be great. Nobody can distract us or interfere with that passage of ours. That is why it is important for us to show our strength. If there is any sense in Pakistan, they will understand our only demand: give up terrorism,"" the Congress leader said.""Some of my colleagues are not from the ruling party. The ruling party could have come alone to bring this message, but they came with us to give India's message... However, sadly, this is not what we hear from India. Somebody is saying that he is supporting the BJP or the Congress, but I am proud that we are here together because we are not supporting , we are supporting one simple idea called India,"" he added.This comes after Shahshi Tharoor and Khurshid found themselves in crosshairs with Congress for their remarks during the trip.Earlier in the day, Khurshid, who is in one of the 7 all-party delegations to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 ""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave an impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated and it was finally put to an end,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think Tanks and Academia""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation.There's an elected government in Kashmir today and therefore for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir,"" he added.Earlier, Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks—not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.The controversy erupted after Tharoor reportedly stated in Panama that India breached the LoC ""for the first time"" during the 2016 surgical strike. This prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LoC and International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicising the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.","Khurshid said that all-party MP delegations are not supporting each other's parties but a ""simple idea called India"" The former external affairs minister said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan needs to understand that the ""dangerous game"" of terrorism that it has been playing since 1947 is over, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Friday, demanding that Islamabad hand over terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar to India for justice.Stressing that PM Modi has made it clear that another terrorist act on Indian soil will be treated as ""act of war"", Singh said Operation Sindoor was India's ""frontal assault"" against terrorism and if Pakistan resorted to ""anything evil or unethical"" again, it would face the Indian Navy 's ""firepower and ire"" this time.""India will not hesitate. It will use every method to root out menace of terrorism. Even methods that Pakistan cannot think of,"" he said, addressing officers and sailors on board aircraft carrier INS Vikrant off the coast of Goa.The minister went on to say that the last time the Indian Navy swung into action, Pakistan was divided into two in 1971.""If the Indian Navy had come into action in Operation Sindoor, then I think Pakistan would have been divided into four parts,"" he said, in the presence of top officers like Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi and Western Naval Command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay J Singh.Several Indian warships and submarines led by INS Vikrant, with its MiG-29K fighters, were forward deployed in a dissuasive deterrent posture in the northern Arabian Sea, at the time IAF and Army launched deep precision strikes against nine terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK on May 7.It bottled up Pakistan Navy within its own shores in a defensive mode.Singh once again rebuffed Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif's suggestion of bilateral dialogue to cover all issues, reiterating that talks could take place only on terrorism and PoK.","Rajnath Singh: Pakistan needs to understand that the ""dangerous game"" of terrorism that it has been playing since 1947 is over.

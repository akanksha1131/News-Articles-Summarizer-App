Voiding our own orders will weaken court's authority: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/voiding-our-own-orders-will-weaken-courts-authority-sc/articleshow/125602727.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday turned its critical gaze on its own functioning. On the growing trend of benches overturning orders of earlier ones within days or months of them being pronounced - such as on the menace of dog bites, retrospective environmental clearance, Bhushan Steel Ltd's insolvency and the ban on fire crackers - the apex court observed ""painfully"" that the practice would ""undermine this court's authority"".In another instance, though it was done through a curative petition filed against SC's 2021 verdict on the dispute between Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Reliance Infrastructure's Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd (DAMEPL), the court had overruled the judgment last year, quashing the Rs 7,687-crore award in favour of DAMEPL.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih said that public confidence in the judiciary would be undermined if cases were reopened and special benches set up to re-hear them at the behest of parties aggrieved by the verdicts.Quoting Justice Robert Jackson, it said, ""We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.""""In the recent past, we have rather painfully observed a growing trend in this court (of which we too are an indispensable part) of verdicts pronounced by judges, whether still in office or not and irrespective of the time lapse since the pronouncement, being overturned by succeeding benches or specially constituted benches at the behest of some party aggrieved by the verdicts prior in point of time.To us, the object of Article 141 of the Constitution seems to be this: the pronouncement of a verdict by a bench on a particular issue of law (arising out of the facts involved) should settle the controversy, being final, and has to be followed by all courts as law declared by SC,"" the bench said.It said that if a verdict was allowed to be reopened, the very purpose of enacting Article 141 (law declared by SC is binding) would stand defeated. The court passed the order while hearing a plea seeking relaxation of bail conditions for an accused who was directed not to leave Kolkata during trial of a murder case. The court noted that he had filed an application after the retirement of the apex court judge who had imposed the condition, and dismissed his plea.The bench held that judicial discipline, propriety and comity demanded that a succeeding bench of different judges defers to the view expressed by the earlier bench, unless there was something so grossly erroneous on the face of the record or palpably wrong that it necessitated a relook in exercise of inherent jurisdiction either through a review or curative petition. ""...As judges of this court, we are alive to the position that overturning a prior verdict by a later verdict does not necessarily mean that justice is better served,"" the bench said.""However, with an over looming sense of dissatisfaction and remorse, we propose not to walk that path. While it is true that in a case of the present nature - where an issue of a citizen's right to move freely throughout the territory of India is involved - the principle of finality may not be applied strictly against the party whose right has been so restricted, but the antecedent facts in the light whereof the restriction is imposed assume significance and must, of necessity, bear serious thought. Any restrictive order of the nature under consideration has to be and must be premised on some worthy reason,"" the bench said.","Supreme Court turned its critical gaze on its own functioning.

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

New Labour Codes: Why will your take home pay go down?

Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages.

and payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of their total CTC, or meet the government-specified percentage.

This adjustment will lead to higher contributions as both PF and gratuity calculations are based on an individual’s basic pay .

. Whilst this change ensures enhanced retirement benefits for workers, it also means reduced take-home pay, as the increased contributions will come from the existing CTC.

The regulation concerning basic salary aims to stop organisations from intentionally maintaining low basic salary whilst increasing allowances to reduce their obligations towards retirement benefits and gratuity.

Currently, PF contributions are set at 12% of the basic salary, whilst gratuity payments are determined by the final basic pay and tenure at an organisation.

New labour Codes: Impact on Take-Home Salary

New Labour Codes: Top points to know

.

New labour codes 2025: In a significant move, the government has notified the new labour laws that may require companies to ensure that the basic salary makes up at least 50% of the total cost-to-company (CTC). This could potentially prompt changes in how pay packages are structured. As a result, for many employees, take-home pay could come down over time as contributions to retirement savings are likely to rise.With the new labour codes, the Narendra Modi government has unified 29 labour-related central laws into four extensive Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020), and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020). Starting November 21, 2025, these Codes seek to simplify regulatory compliance, enhance worker safeguards, and modernise India's workforce regulations in accordance with contemporary economic conditions.The Code on Wages became operational on Friday, with the government expected to announce detailed rules within the next 45 days. Companies will need to restructure their salary frameworks to comply with these new regulations.According to experts, employees might receive reduced take-home pay under the new rules, as both provident fund and gratuity contributions would increase within the existing CTC framework.""The new labour codes unify the definition of 'wages' under the Code on Wages and Social Security. This would mean better retirement security through higher gratuity and provident fund but a possible dip in take-home pay if employers restructure allowances downward to offset costs,"" Suchita Dutta, executive director of the Indian Staffing Federation was quoted as saying by ET.The standardisation of wage definitions across labour codes ensures uniformity in computing social security benefits.""Wages now include basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance; 50% of the total remuneration (or such percentage as may be notified) shall be added back to compute wages, ensuring consistency in calculating gratuity, pension and social security benefits,"" explains Anjali Malhotra, partner at professional services firm Nangia Group.According to Puneet Gupta, partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, the implementation of labour codes could result in increased gratuity payments since calculations will be based on ""wages"", encompassing basic salary and all allowances, excluding HRA and conveyance allowance.The new labour codes introduce universal minimum wages for all employees across organised and unorganised sectors, replacing the earlier system that covered only about 30% of workers.A statutory floor wage will be set by the government based on minimum living standards, and no state can fix wages below this benchmark.A uniform definition of wages now applies, where basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance together must account for at least 50% of total remuneration.The codes mandate gender equality, prohibiting discrimination in hiring, wages, or employment terms for similar work, along with universal wage payment coverage that ensures timely payments and prevents unauthorised deductions for employees earning up to ₹24,000 per month. Overtime compensation must be paid at twice the normal rate.Several compliance and enforcement reforms are included as well. Decriminalisation of offences replaces imprisonment with monetary penalties for first-time violations, and compounding of offences allows certain fines to be settled without prosecution.The threshold for government approval of lay-offs, retrenchment, or closure has increased from 100 to 300 workers, with states allowed to raise it further.Work-from-home is formally recognised in services sectors based on mutual agreement, while dispute resolution will be handled by two-member tribunals for faster outcomes.A mandatory 14-day strike notice aims to prevent sudden disruptions and includes mass casual leave within the definition of a strike.The codes extend social protections to new categories, requiring aggregators to contribute 1–2% of annual turnover towards gig and platform workers’ social security (capped at 5% of their payments).Fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after just one year of continuous service instead of five.The inspector-cum-facilitator system introduces randomised, technology-driven inspections to reduce harassment and improve transparency. Compliance is simplified through digitisation of records, as well as a streamlined one license, one registration, one return system.Employers must issue formal appointment letters detailing job roles, wages, and social security.The codes also expand labour flexibility and reduce burdens on small units.Night shifts for women are permitted in all establishments with their consent and safety measures. Contract labour rules include an all-India licence valid for five years.Factory thresholds have been raised to 20 workers for units using power and 40 for those without, reducing compliance requirements for smaller factories.Finally, working hours remain capped at 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week, with flexible weekly structures allowed through mutual consent.","Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of their total CTC, or meet the government-specified percentage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125516988,imgsize-41896,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-code-impact.jpg"
EC empowered to conduct SIR; we will fix flaws if needed: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-empowered-to-conduct-sir-we-will-fix-flaws-if-needed-sc/articleshow/125602065.cms,"EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar

CJI cites Bihar, says no impact on ground

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday emphatically said the Election Commission is statutorily and constitutionally empowered to conduct the pan-India Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls and that it would not stall the process, while assuring that it would order corrective measures, if any irregularities were brought to its notice.CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi rejected arguments questioning the justification of SIR, with the former saying not a single objection was filed against the updation of electoral rolls after the process was fine-tuned at the apex court's instance.Appearing for RJD MP Manoj Jha, senior advocate Kapil Sibal commenced arguments questioning SIR's constitutional validity, saying there are millions of illiterate people who can't fill voter enumeration forms, which have become a tool for exclusion.""Why should a voter be asked to fill an enumeration form at all? Who is EC to determine whether a person is an Indian citizen or not? Aadhaar card mentions the place of residence and date of birth, which should be enough for persons above 18 years to get enrolled as voters if they give a self-declaration that they are Indian citizens,"" Sibal argued.CJI Kant said, ""Sibal, you have experience of contesting elections in Delhi, where many people do not vote.But in rural areas, elections are a festival. There, everyone is concerned about their votes. A maximum number of people participate, and everyone knows who a resident of the village is.""Senior advocate Kapil Sibal said such an exercise had never been conducted in India because the ethos of our 'Poorna Swaraj' mantra from the freedom struggle days was inclusionary, not exclusionary. Justice Bagchi said, ""It is a matter of record that in 2012 and 2014, the number of voters exceeded the total adult population. Is it not necessary to correct the electoral roll? If EC has a doubt about someone's citizenship, is it not entitled to inquire about it? If EC carries out an aggressive revision of the electoral roll, there will be deletions. ""CJI Kant said the SIR of Bihar's electoral rolls was a prime example. ""Initially, the court was told that crores of voters are being deleted. We issued certain directions to streamline the process. Eventually, what happened? Among the deletions from the voter list were those found to have died or migrated outside. No one filed an objection. We did not find any impact on the ground level,"" he said.The bench's observations led Sibal to switch from highlighting the ill-impact of SIR to focus on questioning its constitutional validity. ""The process must be inclusive and the burden of proving citizenship cannot be fastened on the voters. If there is a doubtful voter, his/her case should be referred to the competent authority to determine the citizenship issue. A booth level officer (BLO) has no right to inquire into the citizenship of a voter,"" he said.

Such decisions require broader consultation with states and stakeholders, and existing regulations cannot be amended for a single institution. Under current rules, 85% of MBBS seats are reserved for the state quota and 15% for the All-India Quota. ""This is not just about SMVDIME.

Several Hindu organisations, including Sanatan Dharam Sabha and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, have protested over 43 out of the first batch of 50 MBBS students reportedly being from a particular community.The groups hold that since the institute is funded by devotees of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, it should attract students from across the country rather than just one community or region.""As of now, 100% of candidates are from the state,"" an official confirmed, adding the college was seeking all-India quota allocation to widen the pool for intake of students.On Sept 8 last year, SMVDIME - located at the base camp of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine - was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats, paving the way for admissions to its first batch in the 2025-26 academic session.The institute began functioning in Nov last year from the administrative block of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.","Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence sought to place 100% of its 50 MBBS seats under the All-India Quota (AIQ) National Medical Commission (NMC) has turned down the proposal.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi marked Constitution Day on Wednesday by urging citizens to never miss out on their constitutional right to vote and renewed his pitch for balancing rights with duties.PM Modi has often emphasised that while the issue of people's rights has received attention, the Constitution's similar focus on their duties was overlooked. He cited a host of stalwarts, including Mahatma Gandhi, to underscore the primacy of duties for social and economic progress.As the country moves forward to realising the dream of a developed India, people must always place their duties towards the nation foremost in their minds, he said.In a letter to citizens on Constitution Day, which was announced by his government in 2015, PM Modi suggested that people organise special events on November 26 to mark the coming-of-age of youngsters in schools and colleges to celebrate first-time voters.First-time voters will make them feel that they are also active participants in the process of nation-building, PM Modi said. ""It is our duty to never miss the opportunity to vote in national, state and local elections where we are registered,"" the PM said. His remarks came amid high turnouts in recent polls and the ongoing SIR of electoral roll drive in several states and UTs.With Congress leading the charge against his govt for allegedly weakening constitutional values, Modi in his letter took a swipe at the party for not celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Constitution's adoption in 2010 in a befitting manner. Sadly, he said, the occasion did not receive the due national attention. However, the then Gujarat govt headed by him had organised a 'Samvidhan Gaurav Yatra', he added.PM Modi credited the Constitution for enabling someone like him from a disadvantaged background to serve as the head of a govt continuously for over 24 years, which includes his stint as Gujarat CM from Oct 2001.The 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Birsa Munda this year marks the occasion as special, he said, asserting it was the country's first home minister's inspiration and courage of conviction that guided his govt in repealing Article 370 and 35(A) and ensuring the Constitution is now fully implemented in J&K.He noted that he had bowed and touched the steps of Parliament when he entered it for the first time in 2014 and had touched the Constitution with his forehead on his re-election in 2019 as a mark of reverence, and paid tributes to Constituent Assembly chairman Rajendra Prasad and its drafting committee chair BR Ambedkar. Modi also attended a programme at Samvidhan Sadan, where President Murmu addressed a gathering to mark the day.On X, he said, ""While it (Constitution) empowers us with rights, it also reminds us of our duties as citizens, which we should always try to fulfil. These duties are the foundation of a strong democracy. Let us reiterate our commitment to strengthening Constitutional values through our actions.""","PM Modi has often emphasised that while the issue of people's rights has received attention, the Constitution's focus on their duties was overlooked.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday wrote to Kolkata Police Commissioner Manoj Kumar Verma, raising alarm over a “serious security breach” during a protest by booth-level officers (BLOs) at the Chief Electoral Officer’s office in Kolkata.The poll body has directed the police to ensure the safety of its officials and submit an action-taken report within 48 hours.The letter was issued following a security breach on Monday during a protest by booth-level officers (BLOs) outside the Chief Electoral Officer’s office in Kolkata, where some demonstrators attempted to force entry, prompting police intervention and a brief scuffle.“It has come to the notice of ECI that on 24.11.2025 a serious security breach has occurred at the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, West Bengal, which has also been widely reported in Media,” the letter read.The poll body warned that the situation could endanger senior election officials.“The existing security in the office of the CEO appeared to be inadequate to handle the situation, which could lead to threat to the safety and security of the Chief Electoral Officer, Additional Chief Electoral Officers, Joint Chief Electoral Officers, Deputy Chief Electoral Officers and other officers and staff working in the office of the Chief Electoral Officer,” it said.The Commission has asked the police to ensure safety at the office, at residences of officials and during their travel.“The Commission has taken a serious view of the incident and directs that the Police Authorities should take all possible measures to ensure safety and security of officers and staff posted in the office of the CEO, at their residences and while commuting to and fro,” the letter stated.It further sought heightened security due to “sensitivity involved” ahead of upcoming elections in the state.“The Commission further directs that adequate security classification shall be done on account of sensitivity involved due to SIR activities and forthcoming elections in the State and ensure that no untoward incident occurs again. An action taken report may be sent to the Commission within 48 Hours of receipt of this letter,"" it further read.The breach occurred during a demonstration by booth-level officers outside the CEO’s office. Their protest march began around 1pm from College Street and reached the NSC Bose Road office at approximately 2.30pm.BLOs have alleged “inhumane stress” from the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. Authorities had barricaded the entrance, but protesters tried to scale it, leading to a scuffle with police.At least 13 representatives were later allowed inside to submit a memorandum demanding an extension of deadlines and relief from online data-upload duties.Their agitation came days after the deaths of two BLOs, with families blaming excessive workload. Another officer suffered a cerebral attack, further fuelling anger among workers.West Bengal CEO Manoj Kumar Agarwal earlier said BLOs were “heroes” of the electoral process and assured that no action would be taken against them for genuine errors.The situation has intensified an already sharp confrontation between the state government and the ECI.On Monday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, flagging what she called two “disturbing yet urgent developments” ahead of polls.She criticised a centralised proposal by the CEO to outsource data entry staff:In her letter, Mamata wrote: “When district offices already have a substantial number of competent professionals performing such functions, what necessitates the CEO's initiative to outsource the same work through an external agency for a full year?”She also objected to a plan to set up polling stations inside private residential complexes, calling it “deeply problematic”.""It has further been brought to my attention that the Election Commission is considering setting up polling stations within private residential complexes, and DEOs have been asked to provide recommendations.This proposal is deeply problematic. Polling stations have always been-and must remain-located in government or semi-government institutions, preferably within a 2 km radius, to ensure accessibility and neutrality,"" Banerjee wrote in her letter.Banerjee appealed to the ECI to act “with utmost seriousness, impartiality and transparency.”The Special Intensive Revision exercise, which began on November 4, will conclude on December 4 and draft electoral rolls are scheduled for publication on December 9. Elections in West Bengal are scheduled next year.","The poll body has directed the police to ensure the safety of its officials and submit an action-taken report within 48 hours.

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra has once again landed in controversy -- this time over a photo he shared online wearing a T-shirt that appeared to mock the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The post quickly triggered outrage within the BJP , with the saffron party warning of police action.The row erupted after Kamra posted on his social media accounts a photo of himself in the respective T-shirt. He captioned the photo 'not clicked at a comedy show', hinting at the previous controversy that angered Shiv Sena , resulting in the destruction of the venue of his comedy show.Maharashtra minister and senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the government would not ignore such posts. “The police would take action against anyone who puts out such objectionable posts,” he warned, responding to Kamra’s picture that showed a dog image alongside a reference to the RSS, the ideological parent of the BJP.Shiv Sena cabinet minister Sanjay Shirsat -- whose party is a BJP ally -- said the saffron party must respond strongly this time, recalling Kamra’s past potshots at both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde . “Earlier, he targeted Prime Minister Modi and Eknath Shinde, and now he has dared to directly attack the RSS. The BJP needs to respond to this,” Shirsat said.“We (Shiv Sena) responded to it (to Kamra's critical comments on Shinde earlier this year).Now, he has mustered the courage to make an objectionable post against the RSS,” he added.This is not Kamra’s first clash with political leaders. In March, he sparked a storm after mocking Shinde during a show by tweaking the lyrics of a popular Hindi film song. Angered by his remarks, Shiv Sena workers later vandalised the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai’s Khar -- the venue where Kamra had performed -- as well as the hotel building it is housed in.","Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra has once again landed in controversy over a photo he shared online wearing a T-shirt that appeared to mock the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place. Our Consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended fullest assistance to the stranded passenger.”It was asserted Arunachal Pradesh is an ‘indisputably Indian territory,’ calling the reason for detention as ‘ludicrous.’“It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.

The ministry releases four advance estimates before final production figures for a crop year.Sowing of kharif crops starts at the onset of monsoon in June, and harvest generally begins in Oct.""Excessive rainfall in some areas of the country affected crops, but most areas have benefited significantly from a good monsoon, leading to overall good crop growth,"" agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said.Maize production is estimated at 28 MT in 2025-26, up from nearly 25 MT the previous year.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: Upping the ante in its political battle with TMC over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral roll in West Bengal, BJP on Wednesday urged the Election Commission to strengthen the ongoing process in the state as it flagged a host of concerns, including the presence of alleged infiltrators on voters' rolls, and demanded deportation or ""detention"" of those who are not Indians.A BJP delegation led by its state president Samik Bhattacharya presented its demands to EC ahead of the poll body's scheduled meeting with the state's governing TMC, which is stridently opposing SIR, on Friday.The BJP delegation told EC, ""The issue of illegal infiltration must be addressed systematically. Clear messaging must be issued regarding exfiltration or detention for individuals who are not Indian citizens."" Strengthened enforcement will help reduce fraudulent applications and ensure infiltrators do not remain on the electoral rolls, it added.BJP noted that illegal infiltration from Bangladesh has remained a longstanding concern in Bengal and they are believed to have obtained fraudulent documents through local networks. Many of them have admitted in live reporting that they have obtained such documents, it claimed.It also rejected the contention of opposition parties that workload is causing stress, even deaths by suicide, among booth-level officers (BLO), saying political coercion by the state's governing establishment for not deleting the names of ineligible voters is their primary problem.Names of a large number of deceased people continue to be on the electoral rolls, leaving scope for misuse, it claimed.","BJP demands deportation or ""detention"" of those who are not Indians.

PM Modi Pens Powerful Letter On Duties And Democracy, Reflects On His Constitutional Journey

NEW DELHi: President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said women representation in judiciary, legislature and executive continues to be low despite Parliament amending the Constitution to enact Women's Reservation Act in 2023 to reserve one-third of seats for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies.""Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam is a historic step towards empowering women and a homage to all women who took part in the Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution. But we continue to lag in giving women adequate representation in judiciary, legislature and executive,"" Murmu said at the Constitution Day celebrations organised by Supreme Court, which has only one woman among 33 judges.Speaking in the presence of CJI Surya Kant and law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, the President said taking steps to give adequate representation to women in all three wings of governance will require a change of mindset. It was SCBA president Vikas Singh who mentioned extremely low representation of women in judiciary - 13% in HCs and 35% in trial courts.She said annual commemoration of the Constitution's adoption on Nov 26, 1949, is often marked by speeches made by dignitaries. ""Have we ever looked back and assessed in the last 75 years how much we have progressed in achieving the constitutional goals of justice, equality, liberty and fraternity for every citizen? If not, can we do it in the next 24 years when we will be celebrating the centenary of the adoption of the Constitution? That is the question, not only for the judiciary, legislature or executive, but for everyone.Addressing another Constitution Day event in Central Hall of old Parliament building or Samvidhan Sadan, Murmu described the Constitution as the bedrock of ""our national pride and national identity"", and as a guiding text for taking India forward with a ""nationalist mindset by abandoning the colonial mindset"".In front of an audience that included Vice-President C P Radhakrishnan, PM Narendra Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, opposition leaders of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, respectively, and members of both Houses of Parliament, Murmu cited implementation of legislations related to the criminal justice system as an example of the effort to shun the colonial mindset.Murmu also said that by repealing the provisions of Article 370, an obstacle that had been hindering the country's inclusive political integration was removed.At the function in SC, Murmu praised CJI's renewed focus on mediation and termed it a big step to reduce litigation.CJI Kant said when it comes to justice delivery system, there is still a disquieting gap between constitutional vision and the experience of many, especially the marginalised section of population for whom the access to justice remains elusive because of exorbitant cost of litigation, language of courts, distance and delay. Promising to improve the justice delivery system on all these fronts, the CJI said, ""The time is also ripe for us to reinforce predictability in our judicial approach.

'Islamophobia': Pak Meltdown Over Ayodhya Event Despite Its Own Poor Record of Minority Persecution

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: On Constitution Day, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, speaking at separate functions on Wednesday, called for upholding the values enshrined in the Constitution and uphold the rights of citizens. However, while Omar expressed concern that religious educational institutions were being unfairly targeted, Sinha asserted that the “practice of rewarding separatism” had stopped after provisions of the Constitution were made fully applicable to J&K in 2019.Addressing students and faculty at the 50th annual celebration of Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa in Jammu’s Poonch district, Omar said “propaganda and lies” were being spread against Muslim religious institutions in many parts of the country. This was unpatriotic, he added.As the programme began with the national anthem, patriotic songs and Constitutional Day pledges, the CM said, “I wish those people who spread venom against religious educational institutions through social media and the press had been here today to witness this programme. They claim that the institutions like Zia-ul-Uloom teach nothing except communalism, and only impart religious education.But you can see that along with religious studies, they teach science, mathematics and all other subjects. ”On social media, “lies are spread that these institutions promote anti-national sentiment”, where one could see here that the reality was completely different, he said.Omar said symbolic observation of Constitution Day meant nothing if its ideals were not followed. “Today, we observed Constitution Day. It does not mean we remember the Constitution just for one hour; it means we must uphold it every day. The Preamble guarantees equal rights for every religion, equal democratic rights and equality before law for all. But, we are passing through a phase where even education is being given a religious colour, where statements are made that a Muslim shouldn’t study in a medical college or that non-Hindus shouldn’t be admitted in a medical college,” the CM said.He was referring to objections raised by BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal over the admission of Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Medical College in Katra. The row erupted after only eight Hindu students from Jammu made it to the first MBBS batch of 50. The admissions were based on the NEET merit list.Omar said Zia-ul-Uloom has always supported the govt and had always helped during natural disasters. During Operation Sindoor, shells fired from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir hit the madrassa on May 7, killing a teacher and wounding three students.LG Sinha, speaking at a function held in Jammu to celebrate 75 years of the adoption of the Constitution, said that after a long wait of 67 years, all provisions of the Constitution were fully implemented in J&K, ending discrimination and injustice. He was referring to the abrogation of Article 370, which granted a special status to J&K, in August 2019.“Those who say what was achieved over the past five years, I want to tell them that the practice of rewarding separatists and torturing patriots has been stopped completely,” the LG said. “Now, J&K is moving ahead guided by ideals of equity, social and economic justice as enshrined in the Constitution by Baba Saheb Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar.”",Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha spoke at separate functions on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar will on December 3 take up chairship of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IIDEA) for the year 2026 in Stockholm, reflecting a “global recognition of the Election Commission’s standing as one of the world’s most credible and innovative election management bodies (EMBs),” as per EC.IIDEA is an intergovernmental organisation created in February 1995, with India as a founding member, to support sustainable democracy worldwide. It has, over the past three decades, evolved into a key global convenor for EMBs, constitutional experts, political institutions and democratic practitioners from across continents. It currently comprises 35 member countries including Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Mauritius, South Africa, Chile and Sweden, with the US and Japan acting as observer states. Electoral processes and electoral research are among its focus areas. IIDEA through its council of member states annually elects a chair and two vice-chairs. Its present chairship is held by Switzerland and will now pass on to India.As Chair, Kumar will be presiding over all council meetings through 2026. EC in a statement on Wednesday said the CEC “will leverage the country’s unmatched experience of conducting the world’s largest elections to shape IIDEA’s global agenda”.Ironically, the international appreciation and IIDEA leadership for the CEC comes against the backdrop of constant attacks faced by him and EC from the opposition parties here, on the electoral roll health and the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise.“The collaboration (between EC and IIDEA) will strengthen knowledge-sharing, reinforce professional networks among EMBs, and support evidence-based global electoral reforms,” the poll panel underlined on Wednesday.It added that “Kumar will leverage the country’s unmatched experience of conducting the world’s largest elections to shape IIDEA’s global agenda”.According to EC, India, with the world’s largest electorate of 1 billion and well-documented, transparent electoral processes, will share its best practices with EMBs from across the world, in the coming year.Joint programmes, workshops, and research collaborations between ECI-run India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) and IIDEA will further enhance global readiness to respond to challenges such as disinformation, electoral violence, and erosion of voter trust, said the commission.","Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar will take up chairship of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IIDEA) for the year 2026.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Wednesday hailed the Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ), which is celebrating its centenary, as “one of the most important institutions in India’s democratic and administrative framework that has, in its hundred-year journey, embodied transparency, impartiality, confidentiality, and accountability”.Birla, while delivering the keynote address at UPSC’s two-day ‘Shatabdi Sammelan’ here, lauded the institution’s ability to adapt to changing times, citing the reforms in examination systems, promotion methods, and digital adoption as examples of its progressive spirit.Highlighting the inclusive nature of UPSC’s processes, the Speaker said, “Candidates from every region, language, and socio-economic background participate in this examination with complete faith in its fairness. That trust is the greatest testimony to UPSC’s credibility.”Junior minister for personnel Jitendra Singh , ‘guest of honour’ at the event, also hailed UPSC as the “guardian of India’s steel frame of governance”, saying it has stood tall as a pillar of integrity, fairness and transparency through the country’s pre and post-Independence era.Speaking in the presence of UPSC chairman Ajay Kumar, Singh recalled Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s description of the civil services as the “steel frame of India” and said, “it is the UPSC that has lived up to the responsibility of being the guardian of this steel frame.”Applauding UPSC’s continuous evolution, Singh drew attention to several recent initiatives that reflect the commission’s forward-looking approach. He especially commended UPSC’s ‘Pratibha Setu’ portal, which seeks to create new opportunities for candidates who have cleared all the Civil Services Examination stages but did not make it to final list of recommended candidates, by connecting them with private sector and institutional openings. He termed the move “an innovative bridge between talent and opportunity”.Singh emphasised UPSC’s larger role beyond recruitment, which covers framing and updating service rules, reviewing administrative practices, and setting ethical standards for public service.“The architects of Viksit Bharat @2047 will emerge from this very institution that has trained generations of India’s finest civil servants,” he remarked.",Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla hailed the Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC) as ‘one of the most important institutions in India’s democratic and administrative framework’ He was delivering keynote address at UPSC's two-day ‘Shatabdi Sammelan’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125595729,imgsize-26168,width-400,resizemode-4/om-birla.jpg"

‘Will give medicine when required’

Siddaramaiah wants ‘swift decision’

‘No groups in the party’

Mallikarjun Kharge in CM race?

NEW DELHI: The standoff between Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar over the chief ministerial post in Karnataka seems to have entered its climax as Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday acknowledged the situation, saying that “medicine” will be given to resolve the issue.As soon as the Congress government in Karnataka completed its halfway mark on November 20, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar added to the speculations after he claimed that there had indeed been a ""secret deal"" -- a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he said.On the ongoing political developments in the state, Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing.But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in the high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.This was the first acknowledgment by Kharge that there is indeed a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.Karnataka minister Satish Jarkiholi said chief minister Siddaramaiah has asked the Congress high command to take an early call on the question of leadership change in the state.Jarkiholi, who handles the public works portfolio, told reporters that he plans to seek an appointment with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge to discuss the matter.He said the issue of succession must be settled by the party’s national leadership and revealed that Siddaramaiah too prefers a swift decision.“When the CM says it, then seniors in the party should take note of it,” he stated. However, he maintained that no internal discussions had taken place among MLAs on a possible leadership shift. “There is no discussion about leadership change in the party. Once it comes up then we will discuss, but there is no discussion about it in the party right now,” Jarkiholi said.A day after raising eyebrows with his remarks, DK Shivakumar on Wednesday changed tune, claiming that Congress is united and focused on the 2028 assembly and 2029 Lok Sabha elections.“Whatever is there, party issues, we will discuss within four walls. I will not discuss any political issues in the media,” the deputy chief minister said.He also denied any confusion or existence of factions within the party and said, “No one should demand anything. There are no groups in the party; there is only one group, that is the Congress. Our group has 140 MLAs.”Priyank Kharge passes Rahul’s message to Siddaramaiah, DKSAdditionally, Karnataka minister and Kharge’s son Priyank Kharge held discussions with senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the leadership change issue in the state.According to reports, Priyank has conveyed Rahul’s message to both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, and they are likely to be called to New Delhi soon for a meeting aimed at resolving the matter.“Discussions are in the media. Will I meet Mohan Bhagwat (RSS chief) if not Rahul Gandhi? Will I report to Keshava Krupa (RSS state headquarters) without reporting to the CM and deputy CM on my meeting? Rahul Gandhi was invited for the Bengaluru Tech Summit; he couldn’t come. I had sought his time to show our Artificial Intelligence Personal Computer,” Kharge said in response to a question.Meanwhile, a section of Congress leaders also pitched Mallikarjun Kharge’s name for the chief minister post amid the “leadership tussle”.Minister Shivananda Patil had described Mallikarjun Kharge as the “most eligible person” for the CM post. “I had committed a mistake once by not voting for him. I accept it today,” he said.State home minister G Parameshwara also said that if the party high command decides, everyone would accept Kharge as the chief minister.The issue of a Dalit chief minister has long been debated within Congress, with senior Dalit leaders including Parameshwara and Mahadevappa speaking on the matter in the past.Some prominent Dalit leaders are reportedly planning to push for a “Dalit CM” before the high command in the event of a change in state leadership, PTI reported.News agency PTI cited sources and claimed that Kharge, a Dalit stalwart in the party, lost the chance to become chief minister thrice — in 1999 to S M Krishna, in 2004 to Dharam Singh, and in 2013 to Siddaramaiah.However, Kharge’s son Priyank dismissed the speculations, calling them “irrelevant”.“Whenever elections happen here (in Karnataka), he is in the race to become the CM, and whenever Parliamentary elections happen, he is in the race to become the PM. Such discussions are irrelevant now,” Priyank said.","Mallikarjun Kharge acknowledges that there is a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.

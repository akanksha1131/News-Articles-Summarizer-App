Received an update on the situation. The families of victims deserve justice and our fullest support,"" Rahul said.The Congress on Tuesday had asked the government to take accountability for the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir instead of making ""hollow claims"" on the situation being normal in the Union Territory, and demanded that an all-party meeting be called to take political parties into confidence.The opposition party denounced the terror attack as a blot on humanity and said it should not go ""unanswered effectively.""Security forces carried out a major manhunt, combing the area to track down the terrorists responsible.""The search operation is currently in progress, with all efforts focused on bringing the attackers to justice,"" the Indian army's Chinar Corps said in a statement overnight.Security has been beefed up since the attack, with streets being deserted in the usually bustling tourist area.Additionally, security forces and forensic team also conducted search operation at the Baisaran picnic spot in Pahalgam.Defence officials told that Indian Army ALH Dhruv helicopters have been allowed to fly in the areas around Srinagar, J&K and adjoining areas in view of the ongoing counter-terrorism operations.Meanwhile, the security forces also foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Baramulla.According to Indian Army, terrorists tried to infiltrate through general area Sarjeevan at Baramulla's Uri Nala.""On 23 Apr 2025, approximately 2-3 UI terrorists tried to infiltrate through general area Sarjeevan at Uri Nala, Baramulla (in north Kashmir),"" Chinar Corps said in a post on X.The alert troops on the LoC challenged and intercepted the infiltrators, resulting in a firefight, the army said.""The operation is in progress,"" it added.In response to the recent terror attack in Pahalgam, several political parties in Jammu and Kashmir have extended their support to the call for a Kashmir Bandh (shutdown) on Wednesday to condemn the attack and show solidarity with the victims' families.Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) has appealed to the people to make the Bandh a ""complete success"" and join in condemning the Pahalgam terror attack.In a social media post on X, JKNC wrote, ""On the instruction of the Party President, JKNC joins the collective call for a bandh in strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terror attack.

Speaking to ANI, he recalled the sheer panic that unfolded as they heard gunfire ring out behind them, just moments after they had left the site of the attack.""This incident happened when we had just left the place of the incident. We could hear the sound of firing for a long time. We didn’t look back. Everyone was screaming, trying to get out. The exit gate was just four feet wide, and there were too many people. I was only thinking about getting my wife and child to safety,” he said.His wife suffered a leg fracture in the chaos. From her hospital bed, she remembered the confusion, ""People shouted, ‘firing ho rahi hai!’ We just ran. Children were crying, people were pushing, there was no space.”Eyewitnesses described the scene of horror. Waheed, a local tour guide, told AFP he rushed to help after hearing the gunshots. “I saw men lying on the ground — lifeless. I helped carry the wounded on horseback,” he said.Pahalgam, located about 90 kilometres from Srinagar, has long been a tourist favourite. This brazen attack has left the region and the nation shaken. Chief minister Omar Abdullah called it “much larger than anything we’ve seen directed at civilians in recent years,” and condemned the attackers as “inhuman.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned from Saudi Arabia after cutting short the trip, called the attack a “heinous act” and promised justice. He directed home minister Amit Shah to visit the site. Shah reached Srinagar later that evening and vowed, “We will come down heavily on the perpetrators with the harshest consequences.”Rahul Gandhi, speaking as Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, called the killings “heartbreaking” and said, “The entire country is united against terrorism.” He also urged the government to take responsibility and ensure such attacks are not repeated.As security forces comb through the valley for those behind the assault, the survivors and families of victims are left picking up the pieces—haunted by the horror, and in some cases, saved by a matter of minutes.","A family from Nagpur, Maharashtra, is grappling with the trauma of what they narrowly escaped a deadly terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Terror struck at the heart of Kashmir’s tourist belt once again on Tuesday, as militants opened fire on a crowded site in Pahalgam, killing at least 28 people, including two foreign nationals from the UAE and Nepal, and two locals. The incident, which also left dozens injured, has reignited memories of the valley’s most brutal attacks on civilians over the past three decades.The assault, carried out at one of south Kashmir’s most visited locations, comes just months after the deadly June 2024 attack in Reasi, where pilgrims en route to Vaishno Devi were targeted. Officials described Tuesday’s attack as the deadliest on civilians in recent years.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who landed in Delhi shortly after the attack, held an emergency meeting with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar at the airport itself. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah called the attack “much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years.”Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi said he had spoken with home minister Amit Shah, the J&K chief minister, and Congress leader Tariq Karra to understand the situation. ""The families of the victims deserve justice and our fullest support. Hollow claims of normalcy must now give way to concrete action,” Gandhi said.This is not the first time Pahalgam has found itself in the crosshairs. From the abduction of six foreign tourists in 1995, one of whom was later killed, to the 2000 Nunwan base camp massacre that left 32 dead, including Amarnath pilgrims and local vendors, the region has seen more than its share of bloodshed.The valley’s history is pockmarked with chilling incidents:, 36 Sikhs were massacred in Chittisinghpora on the eve of President Clinton’s visit.9 Amarnath pilgrims were killed in an attack at the Nunwan camp., seven Amarnath pilgrims, mostly from Gujarat, were killed in Anantnag., a Vaishno Devi-bound bus came under fire in Reasi, killing 10 and injuring 33.From fidayeen assaults on temples to grenade attacks on buses, the targets have mostly remained the same: pilgrims, tourists, migrant workers, and minority communities.As the nation mourns yet another tragedy, pressure is mounting on the Centre and state administration to move beyond statements and deliver actionable security reforms.","Militants opened fire on a crowded site in Pahalgam, killing at least 28 people, including two foreign nationals from the UAE and Nepal, and two locals.

Her early education in the city played a pivotal role in developing her disciplined approach to academics and her curiosity-driven mindset. Although the names of her schools remain undisclosed, the influence of Prayagraj’s competitive and scholarly atmosphere can be traced throughout her journey.The city’s rich educational heritage, known for producing eminent scholars and public administrators, served as an early source of inspiration. It was in this intellectually stimulating environment that Shakti laid the foundations of her academic excellence, which later proved crucial in navigating the demanding UPSC syllabus.Following her schooling, Shakti enrolled in the University of Allahabad, where she pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry. The university, a prestigious institution with a legacy of academic distinction, offered her a strong grounding in scientific methods and critical thinking. Her decision to specialise in Biochemistry reflects an affinity for precision and analysis—skills that became assets during her UPSC preparation.After completing her undergraduate degree in 2016, she went on to pursue a Master of Science in Biochemistry at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Varanasi. BHU, one of the leading centres of higher learning in India, provided her not just academic rigour but also exposure to a wider range of social and intellectual currents. It was during her time at BHU that Shakti’s interest in governance and public administration deepened, motivating her to shift her career trajectory toward civil services.After finishing her postgraduation, Shakti briefly took up teaching, although specific details about her teaching assignments are not publicly documented. This phase, however, highlights her passion for learning and sharing knowledge, while also helping her build key competencies like communication, leadership, and mentorship—qualities vital for a civil servant.In 2018, following the completion of her M.Sc., she made the life-changing decision to begin preparing for the UPSC CSE. Choosing Political Science and International Relations as her optional subject, Shakti brought a unique blend of scientific rigour and social science insight to her preparation. Her approach was systematic, reflecting her academic training and clarity of purpose.Shakti’s preparation journey spanned seven years, underscoring her perseverance and belief in long-term goals. The UPSC CSE is conducted in three stages—Preliminary, Mains, and the Personality Test. The Preliminary exam was held on June 16, 2024, followed by the Mains between September 20 and September 29, 2024. The Personality Test phase took place from January 7 to April 17, 2025.Throughout these stages, her strong analytical abilities, shaped by her background in Biochemistry, supported her performance across subjects. Her decision to opt for Political Science and International Relations showcased her adaptability and her understanding of administrative and diplomatic affairs. It was her confident and composed performance during the Personality Test that helped her leave a lasting impression, ultimately securing the AIR 1.Shakti Dubey’s success story is a powerful narrative of transformation—from a student in a small town to India’s top civil services aspirant. Her academic path through Allahabad University and BHU, coupled with her brief stint in teaching and her strategic choice of optional subject, highlights the importance of both education and purpose-driven effort.Her rise to the top of the UPSC CSE 2024 not only marks a personal milestone but also sets an example for aspirants across the country, especially those from small towns. With her eyes now set on serving the nation through the IAS, Shakti Dubey stands as a role model for resilience, discipline, and visionary determination.","Shakti Dubey from Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, secured the All India Rank 1 (AIR 1) Dubey’s achievement stands as a testament to his exceptional dedication, perseverance, and intellectual prowess, as well as his deep commitment to serving the nation.

These non-locals arrive posing as tourists, obtain domiciles, and then being to act as if they own the land. Consequently, violence will be directed toward those attempting to settle illegally,"" the TRF said.The TRF, which was banned by the government last year, has been involved in recruiting youth through the online medium for the furtherance of terrorist activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into J&K.The group came into existence in 2019 as a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was involved in numerous terror acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Sheikh Sajjad Gul is a commander of The Resistance Front and has been designated as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act 1967.TRF has been responsible for numerous attacks targeting civilians, security forces, and political figures in Jammu and Kashmir.

He is also expected to visit Pahalgam on Wednesday.The attack, which took place in the picturesque Baisaran Valley—often referred to as “mini Switzerland”—is the deadliest targeting civilians in Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama strike. Terrorists opened fire on tourists gathered in the popular meadow near Pahalgam, killing 26, including two foreigners and two local residents, according to a senior official.Located around six kilometers from Pahalgam town, Baisaran is a scenic meadow surrounded by dense pine forests and mountains. Witnesses said gunmen entered the area and began shooting at tourists who were enjoying pony rides, eating at local stalls, or picnicking on the grass.","The Resistance Front (TRF), proxy outfit of Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed's Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the ghastly attack on tourists in J&K's Pahalgam.

A court in Belgium has rejected the bail plea of Mehul Choksi --a key accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case. A three-judge bench heard the arguments before ruling against granting bail.Choksi was arrested in Belgium last week following an official request from Indian authorities.Meanwhile, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said during the weekly media briefing that India was working with the Belgian side for Choksi's extradition.""As you are aware, based on our extradition request, he was arrested in Belgium. We are closely working with the Belgian side for his extradition to India so that he can face trial in the country,"" Jaiswal had said answering a query.Earlier, Choksi's Indian lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, was seen in Antwerp ahead of the bail hearing and had also visited Choksi in jail.After his arrest, Aggarwal had stated that the legal team planned to appeal the decision, emphasizing ""Choksi's ill health and ongoing cancer treatment"" as the primary grounds for seeking his release. ""My client, Mehul Choksi, is currently in custody. We will initiate the process of filing an appeal and request his release from prison, citing his medical condition and the fact that he is not a flight risk,"" Aggarwal told ANI.During a press conference held in Delhi, Aggarwal had outlined the defence strategy to contest Choksi's extradition on two key grounds: the political nature of the case and concerns over the treatment of Choksi's health condition in India. He had argued that extradition could severely impact Choksi's human rights, ""particularly due to the lack of adequate medical care and the risk of harassment by political entities.""Aggarwal had claimed that Choksi had been cooperative with Indian investigative agencies and had expressed willingness to participate in investigations via video conferencing due to his health issues.The legal team had also pointed out procedural prerequisites for extradition, including the issuance of non-bailable warrants since 2018. Aggarwal had noted that previous attempts to extradite Choksi from Dominica had failed, and that Choksi had been receiving medical treatment in Antigua before traveling to Belgium for cancer care.","Mehul Choksi is a key accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case.

A career cut short by family tragedy

NEW DELHI: In a shocking twist to the death of former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, Bengaluru Police have detained his wife, Pallavi, after she allegedly threw chilli powder in his face and stabbed him to death in their HSR Layout residence.Their daughter, Kriti, has also been detained for questioning as investigators dig deeper into what appears to be a domestic dispute turned deadly.The development comes following a formal complaint filed by the deceased officer’s son, who alleged that both women had a role in the killing.According to police sources, the 68-year-old retired IPS officer was killed following a heated argument with Pallavi, who reportedly lost control and attacked him with a knife after blinding him with chilli powder, reported PTI.The murder is said to have occurred on the ground floor of their three-storeyed home on Sunday, where Prakash was found lying in a pool of blood.What makes the case more chilling is what followed: PTI sources say Pallavi made a video call to a friend immediately after the incident and declared, “I have killed the monster.”Prakash's son Kartikesh has come forward with a damning accusation that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for a week, and that his sister Kriti pressured him to return home just two days before his death.“Due to these threats, my father had gone to stay at his sister’s house,” Kartikesh said in his police complaint. “My younger sister Kriti went there and brought him back against his will.”According to the complaint, the fatal incident came to light around 5 pm on Sunday when a neighbor alerted Kartikesh while he was at the Karnataka Golf Association. “I rushed home and found police and others already there. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found near his body,” he said, adding that his father was taken to St John’s Hospital.“My mother Pallavi and sister Kriti used to fight with my father often. I strongly suspect they are involved in his murder,” he added, urging police to take legal action.Investigators believe the murder was the result of long-standing tensions in the family, including a property dispute over land in Dandeli, Karnataka. Sources said the couple had frequent confrontations, and Pallavi had even visited the HSR Layout police station months ago to file a complaint. When her grievance wasn't taken seriously, she allegedly staged a dharna outside the police station.Pallavi is also reportedly undergoing treatment for schizophrenia and has been on medication, police sources revealed.Om Prakash, a 1981-batch IPS officer from Champaran, Bihar, had an illustrious career in the Karnataka police force. He held a Master’s degree in Geology and rose through the ranks to serve as Director General and Inspector General of Police from March 1, 2015, until his retirement in March 2017.He began his service in Ballari district as Additional Superintendent of Police and held key roles in Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, the Lokayukta, and the Fire and Emergency Services.The case has sparked massive interest in Karnataka and beyond, with police sources earlier confirming the use of a weapon and visible signs of physical assault. An autopsy report is awaited, and further investigation is underway.","Former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, 68, was found dead in his home on Sunday.

Urging India to consider acquiring F-35 fighter jets , the vice-president hardsold the fifth-generation American jets and said the aircraft would significantly enhance the Indian Air Force's ability to secure the country's airspace.Referring to India as the US's only ""major defence partner"" with whom the country shares defence infrastructure, technology, and planning on par with America's other allies, Vance pointed to ""dire"" consequences for the world if India and the US ""fail to keep pace"" with the need to scale up across sectors, including manufacturing, energy, cutting-edge technologies, and defence.Addressing a gathering of business leaders, diplomats, academicians, bureaucrats, state ministers, and students at the Rajasthan International Centre in Jaipur, his only public engagement during his maiden four-day visit to India since assuming office as vice-president, Vance set the tone for a future-ready US-India partnership rooted in mutual respect and shared strategic interests.He also contrasted Modi's assertiveness with the previous US leadership. ""President Trump and I know that PM Modi is a tough negotiator. He drives a hard bargain - it's one of the reasons why we respect him,"" he said. ""We don't blame Modi for fighting for Indian industry but we do hold previous American leaders accountable for failing to do the same for our workers.

""As I told PM Modi last night, he's got approval ratings that would make me jealous,"" Vance said.Calling the US-India partnership ""one of the closest in the world"", Vance highlighted the expanding US-India partnership spanning energy, defence, technology, and economic infrastructure. ""From Javelins to Stryker combat vehicles, our nations will co-produce critical equipment - not to provoke war but to secure peace through mutual strength,"" he said.Vance added, ""This designation means that India now shares with the UAE a defence in technology, infrastructure, and partnership with the US, on par with America's closest allies and friends."" ""It's fitting that India this year is hosting the Quad Leaders Summit this fall. Our interests in a free, open, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific are in full alignment. Both of us know that the region must remain safe from any hostile powers that seek to dominate,"" he said.Vance also said India and the US have finalised the terms of reference for a bilateral trade agreement after a high-level meeting with PM Modi in Delhi on Monday. ""This is a vital step toward realising President Trump's and PM Modi's vision,"" he said, highlighting shared priorities of job creation, resilient supply chains, and prosperity for workers. Vance also urged India to ease non-tariff barriers that currently limit American market access and pitched increased US ethanol exports as a cleaner, cost-effective energy solution.Welcoming Modi govt's budget decision to amend India's civil nuclear liability laws, which currently inhibit US firms from exporting small modular reactors or constructing larger US-designed nuclear plants in India, he said, ""These reforms are vital for India's energy goals and AI ambitions. There is no AI future without energy security and dominance.""Vance, who is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Thursday, also stressed the importance of deepening energy ties. ""Expanding energy exports will help India build more, make more, and grow more - all at lower energy costs,"" he said.

Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah, meanwhile, condemned the episode & took strong objection to Bose's unwarranted and derogatory remarks about Karnataka and Kannadigas.BPO employee Vikas Kumar, the biker involved in a fistfight with Bose while the latter's wife Madhumita Dutta was driving him to a bus stop on Old Madras Road, was arrested late Monday based on Dutta's complaint alleging that she and her husband were abused in Kannada before being assaulted.On being released on bail Tuesday afternoon, Kumar uploaded a video on social media stating the allegations against him were false. ""He (Wing Commander) attacked me and has given a false complaint against me, citing language. Working in Bengaluru, I speak five different languages. What he has said is untrue. I'm on the verge of losing my job because of this,"" Kumar said. Kumar filed a counter-complaint later in the day, based on which Bose was booked for attempted murder and other charges.Describing Bose's statement as ""deeply disrespectful and inflammatory"", CM Siddaramaiah stated: ""Kannadigas are proud of their mother tongue, but they are not parochial or intolerant. It is not in our culture to attack or abuse others over linguistic matters. Karnataka has a long and proud tradition of embracing people from across country, treating them with respect and accepting them as one of our own. The inclusive spirit of this land is well documented in history. It is deeply regrettable that certain national media outlets, neglecting their responsibility and professional ethics, have amplified a baseless accusation by one individual, thereby casting aspersions on the dignity of the entire state...""","IAF Wing Commander Shiladitya Bose charged with attempt to murder and provoking breach of peace.

Though the bench asked attorney general R Venkataramani to file a status report on implementation of various EV policies, it believed these are issues which are determined by market forces coupled with people's trust and capacity to buy EVs.Justice Kant said the car manufacturing industry is one of the largest in India and is not only earning good revenue for the country but also engaging a huge workforce.""Moreover, the production of EVs in India would be dependent on demand and supply, though EVs are of late gaining acceptance among people,"" the bench said. Bhushan said except for small subsidies made available on purchase of EVs, govts have done nothing to build charging infrastructure.In 2012, the target to provide 2.27 lakh charging centres for EVs has woefully fallen short as only 27,000 charging stations have been set up. Why can't every parking lot have multiple charging centres for EVs, he asked.The bench asked the attorney general to place on record in four weeks the policy decisions taken by Union govt from time to time to promote EVs and augmentation of charging infrastructure to facilitate those who are using EVs.","Supreme Court asked the central govt to file a status report on implementation of its policies to encourage electric vehicles (EVs) PIL petitioner alleged that though in 2012 Centre had targeted to have about 70 lakh EVs on road by 2020, their numbers are just 35 lakh in 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120533826,imgsize-691789,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi cut short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to India late in the night after finishing his official engagements with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), following the Pahalgam terror attack. PM Modi was originally scheduled to return on Wednesday night but was back in India early morning. He also skipped the official dinner hosted by the de facto ruler of the country.PM Modi’s meet with MbS began with a mention of the Pahalgam attack . Both of them strongly condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with victims. The Jeddah meet also saw them discussing ways to enhance energy, trade, investment and defence cooperation. India has been looking to strengthen cooperation with Riyadh in combating terrorism and terror-financing. tnnBoth Saudi and the UAE are influential members of the OIC and have been supportive of India’s efforts to blunt Pakistan’s Kashmir agenda in the organisation. The Pahalgam attack seemed designed to attract international attention as terrorists targeted tourists while PM Modi was in Saudi Arabia and US vice-president J D Vance in India. It brought alive the memories of the 2020 Chittisinghpura massacre in which 35 Sikhs were killed by terrorists on the eve of then US President Bill Clinton’s visit to India.In their last meeting, PM Modi and MbS had emphasised that terrorism, in all its forms, remains one of the gravest threats to humanity and agreed that there cannot be any justification for any act of terror for any reason whatsoever. India has so far not officially blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack.Ahead of the meeting, PM Modi described Saudi Arabia as one of India’s most valued partners, a trusted friend and a strategic ally. “Our partnership has limitless potential. In a world full of uncertainties, our bond stands strong, as a pillar of stability,’’ PM Modi said in an interview to Arab News, describing MbS as “a strong advocate of our bilateral ties” and a visionary who has inspired global admiration through the reforms under Vision 2030.“Every time I have met him, His Royal Highness has left a deep impression on me. His insights, his forward-thinking vision, and his passion for fulfilling the aspirations of his people are truly remarkable,” he said.In his departure statement, PM Modi said India deeply valued its long and historic ties with Saudi Arabia that have acquired strategic depth and momentum in recent years. “Together, we have developed a mutually beneficial and substantive partnership, including in the domains of defence, trade, investment, energy and people-to-people ties. We have shared interest and commitment to promote regional peace, prosperity, security and stability,’’ he said.",PM Narendra Modi cut short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to India late in the night after finishing his official engagements.

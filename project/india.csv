Azmi’s remarks came after Salman Khan attended the RSS Mumbai Vyakhyanmala event on Saturday, part of a two-day lecture series titled “100 Years of Sangh Journey: New Horizons.” The actor’s presence at the event has since sparked a political debate, drawing reactions from leaders across party lines.Defending Khan, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde dismissed the controversy and urged political leaders not to politicise the issue.

India switches to annual drug drive to end Elephantiasis by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-switches-to-annual-drug-drive-to-end-elephantiasis-by-2027/articleshow/128188901.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a major push to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, the Centre on Monday rolled out a nationwide annual mass drug administration campaign across 12 endemic states, signalling a decisive shift in strategy to meet its 2027 elimination target.Launching the campaign, Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda said the move from biannual to a single, focused drug round each year aims to improve compliance, strengthen surveillance and overcome last-mile gaps that have slowed progress in several districts.Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a mosquito-borne disease that damages the lymphatic system and can cause irreversible swelling of limbs, hydrocele, disability and social stigma. The disease remains endemic in 348 districts across 20 states and Union Territories.While 143 districts have successfully stopped mass drug administration after clearing transmission assessment surveys, nearly half continue to report infection levels above the elimination threshold. Health ministry data show over 6.2 lakh people living with lymphoedema and more than 1.2 lakh hydrocele cases in endemic areas.The current round of annual drug administration is being implemented in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, covering 719 blocks in 124 districts. The objective is to bring microfilaria prevalence below one percent, the benchmark required to interrupt transmission.India has committed to eliminating filariasis as a public health problem by the end of 2027, three years ahead of the global target. Officials said the redesigned annual campaign will allow uninterrupted monitoring, particularly during the monsoon months when drug delivery and follow-up have traditionally suffered.Addressing state health ministers and senior officials, Nadda said filariasis is not just a medical condition but a disease that erodes livelihoods and traps families in long-term economic distress. He stressed the need for direct observation of drug consumption, stronger vector control and sustained community engagement to counter public hesitancy.The programme also places renewed focus on morbidity management, including hydrocele surgeries and care for patients with chronic swelling. Such surgeries are covered under the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme, while Ayushman Arogya Mandirs are expected to support early detection and follow-up care.Officials said steady gains over the past decade, including improved drug compliance and wider district-level coverage, have laid the groundwork for the final push towards a filariasis-free India.","India has committed to eliminating filariasis as a public health problem by the end of 2027.

However, this shall not be mandatory in cinema halls when Vande Mataram is being played as part of the film or during news reels “as a standing audience interferes with viewing of the film and can lead to disturbance of peace and disorder”.As per MHA’s instructions, the national song is to be played at all civil honorary ceremonies, official state functions as well as at events organised by the govt graced by the President of India.

In a marching drill, there will be seven steps leading to start of the national song.In its instructions regarding singing of ‘Vande Mataram’, the MHA said it would be sung at all cultural events and occasions where the national flag is being hoisted.

New Delhi: As the opposition gathered to decide strategy for the upcoming discussion on Budget on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi faced a unanimous demand from allies that he should start the debate, if only to get back at BJP which had not let him speak for seven days. The demand was led by DMK’s T R Baalu and supported by others. But Rahul resisted.He argued that if he stood up to speak, it would result in objections from the treasury benches. And the ensuing commotion would cost every opposition party the chance to speak. He underlined that all regional parties has important issues to raise, and they should not fall prey to “organised disruptions” of BJP.The move won a few hearts in the room, with an ally-critic of LoP Rahul Gandhi later describing it as a “magnanimous” gesture.The meeting was attended by Congress’ Mallikarjun Kharge, K C Venugopal, Naseer Hussain and Manickam Tagore, Ramgopal Yadav (SP), N K Premachandran (RSP), Sanjay Raut and Arvind Sawant (SS), John Brittas (CPM), PC Gupta (RJD), Shatabdi Roy (TMC), E T Mohd Basheer (IUML), Rajaram Singh (CPI-ML), among others.That was how the plan was clinched, with the party sticking to Shashi Tharoor to initiate the discussion.Gandhi will speak on the Budget on Wednesday.When the India bloc leaders met in Kharge’s chamber to brainstorm on the future course, the allies decided on ending the logjam.If Gandhi is still blocked from speaking, they would submit the planned no-confidence notice against Speaker Om Birla, and then get on with the stalled business. If Gandhi is allowed, the notice will not be filed.Lok Sabha is now expected to hold normal proceedings.","Gandhi faced a unanimous demand from allies that he should start the debate.

NEW DELHI: Women MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla , urging him to take strict action against opposition MPs for allegedly committing “heinous acts” inside the House during last week’s proceedings.In their letter, the MPs praised the Speaker for maintaining order and decorum during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address on February 4, but accused opposition of creating chaos.""We wish to express our profound gratitude and admiration for the exemplary manner in which you upheld and protected the dignity, decorum, and sanctity of the Lok Sabha during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks on the Honourable President's Address on February 4, 2026. On that day, the entire House, and indeed the entire nation, witnessed one of the most unfortunate and regrettable incidents inside the Lok Sabha chamber,"" the letter stated.Detailing the alleged misconduct, the BJP MPs claimed that opposition MPs disrupted proceedings in an unprecedented manner.""We saw members of the opposition party not only entering the well of the House but also climbing onto the Speaker's table, tearing up papers, and throwing them towards the Speaker.Furthermore, sadly, some Honourable women members, behaving aggressively and carrying banners and placards, crossed over to the other side. They not only surrounded the Prime Minister's seat but also entered the Treasury benches where senior ministers sit,"" the letter said.“Therefore, we urge you to take the strictest possible action, under the rules, against those opposition MPs who have committed such heinous acts within the House premises and brought disrepute to our democratic institution,” it added.The BJP MPs’ letter comes a day after women MPs from the Congress wrote to Birla accusing him of acting under pressure from the ruling party to justify Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s absence from the House.The controversy stems from Birla’s statement in the Lok Sabha last week that he had received “concrete information” suggesting that several Congress members might approach the Prime Minister’s seat and carry out an “unexpected act.” The Speaker said he had, therefore, requested the Prime Minister not to attend the House to deliver his reply to the Motion of Thanks.In their letter, Congress women MPs strongly objected to the Speaker’s remarks and accused him of making baseless allegations.“Clearly pressured by the ruling party to defend the non-appearance of the Prime Minister, the Speaker issued a statement making grave allegations against the women MPs of the party,” the Congress MPs said.“We are being targeted simply because we have consistently fought against Prime Minister Narender Modi’s anti-people government and demanded accountability from him. His absence from the House was not due to any threat from us, it was an act of fear,” the letter added.The Congress MPs further rejected any suggestion that they had planned to disrupt proceedings.“He (PM) did not have the courage to face the Opposition. We are Members of Parliament from the Indian National Congress, a party that stands for love, peace, constitutional values, and human dignity. We do not believe in violence and intimidation. We are brave women elected representatives who will not be silenced by intimidation,” the letter, signed by MPs including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jyothimani, R Sudha, Varsha Gaikwad and Jyotsna Mahant, stated.“We believe that transparency is the only way to restore the dignity of the Speaker’s office and the credibility of this House,” it said.The Congress MPs also alleged bias in disciplinary action, pointing out that eight INDIA bloc MPs were suspended at the “behest of the ruling party,” while a BJP MP was allowed to speak in a “vulgar and obscene manner” about former prime ministers.",Women MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.

That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win. India edged past South Africa in a thrilling final to finally end their prolonged title drought.Now, with momentum on their side, India will look to script another historic chapter in T20 World Cup history.","India begin their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign against USA on Saturday.

BENGALURU: A 37-year-old Indian-origin tech professional from Karnataka was shot dead by unidentified assailants in a brazen daylight attack at the parking lot of a busy shopping mall in Toronto Saturday.The victim has been identified as Chandan Kumar Raja Nandakumar, a resident of Brampton in the Greater Toronto Area and a native of Thyamagondlu village near Nelamangala, Bengaluru Rural district.In Thyamagondlu, about 47 km from Bengaluru, Chandan's parents were struggling to come to terms with the loss of their only son. ""We spoke to him last Friday. He said he would take leave and come home this summer. We were planning for his marriage. We are completely shattered,"" his father Nandakumar said.No arrests have been made so far. Police in Toronto have launched a homicide investigation, suspecting a ""targeted"" attack. Some relatives suspect Chandan's efforts to form a Kannada association in Toronto could have played a role in the killing, though police have not indicated any motive so far.A computer science graduate from Sapthagiri College, Bengaluru, Chandan had moved to Canada about six years ago and was working with LTI Mindtree, a subsidiary of L&T.Earlier, he had worked with Cognizant in Bengaluru.The killing has sent shockwaves through the Indian diaspora in Canada. This is Toronto's third homicide this year and has triggered grief and outrage among Kannadigas, both in Canada and Karnataka.Family members said Chandan had repeatedly postponed his return to India. ""Had he listened to us and returned, he would have been with us now,"" Nandakumar lamented.Chandan was seated inside his SUV when the attackers opened fire near the entrance to Woodbine Shopping Centre, close to Rexdale Boulevard, around 3.30 pm (local time).According to an official release from Toronto Police Service (TPS), officers rushed to the spot after receiving reports of a shooting and found Chandan with multiple gunshot wounds. ""He was transported to a hospital with life-threatening injuries before he succumbed to the wounds,"" family members told TOI, quoting the TPS communication.Visuals from the scene showed Chandan's white car riddled with bullet holes, prompting investigators to treat the incident as a ""targeted"" attack. The suspects fled the scene in a vehicle.TPS Inspector Errol Watson said the incident raised public safety concerns. ""I can understand how a shooting like this, especially at a mall, can cause concern for the safety of the public,"" he told the media.Condoling the incident, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said: ""We are disturbed by the incident. We have lost a Kannadiga. Our police department has already sought the help of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to bring back the body.""Chikkaballapura MP Dr K Sudhakar said he was coordinating with MEA authorities to facilitate the repatriation of Chandan's body.Friends said he was actively involved in Kannada cultural circles in Toronto, promoting Kannada films, music and community events.His uncle Murali Krishna said the family was unable to understand the motive behind the killing.

In 2014 though, in a joint statement after President Xi Jinping's visit, Beijing stated it ""supports India's aspiration to play a greater role in the UN, including in the Security Council"".While this is the first such acknowledgement after the recent military standoff, it still stops short of explicitly endorsing India's case.

'Either Naravane Or Penguin Is Lying': Rahul Gandhi Reacts To Publisher's Statement On Memoir

What Penguin said

What is the controversial excerpt?

NEW DELHI: Former Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, whose unpublished memoir has triggered a major political controversy, on Tuesday backed his publisher Penguin’s statement on the matter.“This is the status of the book,” Naravane wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of Penguin’s statement.General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book, ""Four Stars of Destiny."" An excerpt from the unpublished memoir was sought to be quoted by Lok Sabha leader of opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in the House on February 2, but he was blocked by the treasury benches, triggering the controversy.The treasury benches argued that House rules do not permit members to cite unpublished material. They also pointed out to Gandhi that he was not speaking on the listed subject — the Motion of Thanks to President Droupadi Murmu’s address, which marked the commencement of Parliament’s Budget session on January 28.The controversy has led to repeated adjournments of the Lok Sabha. Opposition parties have moved a no-confidence motion seeking the removal of Speaker Om Birla, accusing him of repeatedly siding with the government and “blocking” Gandhi from speaking at the government’s behest.As the controversy escalated, Penguin said in a statement on Monday: “We hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny. We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies have been made available to the public by Penguin Random House India. Any copies currently in circulation constitute an infringement of PRHI’s copyright and must immediately be ceased. PRHI shall be exercising remedies available in law against the illegal and unauthorised dissemination of the book. ”The memoir is yet to be vetted by the Ministry of Defence.The excerpt was published by an online portal. In it, Naravane, who was the 28th Chief of Army Staff from December 2019 to April 2022, quotes defence minister Rajnath Singh as conveying Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s message: “Jo uchit samjho woh karo” (take whatever action you deem appropriate).The purported remarks were made in August 2020, at the height of the India–China military standoff in eastern Ladakh.The Opposition has claimed that the vagueness of the alleged instructions amounted to an “abdication” of responsibility by PM Modi during the crisis.",General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book.

"Love, but no passage: What a killing changed for Meitei-Kuki couples",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/love-but-no-passage-what-a-killing-changed-for-meitei-kuki-couples/articleshow/128176965.cms,"TOI

IMPHAL/CHURACHANDPUR: For months, Meitei–Kuki couples in the hills and plains of Manipur believed they had reached the safest point they were likely to get. Life had not returned to what it was before violence erupted in May 2023, but it had settled into something predictable — a fragile calm that was shaped by habit and caution. On Jan 21, that sense of predictability lay shattered.Mayanglambam Rishikanta Singh, a 31‑year‑old Meitei man who had been working in Nepal, was abducted and shot dead in Churachandpur. Singh had quietly entered the Kuki‑majority district on Dec 19 via Aizawl, Mizoram, to dodge the buffer‑zone checkpoints between Imphal and Churachandpur, kin close to Chingnu Haokip’s family said. He had come to see Chingnu, his fiancée, after she sought permission from local authorities and representatives of Kuki National Organisation — an umbrella body of Kuki insurgent outfits under the Suspension of Operation agreement — and had lived with her for nearly a month before the killing. Officials later confirmed Singh was abducted by armed militants from the Tuibong area and taken to a village under Henglep police station, where he was shot dead on camera.The chilling video circulated widely. It showed Singh kneeling with folded hands before armed men, prompting Churachandpur police to register a suo motu FIR. Chingnu was taken alongside him during the abduction but was beaten and thrown out of a moving vehicle, her family said.She was admitted to a trauma ward in Churachandpur, where doctors found her suffering from acute depression and shock. In the hospital, she would answer only with nods and could not hold on to what she ate, her loss too great to bear. A further terrible blow was yet to come: both sides of the ethnic divide ostracised her, with many accusing her of betrayal and circulating threats on social messaging groups.Chingnu has since been discharged from hospital, but is still in no condition to speak. Her family told: ""We do not want any more trouble”.The killing did not spill into fresh violence across Manipur as many feared. In Imphal and Churachandpur, schools stayed open. Offices functioned. Roads reopened intermittently. But something shifted.Across, in Meitei-majority Imphal valley, separation has been a defining condition since mid-2023 for Meitei–Kuki couples. Many were forced apart during evacuations, fleeing in opposite directions for safety. Over time, it became routine — marriages sustained through phone calls, reunions deferred without timelines. Late last year, there were faint signs that the worst might be over. Some couples began, carefully, to plan. The murder on Jan 21 shook everything up again.Mawaibam Bishorjit, 30, a Meitei man, and his wife Thaja Moirang, 27, a Kuki woman from Moreh, married in 2015. Bishorjit worked as a band member at wedding functions. The couple and their two kids — a three-year-old daughter, and an 11-year-old son — fled Moreh on the night of May 3, 2023, and have been living in a relief camp set up at Ideal Girls’ College in Imphal.“If the killing of Rishikanta had not happened, we probably would have continued to plan to return home,” Bishorjit said. “We want to go back, but there must be adequate security in Moreh,” Moirang added. “Without protection, it is not possible.”A 36-year-old Meitei schoolteacher in Imphal, separated from her Kuki husband since July 2023, said she had resumed conversations she once believed were closed chapters — where they might live, which school their daughter could attend. “We were talking about when, not if,” she said. Her husband, an electrician based near Churachandpur, now discourages even tentative plans. “He keeps saying, ‘We wait'.”In the 65km between Imphal and Churachandpur lies a network of buffer zones that have become part of daily calculation for separated couples. Officially meant to prevent clashes, they function in practice as lived borders — shaped by identity checks and ethnic profiling. A 42-year-old Meitei govt clerk, whose Kuki wife has been living with her parents in the hills since 2023, put it simply: “On paper, it’s a few hours’ drive. In reality, it’s a line you don’t cross unless you must.”The drive from Imphal to Churachandpur — which once took a little over an hour — is punctuated by at least seven checkpoints where identity cards are checked and names, Aadhaar numbers, and vehicle details recorded. People know where they are not allowed to go. Meiteis do not enter Churachandpur. Kukis do not travel into the valley. The road exists. Passage does not.Thogjam Haokip, 70, a retired Kuki church pastor, has been married to his Meitei wife Kim, 50, for nearly three decades. Their marriage predates the conflict. “We are not afraid. But we are not blind,"" Kim said. We often think about how things would have turned out had we been living in another place. Would we be safe elsewhere? The thought gnaws at us.”","Mayanglambam Rishikanta Singh, a 31‑year‑old Meitei man who had been working in Nepal, was abducted and shot dead in Churachandpur.

At the end of the day, all parties are in pain, they are grieving and all of you suffered. Lead a good life rather than fight,” Justice Pushkarna said.Sunjay, 53, died in London in June last year.The judge asked the senior counsel appearing for Sunjay’s mother, his wife and his sister to sit down together to solve their issues in a manner in which everyone’s interests were safeguarded. “All of you should try to respect relations… The way forward is resolution in a peaceful manner. Efforts need to be from both sides,” Justice Pushkarna observed orally.The HC was dealing with a lawsuit by Sunjay’s mother Rani Kapur for a purported family trust to be declared “null and void”. In her lawsuit against daughter-in-law Priya and others, 80-year-old Rani alleged that the trust, constituted in Oct 2017, was a product of “forged, fabricated and fraudulent” documents, and that she was wrongly divested of all her rights, assets and legacy.The high court also highlighted the need for Priya to realise it was Rani’s husband (Surinder Kapur) who “founded everything”, and the fruits of his labour should be shared by all.The HC issued notice to Priya and others on a plea by Rani to stay disbursal of dividends from a group company to her daughter-in-law and to preserve the estate. It also sought her stand on Priya’s claim that the suit be rejected.Rani’s suit says she is the sole beneficiary of the entire estate belonging to her late husband, Surinder, who was the promoter of various businesses, including Sona Group of Companies, and a “systematic fraud” was committed on her when the assets were transferred to the “RK Family Trust”.A separate plea by the two children of actor Karisma Kapoor, Sunjay’s former wife, challenging the authenticity of the purported will of their late father is also pending in the HC.","Delhi HC advises family of late industrialist Sunjay Kapur to go for mediation.

Advisories are also going out for other days.With PMs of the Netherlands, Finland and Estonia, along with UK deputy PM David Lammy and his counterparts from Sweden and South Korea also in town, security in central Delhi will be tight.The IT ministry, which is hosting the summit, is also ensuring that venue arrangements go beyond food and water availability to focus on delegate comfort and sustainability.","Hotels such as Maurya, Taj Mahal & Palace, Leela, Oberoi, Imperial & JW Marriott are sold out.

NEW DELHI: Cracking down on deepfakes, the Centre has tightened India's digital rules by mandating compulsory labelling, traceability and user declarations for AI-generated content. It has also sharply cut timelines to take down unlawful content to as little as three hours from 36 hours and placed direct compliance responsibility on social media platforms and their senior officers.For the first time, AI-generated material, including deepfake videos, synthetic audio and manipulated visuals, has been brought under a formal regulatory framework through amendments to the IT intermediary rules. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, 2026 will come into force from Feb 20.The amended rules introduce a statutory definition of ""synthetically generated information"" (SGI).The new rules impose mandatory obligations on intermediaries to identify, label and trace AI content. All AI-generated or AI-altered material must carry a clear and prominent disclosure visible to users.Platforms must also embed persistent metadata and unique identifiers to enable traceability of the content’s origin and the tools used to create it. Once applied, these disclosures cannot be altered, hidden or removed.The rules exclude routine edits such as colour correction, noise reduction, compression or translation, as long as they do not change the meaning. Clearly hypothetical or illustrative drafts are exempt.Large social media platforms face stricter compliance requirements. Before any content goes live, platforms must ensure users declare if it is AI-generated. Intermediaries must deploy automated tools to verify these declarations by analysing the content’s format, source and characteristics. If content is identified as synthetic, visible labelling becomes mandatory. Platforms that knowingly allow unlabelled AI-generated content to remain online will be treated as having failed their due-diligence obligations.The rules also compress response timelines. Certain lawful takedown orders must now be complied with within three hours, compared to 36 hours earlier. Other deadlines have been tightened, with a 15-day window reduced to 7 days and a 24-hour window cut to 12 hours. Platforms must acknowledge user grievances within two hours and resolve them within seven days.Oversight and enforcement will rest with the ministry of electronics and information technology, while users can appeal platform decisions to the grievance appellate committee.Misuse of SGI linked to child sexual abuse material, obscene content, false electronic records, impersonation using a real person’s identity or voice, or explosives-related material will attract action under multiple criminal laws.Platforms must also warn users at least once every three months about penalties for misuse of AI-generated content.","The Centre has tightened India's digital rules by mandating compulsory labelling, traceability and user declarations for AI-generated content.

NEW DELHI: Any hope of normalcy returning to LS was apparently dashed when opposition stepped up their offensive and submitted a notice for the removal of the Speaker. In a twist, it turned out to be the end of a week-long impasse, laying bare faultlines within the opposition as pragmatic voices wanting to be heard on key issues in the House prevailed over those favouring uncompromising rigidity and confrontation.LS functioned normally even though the govt did not agree to the conditions set by Congress: allowing LoP Rahul Gandhi to speak, rectification of the Speaker’s “baseless” claim that he had to request PM not to speak during the debate on motion of thanks to the President for her address in view of plans of Congress’ MPs to do something unprecedented, and a probe into why BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s mic was not switched off when he attacked Nehru-Gandhi family.The prevailing view within govt was that it had come out better in the battle of wits by not making any concession to the key Congress demand of allowing Rahul to speak first and revoking the suspension of eight MPs to defuse the crisis that had stalled proceedings.What helped the govt defuse the impasse was the keenness among some key regional BJP rivals for LS to function and allow discussion on regional concerns. Bengal and Tamil Nadu, where TMC and DMK are in office, are headed to polls, while political temperature is rising in UP, where Samajwadi Party is the main opposition party, with elections only a year away.While TMC made its differences clear by not signing the notice, MPs from different non-Congress oppn parties suggested many of them did not want the first half of the session to be consumed by the deadlock.Across the aisle, BJP’s allies stood firm with the govt, backing the Speaker and criticising the opposition for targeting a constitutional office.Taking high moral ground, Birla decided not to attend till the notice is disposed of, signalling the matter may be taken up later in the session.",LS functioned normally even though the govt did not agree to the conditions set by Congress.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday warned of potential damage to its alliance with Maharashtra ally Shiv Sena (UBT), after the Uddhav Thackeray-led party, along with others, teamed up with the BJP, resulting in the election of the saffron party’s candidate as mayor of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.The development was a major setback for the Congress, which was poised to win the mayor’s post but lost by just one vote.BJP corporator Sangeeta Khandekar was elected mayor, while Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Prashant Danav became deputy mayor.Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal alleged “horse-trading” and blamed Shiv Sena (UBT), Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA).“In the Chandrapur mayoral election, the BJP secured 32 votes and Congress 31. The Sena (UBT) is an ally in the Maha Vikas Aghadi and the INDIA bloc. With its six corporators, the Sena (UBT) was expected to support the Congress. But the party chose to go with the BJP. This development will have consequences in the state,” Sapkal told reporters in Mumbai.“The BJP also gained the upper hand with the support of the AIMIM. If the VBA, with whom we had formed a genuine alliance in the civic body polls, had backed the Congress, our candidate would have won.There was horse-trading,” Sapkal added.Addressing the factional feud within the Chandrapur Congress, he said Congress corporators were “united,” and that he had personally resolved differences among party leaders in the city.“It is only because of the Shiv Sena (UBT), AIMIM, and VBA that the BJP could install its mayor,” the Maharashtra Congress chief asserted.Till Monday, alliances in the 66-member Chandrapur Municipal Corporation remained unclear following a fractured verdict in the January 15 polls.The Congress emerged as the largest party with 27 seats, while the BJP came a close second with 23, triggering a race between the two rivals to form a coalition and secure the mayor and deputy mayor posts.The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), a former BJP ally, won six seats, while three went to the Bharatiya Shetkari Kamgar Paksh (Janvikas Sena), two to the VBA, and one each to AIMIM, BSP, and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena, a BJP ally. Two independents also secured wins. The poll results were declared on January 16.","Congress warns of potential damage to its alliance with Maharashtra ally Shiv Sena (UBT) The Uddhav Thackeray-led party, along with others, teamed up with the BJP, resulting in the election of the saffron party’s candidate as mayor of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128165693,imgsize-30478,width-400,resizemode-4/harshvardhan-sapkal.jpg"

Draft resolution accuses Birla of ‘openly backing ruling party’

New Delhi: Accusing Speaker Om Birla of ""blatant partisanship"" in the running of the Lok Sabha, a joint opposition barring Trinamool Congress Tuesday submitted a notice for his removal from office, escalating the simmering tensions between the govt and the opposition to a point that raises questions about the future of their working relationship.Birla has decided to stay away from the LS proceedings till the no-confidence resolution is settled. He could have continued until the resolution was formally moved in the House. There are indications that the motion against him would now be taken up on March 9 when Parliament is scheduled to convene after the recess. The twin prompt moves reflect a desire to take the moral high ground as well as confidence in NDA's numbers.The notice under Article 94 (c) - signed by 119 MPs - was submitted to the Lok Sabha secretary general by Gaurav Gogoi, K Suresh and Mohammed Jawed Tuesday afternoon, after the presiding officer did not again allow Rahul Gandhi to speak at the start of the proceedings and then at the start of zero hour, which both led to adjournments.Om Birla had objected to Gandhi insisting on citing the unpublished book of Gen M M Naravane to attack the govt.It was suggested that the leader of the opposition’s brief remarks about the opposition’s grievances would be followed by their cooperation to start the stalled discussion on the Budget.The short draft resolution attached to the removal notice for discussion in the House accuses Birla of “openly espousing the version of the ruling party (sic) on all controversial matters”.The anti-BJP camp clinched the fraught move against the Chair within a day of floating it at a meeting that was called to brainstorm on the future course of action in the wake of the govt-Chair’s repeated refusal to allow Gandhi to speak so long as he did not commit not to cite from the memoir of the retired general, which was behind the protests and the logjam. It marked an alacrity of action not seen in the INDIA bloc’s strategic moves in the 18th Lok Sabha. The bigwigs of the bloc signed the notice — Akhilesh Yadav and Dharmendra Yadav (SP), T R Baalu (DMK), N K Premachandran (RSP), E T Mohd Basheer (IUML), Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi (NC), Nilesh Lanke (NCP), Misha Bharti (RJD), and members of JMM among others.While K C Venugopal and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra among other MPs signed for Congress, Rahul Gandhi as LoP did not put his name to the notice. Sena UBT misssed signing the petition owing to miscommunication over the timing of submission.However, TMC stood out for its objection to the initiation of the extreme step at this stage, with Abhishek Banerjee telling reporters that the opposition should exhaust other steps before resorting to “no confidence”. As reported by TOI, he suggested that the opposition write a letter to the Speaker first. While denying any objection to the move, Banerjee argued that a nuanced approach was preferable, citing that TMC’s push for impeachment of CEC Gyanesh Kumar has come only after the party has gone to court, met the watchdog and also written to him. A Trinamool neta even said the party would sign the notice if the opposition waited till Thursday.The notice has listed the stormy events of the ongoing budget session as evidence of Birla’s “partisan manner”. It starts with the Chair’s denial of permission to Rahul Gandhi to speak on Feb 2 on former Army chief M M Naravane’s book about the 2020 Chinese aggression as part of his speech on the motion of thanks. The other complaints include Birla’s observation — made a day after PM Modi’s no-show for his scheduled response to the motion of thanks — that female MPs from Congress posed a threat to the PM which could have resulted in an “unprecedented incident”; suspension of eight opposition MPs; and permission to a BJP MP (Nishikant Dubey) to “make wholly objectionable and personalised attacks” on two former PMs without any reprimand, and the absence of action against him as demanded by the opposition.",Om Birla has decided to stay away from the LS proceedings till the no-confidence resolution is settled.

NEW DELHI: World-renowned astrophysicist Prof Duncan Lorimer, who led the discovery of the first Fast Radio Burst (FRB) as among the brightest and most mysterious radio pulses in the universe, said here on Monday that the “universe is expanding” and that with “new and improved telescopes coming up in the US and Canada, we can find out more deep mysteries of this universe”.A fast radio burst (FRB) is an intensely bright, millisecond-long flash of radio waves originating from deep space, often from billions of light-years away. These fleeting, high-energy events emit as much energy in a fraction of a second as the sun does over several weeks.The first FRB was discovered by Lorimer and his student David Narkevic in 2007 when they were looking through archival pulsar survey data, and it is, therefore, commonly referred to as the ‘Lorimer burst’.During a discussion on ‘The Brightest Pulses in the Universe’ at the PM Museum and Library (PMML), Nehru Planetarium here, Lorimer, a fellow of the Royal Society, and professor of physics and astronomy at West Virginia University, USA, lauded two Indian researchers and his colleagues— Shamil Chatterjee and Shriharsh Tendulkar — for playing significant roles in identifying the host galaxy and origin of repeating Fast Radio Bursts .Duncan Lorimer and his wife Maura McLaughlin had received the Shaw Prize, described as the “Nobel Prize of the East”, for helping discover FRBs.Whenasked the astrophysicist of any possibility of aliens trying to contact humans from other parts of the universe through different radio frequencies, Lorimer said, “There is a possibility that some fractions of fast radio burst might have an unexpected phenomenon. If we dig deeper into the data as we get tens and thousands of signals, we might find some that are anonymous. There might be some components in future (with links to aliens). I might not have seen it directly till now.”On the divided opinion of scientists about the real characteristics of alleged interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS that had entered the Milky Way galaxy last year, Lorimer stayed away from the controversy, saying, “I did not follow that story, so I don’t have an opinion on it.”While interacting with students, Lorimer explained to them the origin and characteristics of neutron stars, deep holes and radio bursts from different galaxies.Highlighting the significance of the event, Ashwani Lohani, director, PMML, said: “It is a great privilege for PMML and Nehru Planetarium to host Prof. Duncan Lorimer. This interaction is a wonderful opportunity for students, young researchers, and the wider public to engage directly with a scientist whose work has transformed our understanding of the universe. Such events inspire curiosity, scientific temper and a deeper appreciation of India’s growing engagement with global science. ”","World-renowned astrophysicist Prof Duncan Lorimer led the discovery of the first Fast Radio Burst.

Age relaxation: The ability to deduct the years of military service plus three years from their actual age for civil job eligibility,” the ministry said. Under rule 2, clause (c) amendment, the definition of ‘ex-servicemen’ now explicitly lists 'Military Nursing Service of the Indian Union alongside Regular Army, Navy, and Air Force, it said.On April 17, last year, a Supreme Court division bench, comprising Justice PS Narasimha and Justice Manoj Misra, had passed the aforementioned order while upholding the ruling of a division bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in Feb 2024.The matter came under judicial scrutiny following a petition filed by Captain Gurpreet Kaur of MNS, who had cleared the examination for Punjab Civil Services in 2021, but her candidature was rejected on the ground that she was not an “ESM (ex-servicemen)”. She had then approached the HC, pointing out that MNS was an “Armed Force of the Union” under the statute and that the Punjab ESM rules covered short service officers released on completion of terms of engagement with gratuity under the definition of ESM.","The notification of Ex-servicemen (Re-employment in Central Civil Services & Posts) Amendment Rules 2026 under Article 309 of the Constitution, which came into effect on Feb 9, will boost rehabilitation and second-career opportunities.

No bunkers built in border areas even 10 months after Op Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-bunkers-built-in-border-areas-even-10-months-after-op-sindoor/articleshow/128172472.cms,"Inside Jaish’s Kargil-Style Terror Bunker In J&K Where Maggi, Rice, Gas And Grenades Were Stocked

JAMMU: Nearly 10 months after Operation Sindoor , there has been no progress on constructing bunkers in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir that witnessed heavy Pakistani shelling, including Poonch, where at least 18 people were killed.“No stone has been moved in Uri after the operation,” Sajjad Shafi, MLA from the Uri constituency in Baramulla district, told TOI. Shafi said a number of houses were damaged during the shelling, forcing large-scale evacuations. While the evacuations saved lives, assurances about constructing bunkers had not been honoured, the MLA said. “Our topography makes community bunkers difficult to access during intense shelling. Every house should have its own bunker,” he said.Echoing the need for individual bunkers, Muzaffar Iqbal Khan, MLA from Thanamandi in Rajouri, said: “Houses are kilometres apart. No one can step out during shelling to reach a community bunker.”Poonch MLA Ajaz Jan of NC said: “When shelling takes place, the Army is forced to first focus on evacuating civilians and rescuing the injured before responding. Permanent bunkers would strengthen defence and reduce pressure on security forces,” he said.According to officials over 500 bunkers have been sanctioned for Uri by MHA and work on them is expected to begin in April 2026. In Nov 2025, the J&K administration had said a proposal to set up 5,693 bunkers in Poonch had been submitted for approval to MHA.","Nearly 10 months after Operation Sindoor, there has been no progress on constructing bunkers in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir.

Mismatch in fertiliser DBT buyers and PM-KISAN data raises red flags for panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mismatch-in-fertiliser-dbt-buyers-and-pm-kisan-data-raises-red-flags-for-panel/articleshow/128170178.cms,"File photo (for representative purpose only)

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over the diversion of subsidised fertilisers, a parliamentary panel has recommended that the govt expedite the integration of Aadhaar authentication with a comprehensive “farmer’s registry” to ensure better targeting of fertiliser subsidies and prevent unauthorised buyers from exploiting the system.The Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilisers, in its report submitted to Parliament on Tuesday, noted the fertiliser department’s submission that its Integrated Fertiliser Management System (iFMS) portal has “identified approximately 18.7 crore unique buyers under the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system and 6.25 crore buyers have availed the fertiliser subsidy till Jan, 2025 which contradicts the farmer population when compared with the PM-KISAN database of agriculture ministry, which records 9.8 crore farmers”.It said this highlights the need for further scrutiny to identify genuine beneficiaries.The panel headed by Congress MP Kirti Azad recorded its concern that buyer identification under the DBT in fertiliser subsidy scheme is established only through Aadhaar authentication on a ‘no denial basis,’ without a well-defined mechanism to ascertain the actual beneficiary.“As a result, subsidised fertilisers, particularly urea, are susceptible to diversion for stocking, black-marketing, and use in industrial sectors such as resin/ adhesives, plastics/ foams, textiles/ leather, and paper/ pulp industries.It is apparent that different syndicates might be functional in this field to benefit from the shortcomings of the DBT system in place allowing purchase of subsidised fertilisers in connivance of implementing agencies creating shortages and black-marketing,” it said.As per the current provision, each beneficiary can purchase up to 50 bags of subsidised fertiliser per month.Taking note of the efforts made by the department to explore the use of the PM-KISAN database and integration of the farmer’s registry with the digital platform of fertilisers department, it has recommended that all necessary measures should be taken for early integration of iFMS platform with farmers’ registry incorporating landholding, cropping patterns, and soil health data besides broadening the Direct Cash Transfer (DCT) Scheme to select districts of different regions to correctly understand the fertiliser purchase behaviours of farmers for a comprehensive understanding of the constraints in the DBT.The panel has recommended that necessary modifications should be made to the DBT system to ensure that benefits percolate directly to both landowners and landless farmers who cultivate leased land.","The Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilisers, in its report submitted to Parliament on Tuesday, noted the fertiliser department’s submission.

This scheme will significantly reduce the financial burden on the public, while ensuring access to quality health services.""Referring to the public response, he said, ""The scheme has received an overwhelming response from the people of Punjab, who are coming forward in large numbers to avail its benefits.This initiative has provided major relief to families who otherwise would have had to spend huge amounts from their own pockets for treatment in case of illness.""However, he cautioned against ""misinformation"", saying, ""some anti-Punjab forces, who do not want the people of the state to benefit from such facilities, are deliberately spreading falsehoods about this ambitious scheme.""Clarifying the hospital empanelment process, Mann said, ""The state government has empanelled a majority of private hospitals under the scheme.

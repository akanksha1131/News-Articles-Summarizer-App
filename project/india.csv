What is an Atomic Clock?

What are the benefits of the project?

How will the transition happen?

NEW DELHI: The country may be on Indian Standard Time (IST), but the exact time is determined by GPS satellites , down to the millisecond, and is linked to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).In the next few months this is set to change with Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) being the link to National Physical Laboratory to provide the reference time. A lab in Faridabad will receive the time from NavIC which will be shared through an optic fibre link with four other centres - Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar and Guwahati - with each having an atomic clock .The deployment of atomic clocks will ensure the time shown on digital watches, smartphones and laptops is based on the atomic clocks instead of service providers accessing data from multiple sources linked to GPS. Soon, the regional centres will disseminate the time to all end users - resulting in ""one nation, one time"".The satellite system was conceived soon after the Kargil war, when India could not get the exact location of targets from foreign satellites. Govt realised that strategic importance and finally got moving on the project around seven years ago.Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said most of the work for the Times Dissemination Project has been completed with atomic clocks installed in Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Bhubaneswar. A few months ago, the NavIC link with NPL Faridabad was tested. The department, which is working with NPL and Isro to disseminate IST with millisecond to microsecond accuracy, will have to align the clocks in four centres with Faridabad to adjust for the time taken for sharing the data through the optic fibre cable.An atomic clock is a clock known for its exceptional accuracy, and functions by utilising specific resonance frequencies of atoms. The extreme precision levels of the atomic clocks can be interpreted by the fact that they will lose one second every 100 million years or so.Former consumer affairs secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said it will establish India's own precise and reliable time distribution network, reducing dependence on foreign systems and enhancing national security. ""It will benefit critical sectors like power grids, telecommunications, banking, defence, and transportation by ensuring synchronised operations, efficiency, and resilience against cyber threats,"" he said.While technical work is underway, the consumer affairs department has notified the draft rules, mandating the use of IST as the sole time reference for legal, administrative, commercial, and official documents across the country.Exceptions will be allowed for specialised fields such as astronomy, navigation, and scientific research, subject to prior govt approval with violations attracting penalty.","Atomic clocks will ensure the time shown on digital watches, smartphones and laptops is based on the atomic clocks.

Waqf bill joint parliament panel to formally adopt tweaks tomorrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-bill-joint-parliament-panel-to-formally-adopt-tweaks-tomorrow/articleshow/117615254.cms,"Waqf bill joint parliament panel to formally adopt tweaks tomorrow

NEW DELHI: Brushing aside opposition's protests and amid accusations of interference in religious affairs of Muslims, BJP and its allies on JPC Monday cleared key changes to Waqf Act, clearing the way for the end of ""waqf by user"" scheme, where properties are deemed to be a Muslim religious charity only on the basis of the word's current usage.If the bill incorporating the changes recommended by the JPC are approved, all waqf claims will have to be backed by registered deeds.The proposed changes, such as inclusion of two non-Muslims, excluding officials who may be there by virtue of their positions, in Central Waqf Council, seek to overhaul the administration of waqf properties worth hundreds of billions of rupees.The JPC adopted all 32 amendments proposed by NDA, while turning down all suggested by opposition by a vote. Congress, TMC, DMK and AIMIM are expected to register their dissent.The JPC has called for the inclusion of up to four non-Muslims in state waqf boards. It also adopted an amendment to take minority Muslim sects like Dawoodi Bohras and Agakhanis out of the jurisdiction of waqf boards, mostly Sunni-controlled bodies.Another crucial amendment as per sources is that a person claiming to be a Muslim and wanting to donate his assets to waqf needs to produce evidence to show that he has been practising the faith for at least five years. The changes are going to be formally adopted by by JPC at its meeting Wednesday to complete the procedural requirement for the bill to be referred back to Parliament and for govt to draw the time-table to seek its passage. Sources in govt said they were ready to move.The outcome, marked by protests by opposition, was significant because of the steadfast support of BJP's allies JDU, TDP and Lok Janshakti Party which have often been sensitive to concerns of their Muslim constituents. The unity in the ruling bloc augurs well for the passage of the bill in the two Houses.Govt has justified the proposed changes by saying they were necessary to tackle the misuse of ""waqf by user"" provision, check corruption in waqf bodies and for making them more inclusive. Another amendment adopted by the panel proposes to do away with vesting any inquiry into disputes over a govt property with the district collector and making room for the state govt to designate an officer above the rank of collector to carry out the inquiry.It is also proposed to allow waqf boards to decide on welfare measures for widows and orphans, among others, instead of mandating it by law. Meanwhile, JPC chairman Jagdambika Pal rejected the opposition's charges, claiming the entire exercise was democratic and the majority view prevailed.","The JPC adopted all 32 amendments proposed by NDA, while turning down all suggested by opposition by a vote.

When and where to watch in India?

Skywatchers are in for a celestial treat as six planets—Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—align in a rare astronomical phenomenon. This spectacular display will be visible from January 21 to January 31.An official told the news agency PTI, that Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn will be visible to the naked eye, creating a stunning formation in the evening sky.The official explained that while Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn will create a visible spectacle observable without equipment, viewing Neptune and Uranus will require optical aids such as binoculars or telescopes.Parade of planets is a phrase people use when two or more planets are visible in the night sky. However, Nasa has specified that it is not an astronomical term. So why is the term is used?The presence of bright planets like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus in a single viewing makes this particular event particularly rare and distinctive. Jupiter shines brightly, while Venus and Mars are reaching their peak brilliance in the post-sunset sky for the first time in years.With Saturn still prominently visible and Mercury making occasional appearances, four or five planets can easily be spotted with the naked eye, creating a captivating celestial spectacle.Space.com explains that all planets in our solar system follow orbital paths around the sun along a specific plane known as the ecliptic. This results in planets appearing in a linear formation when viewed from Earth. Although these linear arrangements are regular occurrences in our sky, they are typically classified as planetary alignments.In India, astronomers across India have prepared for events where people can witness the planets. However, if one can’t attend an organized session, several apps can guide you in exploring the night sky on your own.The Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre (TNSTC) had organised a special night sky observation for the public at Periyar Science and Technology Centre in Kottupuram from Jan 22 to 25 (from 6pm to 8pm).""You can see Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars from your terrace or from the beach. Mars will rise around 9pm,"" said I K Lenin Tamilkovan, executive director, TNSTC.The Department of Science and Technology's Pathani Samanta Planetarium in Bhubaneswar has established suitable facilities to accommodate astronomy enthusiasts for this event.The official confirmed that visitors can observe this uncommon phenomenon daily between 5.30 pm and 7.30 pm.","Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune will align in a rare astronomical phenomenon.

Hindu Sena Chief Vishnu Gupta Allegedly Shot at Near Ajmer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/hindu-sena-petitioner-in-ajmer-dargah-case-shot-at/articleshow/117562555.cms,"AJMER/JAIPUR: Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta alleged Saturday that two unidentified assailants fired at his car around 6 am while he was traveling from Ajmer to his home in New Delhi. Gupta had been in Ajmer to attend a court hearing Friday regarding his lawsuit claiming that a Shiva temple once existed beneath the dargah of 13th-century Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in the city.The alleged attack occurred near Gagwana Ladpura Bridge on the outskirts of Ajmer. ""The moment I heard the gunshots, I told my driver to accelerate immediately. When I glanced back, I saw two men on a motorcycle riding away in the opposite direction,"" Gupta said. He lodged a police complaint and claimed the attack was an attempt to intimidate him and obstruct his legal battle over the Ajmer dargah.Ajmer SP Vandita Rana said that a mark on Gupta's car appeared to be from a pistol shot, but added that the investigation is still underway.“A forensic team was called to examine the crime scene. No arrests have been made, and an investigation is underway,” she said. CCTV footage from the area is being reviewed, but no major leads have been found .This is not the first time Gupta has reported threats to his life. In Nov last year, he filed a complaint in Ajmer, alleging that he had received death threats from an anonymous caller demanding he withdraw his petition. On Jan 23, Gupta demanded police protection, saying his life was in danger due to his lawsuit.Born in 1984 in UP’s Etah, Gupta moved to New Delhi as a child. He claims his political journey began at the age of seven when he participated in the 1991 Ram Janmabhoomi movement. He later joined Shiv Sena’s Delhi youth wing as vice president but resigned due to the party’s stand against north Indians in Mumbai.Gupta’s activities have included provocative demonstrations and inflammatory speeches in Delhi, UP, Haryana, and MP. He first came into the spotlight in 2011 when he assaulted Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan during a press conference.In 2017, he and his supporters attempted to attack CPM leader Sitaram Yechury. His name also surfaced in connection with the 2021 attack on AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s home.Gupta was detained in 2015 over the Kerala House controversy, where his claims about beef being served at the govt guesthouse in New Delhi were later debunked. He also made headlines for his public support of Donald Trump.Gupta’s petition was admitted by an Ajmer civil court on Nov 27 last year.

UCC criticism

What is the implementation process?

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand is set to make history on Monday by becoming the first state in post-independence India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami will officially launch the UCC portal and issue a notification marking the adoption of the civil code, following the completion of government employee training, mock drills, and dry-run sessions.""The UCC's implementation represents a significant milestone, making the Himalayan state the first in the country to adopt this progressive legislation since independence,"" Dhami said.CM Dhami said that the UCC was drafted after extensive consultations with experts, locals, and representatives from various communities, with the goal of bringing uniformity in society and empowering women.The UCC addresses various societal issues, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships. Key aspects of the law include the registration of marriages, divorces, and live-in relationships to ensure equal property rights and protect children's rights, with penalties for non-compliance.UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions. The move has sparked both support and criticism, with proponents arguing for equality and opponents warning of potential societal divisions.The UCC clarifies legal requirements for marriage, stating that only mentally capable individuals aged 21 (for men) or 18 (for women) who are not already married may enter into a union. Marriages can be performed according to religious customs, but registration will be mandatory to ensure legal recognition.The law also addresses issues related to the creation and cancellation of wills and codicils under testamentary succession. Marriages solemnized before March 26, 2010, or those outside the state will be eligible for registration if legal requirements are met.Opposition leaders have criticized the UCC, arguing that it may lead to societal division along religious lines and might be impractical and overly ambitious.The debate surrounding the UCC extends beyond Uttarakhand, as Article 44 of the Indian Constitution advocates for a uniform civil code across the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has referenced the Supreme Court's direction on the need for a common code, stressing that fulfilling the vision of the Constitution's framers remains a national goal.Uttarakhand's implementation of the UCC is likely to set a precedent, with other states potentially following suit. The success of the law's implementation will depend on its ability to balance individual rights and social harmony.As Uttarakhand stands at the forefront of this legal revolution, the coming weeks will offer a clearer picture of how the UCC will be received, both in the state and across India. The state's experience with the UCC will undoubtedly shape the future of personal law reform in the country.Shailesh Bagauli, secretary (home), stated that the government will issue two notifications: one for the implementation of the UCC and another for the rules and regulations, officially launching the UCC in the state.Dhami had promised to implement the UCC if re-elected during the 2022 state polls. After becoming CM, he appointed a five-member committee led by Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai to draft the code, which received feedback from over 2.3 lakh people, representing nearly 10% of Uttarakhand's families.The 740-page draft was presented to the chief minister on February 2, 2024, approved by the cabinet on February 4, tabled in the assembly on February 6, and passed the following day. Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) approved the bill on February 28 and President Droupadi Murmu subsequently signed it on March 11.","UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions. The move has sparked both support and criticism, with proponents arguing for equality and opponents warning of potential societal divisions. Uttarakhand's implementation of the UCC is likely to set a precedent, with other states potentially following suit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117589207,imgsize-808131,width-400,resizemode-4/117589207.jpg"

Trump talks fair trade with Modi; PM to visit US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-talks-fair-trade-with-modi-pm-to-visit-us/articleshow/117612669.cms,"PM Narendra Modi spoke to US President Donald Trump Monday, pledging to work for global peace, prosperity and security. Amid concerns in India about Trump’s threat to hike tariffs on imports from India and elsewhere, as also possible friction over illegal immigration, Modi said in a post on X that both sides are committed to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership.This was Modi’s first conversation with “my dear friend” Trump since the latter’s inauguration on January 20. While ties with the US in areas like defence, technology, counterterrorism, energy and space are expected to flourish further during the second Trump administration, fears remain about Trump’s possibly disruptive trade policies and his mass deportation threats.According to the White House, Trump emphasized the importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a “fair bilateral trading relationship”. “The leaders discussed plans for Prime Minister Modi to visit the White House, underscoring the strength of the friendship and strategic ties between our nations,” said the White House readout.“Delighted to speak with my dear friend President Donald Trump. Congratulated him on his historic second term. We are committed to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership. We will work together for the welfare of our people and towards global peace, prosperity and security,’’ said Modi in a post on X on Monday evening.Modi and Trump discussed various facets of the wide-ranging bilateral Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership and measures to advance it, including in the areas of technology, trade, investment, energy and defence, said the Indian government in a readout. The two leaders exchanged views on global issues, including the situation in West Asia and Ukraine and agreed to meet soon.The conversation came ahead of a possible meeting between the 2 leaders on the margins of the AI summit that France will host next month. Trump has been invited for the summit and Modi has already confirmed his participation. India and the US are also in touch diplomatically for a bilateral visit by Modi to the US in the next few months, well before Trump travels to India for the Quad summit later this year.It also followed external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with his counterpart Marco Rubio in which the former raised issues related to delay in issuance of US visas to Indian nationals and Rubio brought up irregular migration from India. While India is open to taking back illegal migrants, as it was with the Biden administration and even earlier with the first Trump presidency, it wants enough time to be able to first verify the Indian origin of 18,000 illegals that US authorities have identified for deportation to India. While the Indian government wants to work with US authorities to address the issue, it has distanced itself from the number saying any discussion on numbers will be premature at this stage. For the US, India remains one of the largest sources of illegal immigration outside of Latin America.","PM Narendra Modi spoke to US President Donald Trump Monday.

NEW DELHI: A CBI court in Chandigarh sentenced Himachal Pradesh inspector general (IG) of Police Zahur Haider Zaidi and seven other police personnel to life imprisonment on Monday. The sentence follows their involvement in the custodial death of an accused in the rape and murder of a 16-year-old schoolgirl in Shimla 's Kotkhai in 2017.The convicted police officers include the then deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Manoj Joshi, sub-inspector Rajinder Singh, assistant sub-inspector Deep Chand Sharma, head constables Mohan Lal, Surat Singh, and Rafee Mohammad, along with Constable Ranjit Sateta.During the sentencing hearing, the counsels for the convicts sought leniency, citing their age, family responsibilities, and good service records.The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on the convicts.Earlier, on January 18, the Special CBI court convicted the eight police officers in the case related to the custodial death of Suraj, who was found dead at the Kotkhai police station on July 18, 2017. Special judge Alka Malik presided over the case.The convicted officials were found guilty under several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 302 (murder), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to extort confession), 348 (wrongful confinement), and 195 (giving false evidence), according to CBI public prosecutor Amit Jindal.The case stems from the death of Suraj, who was accused in the rape and murder of the 16-year-old girl. The girl had gone missing on July 4, 2017, and her body was discovered two days later. The post-mortem confirmed that she had been raped and murdered, leading to a case being filed.A Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by Zaidi, was formed by the state government to investigate the case. The SIT arrested six people, including Suraj, who died in police custody. The police had initially registered an FIR against another accused, Rajinder, in the girl’s murder.The Himachal Pradesh high court later transferred both cases to the CBI for further investigation. After an inquiry, the CBI arrested Zaidi, Joshi, and the other police officers involved in Suraj’s custodial death.The CBI chargesheeted the accused officials for various offenses, including criminal conspiracy, murder, fabrication of false evidence, and torture during custody to extract a confession.In May 2019, the Supreme Court transferred the case related to the custodial death from Shimla to Chandigarh.The court also acquitted the then Superintendent of Police, DW Negi, in connection with the case.",Zahur Haider Zaidi and seven other police personnel sentenced to life imprisonment.

NEW DELHI: By getting its govt to promulgate UCC in Uttarakhand, BJP has signalled its allegiance to one of its foundational pledges and assured its cadre and supporters of its bonafides.Given difficulties involved in implementing UCC across the country, BJP decided to approach the task incrementally. Issues concerning marriage and divorce fall in the Concurrent List, the terrain where both the Centre and states are competent to make laws, and this afforded a way out. So did the demography of the Hindu-preponderant Uttarakhand that ruled out the risk of any large-scale disruption.Also read: If tribals agree, they would also be brought under UCC, says Dhami While the legislation was supposed to be the baby of the state govt, it was Centre that, for all practical purposes, negotiated the process - right from choices of members of the committee headed by retired SC judge Ranjana Desai.Home minister Amit Shah was closely involved in the process and would regularly hold deliberations with CM Pushkar Dhami. The collaboration enhanced the possibility of Uttarakhand UCC being a pilot for similar laws being planned by BJP-governed UP, Gujarat & Assam. Assam CM Himanta Sarma appears to be especially keen to get going.With UCC in Uttarakhand in place and others expected to follow suit, BJP can claim to have delivered on another component of its 'core' agenda. The party has already made good on its promises on construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, scrapping J&K's special status and criminalising triple talaq. That Uttarakhand UCC came into force the same day when BJP, along with its allies, deployed its majority to push through crucial amendments to Waqf Act was sheer coincidence. The JPC on Waqf would have wrapped up its business in winter session itself if govt had its way.But the coincidence only served to amplify the message of BJP delivering on its promises and enhances the prospect of similar actions both in Delhi and in BJP-administered state capitals.In its third term, Modi govt had revived the issue by referring UCC to the Law Commission once again. The parliamentary standing committee on law and justice simultaneously took up the subject for study and building consensus with different stakeholders. Short of recommending UCC, Law Commission, in its 2018 'consultation paper', had suggested wide-ranging reforms in various family laws to bring gender justice and equality. It recommended uniform age for marriage, its compulsory registration, age of majority (18 years) to be recognised as legal age for men and women for marriage, uniform application of laws for bigamy and divorce with provision for maintenance, recognising polygamy as a criminal offence, recognising adultery as a gender neutral offence and ground for divorce, besides uniform laws for adoption, succession and inheritance.","By getting its govt to promulgate UCC in Uttarakhand, BJP has signalled its allegiance to one of its foundational pledges.

After the resumption of bilateral visits , India and China Monday took significant “people-centric” measures to normalise ties as they agreed to resume the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage in 2025 and also consented, in principle, to restart direct flights between the 2 countries. While India wanted the pilgrimage, which has remained suspended since 2020, to resume, resumption of air services had been a longstanding Chinese demand.The announcement by India followed foreign secretary Vikram Misri’s visit to Beijing during which he also called on foreign minister Wang Yi, kick-starting what promises to be a series of substantive bilateral engagements that could culminate potentially in a visit to China by PM Narendra Modi for the SCO summit.The 2 sides agreed to resume existing dialogue mechanisms step-by-step, addressing each other’s concerns and priorities. Specific concerns in economic ties like the trade deficit were discussed with a view to resolving these issues and promoting “long-term policy transparency and predictability”.The 2 countries also agreed to hold an early meeting of the India-China Expert Level Mechanism to discuss resumption of provision of hydrological data and other cooperation pertaining to trans-border rivers, said the Indian readout. This follows concerns expressed in India about the possible impact of a mega Chinese hydropower project in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river on the flow of water to lower riparian states.“The two sides recognize that 2025, being the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and China, should be utilized to redouble public diplomacy efforts to create better awareness about each other and restore mutual trust and confidence among the public,’’ said the Indian government in an official statement on Misri’s visit, adding the the 2 sides will conduct a number of commemorative activities to mark this anniversary. There was no mention of the border issue in the Indian statement on the outcomes of the visit, which followed NSA Ajit Doval’s visit to Beijing last month for border talks.In the meeting with Wang, while Misri committed India’s full support for China’s SCO rotating presidency, Wang called for more substantive measures to promote mutual trust and understanding. China will host the summit of the Eurasian group later this year.“The two countries should refrain from mutual suspicion, mutual estrangement, and mutual exhaustion,’’ said Wang, according to an English translation by CGTN of a Chinese readout.According to Indian authorities, India and China also agreed to take “appropriate measures” to further promote and facilitate people-to-people exchanges, including media and think-tank interactions. “They agreed in principle to resume direct air services between the two countries; the relevant technical authorities on the two sides will meet and negotiate an updated framework for this purpose at an early date,’’ said the Indian government.Wang said the recent improvement in China-India relations fully aligned with the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples and was conducive to safeguarding the “legitimate rights and interests of the Global South countries”.It also helps to contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in Asia and the world, he added.According to the Chinese readout, Misri said the 2 countries have engaged in a series of beneficial dialogues and communications, properly managed and resolved differences, and promoted the resumption of practical cooperation in various fields.The Indian government said that as agreed between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at their meeting in Kazan in October, the 2 sides reviewed the state of India-China bilateral relations comprehensively during Misri’s visit and agreed to take certain people-centric steps to stabilize and rebuild ties. The meeting in Kazan, on the margins of the BRICS summit, followed the October 21 understanding last year that led to the completion of the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh, bringing to an end the 2020 military standoff.","India and China agreed to resume the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage in 2025.

The first was on November 6, immediately after Trump's victory.Talks between both leaders took place amid growing discussions over the issue of immigration and trade rules in the US, which were Trump's key poll plank in the parliamentary polls.The Trump administration is expected to implement US-focused trade measures, requiring India to lower trade restrictions or risk increased tariffs, which subsequently would affect Indian industries including IT, pharmaceuticals and textiles that are major exported to the US market.A few days ago, Trump threatened Brics nations, including India, of imposing 100 per cent tariffs on trade in case the bloc moves forward with plans to replace the US dollar.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, however, affirmed India's stance regarding the replacement of dollar, stating that the country has never supported de-dollarisation and there were no plans for a Brics currency.On immigration, the US President has expressed a balanced view on H-1B visa programme during a joint news conference at the White House with Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Open AI CEO Sam Altman.Amid concerns raised by the US over irregular migration, India has reiterated it will, like in the past, accept illegal migrants from the US only after verifying their Indian origin and that any talk about number of such undocumented people it’s willing to take back is “premature”.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to US President Donald Trump over the phone.

"First GBS Death in Maharashtra: Pune Cases Reach 101, Free Treatment Announced",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/28-more-cases-take-punes-guillain-barre-syndrome-tally-to-101-water-under-scanner/articleshow/117584339.cms,"Poll Is the Increase in Guillain-Barre Syndrome Cases Concerning? No, It’s a Isolated Incident Yes, It Needs Immediate Attention

GBS treatment very expensive, each injection costs Rs 20,000

Ajit Pawar announces free treatment for GBS

PUNE: The Maharashtra health department reported Sunday what is suspected to be the first death linked to the Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) outbreak concentrated in Pune as the caseload spiked to 101 with 28 more confirmed infections, based on updated surveillance data, reports Steffy Thevar. The daily bulletin said the suspected GBS death occurred in Solapur but did not give details.Sixteen of the patients diagnosed with this rare but treatable condition are currently on ventilator support. Around 19 of those with symptoms are below nine, while the 50-80 age group accounts for 23 cases.A patient hospitalised on Jan 9 is suspected to be the first GBS case within the Pune cluster. Tests have revealed the Campylobacter jejuni bacteria in some biological samples drawn from hospitalised patients. C Jejuni causes about a third of all GBS cases worldwide and is also responsible for the most severe infections.Authorities are sampling Pune's water, especially in areas that are reporting cases. Test results released Saturday showed that a well near Khadakwasla Dam, Pune's main water reservoir, had high levels of the bacterium E. coli. But officials said it was unclear if the well was being used at all. Residents have been advised to boil water and heat their food before consumption.Health department officials said 25,578 homes had been surveyed till Sunday as part of a surveillance exercise meant to find more patients within the community and pinpoint the trigger for the surge in GBS cases, which otherwise don’t exceed more than two a month.GBS occurs when the body’s immune system, while reacting to a bacterial or viral infection, mistakenly attacks the nerves that carry brain signals to parts of the body, leading to weakness, paralysis or other symptoms. Doctors said 80% of affected patients regain their ability to walk without assistance within six months of hospital discharge, but some may take up to a year or more to regain full use of their limbs. GBS treatment is also very expensive.Patients will typically need a course of immunoglobulin (IVIG) injections. A family TOI spoke to earlier said their 68-year-old relative, who was admitted on Jan 16, needed an IVIG course of 13 injections, with each shot costing about Rs 20,000.Three major hospitals in the city sent out alerts to local health authorities earlier this week after they found a higher-than-usual number of GBS patients —26 on Jan 10 — among newly admitted patients. By Friday, the number soared to 73.Speaking about rising cases in Pune, Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar announced, “The treatment is expensive. After discussions with officials from the district administration and municipal corporation, we have decided to provide free treatment. Those from Pimpri-Chinchwad will be treated at YCM Hospital, while patients from Pune Municipal Corporation areas will receive treatment at Kamla Nehru Hospital. For citizens from rural areas, free treatment will be provided at Sassoon Hospital in Pune.”",Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) cases in Pune have spiked to 101 with 28 more confirmed infections. 16 of the patients diagnosed with this rare but treatable condition are currently on ventilator support.

KOLKATA: Even as the CBI and Bengal govt sparred on Monday in the Calcutta high court over whose appeal seeking death for RG Kar rape-murder convict Sanjay Roy should be heard, the victim's family told the HC they did not want capital punishment for the convict for now.The HC division bench of Justice Debangsu Basak and Justice Md Shabbar Rashidi reserved its judgment on whether it would hear the CBI's or the state's appeal. Thereafter, it will hear the merits of the case seeking capital punishment.When the judges asked the victim's parents, who were present in court, about their stand on the issue, their counsel Shamim Ahmed informed the bench that the family ""does not want capital punishment for now"" as they were apprehensive that Roy's hanging could lead to the disappearance of whatever evidence there might be to prove the involvement of others. Another lawyer representing the parents said, ""We want the trial of others to start and chargesheet to be submitted.""The parents later told reporters outside the courtroom, ""Capital punishment to the convict now could hamper the investigation that we have sought. If he (Roy) is hanged now, how will we get further evidence?""A Sealdah trial court had on Jan 20 sentenced Roy to prison ""for the remainder of his natural life"", saying the case did not fall under the ""rarest of rare"" category. The state govt, and later CBI, appealed against this.When the case came up for hearing, state advocate general Kishore Datta told the HC that the state had locus standi to appeal seeking death for the convict even though the investigation was conducted by a central agency. ""In a case being investigated by a central agency, the state is not a bystander because prosecution is always in the name of the state... registration of an FIR is with the state govt, post-trial - parole, remission, capital punishment execution - everything is done by the state,"" Datta argued.Representing the CBI, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju said only the Centre could file an appeal seeking the death penalty and the Bengal govt did not have ""any jurisdiction"" in the matter.","CBI and Bengal govt spar in Calcutta high court over whose appeal seeking death for rape-murder convict Sanjay Roy should be heard.

SC delivers split verdict on Chhattisgarh Christian tribal’s burial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-delivers-split-verdict-on-chhattisgarh-christian-tribals-burial/articleshow/117613070.cms,"NEW DELHI: A division bench on Monday delivered a split verdict on the controversy over the burial of a Christian tribal in Chhattisgarh, with one judge terming denial of burial in his village by local and state authorities as ""hostile discrimination"" on the basis of religion and allowed burial on his private land, and the other judge saying that a family cannot claim unqualified right to choose the place of burial and held that last rites must be performed at the place demarcated for the community, which is 20-25 km away from the village.Taking note that the dead body was lying in mortuary for the past three weeks and making reference to larger bench or to the third judge would further delay his last rites, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma directed that the funeral be conducted at the burial ground demarcated for Christians in another village. The bench said that it was passing the order ""bearing in mind judicial stewardship and to alleviate the predicament and suffering of the appellant and his family"".The bench passed the order on the plea of the son who approached court to conduct the last rites in his native village which was not allowed by villagers. While Justice Nagarathna allowed his plea, Justice Sharma rejected his submission. Beginning her judgement by saying that death is a great leveller, Justice Nagarathna said this case demonstrates that the death of a resident of a village can also give rise to divisiveness and disapproved the conduct of the panchayat and state authorities for discriminating on the ground of religion and held ""this is nothing but a violation of Article 14 and Article 15(1) of the Constitution which speak of equality before the law and the equal protection of the laws as well as places a strict prohibition of discrimination on the ground of religion, respectively"".Justice Nagarathna took exception to the declaration of Bastar ASP, who had said, ""Any person who has forsworn the tradition of the community or has converted into a Christian is not allowed to be buried at the village graveyard."" ""Such an attitude on the part of local authorities, at the village level or higher level, indicates a betrayal of the sublime principles of secularism and the glorious traditions of our country which believes in 'Sarva Dharma Samanvaya/Sarva Dharma Samabhava', which is the essence of secularism,"" she said.Justice Sharma emphasised that no one can claim to have absolute and unqualified right to conduct last rites at the place of one's choice and held that there was no need to invoke Article 142 to allow the plea of the petitioner.","A division bench delivered a split verdict on the controversy over the burial of a Christian tribal in Chhattisgarh.

NEW DELHI: Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday came under fire over his ""taking a dip in the Ganga won't eradicate poverty"" remark, with BJP accusing him of displaying anti-Hindu sentiment and challenging him to say anything similar about the faith of other communities.Speaking at a rally at B R Ambedkar's birthplace at Mhow in Madhya Pradesh, Kharge questioned the relevance of the pilgrims taking dips in Ganga to mark the first Mahakumbh in 144 years: ""Will taking a dip in Ganga Maa eradicate poverty? Will taking a dip in Ganga make people happy and make the country run well? I don't understand why these people compete to spend thousands of rupees and take a dip in the Ganga.""""I don't intend to hurt sentiments and would like to apologise to anyone who may feel offended.But you tell me what good it is going to do. When children are starving, are unable to attend schools and then people are competing with each other to take dips and won't stop unless there are good visuals for TV.""These people are no good for the country. People are free to have faith in the God. You do your puja everyday. People don't step out of their homes without doing puja and we don't have a problem with that. But we have an issue if religion is used to exploit the the poor. We have to fight this.""The remarks which coincided with Union home minister Amit Shah's dip at Mahakumbh drew a fiery response from BJP.""Rahul Gandhi and Congress should explain as to why they have such an anti-Sanatan ideology. This isn't the first time that Kharge said something against Sanatan. Earlier, he had said that he would end Sanatan if they came to power. Rahul can go and take a dip in Italy, we have no objections. But using such words against Maa Ganga is not right,"" party spokesperson Sambit Patra at a press conference.Dubbing Kharge's remarks as an insult and mockery of Hindu faith, BJP MP said that the Maha Kumbh has been a symbol of the Sanatan faith for millions of years and is recognised and respected worldwide.""It is painful to say that while this faith is cherished across the globe, the main opposition party in India is dismissing the Maha Kumbh and this faith. Congress is ridiculing and mocking this sacred tradition,"" said Patra.",Mallikarjun Kharge questioned relevance of pilgrims taking dips in Ganga to mark first Mahakumbh in 144 years.

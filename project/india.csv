He is suspected of providing logistical support and guidance to Pakistani terrorists involved in the attack.The detonation was controlled to ensure adjacent dwellings were not damaged; the precision meant to convey the message that the authorities had no malice towards the general public.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 26 tourists were killed and several others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran Meadow, a scenic area located approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, known for its natural beauty and tranquil environment.The attack took place around 1:30 pm, as tourists were relaxing in the picturesque meadow.Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.","Houses of Zakir Ahmad Ganie in Kulgam and Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Shahid Ahmad Kuttay in Shopian's Chotipora destroyed in controlled explosions.

Pakistan Army fires at multiple LoC posts overnight after Pahalgam terror attack; Indian Army responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-army-fires-at-multiple-loc-posts-overnight-after-pahalgam-terror-attack-indian-army-responds/articleshow/120635289.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan violated the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir by resorting to unprovoked small arms firing from multiple posts across the Kashmir valley on the night of April 25-26, a defence official said Saturday.“On the night of April 25-26, unprovoked small firing was carried out by multiple Pakistan Army posts all across the Line of Control in Kashmir,” said a Srinagar-based defence spokesperson. “Army troops responded appropriately with small arms. No casualties have been reported.”Military sources confirmed similar incidents had occurred a day earlier, with Pakistani forces initiating small arms fire at several points along the LoC. “The firing was effectively responded to,” a source said.The ceasefire violations come amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following Tuesday’s terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people. The Indian Army has since stepped up counter-terror operations and reviewed preparedness, with Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi visiting Srinagar to assess the situation with senior commanders.India has announced a series of strong diplomatic and strategic measures in response to the attack, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty , closure of the Attari land-border crossing, and expulsion of Pakistani military attachés. All Pakistanis who entered via Attari have been asked to leave India by May 1.In retaliation, Pakistan shut its airspace to Indian airlines and suspended trade with India, including through third countries. It also rejected India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, warning that any attempt to stop water flows will be treated as an “act of war”.Amid national outrage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday vowed to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to justice.

He who, without raising doubt, can sense what lies hidden in another’s heart—

He is equal to the divine

Life is a grand, unpredictable game. And in this game, strategy is not optional—it is survival. And at the heart of every great strategy lies one powerful ability – the art of reading others.Be it a chessboard or a boardroom, the first move toward mastery is watching for subtle rhythms people unknowingly adopt.One of my favourite illustrations of this is from a classic Vadivelu comedy. He disguises himself in an array of costumes, yet his friends recognize him instantly. Exasperated, he asks, ""How did you know it was me?"" Their answer is simple: “You forgot to hide your trademark beehive hair.” (And isn’t that true for us all? No matter how clever the mask, our patterns betray us.Consider tennis in the 1990s. A young, fiery Boris Becker stunned audiences with his serves—earning the nickname. When he first clashed with Andre Agassi, a master of returns, Becker triumphed easily in the first three matches.But soon, something changed.In their next eleven matches, Agassi won nine times. Years later, Agassi revealed the secret. After the losses, he started watchingof Becker’s matches obsessively and noticed that just before serving, Becker would subtly stick out his tongue. If it pointed right, the serve would follow suit, and vice versa.Agassi saved it for the pivotal moments—break points, set points—when it mattered most. The result? Becker felt, almost eerily, like Agassi could read his mind. When Agassi disclosed the truth post retirement, Becker could only laugh in disbelief.In the game of life, we’re always playing with and against others. Reading them doesn’t just give us an edge—it prepares us.There’s an African saying:Strategy isn’t only about planning. It’s the subtle art of reading your opponent’s motives, not just their moves. Their fears. Their hopes.The Japanese have a word for this—In the business world, Yomi has worked wonders. Consider the curious case of the ‘new Coke’. In the 1980s, Coca-Cola introduced a new formula with a different taste. Thousands of customers wrote letters of complaint. Eventually, the company “listened” and reintroduced the original Coke.Sales soared.Some industry veterans still believe it was all part of a larger plan. Coca-Colataking something away would reignite affection for it. If true, this wasn’t a product failure—it was strategic brilliance.Even Thiruvalluvar, centuries ago, revered this gift. In, he writes:The greatest strategists are not always the loudest or the boldest. They are the ones who quietly listen, observe, and understand. They hide their beehive hair. They watch for the tongue’s direction. They think like rats to catch them. And in doing so, they play not just the game, but the minds behind it.So, the next time you find yourself at the crossroads, pause. Observe the patterns. Listen to the silence between the words. In that moment, you will see not just the obvious, but what is hidden —that will lead you to your next move.Then you will fight, with the power of being a part of your opponent’s mind.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120622480,imgsize-46472,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/120622480.jpg"

'Avenger' video may be PR stunt, no such outfit operational in Agra: Cops



Hours after restaurant worker Gulfam Ali, 27, was shot dead and his co-worker injured in Agra, a self-proclaimed 'gau rakshak' who identified himself as Manoj Chaudhary and said he was a member of ' Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal ', took to social media on Friday to announce the murder was ""retribution"" for the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed. He said ""there were more deaths to be avenged"".A widely circulated video on social media purportedly shows a man, with two pistols tucked into his jeans and knives strapped on, claiming responsibility for the killing. In the video, Manoj Chaudhary, accompanied by another man who is similarly armed, is heard saying: ""Two k#### (slur) were killed in Taj city Agra. Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal takes responsibility for this. I pledge in the name of Bharat Mata that if we do not avenge the killing of 26 with 2,600, I am not a son of Bharat Mata."" He then raises a religious slogan.Identity of Chaudhary's associate is not known. Police, however, rejected the claims, ""No organisation in the name of 'Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal' is operational (here). The video on social media appears to be a publicity stunt. An FIR has been registered at Tajganj and a probe is on.""Agra police commissioner Deepak Kumar told TOI: ""The crime was a fallout of a quarrel over quality of food a few days ago. Investigation has revealed that the two men in the video are not Kshatriyas, and their self-declared status as gau rakshaks is also doubtful. At this stage, it appears to be more of a publicity stunt. CCTV footage from the crime scene shows the presence of four individuals. We have arrested a suspect.""Gulfam worked as a waiter at Shahid Ali Chicken Biryani , owned by his cousin Shahid Ali, in Tajganj. Around midnight, three men came on a scooter and shot him dead.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq returned to Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid to deliver his Friday sermon after restrictions of over a month, condemning the Pahalgam massacre and paying tributes to the victims.Mirwaiz and the others observed a minute’s silence in solidarity with the relatives of all those who lost their dear ones in the terror attack.Mirwaiz reminded his audience that the authorities had put him under house arrest ahead of previous Friday prayers in the past month. “Sadly, during this time, we had to witness a terrifying attack, which has left our hearts bleeding. The manner in which a carnage was carried out, more than two dozen people killed after ascertaining their identities and in front of their families, is shocking and chilling beyond belief,” Mirwaiz said.The chief cleric recalled the 1990 day when his father was shot dead by terrorists. “Who better can understand the pain and grief of loss of the families affected (in Pahalgam) than people who have suffered it (terror) for decades and still continue to. Today is the 36th martyrdom anniversary of my father, Mirwaiz Molvi Mohammad Farooq.”Mirwaiz told the gathering that “our hearts go out to these families who will never see their loved ones again, and our prayers are with them and we pray for speedy recovery of the injured.”Mirwaiz underscored Kashmiris’ famed hospitality, saying they had always opened their hearts and homes to outsiders, especially tourists. “People of Kashmir once again upheld the tradition of outreach, help, and humanity in this distressing time. Locals helped those at the (Pahalgam) spot to flee, even at risk to their own lives, in which pony operator Adil Hussain died. We pay homage to this brave young Kashmiri,” Mirwaiz said.He pointed out that other locals ferried the injured, some on their backs, to hospitals, while a complete shutdown was observed in memory of those killed. “The people of Kashmir sent a strong message of their total disapproval of such actions and solidarity and sympathy with the bereaved, standing shoulder to shoulder with them.” He requested authorities to allow him to visit the injured in hospitals and Adil’s family to pay condolences.Mirwaiz struck a note of caution and anguish at “a large section of mainstream media spreading communal rhetoric of hate against Kashmiris”. This, he said, has made Kashmiris across India vulnerable, forcing hundreds, especially students, to leave. “I appeal to govts in different states to ensure the safety of our students and all other Kashmiris,” Mirwaiz said.",Mirwaiz Umar Farooq returned to Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid to deliver his Friday sermon.

BENGALURU: Sujatha, the wife of Bengaluru-based techie Bharath Bhushan who was killed in Tuesday's attack, said her husband tried to comfort her and their three-year-old son before being fatally shot, saying, ""'Don't worry, don't worry... stay strong.'"" The terrorist did not show mercy despite Bhushan being the father of a child, she said.Sujatha said she had been near a tent checking out a traditional Kashmiri outfit when one of the terrorists, after gunning down a tourist, walked up and asked: ""How is it that you are happy here while our children are being killed and we are suffering? Don't you read the news about us?"" He then killed another tourist before pointing the gun at Sujatha's husband and asking his name. ""My name is Bharath,"" Bhushan said, and was shot in the head, thrice, said Sujatha.""After shooting my husband, the terrorist went away. I rushed to my husband and took his wallet.

Nepal medic killed in Pahalgam didn’t get time to say he was a foreigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-medic-killed-in-pahalgam-didnt-get-time-to-say-he-was-a-foreigner/articleshow/120592414.cms,"Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: After travelling across three states and an international border, the body of Sudeep Neupane , 27, the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, reached his home in Kalikanagar, a neighbourhood in Butwal, western Nepal, draped in the national flag.He was cremated at Triveni Ghat around noon, with hundreds, including local govt officials, gathered for the last rites. Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India.Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep’s home, the neighbourhood had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when a group of men with guns approached. Witnesses later said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot. “He didn’t get the chance to say he was a foreigner,” said Tejulal Neupane , his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. “He had nothing to do with anything.”His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries. His body was airlifted from Srinagar to New Delhi on Wednesday evening, then flown to Lucknow later that night. From there, it was driven overland to Sunauli before crossing into Nepal. A district magistrate from Uttar Pradesh accompanied the body as far as the border. At Sunauli, it was received by Dadhiram Neupane, Sudeep’s uncle and the ward chairperson of Butwal-14. A police escort led the final leg to Kalikanagar. Butwal mayor Khelraj Pandey, Rupandehi chief district officer Basudev Ghimire , and police chief Ranjit Singh Rathore joined the procession.Sudeep lived in Kalikanagar for most of his life. After his parents, Dhruv Neupane and Reema Pandey, separated, he stayed behind to support his mother. His sister moved to Pokhara after marriage, but Sudeep remained, managing the household finances, arranging care, and eventually becoming its only earning member. He held a public health degree from Dharan and was pursuing further studies in Kathmandu while working part-time on an oral health campaign in rural Nepal.The job did not pay much, but it was steady, and he had grown invested in the work. “He wasn’t just showing up,” said Amrit Bhusal, who runs Modern Samaj Dental, the clinic that had employed him for nearly a year. “He was doing follow-ups. He was tracking cases. He was committed in a way that was unusual.”In Pyuthan, Bhairahawa, and along the outer districts of Rupandehi, his visits became routine. He carried a clipboard and often walked between health posts on foot. When he spoke about public health, his colleagues said, it was in practical terms — transport access, dental hygiene, vaccine follow-up — not in abstract declarations.At home, he was quiet. Neighbours described him as careful and unobtrusive. Rajendra Kumar Acharya, who lives two houses down, remembered a brief conversation before the trip. “He told us he was going to Kashmir. He seemed happy to be taking a break. That’s all.” His 89-year-old grandfather, Khemananda Neupane, learned of the death indirectly. “My wife stopped my prayers,” he said. “She told me something had happened. I didn’t understand at first.”His father, Dhruv Neupane, a teacher at Bhawanipur High School in Butwal-18, was returning from a teachers’ protest in Kathmandu when his phone began to ring. “No one would say it outright,” he said. “Only when I arrived home did I understand what they had been trying to tell me. It doesn’t matter where I live. He was my child.”","Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: The Union government on Friday informed Supreme Court that deletion of a provision in the 1995 Waqf Act barring enforcement of rights over unregistered waqfs through an amendment in 2013 resulted in a massive rise in Waqf Board properties country-wide from 2,07,394 to 8,72,870 and a corresponding increase in area from 18.3 lakh acres to 39 lakh acres.Delhi Waqf Board in 2013 had just nine properties having an area of 0.03 acres. By 2025, the number of properties under its control increased to 1,047 having an area of 28 acres. This phenomenon was more accentuated in Jammu & Kashmir, where the Auqaf Board had just one property with 0.42 acres in 2013, which increased to 32,533 with an area of 31.4 acres by 2025, the Centre's affidavit said.Even in the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, waqf properties increased from 35 in 2013 to 151 in 2025, with the accretion of an additional area of 138 acres. The least increase in waqf properties, from 51 in 2013 to 58 in 2025, was in Meghalaya, where Christians constitute 75% of the population, Hindus 11% and indigenous groups 9%.In Rajasthan too, the rise in waqf properties was minimal, adding 7,769 in 12 years to the 23,126 in 2013. In Tamil Nadu, waqf properties numbering 43,623 in 2013 increased by another 22,469 in the next 12 years. In Uttar Pradesh, Sunni Waqf properties increased from 12,914 in 2013 to 2,17,161 in 2025. In West Bengal, such properties increased from 17,946 in 2013 to 80,808 in 2025. In Gujarat, waqf properties increased from 3,074 in 2013 to 39,940 in 2025. Andhra Pradesh too saw a massive increase - from 390 in 2013 to 14,685 in 2025.Taking the overall picture of alarming increase in waqf properties without registration and suo motu declaration of a property as waqf by boards, the Centre said the 2025 amendment was brought in to ensure that ""Waqf Boards in the country are properly administered and function with transparency and prevent repeated abuse of waqf legislation which resulted in deprivation of personal properties of individuals and encroachment of govt land"".It said the amendment was necessitated because of ""repeated and documented instances across the country where Waqf Boards had claimed title over govt land, public utilities and protected monuments without deed, survey or adjudication, relying solely on the board's unilateral records. Said claims included waqf claims over collectors' offices, govt schools, ASI-protected heritage sites and land vested in state or municipal authorities"".","Delhi Waqf Board in 2013 had just nine properties having an area of 0.03 acres.

NEW DELHI: Dr Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, an eminent space scientist, educationist and the guiding force behind India’s space and education milestones, passed away on Friday in Bengaluru at the age of 84. A former chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and the chief architect of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Kasturirangan had been battling age-related ailments following a heart attack he suffered in Sri Lanka in July 2023. He breathed his last at 10:43 am at his Bengaluru residence.His mortal remains will be kept at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, on April 27 for people to pay their respects. He is survived by two sons.Kasturirangan-led Isro from 1994 to 2003, a period marked by major milestones, including the operationalisation of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and the successful flight-test of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. Under his stewardship, Isro pursued technological self-reliance and began planning ambitious missions such as Chandrayaan, despite facing international sanctions following India’s 1998 nuclear tests.PM Narendra Modi said, “I am deeply saddened by the passing of Dr K Kasturirangan, a towering figure in India's scientific and educational journey. His visionary leadership and selfless contribution to the nation will always be remembered.” He praised Kasturirangan’s pivotal role in elevating Isro and said India would always be grateful for his contributions to education.President Droupadi Murmu acknowledged his integral role in shaping both India’s space programme and the NEP.Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan remembered him as an “intellectual titan”, saying, “To me, he was far more than a mentor — he was a guiding light, a wellspring of wisdom, compassion, and quiet strength.”Science and technology minister Jitendra Singh called him “a visionary scientist and a guiding force behind India’s space programme”. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said he made significant contributions in India's space exploration and contributed in various positions in key policy making.Prior to heading Isro, Kasturirangan directed the Isro Satellite Centre and was responsible for overseeing development of next-generation satellites including INSAT-2 and IRS-1A & 1B. As project director for BHASKARA-I and II, India’s first experimental Earth observation satellites, he laid the groundwork for the nation’s remote sensing capabilities.An accomplished astrophysicist, Kasturirangan’s research spanned high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy. He played a key role in conceptualising India’s first space-based high-energy astronomy observatory and authored over 200 research papers in leading national and international journals. He also edited six books.After his illustrious space career, Kasturirangan pivoted to education policy and led the drafting committee of the NEP-2020, introducing a transformative vision for Indian schooling and higher education. Later, he spearheaded the development of the National Curriculum Framework.He had famously stated, “The vision of India’s new education system is to ensure that it touches each and every citizen's life and creates a just and equitable society.”Kasturirangan was awarded all three of India’s top civilian honours — Padma Shri (1982), Padma Bhushan (1992), and Padma Vibhushan (2000). He was also Member of Rajya Sabha (2003–09), Planning Commission member, National Institute of Advanced Studies director (2004–2009) and JNU chancellor.Born on Oct 24, 1940, in Ernakulam, Kerala, he earned his physics degree from Bombay University and his PhD in experimental high-energy astronomy from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad. Kasturirangan leaves behind a legacy that spans the cosmos and classrooms.","Dr Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, an eminent space scientist, educationist and the guiding force behind India’s space and education milestones, passed away on Friday.

Waqf Act restricted itself to secular side: Govt

NEW DELHI: Putting up a strong defence of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, the Centre called it a secular law and accused the petitioners challenging its validity in Supreme Court of spinning a false ""interference in religious affairs"" narrative on mandatory registration of every waqf, including ' waqf by user '. It said this provision was more than a century old.In a 1,332-page affidavit, joint secretary in the minority affairs ministry Shersha C Shaikh Mohiddin requested SC to abide by traditional assumption of validity of a law enacted by Parliament and conduct a detailed hearing without granting any stay on operation of the law, which is to stop misuse of 2013 amendment allowing encroachment of private and govt properties. In the last hearing, SC had flagged 3 issues in 2025 law - registration documents of waqf properties, inclusion of non-Muslims in Central Waqf Council and Waqf Boards & determination of govt land.In its affidavit, Centre pointed out that SC in the last 30 years never considered staying provisions of the 1995 Waqf Act and sought an ""equitable"" approach.Rebutting the charge that the new law represented an interference with religious rights of Muslims, the Centre said the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, restricted itself to secular dimensions like record management, procedural reforms and administrative structure and not even remotely attempted to interfere in any ritual, prayer or fundamental Islamic obligations.Addressing the three issues flagged by SC as 'contentious', the Centre said the architecture of the 1995 Waqf Act required a relook because of the sudden increase in the area covered under waqf. ""Till 2013, that is the period which included Mughal era, pre-independence era and post-independence era, the total area under waqf was 18.3 lakh acres. It is really shocking to note that after 2013, another 20.9 lakh acres of land were added to waqfs, which totalled 39.2 lakh acres,"" Centre said.It said no waqf or individual Muslims could validly question the 2025 provision for mandatory registration of waqf properties as this has been in existence since the enactment of Waqf Act, 1923, and the provision was consistently carried forward through the enactment of Waqf Act, 1954 and Waqf Act, 1995.""Legislative intent and policy has always been very clear with regard to waqf being registered so that it remains under the statutory regime with respect to its secular aspects like maintenance of accounts, survey of properties, transparent administration and supervision in case of transfer of property of waqf,"" the Centre said.""Those waqfs which have not registered themselves, including 'waqfs by user', since 1923, 1954, or at least prior to Jan 1, 1996 (date on which the 1995 Act came into force), nor have they been found to be in existence during the survey by the Survey Commissioner and an independent exercise mandated by law from the State Waqf Board and have no legal existence and any belated claim at this stage is not maintainable,"" it added.Centre said the legislative architecture over the last 100 years mandated registration of waqf properties and those who have violated the law are barred from arguing that ""exclusion of unregistered 'waqf by user' is either arbitrary, unreasonable or without any logic purpose or intent"".Central Waqf Council has 22 members and its nature of assignment is to recommend management of properties. Inclusion of a maximum of four non-Muslims would not alter the character or nature of the council. Similar is the case with Waqf Boards, where a maximum of three non-Muslims could be part of an 11-member body, it said.Defending provisions identifying unlawful waqf claims, Centre cited cases like Hyderabad's Viceroy Hotel wrongly claimed as waqf. It said earlier provisions enabled encroachments via 'waqf by user' and suo motu declarations. Now, govt property identified as waqf encroachment by a senior officer can be challenged before Waqf Tribunals, HCs, and SC, ensuring fair scrutiny.","The Centre called it a secular law and accused the petitioners challenging its validity in Supreme Court of spinning a false ""interference in religious affairs"" It said mandatory registration of every waqf, including 'waqf by user', was more than a century old. Centre pointed out that SC in the last 30 years never considered staying provisions of the 1995 Waqf Act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120631752,imgsize-1186192,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-35.jpg"

NEW DELHI: After travelling across three states and an international border, the body of Sudeep Neupane , 27, the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, reached his home in Kalikanagar, a neighbourhood in Butwal, western Nepal, draped in the national flag. He was cremated around noon.Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India. Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep's home, the neighbours had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when the terrorists approached. Witnesses said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot.""He didn't get the chance to say he was a foreigner,"" said Tejulal Neupane, his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. ""He had nothing to do with anything.""His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries. His body was airlifted from Srinagar to New Delhi on Wednesday evening, then flown to Lucknow later that night. From there, it was driven overland to Sunauli before crossing into Nepal. A district magistrate from UP accompanied the body as far as the border. At Sunauli, it was received by Dadhiram Neupane, Sudeep's uncle and the ward chairperson of Butwal-14.

'Razings a stern reminder of price to pay for terror'



In a stern message to local terrorists and their families, J&K administration on Friday demolished the houses of three terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack .The houses of Adil Hussain Thoker alias Adil Guree in Bijbehara of Anantnag; Asif Sheikh in Awantipora; and Ahsan Sheikh in Pulwama were quietly razed on Thursday and Friday night.The administration ensured that none of their family members was inside when the houses were destroyed. In fact, a source indicated they were aware of the impending demolition as they had vacated the houses beforehand with their important belongings.The detonation was controlled to ensure adjacent dwellings were not damaged; the precision meant to convey the message that the authorities had no malice towards the general public. There may be more demolitions, according to the source. ""The action is clearly aimed at disincentivising local terrorism or any kind of support to terror,"" a J&K govt functionary told TOI.It is a stern reminder to local youths that if they pick up the gun and join terror ranks, their families will have a heavy price to pay. Their families will also be denied govt benefits and facilities including passports, govt jobs, police clearances. This is all part of the Centre's and J&K administration's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism,"" the J&K govt functionary said.Adil, who legally travelled to Pakistan via Attari-Wagah border crossing in 2018, completed his terror training there and infiltrated back into Kashmir sometime last year, is said to have played guide to and arranged logistics for the attack team that comprised two hardcore Pakistani terrorists Hashim Musa and Ali Talha and a local terrorist from Awantipora, Asif Sheikh. Adil is said to have helped with reconnaissance of the attack site.Asif, one of the leading terrorists active in Tral, Pulwama and Kulgam, is said to have been roped in by the Pakistani terrorists since he was familiar with the terrain, hideouts and escape routes around Baisaran. Ahsan Sheikh, a LeT terrorist active in Pulwama, is said to have arranged logistics for Pahalgam attack.This is not the first time the home of a terrorist has been demolished by the J&K admin. A few months ago, the house of local terrorist Haroon Ganai from Anantnag, who was recruited by Pakistan's ISI, was demolished in a similar manner.

NEW DELHI: The ceasefire with Pakistan along the Line of Control has begun to fray with firing of small arms being reported from multiple locations since Thursday night, though big guns like howitzers and large mortars are yet to open up from either side to blow it to smithereens.The escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror massacre came as Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi was in J&K to review the overall operational situation along the 778-km LoC as well as the counter-terror operations, with Udhampur-based Northern Command chief Lt-Gen MV Suchindra Kumar and his successor Lt-Gen Pratik Sharma, among other top officers.“Gen Dwivedi directed all formations to remain on the highest alert,” an officer said, in the backdrop of PM Modi and other top ministers promising deadly retribution as all military options for limited punitive strikes against Pakistan are on the table.A major incident of prolonged exchange of fire across the heavily-militarized LoC began at the Tutmari Gali sector in the Kupwara district of J&K around midnight, with Pakistani soldiers “initiating” heavy firing by assault rifles and light machine guns with “tracer bullets” at Indian Army posts.Indian troops deployed in the area “effectively” responded, with the exchange intermittently continuing for a few hours. “If the Pak troops fired around 600 rounds at our posts, our soldiers retaliated with over 1,300 rounds. There were no casualties on our side,” an officer told TOI.The exchange of fire at other places like Uri, Poonch, Tangdhar and Gurez was not so intense, with jumpy Pakistani soldiers largely indulging in “speculative firing” to elicit responses from the Indian side to pinpoint their positions. “The Pak Army is obviously on the edge and expecting a big Indian reaction,” the source added.The LoC has been relatively quiet since the rival director-generals of military operations reached a fresh understanding in Feb 2021 after a particularly violent year that saw as many as 5,133 ceasefire violations. Howitzers, 120mm mortars and anti-tank guided missiles were then often being used in a “direct firing mode” to cause maximum damage on the other side.Away from the LoC, the IAF has stepped-up its fighter sorties from air bases on the western front, stretching from Srinagar and Awantipur in J&K to Rajasthan, and kept its surface-to-air missile systems and other ground-based weapons on a high alert, sources said.The precautionary measures include enhancing the number of ORPs (operational readiness platforms) at various IAF air bases. An ORP usually includes two to three fighters being kept combat-ready in blast pens adjoining the runway at an airbase for immediate take-off whenever an alarm is sounded.Military officers say if the govt decides to go for some limited military action against Pakistan, the options range from the less-escalatory punitive artillery fire assaults across the LoC to precision air strikes by fighters like Rafales, Mirage-2000s and Sukhoi-30MKIs armed with long-range weapons like the French `Scalp’ air-to-ground cruise missiles, Israeli Crystal Maze missiles and Spice-2000 precision guided penetration bombs.",Firing of small arms reported from multiple locations since Thursday night.

"“What is wrong with NFL owners"": Donald Trump can’t believe Shedeur Sanders wasn’t a first-round pick, slams team owners as ‘stupid’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-is-wrong-with-nfl-owners-donald-trump-cant-believe-shedeur-sanders-wasnt-a-first-round-pick-slams-team-owners-as-stupid/articleshow/120635077.cms,"NFL owners branded ‘stupid’ by Trump over Shedeur Sanders’ shocking first-round draft omission (Credit: Getty Images)

President Trump slams NFL owners as ‘stupid’ for skipping Shedeur Sanders in first round of 2025 draft



The NFL Draft is known for its unpredictability, but the dramatic fall of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders into the third round of the 2025 Draft has shocked many football fans and analysts. Once touted as a potential No. 1 overall pick, Sanders now finds himself still waiting for a team to take a chance on him—despite boasting an impressive college résumé and pedigree. His fall out of the first and even second round not only stunned onlookers but sparked widespread debate across social and sports media.Shedeur, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders , was projected by many to be a first-round talent, with the Pittsburgh Steelers among the teams frequently linked to him in mock drafts. Yet, after 65 selections, his name still hadn't been called. While draft boards fluctuate and team needs vary, the lack of confidence in Sanders by quarterback-needy teams is puzzling, especially after his standout 2024 season, where he was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, leading Colorado to a strong 9-4 finish.Perhaps the most headline-grabbing reaction came from U.S. President Donald Trump , who launched a scathing rebuke of the league’s team owners on Truth Social. “What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?” Trump posted. “Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be ‘picked’ IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!”Trump’s passionate post highlights the sentiment shared by many who feel that Sanders’ family background, athleticism, and proven leadership should have made him an early-round lock. With Deion Sanders not only being a Hall of Famer but also Shedeur’s coach at Colorado, the quarterback’s exposure to high-level mentorship and football IQ is undeniable.It’s worth noting that the NFL Draft isn’t just about talent—it’s about fit, timing, and a complex web of organizational strategies. Some franchises may have prioritized other positional needs, while others may be skeptical of media hype or external influences, even one as loud as a former president's endorsement.The real question now isn’t why Shedeur fell—it’s who will finally recognize his potential and make the move. Whether Trump’s loud backing shifts any front office decisions remains to be seen, but the spotlight on Shedeur Sanders burns brighter than ever. One thing is certain: wherever he lands, he’ll arrive with a chip on his shoulder and something to prove.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders suffers massive financial blow after NFL Draft first-round snub","Shedeur Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was projected by many to be a first-round talent.

What Lauri Markkanen Brings to the Lod Angeles Lakers

Why the Jazz Might Consider This Trade

Is This A Win-Win Deal?

Thehave been performing well in recent games, thanks to dominant performances from Luka Doncic and LeBron James . However, their lack of depth outside the star trio raises questions about roster upgrades. A potential solution? Trading for Utah Jazz forwardThe Los Angeles Lakers' victory in Game 2 demonstrated how much they depended on Austin Reaves and Doncic (who scored 52 points alongside James). There were very little bench contributions; Gabe Vincent scored six points and Dorian Finney-Smith only scored seven in 39 minutes.With limited offensive support, GM Rob Pelinka might explore adding another high-caliber player. As Dean Simon of the Sporting News noted,To acquire Markkanen, the Lakers could offer a package centered around young talent and draft picks:Proposed Trade DetailsThis deal gives Utah expiring contracts, a promising rookie in Knecht, and draft assets while providing the Los Angeles Lakers a proven scorer.At 27, Lauri Markkanen is entering his prime. Though his numbers dipped slightly this season (19.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG), his 2022-23 campaign proved his elite scoring ability (25.6 PPG). Playing for a tanking Jazz team likely impacted his production.Key Strengths:- Elite Shooting: Career 37.1% from three, perfect for spacing alongside Doncic and James.- Pick-and-Roll Threat: His size (7’0”) and athleticism make him a dangerous lob finisher.- Versatility: Can play both forward spots, fitting seamlessly into the Los Angeles Lakers’ system.Utah is in rebuild mode, and Markkanen’s value won’t be higher. Acquiring Knecht—a high-upside prospect—along with a future pick accelerates their youth movement. Hachimura and Vanderbilt provide short-term flexibility with expiring deals.For the Lakers, adding Markkanen creates a ""Big Three"" capable of contending for years. For the Jazz, it’s a chance to stockpile assets. While unlikely, this trade could reshape the Western Conference hierarchy.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $97 million Brooklyn Nets center to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic in Championship push Would you make this trade if you were Rob Pelinka?

NEW DELHI: Just a season after leading Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to IPL glory, Shreyas Iyer returns to Eden Gardens in opposition colours, now captaining a rejuvenated Punjab Kings (PBKS).Let go by KKR in a shock off-season move, Iyer has found form and leadership comfort under mentor Ricky Ponting, guiding PBKS to the top five with five wins from eight. With 263 runs and three fifties, Iyer now has a chance to deliver a KL Rahul-style statement knock against his former team.KKR, however, are floundering with five losses in eight. Their top-order is shaky, the middle-order misfiring, and spin options underwhelming on home turf.Calls for change may see Rovman Powell come in, while Angkrish Raghuvanshi remains a lone batting bright spot. Ajinkya Rahane’s conservative approach and Sunil Narine’s lack of impact have also added pressure.PBKS, on the other hand, look confident with Marco Jansen’s early bursts, Nehal Wadhera’s finishing skills, and Arshdeep Singh’s 11 wickets leading the attack. Yuzvendra Chahal, who wrecked KKR in their 95 all-out collapse last week, looms large again.KKR must win five of their remaining six to stay in playoff contention, but with just one home win this season and internal issues, including pitch controversies, they face a tough task.Saturday’s clash is more than just a game: it’s personal, tactical, and possibly season-defining.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh , Andre Russell, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh , Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun Chakaravarthy, Angkrish RaghuvanshiPrabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis(wk), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Xavier Bartlett, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarBrace for a hot Saturday in Kolkata.

Brief scores:

Chennai Super Kings:

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Sunrisers Hyderabad dealt a massive blow to Chennai Super Kings’ playoff hopes with a five-wicket win in a battle of strugglers at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday. The victory, SRH's first-ever at Chepauk, was powered by Harshal Patel ’s brilliant 4 for 28 on a sluggish surface and a composed chase that took them over the line in 18.4 overs.Chennai’s batting frailties continued to haunt them as they were bundled out for 154 in 19.5 overs. Dewald Brevis top-scored with a fluent 42 off 25 balls, while Deepak Hooda’s late cameo of 22 helped CSK limp past 150. The SRH pace attack, led by Harshal’s clever variations and supported ably by Pat Cummins (2/21), Jaydev Unadkat (2/21), and Mohammed Shami (1/28), never let the hosts settle.Despite dew aiding the chase, SRH made hard work of the modest target. After early setbacks, Ishan Kishan (44 off 34) anchored the innings, before Kamindu Mendis (32* off 22) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (19* off 13) finished the job with a calm 49-run unbroken stand for the sixth wicket.With this win, SRH moved to eighth in the ten-team table, collecting six points from nine matches. Their playoff hopes, though slim, remain alive — requiring them to win all five of their remaining fixtures, and by a healthy margin to stay in contention.For CSK, it was their seventh loss in nine games, leaving them at the bottom of the table and needing a near-miracle to qualify — five consecutive wins and a favourable points cut-off. The loss also highlighted their mounting concerns: a brittle top-order, a lack of bowling bite, and diminishing confidence across the board.154 all out in 19.5 overs (Dewald Brevis 42; Harshal Patel 4/28).155/5 in 18.4 overs (Ishan Kishan 44).","Sunrisers Hyderabad dealt a massive blow to Chennai Super Kings’ playoff hopes with a five-wicket win in a battle of strugglers at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday.

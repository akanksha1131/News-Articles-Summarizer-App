Yunus’s special assistant ‘asked to’ resign

The interim govt is set to introduce a special law by next week aimed at accelerating efforts to recover billions of dollars allegedly siphoned off from Bangladesh to foreign countries. In the absence of aparliament session, the law will be enacted through an ordinance, said chief adviser Yunus Muhammad’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam.Referring to govt’s white paper on the state of the economy, Alam said approximately $234 billion was siphoned off during the Hasina administration from 2009 to 2024. Additionally, an estimated $17 billion was stolen from the banking system. He added, govt is currently investigating 11 prominent individuals and companies, including former PM Hasina and her family members.A meeting was held with the 11-member task force, which was established in Sept last year. According to Alam, the task force has already engaged with around 200 law firms and may enter agreements with about 30 internationally known firms to expedite the recovery process.Muhammad Yunus’ special assistant M Aminul Islam resigned from his position on Monday, reportedly after being “asked to do so” by the chief adviser’s office. Aminul was tasked with assisting the education adviser.

No commitment to US on tariffs: Govt to Parlimantary panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-commitment-to-us-on-tariffs-govt-to-parlimantary-panel/articleshow/118865487.cms,"US President Donald Trump

US talks could also prove beneficial for us: Commerce secretary

NEW DELHI: Two days after Donald Trump’s claim that India had committed to bring tariffs “way down”, govt on Monday told a parliamentary panel that no commitments on the issue had been made to the US and it has sought time until Sept to address the issue that is being repeatedly flagged by the American president.Appearing before the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs, commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal is learnt to have said that India and the US were working towards a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement, focusing on long-term trade cooperation instead of merely seeking immediate tariff adjustments.He also sought to allay concerns over tariff actions against India, arguing that New Delhi was engaged with Washington on a trade deal, in sharp contrast to China, Canada and Mexico — where Trump has announced tariff actions, some of which have already kicked in.Some opposition MPs like AIMIM ’s Asaduddin Owaisi , Congress’s Deepender Hooda and TMC’s Sagarika Ghosh are learnt to have questioned the commerce secretary on reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has threatened to impose from April 2 against countries with high tariffs. According to sources, Barthwal responded by suggesting that India may escape reciprocal tariffs for the moment.Some opposition MPs like AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi, Congress’s Deepender Hooda and TMC’s Sagarika Ghosh are learnt to have questioned the commerce secretary on reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has threatened to impose from April 2 against countries with high tariffs.The parliamentary panel, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , had asked commerce secretary and foreign secretary Vikram Misri to appear before it and explain recent developments, including media reports quoting Trump that India had agreed to lower its tariffs.Earlier in the day, Misri presented govt’s view to panel members about reports of constructions on China border and assured lawmakers that the two countries were in constant touch and there was nothing to be concerned about.Trade issues and Trump’s repeated threats of tariff actions are learnt to have dominated the meeting Monday, where Barthwal made it clear that the country’s interests would be safeguarded during talks for trade deal. He said govt could only react after Trump administration had taken some steps, which was not the case so far.The commerce secretary is learnt to have pointed out that the talks could also prove to be beneficial for India. There is a section in govt which believes higher tariffs on countries such as China will open the doors for India in certain sectors in addition to the proposed bilateral agreement helping export of Indian textiles and leather products.Last week, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had suggested that Trump’s stance on tariffs and foreign policy could throw up openings for India. Commerce department officials have maintained that India and US can complement each other, given the list of products that each produces.Sources said committee members asked Misri many pointed questions on China and the dam on Brahmaputra river. He informed the panel that there was no agreement between India and China, but there was a water agreement between India and Pakistan. “So, any issue with China can be discussed bilaterally only,” a source quoted Misri as saying. He said China wanted to restore full-fledged relations with India, with direct flights, visa for visitors and deployment of journalists. He said talks were continuing, but expressed concern about allowing visitors and scribes.",US talks could also prove beneficial for us: Commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal.

BJP vs DMK

Clash began after DMK MP claimed TN funds ‘diverted’

NEW DELHI: The Modi govt and DMK clashed on the first day of the resumed Budget session , with the latter questioning the govt over the three-language policy and education minister Dharmendra Pradhan accusing the Tamil Nadu govt and the governing party of going back on their commitment to sign the MoU for NEP.The minister attacked DMK with strong words, claiming that TN was ready to implement NEP but reversed its stand because of pressure from some ‘super CM’, and accused the party of being undemocratic and anti-students, leading to protests and a couple of adjournments. He later withdrew his remark on Speaker Om Birla’s initiative, and was expunged. In the evening, DMK filed a privilege motion against Pradhan, accusing him of misleading the House and tarnishing the image of Tamil Nadu.DMK MP K Kanimozhi, in the privilege notice, also alleged that the minister’s conduct attacked her dignity as a woman, and “his indecent remarks” constituted an outrage to modesty and harassment, while sending a “harmful message” that any female member can be attacked verbally, humiliated and harassed.DMK MPs disrupted the proceedings during question hour, opposing the Centre’s three-language policy and linking of the implementation of NEP as a pre-condition for release of central grants. Congress MPs, too, joined DMK, against Pradhan’s remarks. Under NEP, every state has to sign an MoU in order to receive central funds for infrastructure upgrades and other financial assistance.With language policy and delimitation on top of its agenda, DMK used legislative proceedings on the first day to hammer home its talking points, with even the “lading bill” becoming a platform for sniping at BJP. DMK MP Kalanidhi Veeraswamy, speaking on the legislation, caustically said there did not seem to be an equivalent of “lading” in Hindi, because govt had not changed the name of the bill from its earlier version — echoing DMK’s complaint that Modi govt has enacted laws without the customary English titles like the three criminal laws. Veeraswamy said govt should consider Tamils as a part of India. Citing a Tamil proverb, he went on to say that Tamils consider every person in contact as their relatives, but the treasury benches “treat us” as enemies and not political foes.The clash started after DMK MP T Sumathy said around Rs 2,000 crore originally meant for TN for PM-SHRI has been diverted to other states due to its opposition to NEP. She said Centre was using financial allocation for school education as a vengeful tool against the state.During the clash, the Speaker was infuriated at certain remarks made by DMK’s Dayanidhi Maran, who had trooped into the well shouting slogans against the govt. Birla dared Maran to repeat the same words on record from his seat, and action would be taken against him. Birla also urged the treasury benches to bring a motion against Maran’s remarks against the Chair. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju immediately rose to condemn Maran’s behaviour, and promised to bring a related motion.Pradhan said Centre was ready with the funds, but the state must sign an MoU by March 15 to implement NEP. He said Kanimozhi was aware that TN was ready to sign the MoU. “Let her be honest to people of Tamil Nadu that she only came to know today. Their higher education minister wrote to us. They are dishonest... It is unfortunate in democracy. They are trying to cover up their failure and doing politics,” he said.",Clash began after DMK MP claimed TN funds ‘diverted’ from PM-SHRI.

Dogs of war: Russian rumble makes Ukraine top arms buyer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dogs-of-war-russian-rumble-makes-ukraine-top-arms-buyer/articleshow/118865239.cms,"AP photo

With 43% share, UP top exporter

NEW DELHI: Ukraine has displaced India as the world’s largest arms importer in the 2020-24 timeframe, with its imports skyrocketing by nearly 100 times compared to 2015-19 due to its ongoing debilitating war with Russia.India notched up 8.3% of the global arms imports in 2020-24, driven largely by heightened tensions with China and Pakistan, while Ukraine stood at 8.8%, as per as per latest data on international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday.Overall, European arms imports grew by 155%, fueled by fears of Russia’s expansionism after invading Ukraine in Feb 2022 and the prevailing uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy under the new Trump administration.Pakistan’s arms import, incidentally, increased by 61% between 2015-19 and 2020-24. It was placed fifth in the world ranking, with 81% of its weapons coming from China, in yet another indicator of the ever-expanding military collusiveness between India’s two hostile neighbours.There was a small silver lining for India despite its strategically-vulnerable position of being a top arms importer, with SIPRI noting that its imports decreased by 9.3% between 2015-19 and 2020-24, partly due to New Delhi ’s increasing ability to design and produce its own weapons.The figures, however, do not account for deals where deliveries have not yet begun. This includes, for instance, the mega $3.3 billion contract with the US govt for 31 weaponized MQ-9B `Predator’ drones, along with another $520 million contract with manufacturer General Atomics to set up an MRO facility in India, inked last Oct.Russia remains India’s main weapons supplier, accounting for 36% of its arms imports. Russia’s share, however, has steadily declined from 72% in 2010-14 and 55% in 2015-19 because India has increasingly turned to the US, France and Israel. Russian arms exports, in fact, have fallen sharply by 64% in the latest five-year period, with China too relying mainly on its own military-industrial complex.Despite recent declarations from India and Russia that their defence ties remain as robust as ever, SIPR said, “The shift is visible in India’s new and planned orders for major arms, most of which will come from Western suppliers.”France accounts for 33% of India’s imports, with Israel placed third with 13%. India, of course, is getting set to ink two mega deals with France for direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines by Mazagon Docks, collectively worth around Euro 10.6 billion (almost Rs 1 lakh crore). India, incidentally, is the biggest arms customer of France, Russia and Israel.The fourth largest military spender after the US, China and Russia, India needs to single-mindedly pursue cutting-edge defence R&D, expand its defence-industrial base and streamline procurement procedures to ensure it gets the biggest bang for its buck.While DRDO, defence PSUs, shipyards and ordnance factories should become much more dynamic instead of wallowing in time and cost overruns, the domestic private sector and foreign armament majors must be further encouraged to enter defence production here in a much bigger way.Not a single “Make in India” project, for instance, has taken off till now under the much-touted strategic partnership model promulgated in May 2017 to boost indigenous defence production through tie-ups with foreign companies for “deep and extensive” technology transfers.","India notched up 8.3% of the global arms imports in 2020-24, driven largely by heightened tensions with China and Pakistan.

Stay updated with the latest city news, weather, and Air Quality Index (AQI) updates for major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Noida, and Bengaluru on Times of India.



MUMBAI: As the Mahayuti govt faces its first budget after the assembly polls after coming to power, it will have to walk the tightrope between controlling its massive debt and fiscal deficit while continuing its welfare schemes, with polls to local bodies including municipal corporations and gram panchayats due this year.The govt could focus on keeping its welfare schemes going while scrutinising and trimming beneficiaries as it has done with its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. It's already apparent that chances of hiking the Ladki Bahin stipend from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month as promised in the Mahayuti poll manifesto will be unlikely in this budget.With chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announcing a rise in the state's outlay under the Namo Shetkari Samman Nidhi for farmers from Rs 6,000 to Rs 9,000 per year, it's possible that the budget will account for this.The state's debt projection for 2024-25 was already Rs 7.8 lakh crore. Before the polls, it had introduced welfare schemes worth a steep Rs 96,000 crore including the Ladki Bahin Yojana which helped power its electoral victory. Since then, the state has introduced supplementary budgetary demands for additional expenses outside the budget worth Rs 1.37 lakh crore, the highest ever in Maharashtra.At Rs 1.1 lakh crores by July, the state's fiscal deficit had spiralled upwards. By Oct 2024, the state's finance department had warned that the fiscal deficit was estimated at Rs 2 lakh crore and would be impossible to fill. ""The fiscal deficit is beyond 3% of the state's GSDP and will not be possible to fill,"" the department had warned.Senior officials say the state will try and bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% of the GSDP, which is required by budgetary management norms. Fadnavis told TOI in the past that the state will not cut welfare or infrastructure spending but will focus on increasing revenue (TOI, Feb 13). However, the global slowdown will be a challenge to revenue generation. Fadnavis had said the state would focus on raising finances, including through borrowings, monetisation schemes and also through annuity schemes or build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes for infrastructure projects.","Mahayuti govt must balance its extensive debt and fiscal deficit with the continuation of welfare programs.

We will file missing complaint if these trolls are not found by morning!""BJP also shared another post about Sharma’s achievements, saying, ""Under Rohit Sharma’s captaincy: Team India wins T20 World Cup 2024 and Team India wins Champions Trophy 2025 .""Following the win, Mohamed congratulated the team, including Sharma, praising his leadership and performance. In a post on social media, she wrote, ""Hats off to captain Rohit Sharma who led from the front with a brilliant 76, setting the tone for victory.""Mohamed's controversial comments were made on social media and quickly went viral, sparking widespread backlash. She labelled Sharma ""fat for a sportsman"" and claimed he was the ""most unimpressive captain India has ever had,"" comparing him to cricketing legends like MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Sachin Tendulkar. Although Mohamed deleted her posts after facing heavy criticism, she defended her remarks, insisting that she was merely commenting on Sharma's fitness, not body-shaming.BJP leaders swiftly seized on the opportunity to criticise the Congress. BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla mocked the party, saying, ""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling Rohit Sharma unimpressive!"" Poonawalla further lauded Sharma's achievements, including his recent T20 World Cup victory and a stellar track record as captain.Meanwhile, other BJP leaders, including Pradeep Bhandari, accused Congress of continuously opposing figures who are seen as national heroes, while Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya weighed in, urging political parties to avoid criticising athletes. Mandaviya called out remarks that undermine sportspeople’s dedication, labelling such comments as “shameful” and “pathetic.” He added that politicians should respect athletes, who are capable of managing their professional lives without political interference.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that Mohamed had been advised to delete her posts and exercise more caution in the future. Congress MP Rajani Patil also condemned the remarks, calling body-shaming unacceptable and criticising the timing of Mohamed’s comments just before a major match.India's men's cricket team, under Rohit Sharma's leadership, triumphed in the Champions Trophy 2025, defeating New Zealand to secure their third title. Sharma’s performance, including a match-winning 76, was widely celebrated, and his leadership has been lauded by fans and experts.","Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed had previously faced criticism for calling the Indian captain ""fat"" and ""unimpressive"" Taking to social media, BJP shared a video featuring a scene from the film Pushpa featuring the iconic dialogue, ""Did you think I’m a flower just because you heard the name Pushpa?

NEW DELHI: Nearly 300 Indian nationals returned home via Thailand on Monday after being freed from scam centers in Myanmar, as reported by AFP. A crackdown on these illegal online fraud hubs, largely run by Chinese operators, has led to the release of around 7,000 workers from over two dozen countries.Many of the freed individuals, mostly Chinese, remain stranded in poor conditions near the Myanmar-Thai border. Indian officials escorted seven buses carrying 266 men and 17 women—along with three additional buses transporting their luggage—to Thailand’s Mae Sot airport.The government deployed a C-17 transport aircraft to bring them back, with another 257 nationals set to be repatriated the following day.China, which has already repatriated over 2,000 of its citizens, continues efforts to dismantle these scam operations that thrive in Myanmar’s lawless border regions. These centers, part of a billion-dollar industry, exploit foreign workers for online fraud, including romance and investment scams. Many workers report being lured into these jobs under false pretenses and subjected to abuse.China has treated its repatriated nationals as criminal suspects, placing them in handcuffs upon arrival.","Nearly 300 Indian nationals returned home via Thailand on Monday after being freed from scam centers in Myanmar.

Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin.

CAG-itated politics: How audit reports upend political fortunes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cag-itated-politics-how-audit-reports-upend-political-fortunes/articleshow/118809663.cms,"The scam that wasn't



'Conscience' shaking scam



Congress and CAG not meant for each other



NEW DELHI: Political parties and CAG reports have shared a hot and cold relationship in Indian politics over the decades. Interestingly, the two become quite inseparable when the elections approach. Delhi witnessed this recently when audit report of exorbitant spending on CM's official residence, injected into public consciousness as 'sheeshmahal' scam, was one of the key reasons that helped the Bharatiya Janata Party seal the fate of Aam Aadmi Party A simple look at the CAG website and the number of reports released in a year shows a drop by almost half, relatively during poll years, exception being 2014. This indicates how the ruling parties have done their best to keep the report away from the public glare, while the opposition has ensured it puts a spotlight on it.So, while several reports were used to shape the collective consciousness of the public towards parties like the Congress and the AAP, many other reports were carefully brushed under the carpet.Any discussion on CAG report and politics would perhaps be incomplete without a mention of the 2G scam and the coal block scam that played a key role in the downfall of Manmohan Singh-led UPA government in 2014.The 2G spectrum ""scam"" that led to the loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crores to the exchequer did not turn out to be a scam after the Supreme Court acquitted everyone.The apex court even pulled up the CBI saying that ""the prosecution miserably failed to prove any charge against any of the accused, made in its well choreographed chargesheet.""No matter the verdict, the ""scam"" did what it was supposed to -- put a final lock on the UPA government's fate -- paving way for the ""Modi wave"".The coal scam that led to the downfall of UPA government was much talked about. Referring to this, the NDA government last year dubbed it as the scam that ""shook the conscience of the nation in 2014"", with a loss of Rs 1.86 lakh crore to the exchequer.""These actions were scrutinised by investigation agencies, and in 2014, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India cancelled the allocation of 204 coal mines/blocks allocated since 1993,"" the central government said and rightly so.After BJP came to power in 2014, it had introduced a revamped coal auction and allocation system, facilitating the distribution of those 204 coal blocks. However, in doing so, it ignored warnings from its own leaders who said that it would lead to corruptions and scams.An investigation by The Reporters’ Collective revealed that the Union government had received early warnings in 2015 that its new coal auction system was vulnerable to corruption. However, no action was taken upon those warnings and the government went ahead with the new coal auction regime.And the two MPs were proved right.In 2016, a new CAG report on the e-auctions conducted in 2015 under the NDA government was released. It exposed irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks. The report documented instances of collusion and potential auction rigging by private firms, which secured coal blocks at prices that yielded suboptimal financial returns to the government.It found that the upfront payments made by successful bidders were undervalued by over Rs 382 crore, raising concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the coal allocation system.Congress was quick to latch on to this and alleged that rules were tweaked to favour one of the leading businessmen from Gujarat, who they claim is close to the government. It also cited instances where it emerged as the sole bidder. However, this never left any impact on the people enough to upend BJP's fate in 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Two years ago, several CAG reports came out but missed the public eye. One of those was that of Dwarka expressway where the cost of construction reached Rs 250 crore per kilometer against the approved cost of Rs 18.2 crore.Further, anomalies were found in the Ayushman Bharat scheme where the payments were being made to the dead.

Poll What is most important in the justice system? Proper Investigation Fair Trial

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose. And then, silence. Shahzadi was gone.""We did not hear from her afterward,"" Shamsher said Monday. They searched. They begged for news, combing through bureaucratic barriers, unanswered pleas. ""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said. ""She was a victim, not a criminal. She was innocent,"" Shamsher said. ""She only wanted to fix her scars.""

Government defends probe, DRI arrests hotelier’s son

NEW DELHI: Kannada actress Harshavardhini Ranya, popularly known as Ranya Rao , has been sent to judicial custody till March 24 in connection with an alleged Rs 12 crore gold smuggling case .The development comes amid fierce political battle in Karnataka, with the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP exchanging accusations over alleged favoritism and cover-ups.The BJP has alleged that a prominent minister in chief minister Siddaramaiah’s government is shielding Ranya Rao, suggesting a deep-rooted nexus in the smuggling operation. Karnataka BJP president B Y Vijayendra , in a post on 'X', called it “one of the biggest gold heists in recent times,” blaming the Congress government for “churning out scandals in increasingly innovative ways.”Vijayendra further claimed that such large-scale smuggling could not have occurred without the involvement of influential figures within the government. He warned that any attempts to suppress the investigation would backfire, especially with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stepping in.Meanwhile, the Congress has turned the tables on the BJP, revealing that the previous BJP government had allotted 12 acres of land in Sira, Tumakuru, to Ranya Rao’s company, Ksiroda India, for a steel plant in February 2023. Minister M B Patil shared official documents to back the claim, suggesting that the BJP, now raising questions, had granted land to the same individual they were accusing of a crime.State home minister G Parameshwara urged patience, stating that with both state and central agencies involved, the truth would emerge. ""Neither I nor the government can comment until the investigation is complete,"" he said.Meanwhile, in a fresh twist, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths arrested a man linked to the case.

Nadda flags oppn bid to raise matters via Rule 267

NEW DELHI: Led by Congress and Trinamool Congress, opposition parties Monday demanded a discussion in Parliament on alleged discrepancies in voter lists, with Rahul Gandhi raising the issue in Lok Sabha.Bringing up the matter during zero hour, Rahul said several states had found discrepancies in voter lists. “Voter lists are being questioned across country and the entire opposition has been demanding a discussion on the matter. Questions have been raised by opposition in one voice in every state, including Maharashtra,” he said. Congress, however, failed to bring it up in Rajya Sabha when party president Mallikarjun Kharge was not allowed to raise the matter.Later, Kharge posted on X, “The abrupt and unwarranted deletion of voters, presence of duplicate EPIC numbers, and other such crucial issues affecting integrity of our electoral process require urgent attention and discussion in Parliament.” SP, AAP and RJD too said it was an extremely serious matter and Parliament needed to take it up.TMC’s Saugata Roy demanded a thorough revision of voter lists, particularly ahead of assembly elections in Bengal and Assam next year. “There are some serious flaws. This has been pointed out with respect to Maharashtra, which had inflated voter lists. This was pointed out in Haryana. They are now trying to jump into Bengal and Assam where elections are due next year,” Roy claimed.Party MP Kalyan Banerjee sought action against EC and said the poll body had “failed” to conduct fair and transparent elections over the past few years.He said the West Bengal CM had already drawn the EC’s attention to numerous instances of “duplicate” voter cards.Leader of the House in RS J P Nadda Monday said govt is ready for discussion on any issue and questioned opposition’s intent over trying to raise matters through Rule 267 which calls for suspension of scheduled business to discuss urgent matters.He termed practice of opposition MPs giving notices under Rule 267 despite elaborate rulings by the chairman on the issue a “vicious design to demean Parliament”. Harivansh did not allow leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge to make his submission. Opposition MPs then protested for a while before walking out.Condemning the walkout, Nadda said opposition was not interested in debate and when their notices were rejected by the chair based on previous rulings, they wanted to give an impression that govt did not want to answer queries.“Govt under PM Modi is ready to discuss anything under this roof.

Pradhan doubles down on NEP stand

merits higher place in both society & academia: BJP

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin came down hard on Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday for calling DMK MPs “uncivilised”.Taking to X, Stalin said, “Dharmendra Pradhan, who thinks he is a king and speaks with arrogance, should mind his words. How can you call Tamil Nadu MPs uncivilised when you are the one who cheated Tamil Nadu by not releasing the funds?”DMK MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, too, expressed strong objection to Pradhan’s comments in LS, following which the Union minister said he would retract his words.During a heated Lok Sabha debate on three-language policy on Monday, Pradhan said DMK MPs were “undemocratic and uncivilised”. Condemning Pradhan’s remark, DMK cadres across Tamil Nadu set fire to Pradhan’s effigies. They raised slogans against the Union minister while beating his effigies with slippers.Referring to Pradhan’s remark, Stalin said Pradhan had insulted people of Tamil Nadu and demanded to know from PM Narendra Modi whether he approved of his minister’s speech.Recalling Pradhan’s letter dated Aug 30, 2024, Stalin said it was the minister who said TN entirely rejected the MoU sent by Union govt on NEP. “DMK functions on people’s wishes and not on directions from Nagpur (RSS headquarters),” said Stalin.Kanimozhi criticised Pradhan for his remarks. Taking to X, she said, “I strongly condemn Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan for his disgraceful remarks calling Tamil Nadu and its people uncivilised. On behalf of DMK and eight crore Tamilians, I demand an immediate apology!” The DMK MP further said, “His words deeply hurt and pained the people of Tamil Nadu. What right does he have to insult TN while happily taking its tax revenue, workforce, & contributions to the nation? BJP govt has no problem reaping benefits from Tamil Nadu, yet it repeatedly disrespects its people. We will not tolerate this!”Dharmendra Pradhan intensified his criticism of TN govt on dispute over implementation of NEP and said “those lacking concrete facts resorted to creating an uproar to mislead others”. He urged TN govt to prioritise students’ interests over political considerations. “Just a few days are left before completion of this financial year; govt doesn’t have any issue in providing TN their allocation of PM SHRI but they are not interested in it,” he said, adding, “Those who don’t want to join PM SHRI programme, I appeal to them, it is a scheme for benefit of students, and in TN, the medium of instruction will remain Tamil only. What is their opposition, I do not understand?”Amid protests by DMK members in Lok Sabha over language provisions in National Education Policy , senior BJP MPs Monday staunchly defended promotion of Sanskrit in both academia and society, arguing that its status as one of the oldest languages merits greater recognition.BJP MP Dilip Saikia called for Sanskrit to be made compulsory in universities nationwide, while Nishikant Dubey dismissed DMK’s protests as “politically motivated and attempt to divide the country by inciting passions by opposing NEP and delimitation of parliamentary constituencies”.DMK is opposing NEP and delimitation out of fear of losing the Tamil Nadu assembly polls due next year, he said.“DMK is only inciting passions. Tamil is an ancient language but Sanskrit pre-dates Tamil. Go to any temple across country be it in Tamil-speaking, Telugu-speaking or Kannada-speaking regions — everywhere puja is performed in Sanskrit,” Dubey said.He said in 1973, Congress-led govt increased seats in MP and Bengal in delimitation of parliamentary seats but did not do so in Tamil Nadu. “Despite that, DMK is running govt in partnership with Congress. DMK wants to divide the country by inciting emotions,” Dubey said.",DMK cadres across Tamil Nadu set fire to Pradhan’s effigies.

NEW DELHI: After clogged lavatories affected yet another long haul flight, Air India Monday issued an unusual statement: “Urge passengers to use lavatories only for purposes they are meant for.” Air India found the passengers had flushed polythene bags, rags, and clothes that led to clogged pipes and overflowing toilets.“Our teams have previously also found objects such as blankets, innerwear, and diapers, among other waste, having been flushed down toilets on other flights,” Air India said.AI has long faced this issue, mostly with its old Boeing 777s, used for the North America long hauls.

This led the lavatories to become unserviceable,” Air India stated.The airline empathised with passengers who faced discomfort and whose plans were affected by the flight’s diversion, but said the flight departed in time. An hour and forty-five minutes into the flight, the crew reported eight of the 12 lavatories in the aircraft to be unserviceable.“By this time, the aircraft was overflying the Atlantic, leaving points in Europe as potential cities to divert to. However, due to restrictions on night operations at most of the European airports, it was decided to divert back to Chicago,” the airline stated, adding, “The decision to divert was taken entirely in the interest of passenger comfort and safety.”Upon landing at Chicago, all passengers were provided immediate assistance, including hotel accommodation and alternative flight options to continue their journey to Delhi.","Passengers had flushed polythene bags, rags, and clothes that led to clogged pipes and overflowing toilets.

The pervert’s video, shot by a college student, went viral on social media sparking outrage and forcing cops to swiftly arrest the chef, who worked as a kitchen supervisor in the top hotel chain.The accused, Shantkumar, would often film his vulgar act on phone. During investigation, police were shocked to find his phone gallery replete with explicit videos , including many shot within his house. The chef, living in Nagpur for six months, admitted to filming himself in sexual acts with other women, police said. There were other pornographic videos, too, in his phone gallery.On Sunday evening, he stepped out of his car, walked towards the women while talking on his phone, and began masturbating. While most turned away, a college student decided to teach the pervert a lesson. She took out her phone and recorded his misdeeds, along with the red car in which he arrived. It was the car’s registration number plate that helped police track him down.

BENGALURU: Kannada actress Ranya Rao’s alleged involvement in the gold smuggling case has triggered a political slugfest in Karnataka with Congress and BJP trading charges of favouritism and cover-up. Harshavardhini Ranya alias Ranya Rao was arrested a week ago for allegedly smuggling gold worth Rs 12 crore from Dubai.While BJP alleged the involvement of an influential minister in shielding the actress, Congress countered the charge by accusing BJP of allotting 12 acres to Rao to set up a TMT steel bar factory. Karnataka minister M B Patil clarified that the land allotment did not materialise as Rao’s company failed to make the prescribed payment.In a post on ‘X’, BJP Karnataka chief B Y Vijayendra said, “Media reports about involvement of a prominent minister in Siddaramaiah’s govt in one of the biggest gold heists come as no surprise — especially given this govt’s track record of churning out scandals in increasingly “innovative” ways! (sic)” The MLA said the blatant violation of govt protocols that allegedly enabled Rao to smuggle gold could not have happened without support of influential figures within govt.The BJP state chief further added that if these reports were true, then it raised serious concerns about the extent of the alleged nexus.“Any attempt by govt to shield those responsible will backfire, especially with CBI now stepping in. The truth will come out, and any cover-up will only further expose the govt’s complicity in this grievous offence,” he said.State home minister G Parameshwara said probe was underway and with CBI also stepping in, the truth will come out. “Until the probe concludes, we cannot say anything. Neither me nor the govt can offer any such feedback,” the minister told reporters Monday.Minister for medium and large industries, M B Patil, hit back, saying that when BJP was in office, it allotted 12 acres land at Sira in Tumakuru to Ranya Rao’s firm in Feb 2023 to establish a steel plant.Regarding the land allotment, Vijayendra said, “It might have happened during BJP’s tenure. Let them probe. We are not stopping them.”On Monday, Patil’s office said the 12 acres of land sanctioned a company linked to actress Ranya Rao has not been officially allocated as the company failed to make the prescribed payment.",Kannada actress Ranya Rao’s alleged involvement in the gold smuggling case has triggered a political slugfest in Karnataka. Congress and BJP trading charges of favouritism and cover-up. Ranya was arrested a week ago for allegedly smuggling gold worth Rs 12 crore from Dubai.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118863722,imgsize-23660,width-400,resizemode-4/118863722.jpg"

CHANDIGARH: Punjab BJP media in-charge Vineet Joshi Monday accused Aam Aadmi Party of “making attempts to wrongly influence the minds of young voters with the inclusion of questions in exams that evidently lead to answers that talk about policies and programmes of governing AAP”.Hitting back, AAP termed the allegations as “baseless” and slammed BJP for “attempting to create unnecessary controversy and mislead the public for political gain”.At a presser, Joshi referred to the political science question paper of Punjab School Education Board’s Class XII exam held on March 4, and said it asked about when AAP was established. “Similarly, a question asked students to describe policies and programmes of AAP,” Joshi said. “This is blatant misuse of office by AAP… The education department cannot act like a mouthpiece of the establishment. Minds of youngsters, potential voters, cannot be influenced using the crutches of the education department,” he added.AAP spokesperson Neel Garg, in a statement, stated, “The subject of Political Science naturally includes discussions on regional and national political parties as part of the curriculum. In previous years’ papers, questions about BJP and Congress were asked too.”",Punjab BJP media in-charge Vineet Joshi accused Aam Aadmi Party of ‘making attempts to wrongly influence the minds of young voters’ AAP termed the allegations as ‘baseless’ and slammed BJP for ‘attempting to create unnecessary controversy and mislead the public for political gain’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118863450,imgsize-116380,width-400,resizemode-4/118863450.jpg"

Another reform vs tradition clash brews in Kerala over shirtless rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-reform-vs-tradition-clash-brews-in-kerala-over-shirtless-rule/articleshow/116955673.cms,"The year was 1982. A scuffle broke out in the dining hall of the Guruvayur temple complex when those serving special free meals manhandled a person who refused to remove his upper garment. They demanded to know whether the person who sat among the sacred thread-wearing shirtless men was a Brahmin or not. For, it was a 'Brahmin Oottu' (meal) and those belonging to other castes were unwelcome. The person who challenged the custom was spiritual leader and social reformer Sree Narayana Guru 's disciple Swami Ananda Theerthan, known for his relentless fighting against caste discrimination.As news about the manhandling of Ananda Theerthan made headlines the next day, temple authorities and the govt faced severe criticism. The then chief minister K Karunakaran reacted swiftly. The practice of 'Brahmana Oottu' was abolished, and a mass feast organised in the same dining area. Karunakaran, along with several other community members including Dalit activist and writer Kallara Sukumaran, participated in the event.However, the practice of some temples insisting that male devotees enter the temple with bare upper bodies continues to this day. Now, four decades later, a call by Satchidananda Swamy, head of Sivagiri mutt which was founded by Sree Narayana Guru, to do away with the shirtless tradition has sparked a fresh debate. Satchidananda Swamy put across his demand in the presence of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan at the inaugural session of the annual Sivagiri pilgrimage. The mutt chief argued that the dress code had nothing to do with scriptures or spirituality and was a disgusting residue of casteism in Kerala. ""Temples and deities are instruments that help devotees reach the formless and nameless God. It has nothing to do with the external appearance or the dress code of the devotees. What is going on in the devotee's mind while inside the temple and in front of the deity is the only thing that matters,"" said Swamy.According to him, such dress codes were the invention of the clergy aimed at excluding non-Brahmins from temples. He pointed out that even some non-Brahmin priests were trying to enforce such Brahmanical traditions, including in some temples under the Sivagiri mutt's administration.Vijayan who, just a few days earlier attempted to disassociate Sree Narayana Guru from Sanatana Dharma, responded positively to Satchidananda Swamy's call but with caution. He said the abolition of the dress code restrictions should be done only after reaching a consensus among temple stakeholders. The CM's measured response was probably on account of the bitter experience his govt faced when it tried to implement the Supreme Court's order permitting women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala temple.""Satchidananda Swamy's suggestion is a positive one. But the Devaswom board alone cannot take a decision. Consensus is essential,"" said Travancore Devaswom Board president P S Prasanth, echoing the CM's sentiment.According to historian M G Sasibhooshan, the dress code might have originated as an attempt to discourage people from casually straying into temples or treating them as tourist spots. But he pointed out that such restrictions are prevalent only in Kerala or in a few temples like the Sri Mookambika Temple in Karnataka due to shared traditions with Malayali Brahmins. Most other Indian temples allow devotees to enter even the sanctum sanctorum without dress code restrictions.Sasibhooshan also said the Kerala govt had made an abortive attempt to abolish dress code restrictions in the 1970s. The discussion took a contentious turn after Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G Sukumaran Nair came out against Pinarayi Vijayan's support for Swamy's proposal. Nair argued that temple traditions could not be altered by anyone, including the govt. He also questioned Satchidananda Swamy's right to challenge temple practices. According to him, each temple had its own practices and traditions, and the dress code was an essential part of it.The war of words continued as Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan launched a counter-attack on the NSS general secretary, saying such issues should not divide the Hindu community. Yogakshema Sabha president Akkeeraman Kaladasan Bhattathirippad struck a more conciliatory tone. He acknowledged that unnecessary restrictions and evil practices should indeed be abolished but stressed that changes must be implemented through broader consultation on a case-by-case basis.He also rejected the argument that the dress code existed to help Brahmin priests identify their community members. ""Customs and traditions vary across temples. For instance, Sabarimala temple has no dress code restrictions, and even non-Hindus are welcome there. But the same temple doesn't allow women between 10 to 50 age groups to enter. We are not against change, but it's unfortunate to attribute Brahminical hegemony to anything and everything,"" he said.","Satchidananda Swamy, head of Sivagiri mutt, calls for end to shirtless tradition. He argues that the dress code had nothing to do with scriptures or spirituality. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan backs Swamy's call, but with caution.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116955694,imgsize-530384,width-400,resizemode-4/116955694.jpg"

0 visibility for 9 hours: Worst fog of season blinds city,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/0-visibility-for-9-hours-worst-fog-of-season-blinds-city/articleshow/116952045.cms,"NEW DELHI: Flights were cancelled, trains ran late, and weekend road traffic was sluggish as the national capital was enveloped in a thick fog blinding it for as long as 12 hours, starting late Friday night until Saturday morning. This occurred against a backdrop of cold and polluted weather. A yellow alert was issued by the Met, expecting moderate to dense fog on Sunday and light to very light rain on Monday.According to IMD, on Saturday, very dense fog led to zero visibility, which lasted for nine hours at Palam and six hours at Safdarjung, making it the season's worst fog situation for the national capital. Weather scientists cited no winds, an abundance of moisture near the surface layer, and a highly stable surface boundary layer as reasons for this situation.The fog conditions also impacted a large area of the Indo-Gangetic plains.The formation of very dense fog leading to zero visibility for over eight hours impacted flight operations for the third consecutive day at IGI airport. According to FlightRadar24, over 400 flights were delayed, and the average delay was 34 minutes. Airport officials said that 19 flights, of which two were international, were diverted while some flights were cancelled. However, around 45 flights were cancelled either due to bad weather at the destination or other operational reasons from Delhi, airport officials added.A dense fog across the Indo-Gangetic plain wreaked havoc on train services, leaving 1.5 to 2 lakh passengers stranded or delayed while travelling to and from Delhi. The severe weather disrupted around 100 trains, with 49 requiring rescheduling due to maintenance needs. However, the delay led to major disruptions, particularly for key trains including the Vande Bharat Express to Mata Vaishno Devi, Varanasi, Khajuraho, Ayodhya, and services such as the Lucknow Swarn Shatabdi and Amritsar Shatabdi, all of which faced delays of over four hours.On Saturday, the city's base station, Safdarjung, recorded a minimum temperature of 7.8 degrees Celsius, 0.9 notches above normal.","Dense fog blankets Delhi for 12 hours, disrupting flights, trains and road traffic.

"PM Modi hails rise in rural consumption, says vision is to empower villages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-hails-rise-in-rural-consumption-says-vision-is-to-empower-villages/articleshow/116951986.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday celebrated the rise in rural consumption, citing the recent household consumption expenditure survey, and a dip in poverty as underlined in an SBI study released a day before.The consumption expenditure survey that showed rural households are diversifying their spend and devoting a larger part of expenditure on non-food items. ""Our vision is to empower rural India by transforming villages into vibrant centres of growth and opportunity... I am confident that the development of villages will lead to the realisation of a developed India,"" Modi said while inaugurating the six-day Grameen Bharat Mahotsav here at Bharat Mandapam. His remarks on the changed face of rural India came amid preparations for the Union Budget.The study by SBI, released on Friday, noted that rural poverty fell sharply from nearly 26% in 2011-12 to 7% in 2022-23, and further to less than 5% in 2023-24.The consumption expenditure survey, released last month, showed that the urban-rural gap in the monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) declined to 71% in 2022-23 from 84% in 2011-12. It further came down to 70% in 2023-24, confirming sustained momentum of consumption growth in rural areas. The survey also showed that non-food items remained the major contributor to a household's average monthly expenditure in 2023-24 with about 53% and 60% share in MPCE in rural and urban areas, respectively.Citing figures from the SBI study on poverty, Modi took a swipe at the previous Congress govts' 'Garibi Hatao' slogan, saying while some people have been raising slogans to eradicate poverty for decades, the country is now witnessing a real reduction in poverty.Referring to the consumption expenditure survey, which shows that average MPCE in rural India increased from Rs 1,430 in 2011-12 to Rs 4,122 in 2023-24, Modi said the figures reveal that the purchasing power of people in rural India has nearly tripled, indicating that people are spending more on their preferred items.The PM said previously, villagers had to spend more than 50% of their income on food, but for the first time since Independence, the expenditure on food in rural areas has fallen below 50%, and this meant people are now spending on other desires and needs, improving their quality of life.He noted that these achievements could have been realised during the tenure of previous govts, but for decades after Independence, lakhs of villages were deprived of basic necessities.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, ""PSBs are already operating credit saturation drives in priority sectors for schemes such as PM MUDRA Yojana, PM Awas Yojana, and SVAnidhi Yojana. Taking the momentum further, the Grameen Bharat Mahotsav showcases India's rich cultural heritage as well as the aspirations of rural people and development in the four areas -GI Tags, natural farming, women empowerment, tribal welfare, with a focus on Northeast products.""","The consumption expenditure survey that showed rural households are diversifying their spend and devoting a larger part of expenditure on non-food items.

Lakshadweep divers bump into wreck of centuries-old warship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lakshadweep-divers-bump-intowreck-of-centuries-old-warship/articleshow/116951968.cms,"Divers discovered the wreck of a probable European warship near Kalpeni island, Lakshadweep on Saturday. The ship, dating back to the 17th or 18th centuries, includes a cannon and anchor, suggesting historic maritime battles.

CHENNAI: A group of divers exploring marine life near Kalpeni island in the Lakshadweep archipelago stumbled on Saturday morning upon the wreck of what, it appeared, had been a warship.Going by the nature of the wreck, researchers believe the ship, fitted with cannon, might have belonged to any of the three European powers - Portuguese, Dutch, or British - and was sunk sometime during the fight for supremacy over the ancient maritime route connecting the Middle East and Sri Lanka in the 17th and 18th centuries.“When we spotted the wreck on the western side of Kalpeni, we didn’t know it was a warship. When we found a cannon and an anchor, we realised it could be an important find,” said Satyajeet Mane, a marine explorer who led the group of divers from Brannadives, a local divers’ group that included Nasrulla and Sajudheen.They said they would inform the local authorities about the find. ""We found it at a depth of just four or five metres at the mouth of a lagoon. The wreckage appears to be spread over the deeper parts of the Arabian Sea,"" said Mane. ""Going by the size of the ship, the cannon, and the metal, it could be a European warship. More exploration is needed.""Idrees Babu, a scientist at the department of science and technology and a mentor to the divers' group, said such a shipwreck has not been recorded in the region earlier. tnn""The ship might have been 50m-60m in length. The East India Company started using iron ships on this trade route in the 17th century or 18th century. We need underwater archaeological studies to learn more about it; till then we need to protect the site,"" he said.When the British used iron ships, the Portuguese continued to use ships made of iron and wood. ""The coral growth on the wreckage and corrosion makes it difficult to immediately ascertain if the ship was made fully of iron or it had components of wood too. The coral growth indicates it has been submerged for a few centuries,"" said Mane.","Divers stumble upon wreck of probable European warship near Kalpeni island, Lakshadweep.

The waste was transported to Pithampur (near Indore) on court orders, he said. ""If any security concerns or fear arise among the public, the state govt will present it before the court. No further action will be taken until the court provides clear directions. The govt is committed to complying with court orders and will proceed only as per its instructions,"" the CM said.On Friday, violence broke out as protesters clashed with police in the industrial township near Indore. Two of the protesters tried to immolate themselves and are in hospital with burns. Taken aback by the protests, MP govt said Saturday it would request HC for more time to dispose of waste from the 1984 tragedy.State chief secretary Anurag Jain Saturday said govt will present an affidavit in HC to apprise it of public sentiments and seek more time. Further action on waste disposal will not be taken without taking the public into confidence, Jain said in Bhopal. He said everything has been done according to SC guidelines.“The waste has only been transported so far. No immediate decision has been taken to burn it,” Jain said, adding: “After discussing all the points related to this, when it emerges that the situation is completely under control, only then the waste will be disposed of.”Protests by Pithampur citizens continued for the second day Saturday. At least 80 industries were forced to shut operations as workers, apprehensive about their safety amid escalating unrest in the industrial township, did not report for duty. This resulted in significant production losses in the state’s largest industrial hub.Gautam Kothari, president of Pithampur Audhyogik Sanghatan, said, “This situation could have been averted if govt had established proper communication channels with residents. There were no assurances or dialogue with locals, leading to this mismanaged situation.”“Not a single worker reported to work Saturday. Since we are in the same sector as the waste disposal plant, the situation in this vicinity is extremely tense.

Virat Kohli - out or not out at SCG? Experts divided on decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/virat-kohli-out-or-not-out-at-scg-experts-divided-on-decision/articleshow/116899309.cms,"Steve Smith was ruled to have grassed this catch attempt to allow Virat Kohli to continue batting at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma dropped! Exclusive visuals of his last session with India Test team

The Australian cricket team erupted in joy after what seemed to be an astonishing team catch off Virat Kohli ’s first ball on the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.However, third umpire Joel Wilson ruled it not out.Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.Despite this, the decision was overturned by Wilson, as it appeared that the ball had grazed the ground after Smith’s attempt.This ruling has sparked considerable debate among fans and experts alike.Former Australia opener and coach Justin Langer believes Kohli was out. “From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did,” he said on 7 Cricket.“He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that’s out.”Ricky Ponting agreed with Langer.“As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had’ve come out of (Smith’s) hand, he wouldn’t have been able to scoop it up,” he said on 7 Cricket.“I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball … look where his pointer figure is there, it’s still underneath the ball.”Former Test umpire Simon Taufel on Channel 7 explained why the Virat Kohli first-ball review was hard to judge.“I think you described it very well when you said that depending upon which side of the fence you sit on you could probably build a case for either decision to be given,” he said.“Listening to Joel Wilson’s language there, where he said the fingers were underneath the ball and then he’s seen it roll on to the ground, by his own language he is telling us that he believes he’s seeing that ball on the ground.“So, there are two things that the TV umpire here is looking for. One is fingers underneath the ball. He was satisfied there. But then he believes through those pictures that he’s clearly seen the ball on the ground.“And here’s the challenge, slowing it right down with slow-mo. Play it at real speed and it looks pretty good.“I can certainly understand what the third umpire’s done there. He believes he’s seen the ball on the ground and called it way he’s seen it. Normally the ICC protocol on fair catches is if you see the fingers underneath the ball, that’s good to maintain a fair catch.“But here’s the problem: the on-field umpire’s no longer have the soft signal and make the decision, it’s purely in the hands of the television umpire now.”Mark Waugh, in commentary for Fox, also felt it was out.“Virat Kohli will breath a huge sigh of relief, Australian fans will feel they’ve been robbed, Indian fans (it’s) desperate relief,” Isa Guha said on Fox Cricket.Mark Waugh believes the finger was underneath the ball when it touched the turf.“It would’ve been a great catch … I think it was … he’s not happy,” he said.“You see his right finger just underneath it … I think he’s got away with one there Kohli.”Former Australian greater Allan Border was unsure. “Those ones looks so close, it’s hard to tell,” he said.Ex-India allrounder Irfan Pathan said Kohli was rightly given not out.“Virat Kohli was not out which was rightly called NOT OUT. will explain during the break,” Pathan wrote on X.","Virat Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.

'India well-prepared': Government says closely monitoring HMPV situation in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-well-prepared-government-says-closely-monitoring-hmpv-situation-in-china/articleshow/116947440.cms,"'Nothing to be alarmed about present situation': Director General of Health Services

What is HMPV?

NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry on Saturday said that India is ""closely monitoring"" the situation regarding a new variant of the human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ). The ministry also mentioned that it has requested the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to provide ""timely updates"" on the situation in China and that ""India is well-prepared"" to manage any potential rise in respiratory illnesses.The health ministry said that the surge in respiratory illnesses observed in China was consistent with the seasonal flu patterns. It said that reports indicate that the increase in cases is primarily due to Influenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)—all common pathogens associated with the flu season.The ministry noted that these viruses are already circulating globally, including in India, and there is no indication of an unusual rise in respiratory cases.It said that while there is no cause for alarm, as a precaution, the ICMR will increase the number of laboratories testing for HMPV and will continue to monitor trends throughout the year, the statement said.The ministry urged the public to follow standard health precautions, including avoiding close contact when exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness.On Friday, Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Atul Goel, had explained that after analysing the data on respiratory outbreaks in India, there had been no significant rise in cases during December 2024, and no large-scale outbreaks were reported from Indian institutions.""There is news doing the rounds about a Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) outbreak in China. However, we have analysed the data of the respiratory outbreaks in the country (India) and there is no substantial increase in the December 2024 data and no cases which have been reported in large numbers from any of our institutions. There is nothing to be alarmed about the present situation,"" Goel said.He added that hospitals are well-equipped to manage the typical winter surge in respiratory infections. Goel also urged the public to follow standard precautions, such as avoiding close contact with others if experiencing symptoms.Meanwhile, China downplayed the severity of the outbreak, stating that this year’s respiratory infections were less severe than last year’s and assured that it remains safe for foreign travellers.Reports from China have raised concerns about a surge in respiratory infections, attributed to the HMPV. While some social media posts highlight overwhelmed hospitals, Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) have not declared a state of emergency. This increase in infections comes during the winter season, a time when respiratory illnesses naturally peak.HMPV, discovered in 2001, belongs to the Pneumoviridae family, alongside the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It causes symptoms similar to the common cold or flu, such as coughing, a runny nose, and fever. It can be particularly severe for children under five, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems or chronic respiratory conditions like asthma.HMPV spreads through respiratory droplets, close contact, and contaminated surfaces. There is no specific treatment or vaccine, so management focuses on symptom relief. Preventative measures, such as handwashing, wearing masks, and avoiding contact when ill, are recommended.","The Union health ministry on Saturday said that India is ""closely monitoring"" the situation regarding a new variant of the human metapneumovirus ( HMPV) The ministry also mentioned that it has requested the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to provide ""timely updates"" on the situation in China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116947433,imgsize-811473,width-400,resizemode-4/116947433.jpg"

Kishor questioned.Kishor’s hunger strike has entered its third day amid a biting cold wave in Patna. His protest calls for the cancellation of the 70th Combined Competitive Examination held on December 13, following claims of widespread malpractice, including the sale of exam seats. ""More than half the BPSC seats were sold,"" he alleged, adding that the position of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) is being openly traded for Rs 1.5 crore.The district administration has deemed Kishor’s protest illegal, citing a Patna high court directive that restricts demonstrations to Gardani Bagh. An FIR has been lodged against him and 150 of his supporters, with officials warning of further action if the protest site is not vacated.Despite the mounting pressure, Kishor has vowed to continue his hunger strike until the Bihar government addresses the demands of the protesting students. ""There is no question of withdrawing my fast, not until the demands of the students are met. We suggested from our end that the CM should meet the students and together they should bring out a solution. If that happens then I have no problem stopping the fast,"" he told news agency ANI.Also read:",Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor on Saturday reacted sharply to criticism over a luxury 'vanity van' parked near his protest site at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan.

Online Dating Scams Fake Job Offers or Investment Schemes

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Saturday arrested a 23-year-old individual who allegedly scammed more than 700 women after establishing connections on dating platforms by impersonating a US-based model. The West district's cyber police station arrested Tushar Bisht for exploiting platforms like Bumble and Snapchat to deceive victims, coerce them using personal images and recordings, and demand money, according to Delhi Police.""Posing as a US-based freelance model, the accused created fake identities using a virtual international mobile number and photographs of a Brazilian model,"" deputy commissioner of police (West), Vichitra Veer, said in the statement.Bisht utilised these fraudulent profiles to establish contact with women between 18 and 30 years on various online dating services.""His primary targets were users of Bumble, Snapchat and WhatsApp,"" the statement said.The DCP said that Bisht established trust through dialogue and persuaded them to share private and intimate images and videos.""Once he obtained the content, he resorted to blackmail, threatening to leak the sensitive material online, or sell them to dark web unless the victims paid him,"" the DCP said.Initial investigations showed the accused communicated with over 500 individuals on Bumble and 200 others across Snapchat and WhatsApp, authorities reported.The seized mobile device contained incriminating evidence, including victims' objectionable data, a virtual mobile number, and records of extortion-related financial dealings.Authorities confiscated 13 bank-issued credit cards, the statement added.The case came to light on December 13, when a Delhi University student reported to cyber police that she had connected with the accused on Bumble earlier that year.Claiming to be a US-based model visiting India professionally, he gained her confidence through regular communication.As their relationship developed, he convinced her to share private photos and videos via Snapchat and WhatsApp. He consistently avoided in-person meetings with various excuses, the DCP said.""The situation escalated when the accused sent her a private video she had shared, and demanded money. Pressured, the victim made small payments, citing her financial constraints. However, the relentless demands drove her to inform her family and lodge a complaint,"" the DCP said.Following an FIR registration, a dedicated team identified Bisht and located him in Shakarpur, east Delhi. A raid resulted in his arrest, the statement confirmed.Explaining his methods, the DCP revealed that during questioning, Bisht acknowledged using a virtual international number obtained through an application for over two years. He used this to register on various platforms, presenting himself as a successful model.His counterfeit profiles included fictional narratives and photographs for authenticity. After establishing connections, he persuaded victims to share intimate material.""Initially, he did this for amusement but later he turned it into a calculated scheme to extort money. He confessed to possessing the private content of numerous women and blackmailing several of them for financial gains,"" Vichitra Veer said in the statement.Bisht comes from a middle-class Shakarpur family. His father serves as a private driver, his mother manages the household, and his sister works in Gurugram.A BBA graduate, Bisht worked as a technical recruiter at a Noida-based organisation for three years.Police investigations revealed communications with over 60 women from Delhi and surrounding areas. They identified two bank accounts linked to him, with one showing multiple victim transactions while awaiting details of the second account.",Delhi Police arrest Tushar Bisht for exploiting platforms like Bumble and Snapchat.

"Under new policy, Lieutenant Generals to be promoted on merit basis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-new-policy-lieutenant-generals-to-be-promoted-on-merit-basis/articleshow/116929166.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India moving towards the creation of tri-Service theatre commands, the Army has adopted a radical change in the promotion policy for top officers by making it necessary for all Lieutenant Generals to be graded on their performance through a “quantified assessment system”.This new system, which will come into force from March 31, will “facilitate merit-based selection” of serving Lt-Gens for apex-level appointments in the integrated theatre commands and tri-Service establishments, sources told TOI.The new policy for Lt-Gens, with “revised annual confidential report (ACR) forms”, will not apply to the vice chief and commanders-in-chief of the six operational commands and one training command in the Army. These eight officers are also Lt-Gens but a rung higher than the other three-star generals.The over 11-lakh Army has almost 90 Lt-Gens, 300 Major Generals and 1,200 Brigadiers in its 43,000-strong officer cadre. “The new policy for Lt-Gens will align the Army with the much smaller IAF and Navy, where the quantified appraisal of equivalent ranks (Air Marshals and Vice Admirals) is already there,” a source said.“There was no quantified ACR system for Lt-Gens so far. Now, they will be graded on different attributes on a scale from 1 to 9. In effect, promotions will be based on merit rather than just seniority. The impending creation of theatre commands requires a uniform assessment system for the top ranks in all the three Services,” he added.The Army headquarters’ letter on the new policy does not specify whether it will also be applicable for the selection of the vice-chief and seven commanders-in-chief within the force.As per the existing Army policy, promotion to the C-in-C level is based purely on seniority, in conjunction with the date of birth and vacancies available. A Lt-Gen, after he has commanded one of the 14 corps in the force, must have `residual’ service of 18 months (till he turns 60) to be promoted as the C-in-C of one of the seven Army commands.Strong reservations against the new policy are already being expressed by some officers. “Very few officers become three-star generals after being assessed on merit at every step in their careers in the Army’s steeply-pyramidical structure,” a senior officer said.“After the Lt-Gen rank, promotion to C-in-C was based on seniority. Introducing merit at this stage will open the door for interference, political or otherwise,” he added.The policy comes at a time when the blueprint for the three theatre commands for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean Region has been finalized to ensure an integrated war-fighting machinery. Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan has already made presentations to defence minister Rajnath Singh and national security advisor Ajit Doval on the matter.As per the existing plan, which entails the most radical military reorganization in the country since Independence, the China-specific northern theatre command will come up in Lucknow, while the western one for Pakistan will be based in Jaipur. The maritime theatre command, in turn, will be located at Thiruvananthapuram, as earlier reported by TOI.",New system will “facilitate merit-based selection” of serving Lt-Gens for apex- level appointments in integrated theatre commands and tri-Service establishments.

Gift deed can be quashed if kids neglect parents: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gift-deed-can-be-quashed-if-kids-neglect-parents-sc/articleshow/116926192.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emphasising need to protect interests of senior citizens, many of whom are ignored by their children and left to fend for themselves once they hand over property by executing a gift deed , Supreme Court held that such deeds signed by parents could be quashed under Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act if the children fail to take care of them. The transfer of property would be declared null and void, court said.A bench of Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Karol said the Act is a beneficial legislation meant to lend a helping hand to elders who are left alone due to withering of joint family system and that its provisions should be interpreted liberally, and not in the strict sense, to protect their rights.It set aside a Madhya Pradesh HC verdict which held that gift deeds cannot be quashed on grounds of not serving parents if such conditions were not expressly mentioned in the deed. SC said HC took a 'strict view' of the legislation when a liberal view was needed to be taken to fulfil purpose of the law.Section 23 of the Act says, ""Where any senior citizen who, after the commencement of this Act, has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, subject to the condition that the transferee shall provide basic amenities and basic physical needs to the transferor and if such transferee refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, the said transfer of property shall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or under undue influence and shall at the option of the transferor be declared void by the tribunal.""Referring to this, HC had held that a gift deed should have a clause to the effect to bind children to take care of parents, and the deed cannot be quashed in absence of it. But SC overruled the verdict.The court allowed a woman's plea for quashing the gift deed in favour of her son who refused to take care of her. It relied on ""avachan patra/promissory note"" executed by her son promising to take care of her till the end of her life and that if he does not do so, she will be at liberty to take back the deed. The note was executed on the same day of execution of the gift deed.""The Act is a beneficial piece of legislation, aimed at securing rights of senior citizens, in view of the challenges faced by them. It is in this backdrop that the Act must be interpreted and a construction that advances remedies of the Act must be adopted,"" SC said.","Supreme Court held that such deeds signed by parents could be quashed under Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act. The transfer of property would be declared null and void, court said.

'Appalling': Indologist Dalrymple slams 17th century Mubarak Manzil demolition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/appalling-indologist-dalrymple-slams-17th-century-mubarak-manzil-demolition/articleshow/116951559.cms,"AGRA: In a scathing critique, Scottish historian and Indologist William Dalrymple condemned the demolition of Agra's 17th-century Mubarak Manzil, calling it an ""appalling negligence of India's heritage"" and the main reason why the country fails to attract tourists from abroad despite its rich cultural past.Sharing TOI's report on a social media platform, Dalrymple said, ""One of the most important historic buildings in Agra destroyed with the full connivance of authorities. This is exactly why India attracts so few tourists.""In a continuation post on X, Dalrymple added, ""Neglect your main heritage centres, allow developers to raze all its heritage properties, and then be surprised when this great country has fewer tourists than Dubai or Singapore.""According to the World Economic Forum Travel & Tourism Development Index, India attracted 11 million international tourists in 2019, a stark contrast to France's 90 million tourists that same year and Spain's 85 million in 2023.Dubai, a single city, recorded 17.5 million arrivals in 2023.Mubarak Manzil, located near the Iron Bridge in Agra, was documented on an 1868 map. During British rule, engineer A C Polwhele reported its use as a goods depot for the East Indian Railway. A marble plaque stated that Aurangzeb built it after the Battle of Samugarh. British archaeologist ACL Carlleyle's 1871 report detailed its architecture and historical significance.The demolition of Mubarak Manzil has sparked widespread protests from locals, historians, and political leaders. Politicians have joined the outcry. Former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi criticised the act.Shakeel Chauhan, national general secretary of the Tourist Guide Federation of India, said, ""The Centre envisions making tourism a $1 trillion ecosystem with 100 million international tourist arrivals by 2047, but neglect towards heritage sites undermines this goal. Mubarak Manzil is not an isolated incident.""""Other sites in Agra, including Zohra Bagh, Lodhi-era structures, and Shahi Hammam, have also been destroyed. Reports of water leakage at the Taj Mahal and damage to 400-year-old paintings at Akbar's Tomb further dent India's image as a tourist destination,"" he added.","Mubarak Manzil, located near the Iron Bridge in Agra, was documented on an 1868 map.

Arrested Rajasthan PSC member leaked papers: SIT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arrested-rajasthan-psc-member-leaked-papers-sit/articleshow/116951506.cms,"JAIPUR: Arrested Rajasthan Public Service Commission ( RPSC ) member Babu Lal Katara not only handed over six sets of 2021 SI exam question papers to commission colleague Ramu Ram Raika, but also leaked these to Udaipur-based govt accountant Purushottam Dadhich who allegedly circulated the papers for profit a full month before the exam.This new detail, revealed in a SIT report exclusively accessed by TOI, belies the earlier perception that Katara's leak was limited to Raika's family. The test was held on three days, from Sept 13 to 15, 2021, during the tenure of Ashok Gehlot-led Congress govt. SIT has recommended cancellation of the test results. The state's current BJP govt is yet to take a decision on it. Some unsuccessful candidates have filed a plea for cancellation in Rajasthan HC, which has sought govt's stand.The SIT report confirms the leak originated from RPSC headquarters in Ajmer. Previously, it was believed that Katara provided question papers for Raika's son Devesh and daughter Shobha only, both of whom were arrested while undergoing SI training.Since Dadhich is absconding, it is not clear how many others received the leaked papers from him. Additionally, the SIT suggests Dadhich may have shared the papers with some coaching centres.The new revelation emerged after the SIT arrested candidate Renu Kumari last year. She received Hindi and GK papers three days before the exam from Dadhich. ""Katara provided Dadhich with six sets of question papers,"" the SIT report states.On Saturday, Rajasthan police said directions had been issued to suspend all 45 trainee SIs arrested in the leak case. SIT has arrested 45 trainees since March 2024. Of these, 25 were released on bail, while the rest remain in judicial custody. Some were scheduled to begin assignments.The SIT report pointed out that the previous Congress govt rushed and wrapped up SI appointments by Oct 3, 2023, days before model code for assembly elections later that year came into force.In another damning revelation, the SIT has accused RPSC of stonewalling its probe into the matter.","RPSC member Babu Lal Katara handed over six sets of 2021 SI question papers to colleague Ramu Ram Raika.

The mahapanchayat was called in support of the farmer representative, who has been on a hunger strike amid deadlock over talks on the long-pending demands of the farmers.Contesting govt figure of 4 lakh farmer suicides, Dallewal said ""as per our knowledge, over 7 lakh farmers ended lives due to debt"". ""SC observed that my life is precious, but I feel the lives of all those who committed suicide were precious for their respective families, and no more lives should go waste,"" he added.Speaking at another kisan mahapanchayat in Haryana's Tohana, Sanyukta Kisan Morcha representative Rakesh Tikait took aims at central govt, accusing it of prolonging the stir with the aim to rupture farmers' unity and defame Sikhs. Although Tohana gathering expressed concerns over Dallewal's deteriorating health, Tikait also took jibes, alleging Centre was sustaining agitation in Punjab to make it look bigger than Delhi protests in 2020-2021, which SKM had spearheaded.","Farmer union representative Jagjit Singh Dallewal on 40th day of his indefinite fast.

The offering was part of the six-day annual Urs and marked the 11th consecutive year that Modi has maintained the tradition.The gesture comes amid a lawsuit filed by Hindu Sena in an Ajmer court in Sept, claiming a Shiva temple predated the dargah - now a spiritual landmark for millions across faiths. The dargah committee, under the ministry of minority affairs, dismissed as baseless the claims that the dargah was built atop a temple.An Ajmer court postponed Saturday the hearing of Hindu Sena's application seeking to prevent the PM's chaddar offering . The matter will now be heard on Jan 24, alongside the primary case.Speaking at the Mehfil Khana, Rijiju read Modi's message to devotees: ""Throughout history, our saints, peers, fakirs and great spiritual leaders have illuminated lives with their altruistic values. Through his life and teachings, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti left an indelible mark of service, compassion, and humanity.""The message emphasised harmony: ""His teachings of love, unity, and harmony will continue to inspire generations to come. The occasion serves as a significant medium to strengthen bonds of community and solidarity among people.""The PM's gesture was interpreted by many in the Muslim community as a symbolic rejection of the lawsuit.

PUNE: A 25-year-old BPO worker, Shubhada Kodare, was hacked to death with a cleaver by a colleague in the parking lot of her office, while two dozen people remained mute spectators.Shubhada was attacked by 27-year-old Krishna Satyanarayan Kanojia on Tuesday, allegedly because she refused to return money borrowed from him on false pretext. She succumbed to injuries late Tuesday at a private hospital. Kanojia was arrested and investigation is on.A grainy minute-long video of the attack surfaced online Thursday, which showed the attacker calmly walking about with the cleaver before Shubhada slumped to the ground and a pool of blood formed around her. While 20-odd people witnessed the scene unfold on premises of the BPO where both the accused and the victim worked, none moved to stop the attacker. Some grabbed the assailant only after he tossed away the cleaver.Additional commissioner of police Manoj Patil said probe revealed that both Shubhada and Kanojia were working as executives in the accounts department of the BPO at Ramwadi in Yerawada. About a year ago, Shubhada, of Karad in Satara, told Kanojia that she needed money to support treatment of her father. He lent her money several times adding up to Rs 4 lakh.A few months ago, she informed Kanojia that her father would be operated upon. After a few days, Kanojia, as a good gesture, visited her father. He was shocked to learn that her father did not have any health issues.After this, Kanojia demanded his money back, but she picked arguments and lodged a non-cognisable offence against him three months ago, Patil said. He kept pursuing her to get his money back, but she avoided him and did not answer his calls.""Enraged, Kanojia came prepared and attacked her,"" he said.","Shubhada Kodare, 25, was hacked to death with a cleaver by a colleague in the parking lot of her office.

Hiding sister’s inter-caste marriage is cruelty: Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiding-sisters-inter-caste-marriage-is-cruelty-court/articleshow/117100514.cms,"The wife left her marital home two days after learning that her sister-in-law had married into another community which she considered lower in the societal caste hierarchy.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has served notice to a woman who obtained a divorce through a family court primarily citing cruelty because her husband's sister had married outside their caste and this information was hidden from her. The couple's arranged marriage took place in 2018, as stated by the husband's representative.The wife left her marital home two days after learning that her sister-in-law had married into another community which she considered lower in the societal caste hierarchy. In 2020, the woman filed for divorce in Bhavnagar family court, claiming cruelty. She said her husband had concealed information about his sister's inter-caste marriage .While he did mention having two sisters, he failed to disclose a third sister who had married outside their caste.She met this third sister only during the wedding. Additionally, she said her husband filed a police complaint alleging threats to his life from her family and mailed it to her workplace.The husband filed a suit requesting restoration of conjugal rights, seeking court intervention to compel his wife to return.On September 30, 2024 the Bhavnagar family court dismissed his petition while granting the wife's divorce request. The husband contested this decision through two separate appeals and requested HC to quash the divorce order. After a preliminary hearing, Justices Biren Vaishnav and DM Desai stated that perusal of the judgment and decree under challenge would indicate that one of the primary grounds on which the application of the wife was entertained, claiming that the appellant husband had committed cruelty, is that one of the sisters of the appellant was married to someone from another community.Following the notice issued to the woman, the high court has scheduled a joint hearing of both appeals on January 20.","The couple's arranged marriage took place in 2018, as stated by the husband's representative.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a fresh FIR against Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, son of former finance minister P Chidambaram. The case revolves around allegations that Karti helped Diageo Scotland, a UK-based alcoholic beverage company, circumvent a ban on duty-free sale of its Johnnie Walker whisky in India.Vasan Health Care, Diageo Scotland and Sequoia Capital too have been named as accused in the fresh case.A preliminary enquiry in the case was initiated in 2018, which probed the processing and approval of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearances.The new FIR alleges corruption in lifting the ban imposed on Diageo Scotland for sale of duty-free liquor in India in 2008 besides FIPB clearance to Sequoia Capital. It alleges that Karti received bribes through Vasan Health Care to grant FIPB clearance to Sequoia Capital.According to CBI, Diageo Scotland had been importing duty-free Johnnie Walker whisky into India until April 2005, when India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) imposed an embargo on the sale of Diageo's duty-free products. This move resulted in significant losses for Diageo Scotland, as 70% of its Indian business relied on Johnnie Walker whisky sales.CBI alleges that Diageo Scotland approached Karti to get the embargo lifted and made suspicious payment of $15,000 to Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd (ASCPL), a company purportedly controlled by Karti and his aide S Bhaskararaman. The payment was disguised as a ""consultancy fee"".ASCPL has been under the scanner in the INX Media case and another case involving alleged illegal gratification for granting Indian visas to Chinese workers.In 2018, Karti was arrested by CBI in the INX Media case, and his father P Chidambaram was later arrested by both CBI and ED.","CBI has registered a fresh FIR against Congress MP Karti Chidambaram.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has expressed his strong support for Indian batting superstar Virat Kohli , stating that if he was captain he would ""fight with the team management"" to ensure Kohli remains in the squad despite his recent struggles in Test cricket.Clarke made these remarks on the Beyond23 Cricket podcast, where he discussed Kohli's form during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and his overall importance to the Indian team.Clarke acknowledged that Kohli hadn't scored as many runs as he would have liked in his recent Test matches but emphasized the batter's immense talent and impact. ""It's Virat Kohli! This guy can make a double hundred tomorrow. He's that good a player. This guy could play, he should play until he's had enough. If he retires from Test cricket right now, there's only one team losing out, it's India,"" Clarke remarked.Kohli scored a century in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but struggled to make significant contributions in the subsequent matches. Despite this, Clarke stressed that he would back Kohli without hesitation. ""If I was captain of any team that Virat Kohli was in, even though I know he didn't make as many runs as he would have liked, I'm fighting for him to stay in my team,"" Clarke said.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 The Indian batter's repeated dismissals outside off-stump during the series drew criticism from fans, with many recalling how Sachin Tendulkar famously avoided the cover drives during his iconic double hundred at the SCG. However, Clarke pointed out the fundamental differences between the two players.""Sachin was a different player to Virat Kohli. A lot of people during this Australian summer were saying Sachin did it in a Test match. He got out cover driving a couple of times and then let it go to make a 200 at the SCG. Sachin is a different player to Virat. Virat's greatest strength is bat on ball. He just plays it in a different way,"" Clarke explained.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Schedule Clarke's remarks highlight his belief in Kohli's enduring abilities and value to the Indian Test side, reinforcing the idea that Kohli's presence on the field is a significant asset despite a lean patch in form.","Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has expressed his strong support for Indian batting superstar Virat Kohli.

NEW DELHI: Four individuals charged with the murder of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar have been released from custody, according to documents filed by Canada’s department of justice on Thursday.The accused—Karan Brar, Karan Singh, Amandeep Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karanpreet Singh—were charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with Nijjar’s killing on June 18, 2023.Court documents show the status of the accused as “not in custody,” marked with an ""N."" The news of their release comes days after former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation.The incident took place in the parking lot of a Gurdwara in British Columbia's Surrey, where Nijjar, who led the Khalistan Tiger Force , was fatally shot in what has been described as a ""contract killing.""A video of the incident, which reportedly surfaced in March 2024, showed armed men attacking Nijjar as he exited the Gurdwara.Nijjar’s killing has been at the center of strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada. Trudeau had alleged a possible involvement of Indian government agents in the murder, a claim India has consistently denied, calling it “absurd” and “motivated.”India has accused Canada of harbouring extremist and anti-India elements, including supporters of the Khalistan movement.Earlier, the ministry of external affairs stated that Canada had not provided any specific evidence or formal communication regarding the case, despite the arrests of Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder.The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) in British Columbia, which is handling the case, has accused the individuals of murder and conspiracy. However, Canadian authorities have not presented any evidence linking the accused to India, despite speculation in Canadian media.","Four individuals charged with the murder of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar have been released from custody.

Poll What’s More Important in Diplomacy? Pursuing Neutrality Maintaining Alliances

NEW DELHI: While the Indian government has invited Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to participate in the Republic Day celebrations as the chief guest, and an official announcement about his visit is expected any moment now, it would not like him to club his visit to India with a proposed visit by the president to Pakistan.Official sources have maintained for the past several weeks that Subianto will be the chief guest for the January 26 parade, but no official announcement has been made so far about the visit. Normally, the same announcement is made months in advance.Amid this delay in announcement, reports emerged in Pakistan media earlier this week that the president is likely to arrive in Islamabad on January 26 for a 3-day visit. India has encouraged foreign leaders in the recent past to not include Pakistan in their itinerary while travelling to India, and to dehyphenate their ties with the 2 countries.It is learnt that India has raised the issue diplomatically with Indonesia, hoping to dissuade Subianto from flying directly to Islamabad after the R-Day celebrations. The president hopping on a direct flight to Islamabad hours after the Indian military parade will be bad optics for India, given its troubled relationship with Pakistan over a range of issues, not least cross-border terrorism. Subianto had met the Pakistan PM, Shehbaz Sharif, in Egypt on the margins of a multilateral event in December and pledged to enhance economic cooperation between the two countries.With their common focus on political sovereignty, economic self- sufficiency and independent foreign policy, India and Indonesia have traditionally enjoyed strong ties. Indonesia has also emerged as India’s largest trading partner in the Asean region. During the state visit of then Indonesian President Joko Widodo in 2016, the two countries agreed to establish a Security Dialogue in order to develop a comprehensive action plan on security cooperation.Widodo was in India again in 2018 as one of the chief guests for the Republic Day parade, along with the leaders of 9 other Asean member-states. He too had travelled to Pakistan soon after his visit to India. This is the third time India has the invited an Indonesian president for Republic Day, the first being the inaugural event in 1950.",India has invited Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to participate in the Republic Day celebrations.

NEW DELHI: The government has extended invitations to officials from countries that were part of undivided India at the time to mark 150 years of the India Meteorological Department , established in 1875. This includes officials from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bhutan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.Representatives from the Middle East and Southwest Asia have also been invited to join the celebrations.Pakistan has confirmed its participation, while the IMD awaits confirmation from Bangladesh.A senior IMD official said, “We wanted officials from all countries that were part of undivided India during IMD’s establishment to be part of the celebrations.”The celebrations will include a variety of events such as marathons, exhibitions, workshops, and olympiads. To commemorate the occasion, the finance ministry has also approved a special Rs 150 commemorative coin.Adding to the festivities, the IMD will showcase its first-ever tableau during the Republic Day parade, highlighting its legacy and contributions to meteorology.Born out of necessity during the British era after the devastating Calcutta cyclone of 1864 and multiple monsoon failures, the IMD began as modest weather forecasting entity. Over 150 years, it has grown into a global leader in meteorological research , weather communication, and forecasting.In its early years, the IMD used telegrams to send weather warnings. Over time, it embraced cutting-edge technology, pioneering the use of electronic computers for meteorological research and introducing India's first message-switching computer for global data exchange.India also made history as the first developing country to launch its geostationary satellite, INSAT, enabling round-the-clock weather monitoring and cyclone alerts.","Officials from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bhutan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Nepal have been invited to join the celebrations.

It is about strengthening India and eliminating hatred,” he told reporters in Jammu.“Those who believe this alliance was only for parliamentary elections should come out of this misconception,” Farooq added. It was not clear if he was referring to Omar’s remarks or to Tejashwi Yadav’s comments.Farooq also rejected criticism against Omar that he was acting as a “Centre’s man”, and stressed that as the CM, the latter had to cooperate with the Union govt for J&K’s welfare.

Congress vs regional parties: Can INDIA bloc survive internal contradictions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-vs-regional-parties-can-india-bloc-survive-internal-contradictions/articleshow/117093169.cms,"NEW DELHI: Has INDIA bloc become a burden for the opposition parties? The anti-BJP alliance which was launched with much fanfare and anticipation in the run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections seems to be gasping for breath. Every assembly election since the formation of the INDIA bloc has brought to fore the internal contradictions within the alliance - with several allies at the national level being rivals in the states.The Congress , which leads the alliance at present, has increasingly faced resistance from some of the regional parties, especially after its dismal electoral performance in Haryana and Maharashtra.The latest round of tussle within the coalition in Delhi has taken an ugly turn with the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP engaging in an open war of words, accusing and targeting each other - much to the discomfort of other alliance partners.On Thursday, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah expressed dismay over the lack of clarity regarding the leadership and agenda of the INDIA bloc and said the alliance should be wound up if it was meant only for parliamentary elections.""After the assembly elections in Delhi, they should call all the alliance members for a meeting. If this alliance was only for the parliamentary elections, it should be wound up, and we will work separately. But if it is meant for assembly elections as well, we will have to sit together and work collectively,"" Abdullah said.His remarks come amid assertions by the Congress and RJD, another key partner of the alliance in Bihar, that INDIA bloc was formed only for coordination during the Lok Sabha elections.Congress leader Pawan Khera on Thursday reiterated that INDIA bloc was formed exclusively for Lok Sabha elections and asserted that the party is gaining significant momentum ahead of the Delhi assembly elections ""The INDIA bloc was formed for the Lok Sabha elections at the national level. Based on the situation in different states, whether it is the Congress or regional parties, they decide independently, whether to fight together or separately,"" Khera said.According to reports, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had recently told reporters that there was nothing unusual about the Congress and AAP fighting separately in Delhi, where they had come together ""only for the Lok Sabha polls"".His remarks assume significance as assembly elections are due in Bihar towards the end of this year and the RJD and the Congress are in alliance in the state. The relationship between the two parties was strained recently when RJD supremo Lalu Prasad backed Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee's claim for leadership of the INDIA bloc and made light of any objections that Congress could have over this.The two parties have already started posturing over seat sharing with some Congress leaders citing the party's strike rate in Lok Sabha elections to seek parity in seat sharing in the assembly elections. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the RJD had contested 26 seats and won 4 while the Congress fought on 9 seats and won 3.In West Bengal, the Congress and the Trinamool Congress could never work together as Mamata Banerjee refused to agree to the seat-sharing demands of the grand-old-party.In Kerala, the Congress and the Left parties as rivals engage in bitter politics even as they remain together at the national level and even in West Bengal.However, it's not just the regional parties that have snubbed the Congress. In Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, where the Congress was the dominant political player, the party refused to accommodate the demands of INDIA bloc allies leading to a bitter parting of ways in assembly elections.The Congress, which has ceded its political space to regional parties in several states since 2014, is now desperately trying to reclaim the lost ground. That explains the acrimony that surfaces within the INDIA bloc before every assembly elections. Clearly, the stakeholders need to decide if they want to disband the INDIA bloc till the next Lok Sabha elections.",The anti-BJP alliance which was launched with much fanfare and anticipation in the run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections seems to be gasping for breath.

ECI orders Delhi's chief electoral officer to set inquiry over AAP's allegation

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday met Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and doubled down on serious allegations of electoral malpractice in the New Delhi Assembly constituency , accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of orchestrating a ""big scam"" to manipulate voters and influence the upcoming Delhi elections.The Election Commission has asked the Chief Electoral Officer of Delhi to inquire about the complaints made by AAP and file an action-taken report.Kejriwal represents the New Delhi constituency. He will be up against BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress's Sandeep Dikshit in the assembly elections that will be held on February 5.Reacting to the allegations, Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said Kejriwal was aware that he would lose the upcoming polls. ""A student who feels he is about to fail the exam goes and complains to those above him. He [Kejriwal] knows the exam will be tough and what is coming. He has stopped talking about Delhi and is focussing on only his own constituency of New Delhi.""Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal claimed that thousands of fake applications for vote cancellations and additions had been filed in the constituency in recent weeks and pointed the finger at BJP candidate from the seat Parvesh Verma.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal along with CM Atishi and other top AAP leaders, met the Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and discussed ""concerns"" regarding alleged irregularities in the polls.""In the New Delhi Assembly constituency, from December 15 to January 7, in 22 days, 5,500 applications have come for cancellation of votes. These applications are fake,"" Kejriwal alleged.He said that when officials investigated the matter and contacted the individuals whose votes were reportedly being cancelled, they found that these applications had been filed without their knowledge.""A big scam is going on,"" he added.Kejriwal further accused BJP candidate Parvesh Verma of organising job camps and openly distributing cash to influence voters.""Where did all these people come from in just 15 days? These people are coming from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to get fake votes registered. Thirdly, we pointed out that Parvesh Verma in the New Delhi seat is openly distributing money, and health camps are being held with glasses being distributed. He announced on January 15 that job fairs will be held. All of this falls under corrupt practices according to the Election Commission's rules. Parvesh Verma should be barred from contesting the election,"" he said.The AAP convenor called for stringent action against Verma, demanding that he be barred from contesting the elections and that his residence be raided.""The Election Commission of India must ensure that such practices are stopped immediately. The local election officer of the New Delhi Assembly constituency has surrendered to the BJP and is facilitating all the wrong works of the BJP. The local DEO and ERO should be suspended,"" Kejriwal urged.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann also weighed in on the controversy, expressing faith in the ECI. ""We trust that the ECI will take strict action against the officers of the New Delhi Assembly constituency and also on the deletion and addition of votes. ECI is our last hope. It is the responsibility of the ECI to save democracy,"" Mann said.The allegations have sparked a political storm, with AAP urging immediate intervention by the ECI to prevent further violations. Taking to X, AAP shared a letter addressed to chief election commissioner ""to highlight a large number of voter additions and deletions in the New Delhi assembly.""According to the post, Delhi CM Atishi has also demanded that ""verification of the authenticity of objectors should be carried out before the exercise of voter deletion is done.""The letter includes the data of applications submitted for voter deletions and additions.Later in the day, Kejriwal's remarks -- ""people are coming from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to get fake votes registered"" sparked controversy. Taking aim at Kejriwal, BJP leader Manoj Tiwari said that the AAP national convenor is disrespecting residents of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh living in the national capital.""Arvind Kejriwal and AAP have a history of disrespecting migrants from UP, Bihar, and Jharkhand. Intentions often reveal themselves naturally. I want to ask Arvind Kejriwal, how dare you call the people of Purvanchal, UP, and Bihar fake? You (Arvind Kejriwal) and (AAP) promises are fake,"" he said.BJP national president J P Nadda also criticised Kejriwal for allegedly disrespecting residents of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar by labelling them as fake voters. Nadda posted two video recordings of Kejriwal's statements on X, including an older clip and one from Thursday following an AAP team's visit to the Election Commission.""In fear of his defeat after looting Delhi for the past 10 years with his massive corruption and turning into a disaster for the city, Arvind Kejriwal in desperation has resorted to baseless comments against brothers and sisters of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,"" the BJP leader alleged.""People of Delhi will surely reply to him by throwing him out of power,"" he added.Following AAP's uproar over alleged electoral malpractice in the New Delhi Assembly constituency, the ECI asked chief electoral officer of Delhi to inquire about the complaint of AAP, ascertain the facts and take immediate appropriate action in accordance with the Model Code of Conduct.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday met Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar.

The revelation comes amid widespread outrage following the suicide of Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, which has reignited discussions around domestic violence against men.In the video, Challa recounted how her brother, an assistant professor at a Hyderabad engineering college, married a woman from Rajahmundry in 2019. However, the marriage lasted just 10 days.“She misbehaved with my parents, spoke foul language, and did not let my brother into his own bedroom. She often threatened suicide. This was clearly an extortion plan by my sister-in-law, her sister, her brother, and her boyfriend. Her sister had also executed a similar extortion plan with her in-laws. Ten days after she left our home, she filed a 498 case ( Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that deals with cruelty against a married woman by her husband or his relatives) against us. The FIR was filed without our knowledge or any investigation,” Challa alleged in the video.Even after five years, Challa revealed, the trial has yet to commence, leaving her family in a state of prolonged distress. “It has been 5 years since this incident, and the trial for this case has not yet begun. This has been traumatising. My parents’ health has declined,” she shared.Challa also spoke about how the case has impacted her career. Despite her stellar academic background—an alumna of IIM Ahmedabad and IIT Gandhinagar—and previous role as a Vice President at Goldman Sachs, she admitted to struggling professionally. “Despite my flawless academic records, I have been unable to find a job,” she said, pointing to the pending criminal case as a major obstacle.The video sparked an outpouring of reactions on social media, with many netizens criticising flaws in the arranged marriage system and sharing similar experiences.“Arranged marriage is injurious to mental health,” one user commented. Another wrote, “A friend of mine, day 1 of marriage, she didn't let him even touch her, no talks, nothing, living in separate rooms. Weeks passed, he found she is always on the phone with someone.

By tomorrow (Jan 10), it is expected to reach initialisation conditions,” Isro said Thursday.The space agency, however, did not confirm if it will attempt the docking on Friday or on a later date.Earlier in the day, Union minister Jitendra Singh , Minister of State for Space, met with senior Isro officials — including chairman S Somanath and chairman-designate V Narayanan — to discuss the space agency's ambitious upcoming missions for early 2025.Isro has outlined an aggressive launch schedule for the first half of 2025, including two GSLV missions, a commercial LVM3 launch, and the crucial first uncrewed test of the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme.Leading the calendar is the GSLV-F15 mission, scheduled for late Jan. This mission will deploy the NVS-02 navigation satellite, enhancing India’s NavIC constellation. The satellite features indigenously developed atomic clocks and new L1 band signal capabilities, with launch vehicle integration currently in advanced stages at Sriharikota.“A major highlight is the upcoming Isro-Nasa collaboration Nisar (Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture RADAR) mission, to be launched aboard GSLV-F16.

Same-sex marriage: LGBTQs still have option to file curative plea

NEW DELHI: For the second time in two years, Supreme Court has junked pleas for legalising same-sex marriages, with a five-judge bench on Thursday unanimously rejecting a bunch of petitions by LGBTQ+ community members seeking review of the court's October 2023 judgment that had emphatically dismissed PILs seeking the relief.The petitioners had sought a review of SC's order on October 17, 2023, where a bench of then CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices S K Kaul, S R Bhat, Hima Kohli and P S Narasimha unanimously rejected pleas to legalise same-sex marriages, and by a three to two majority, refused to confer adoption rights on queer couples.On Thursday, a bench led by Justice B R Gavai and comprising Justices Surya Kant, B V Nagarathna, P S Narasimha and Dipankar Datta unanimously ruled that the review petitions were ""devoid of merit"" and rejected the pleas for open-court hearing on the contentious social issue, which now stands more or less settled - same-sex marriage will remain illegal unless a law is enacted to make it legit.The bench also held that the majority opinion of Justices Bhat and Kohli, with which Justice Narasimha had concurred, in the 2023 judgment required no interference as the review petitions failed to point out any error in the judgment.This means the majority view of three judges in the Oct 2023 judgment now stands ratified by a five-judge bench through a well-considered order.We have carefully gone through the judgments delivered by Justice Bhat (former judge), speaking for himself and for Justice Kohli (former judge) as well as the concurring opinion expressed by one of us, Justice Narasimha, constituting majority view. We do not find any error apparent on the face of the record. We further find the view expressed in both judgments is in accordance with law and, as such, no interference is warranted. Accordingly, the review petitions are dismissed,” the bench said.However, LGBTQ community members still have an option in the form of curative petition which, like review petitions, and if filed, would be taken up by a five-judge bench in chambers without the assistance of lawyers.In the Oct 2023 verdict, Justices Chandrachud and Kaul had favoured social rights for queer couples while the other three had said it was for Parliament to decide the nature of social rights that could be conferred on couples in same-sex relationships. Several petitions seeking review of the 2023 judgement were filed, leading CJI Chandrachud to constitute a five-judge bench to hear these petitions in chambers.However, after the retirement of CJI Chandrachud and Justices Kaul, Bhat and Kohli, CJI Sanjiv Khanna constituted a new bench to take up the review petitions and consider whether these required to be entertained and whether these should be posted for hearing in open court.The 2023 judgment, despite asserting that queerness was neither urban nor elite, had unanimously ruled that the right to marry was not a fundamental right and the legislature had the power to regulate it in accordance with societal conditions.Unequivocally stating that the legislature alone could effect changes in marriage laws and other consequential legislations to allow same-sex couples the right to legally tie the knot, SC had said it was not for the court to read down or insert words into Section 4 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, to erase the statutorily essential man-woman component of a valid marriage.Differing with Justices Chandrachud and Kaul on adoption rights to queer couples, Justices Bhat, Kohli and Narasimha had said how queer couples could achieve legal status for their relationships was an issue to be addressed by the legislature.“The modalities of how it should play out, what it will entail etc are facets that the state — here the legislature and the executive — needs to exercise its power in furtherance of. Now, whether this will happen through proactive action of the state itself, or as a result of sustained public mobilisation, is a reality that will play out on India’s democratic stage, and something only time can tell,” the majority opinion had said.Justice Chandrachud had decided to take up the petitions seeking review of the Oct 2023 judgment on July 10 last year by a bench led by him and comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Hima Kohli, B V Nagarathna and P S Narasimha. However, Justice Khanna had recused from the case warranting the constitution of a new bench.","For the second time in two years, Supreme Court has junked pleas for legalising same-sex marriages.

Convict released after 25 years in jail; he was 14 at time of crime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/convict-released-after-25-years-in-jail-he-was-14-at-time-of-crime/articleshow/117064666.cms,"Supreme Court.

Injustice inflicted by courts at every stage: SC

NEW DELHI: Admitting that ""injustice has been inflicted"" by all courts, including itself, in rejecting the juvenility plea of a death convict who had to spent 25 years in jail, Supreme Court on Wednesday directed his release from prison forthwith by holding that he was just 14 years old at the time of committing the crime, a fact which was not accepted earlier by it in four rounds of litigations, manifesting that even SC is not infallible.In this case, the accused was convicted and awarded the death sentence in 2001 in a murder case. He had raised the defence of juvenility by claiming to be just 14 year old and also placed bank account details, but his plea was rejected by the lower court. But his defence of juvenility was also not accepted by high court and Supreme Court.High court and Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence despite placing before them fresh evidence of school certificate for his age proof. SC not only rejected his appeal but also his review and curative petitions.Staring at death, the convict was left with no option and he filed a mercy petition with Uttrakhand governor, which was rejected. He thereafter sought mercy from the President, who commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment in 2012 with a condition that he shall not be released until the attainment of 60 years of age.The convict’s mother, with the help of a social worker, thereafter started a fresh round of litigation by challenging the presidential order in high court, which dismissed her plea and she approached Supreme Court, which examined the evidence relating to his age afresh and confessed the mistake done by the courts. During the pendency of the mercy plea, an ossification test was also done by a medical board constituted by Meerut jail on a request made by the convict and it also indicated that he was aged around 14 years at the time of the occurrence.Noting all the judicial proceedings from trial court to SC in its order, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and Aravind Kumar said, “The facts as narrated above speak for themselves. At every stage, injustice has been inflicted by the courts, either by ignoring the documents or by casting a furtive glance. The appellant, despite being illiterate, raised this plea one way or another, right from the trial court up to the conclusion of the curative petition before this court... The approach of courts in the earlier round of litigation cannot be sustained in the eye of law,” the bench said.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Sundresh said that in case of a juvenile, the court is expected to play the role of parens patriae by treating a child not as a delinquent, but as a victim, viewed through the lens of reformation, rehabilitation and reintegration into the society.“Thus, a juvenile court is a species of a parent. A delinquent who appears before the court is to be protected and re-educated, rather than be judged and punished. It is for this purpose that the court will have to press into service the benevolent provisions for rehabilitation introduced by the legislature. A juvenile court assumes the role of an institution rendering psychological services. It must forget that it is acting as a court, and must don the robes of a correction home for a deviant child,” the bench said.“We would only state that this is a case where the appellant has been suffering due to the error committed by the courts. We have been informed that his conduct in prison is normal, with no adverse report. He lost an opportunity to reintegrate into society. The time which he has lost, for no fault of his, can never be restored,” the court said, directing Uttarakhand State Legal Services Authority to play a proactive role in facilitating his rehabilitation and smooth reintegration into the society upon his release.Emphasising that it is the primary duty of a court to make a single-minded endeavour to unearth the truth hidden beneath the facts, the bench said “the court is a search engine of truth, with procedural and substantive laws as its tools. When procedural law stands in the way of the truth, the court must find a way to circumvent it. Similarly, when substantive law, as it appears, does not facilitate the emergence of the truth, it is the paramount duty of the court to interpret the law in light of its teleos. Such an exercise is warranted in a higher degree, particularly while considering social welfare legislation.”",Supreme Court on Wednesday directed his release from prison forthwith by holding that he was just 14 years old at the time of committing the crime.

Time now for legislature & executive to take a call: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday expressed its reservation about directing governments to implement its Aug 2024 landmark ruling to bar those belonging to creamy layer within SC and ST categories from taking quota benefits, and also to sub-classify SC/STs to extend the benefit of reservation to the more needy among the two categories. The court said it was for legislature and executive to take a call, reportsAmit Anand Choudhary.But govts have been reluctant to act on the prickly issue, with dominant sections among Dalits opposing the sub-categorisation ruling. Aggrieved by this, an MP resident moved SC, seeking direction to the state to implement the order in recruitments done by it.Advocate Siddharth Gupta, appearing for the petitioner, told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih that all govt departments/PSUs must be directed to stop reservation benefits being extended to the creamy layer within SCs/STs.The SC bench, however, said it had passed the order but it was now for legislature and executive to take a decision. “We have given our view that taking into consideration the experience of the past 75 years, such persons who have already availed benefits and are in a position to compete with others, should be excluded from reservation. But it is a call to be taken by executive and legislature,” the bench said. Indicating the court’s limitation, the bench said that the attorney general had a day earlier argued that the court should not interfere in policy decisions.As the petitioner pleaded that govt would not frame policy as family members of policymakers would also be deprived of reservation due to the creamy lawyer criterion, the bench said, “Legislators are there and legislators can enact a law.”Gavai, who was part of the seven-judge bench — and its lone Dalit judge — that passed the landmark order last Aug that permitted sub-categorisation of castes within the SC community, had asked states to devise a framework to identify and exclude creamy layer among SCs/STs from availing reservation benefits. He had said that a mechanism especially suited for SCs/STs was needed, as the OBC creamy layer principle could not be applied to them. “ The state must evolve a policy for identifying the creamy layer even from SCs and STs so as exclude them from the benefit of affirmative action. Only this and this alone can achieve the real equality enshrined under the Constitution,” he had said. The then CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Vikram Nath, Pankaj Mithal, Manoj Misra and S C Sharma concurred with Gavai.“If a person from such a category, by bagging the benefit of reservation, achieved a position of a peon or maybe a sweeper, he would continue to belong to a socially, economically and educationally backward class. At the same time, people from this category, who after having availed the benefits of reservation, have reached high echelons in life cannot be considered to be socially, economically and educationally backward so as to continue availing the benefit of affirmative action. They have already reached a stage where on their own accord they should walk out of the special provisions and give way to the deserving and needy,” Gavai had said.","The court said it was for legislature and executive to take a call. dominant sections among Dalits opposing the sub-categorisation ruling.

Poll Will Genome Sequencing Data Impact Healthcare in India? No, It Will Take Time to Make a Difference Yes, It Offers Great Potential

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals and said it will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research .The Genome India Data , which represents the genetic diversity in the country, will be available to researchers at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC) through managed access. ""I am confident this will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research,"" Modi said in a video-recorded statement played out at the Genomics Data Conclave organised by the Department of Biotechnology.Modi said this national database will facilitate advancements in the treatment of genetic and infectious diseases, foster the development of new medications and precision medical techniques, and enable research into the lifestyles and habits of diverse communities.A genome is the complete set of DNA sequences in an organism and contains all the instructions required for that organism to function, including embryogenesis, growth, responding to the environment, and healing from disease. The primary aim of Genome India is to construct a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variations for India's population that will better capture our unique diversity. Launched in January 2020, its goal is to sequence 10,000 genomes from healthy Indian individuals spanning the length and breadth of the country.The Human Genome - the complete map of all 23 large DNA sequences (chromosomes) that encodes our species - comprises a total of around three billion base pairs contained within the nuclei of each of our cells.According to Martin Carkett and Alexander Honkala, experts in the field, while this sequence of base pairs is virtually identical in every human, differentiating us from, say, a chimpanzee or a mouse, there are nonetheless subtle differences in each of our individual genomes that make us unique. Whole-genome sequencing enables us to read a person's individual genome and, among other things, identify differences from the average human genome that are often associated with disorders and disease but can also be associated with other factors like disease resistance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals.

The ill-planned opening of the gate led to a sudden surge of devotees, who had been waiting for over 12 hours by then, towards the gate, leading to the stampede.Officials clarified on Thursday that the stampede was not a result of the opening of the gate to issue tokens before the scheduled hour.

GUWAHATI: Around 25,000 Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam may face deportation following a ruling by Gauhati high court Thursday. The case pertains to immigrants who arrived between 1966 and 1971 but failed to register with Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) after being declared foreigners by tribunals.The court's decision stems from an appeal of one Begum Zan, who sought an extension for registering with FRRO. She was declared a foreigner by the Barpeta foreigners' tribunal on June 29, 2020, but she failed to meet the registration deadline. The court rejected her plea, citing the binding nature of a recent Supreme Court ruling.The case brings to the forefront a long-standing issue in Assam, where the 1955 Citizenship Act's Section 6A, introduced in 1985, specifically addresses the status of immigrants from Bangladesh. Section 6A(2) grants citizenship to those who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, while Section 6A(3) covers those who entered between Jan 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971. The latter group is required to register with FRRO within 30 days of being declared foreigners, with a possible extension to 60 days. Those who fail to do so face the risk of deportation, while those who register are granted rights similar to citizenship, excluding electoral participation for ten years. After this period, they become full citizens.About 5,000 people who missed the registration deadline, along with their family members, bring the total number facing deportation to Bangladesh to nearly 25,000. The high court judges said they could not grant an extension in Zan's case, emphasising they were ""bound by the decision of the Supreme Court"". The decision referred to a ruling made in Oct 2024 by a five-member constitution bench, which upheld the legality of Section 6A of Citizenship Act.The majority of judges in the SC bench held that immigrants in this group (1966 to 1971), who did not register within the prescribed timeframe, would lose eligibility for citizenship. Justice JB Pardiwala dissented, arguing that those immigrants should be allowed to register even after the deadline.Zan's counsel AS Tapadar argued that the minority opinion from Justice Pardiwala should prevail. ""Time should be allowed for the petitioner to register with FRRO,"" Tapadar urged.","Around 25,000 Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam may face deportation.

""Whatever content is necessary for this case would be provided to you in terms of SC's guidelines in Gopalakrishnan case,"" the court told Prajwal's counsel.

KOLKATA: A trial court is set to deliver the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital rape-murder verdict on January 18, more than five months after a 31-year-old junior doctor was violated and brutally killed in the state government-run institute, setting off a wave of protests in Kolkata, ripples of which were felt around the country. CBI , which is investigating the matter, demanded death for Sanjay Roy , the primary accused, in its closing arguments on Thursday at the Sealdah sessions court, citing multiple reports: biological samples, CCTV footage analysis, testimonies of 50 witnesses - which, it said, proved he was the sole perpetrator of the 'monstrous crime'. The Central agency's lawyers also said that the rape-murder was a 'rarest of rare' crime, fit for capital punishment.Roy has been implicated under 103(1), 64, and 66 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deal with murder, rape and for causing death or leaving the victim in a persistent vegetative state. If convicted, Roy will either be sentenced to death or face a life behind bars.Defence lawyer Sourav Bandyopadhyay, chief of the Legal Aid Defence Council Service, South 24 Parganas, said in his final submission that his client was innocent, and that he was being framed by evidence planted against him.","A trial court is set to deliver the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital rape- murder verdict on January 18.

Can't stop organ donation without proof of 'sale': Kerala HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-stop-organ-donation-without-proof-of-sale-kerala-hc/articleshow/117097283.cms,"Representative image

KOCHI: In a significant judgment, Kerala HC Thursday ruled that permission for organ donation cannot be denied unless there is cogent evidence establishing a commercial element. A donor's assertion that donation is made out of altruism should be accepted in absence of credible evidence to the contrary, HC said.Justice C S Dias gave the ruling on a plea by a 20-year-old renal failure patient and his voluntary donor, challenging decision of an authorisation committee denying permission for kidney transplant .Initially, the application was rejected by health officials citing absence of a certificate of altruism from the district police chief. Despite an HC directive to consider the application without insisting on the police certificate, both authorisation committee and principal secretary of health dept rejected it again. The committee denied the application once more despite producing the said certificate, prompting the petitioners to move HC again.While hearing the petition, the bench referenced a prior decision, wherein it was observed that voluntary donation of an organ represents self-deprivation of the highest order, and it is inhuman to presume that such a sacrifice is made solely for monetary considerations. HC directed the authorisation committee to grant permission for the transplant within a week.","Kerala HC ruled that permission for organ donation cannot be denied unless there is cogent evidence establishing a commercial element.

As India approaches its centenary of Independence in 2047, our youth stand at the forefront of our mission to build a Viksit Bharat. Guided by the Prime Minister's clarion call to engage one lakh youth in politics with no political background, we have reimagined the National Youth Festival into something extraordinary - 'The Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2025 '. This dialogue is not just an event, it's a movement, a vibrant celebration of youth empowerment, leadership, and actionable ideas that align with India's vision for 'Viksit Bharat'.For over two decades, the National Youth Festival has been a symbol of cultural exchange and youthful energy. This year, however, we dared to think differently. On Nov 18, 2024, we announced a ground-breaking transformation of the festival, placing leadership, innovation and nation-building at its core.Central to this reimagining is the Viksit Bharat Challenge , a three-stage competition designed to identify and nurture India's brightest minds. The challenge is rooted in merit, inclusivity and transparency, ensuring every young Indian, regardless of geography or background, has an equal opportunity to contribute.The first stage, the Viksit Bharat Quiz, saw participation from around three million youths across the nation. Conducted in 12 languages, it tested their knowledge of India's progress over the past decades.The second stage, the Viksit Bharat Essay Competition, encouraged participants to delve deeper into pressing issues. Over two lakh essays were submitted, exploring 10 thematic areas, such as leveraging technology for development, embracing sustainability, preserving cultural heritage, and making India a global sporting powerhouse.The final stage, the Viksit Bharat Vision Deck Competition, brought top participants to state-level championships. Here, young leaders presented innovative ideas to panels of domain experts and leadership moderators. This stage emphasised grassroots perspectives and regional diversity, showcasing the ability of young Indians to think globally while acting locally.The journey through these stages has been marked by inspiring stories of resilience & determination. From the hills of the north-east to the villages of Rajasthan and Gujarat to the coastal towns of Tamil Nadu, we witnessed young leaders overcoming societal barriers, logistical challenges and personal hardships to present their visions for Viksit Bharat.On Jan 10, the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue will begin at Bharat Mandapam, bringing together 3,000 participants. The event comprises 1,500 participants from the Viksit Bharat challenge track, representing the top 500 teams from state championships, 1,000 participants from the traditional track, showcasing India's cultural diversity through performances selected from state-level youth festivals and 500 Pathbreakers, trailblazers chosen for their ground-breaking contributions across thematic tracks.Participants will engage in cultural and thematic presentations, competitions and excursions to iconic sites like the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya and the National War Memorial. An exclusive dinner with various Union ministers and MPs will provide a rare platform for informal dialogue.On Jan 11, a grand inaugural session featuring national icons, thought leaders and innovators will take place. This discussion will set the stage for deliberations across 10 critical tracks, led by mentors and domain experts. The evening will see conferring of National Youth Awards and 'Colours of Viksit Bharat' cultural show.The final day, Jan 12, celebrated as National Youth Day to honour the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, will be a defining moment for every participant. The top 10 ideas from thematic tracks will be presented to PM Narendra Modi, providing an inspiring platform for innovative minds to shine.This interaction emphasises India's commitment to involving youth in governance and decision-making. Following this, participants will also have the opportunity to interact with the PM and other eminent leaders, over lunch, fostering meaningful conversations and leaving them with lasting memories.The day will also feature a grand plenary session led by the PM. This session will reinforce the transformative potential of India's youth in shaping a developed India.","Mansukh Mandaviya is minister of youth affairs & sports and labour & employment.

'We are proud of it': Two Himachal brothers marry same woman in tribal polyandry tradition; video viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-proud-of-it-two-himachal-brothers-marry-same-woman-in-tribal-polyandry-tradition-videos-go-viral/articleshow/122792576.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a rare yet culturally rooted event, two brothers from Himachal Pradesh’s Hatti tribe have married the same woman, reviving an age-old tradition of polyandry.The ceremony took place in Shillai village of Sirmaur district’s Trans-Giri area, with hundreds attending the three-day celebration that began on July 12.The bride, Sunita Chauhan from Kunhat village, married Pradeep and Kapil Negi in accordance with the tribal custom known as ""Jodidara"", which is recognised under Himachal Pradesh’s revenue laws.“I made this decision without any pressure. I respect the bond we have formed,” Sunita told PTI. Pradeep, who works in a government department, and Kapil, employed abroad, said the marriage was a joint, transparent decision. “We followed the tradition publicly as we are proud of it,” Pradeep told PTI. Meanwhile, Kapil said, “We’re ensuring support, stability and love for our wife as a united family.”Videos from the wedding, which featured local folk music and dance, have gone viral on social media, drawing attention to the once-prevalent tradition.The Hatti tribe, a close-knit community living along the Himachal-Uttarakhand border, was granted Scheduled Tribe status three years ago.Polyandry, though rare now, is still practised in parts of the region including Trans-Giri, Jaunsar Babar in Uttarakhand, and Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh.According to village elders, such marriages continue discreetly and are accepted socially, though fewer in number due to growing literacy among women and economic development.Kundan Singh Shastri, general secretary of Kendriya Hatti Samiti, explained the tradition’s roots to PTI. “Polyandry helped prevent the division of ancestral land, encouraged brotherhood, and ensured a feeling of security in tribal life. It was also practical for managing scattered farmlands in the hills,” he said.In the Hatti tradition known as ""Jajda"", the bride arrives in a procession to the groom’s home where rituals including ""Seenj"" are performed. A local priest chants mantras, sprinkles holy water, and offers jaggery to the couple, blessing them with sweetness in their married life from the family deity.(with inputs from news agency PTI)","Two brothers from Himachal Pradesh’s Hatti tribe have married the same woman, reviving an age-old tradition of polyandry.

Five men linked to killing of murder convict Chandan Mishra in a Patna private hospital on July 17 were arrested in a guest house in Kolkata’s Anandapur late Saturday by a joint team of Bihar SIT and Bengal STF. A white sedan used to flee Patna was also seized.Four of them were seen on CCTV entering and exiting Room 209 on Paras HMRI Hospital’s second floor, where gangster Mishra, 36, from Bihar’s Buxar was shot multiple times. He was on parole for liver surgery. Their capture came more than 12 hours after five others were detained at a housing complex in Kolkata’s New Town for allegedly aiding the gang’s movement.All 10 are being questioned. Bihar Police identified the alleged gang leader as Tauseef Badshah and alerted Bengal counterparts with details of the fleeing vehicle seen on Durgapur Expressway. Tauseef reportedly made a phone call upon reaching New Town Friday, seeking shelter in Sukhobrishti but was turned away. He contacted a broker for accommodation, but was again denied.The group then moved to Anandapur. Traffic CCTV picked up their vehicle, prompting a raid. “All five had changed SIMs, but we tracked their new numbers using IMEI data,” said a policeman.

A Yamunanagar court has sentenced a man to seven years of rigorous imprisonment for sexually assaulting and intimidating a minor Hindu girl to coerce her into a relationship with a Muslim juvenile, terming the case one of “love jihad”. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the convict and said such acts were “a potential threat” to the nation’s sovereignty and integrity.While acknowledging that ‘love jihad’ is not a legal term under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita or the Pocso Act , the court described it as a “purported campaign by Muslim men to convert non-Muslim women to Islam by pretending to be in love.”In Nov last year, a 14-yearold girl filed a complaint at City Yamunanagar police station, naming Shahbaj and a juvenile. She alleged the boy had stalked her on her way to school while Shahbaj pressured her to befriend him.The FIR invoked sections 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of BNS, and sections 17 (abetment), 8 (sexual assault) and 12 (sexual harassment of a child) under Pocso. The defence counsel, SS Nehra, argued that the accused was falsely implicated.However, additional sessions judge Ranjana Aggarwal, in her July 17 order, said Shahbaj systematically tried to force an interfaith relationship through “allurement and inducement.” The court awarded him four years under Pocso Section 8, two years under Section 12, and one year under BNS Section 351(2), with fines totalling Rs 1 lakh.

NEW DELHI: India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah remains a doubtful starter for the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, scheduled to begin on July 23 in Manchester. With India trailing 1-2 in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series, Bumrah’s availability is seen as crucial—especially in light of the pre-series plan that he would feature in only three of the five matches.Having already played the first and third Tests at Leeds and Lord’s, the Indian team management now faces the decision of whether to field him in the fourth or save him for the series finale.Veteran Indian cricketer Ajinkya Rahane has suggested that left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh should step in if Bumrah is rested.""If Bumrah is not playing, Arshdeep is the guy. Because in England, you need a left-arm seamer who can swing the ball both ways, and also, with a different angle, he can create that rough for the spinners. So, if Bumrah doesn't play, Arshdeep should play the next one,"" Rahane said on his YouTube channel.Rahane also weighed in on the team’s spin options, specifically Kuldeep Yadav.""Depending on the condition of the wicket, I feel Kuldeep should play. If the wicket is similar to the last three Test matches, Kuldeep should play because you need guys who can get you those wickets. Our batting unit is doing really well. Even if you score 25-30 runs less, that's okay.But you need people who can get you those wickets. You don't want to depend on your leading fast bowlers every time.""Arshdeep, who has picked up 99 wickets in 63 T20Is, is still awaiting his Test debut. However, his participation in Manchester has been thrown into doubt due to an injury suffered during a practice session.The pacer sustained a cut when he was hit by a ball while training, prompting medical attention.""He took a ball while he was bowling there. So he hit a ball, and he tried to stop it and it's just a cut. So we have to see how bad the cut is. Obviously, the medical team have taken him off to see a doctor and obviously, if he needs stitches or does he not, that will be important to our planning for the next few days.""With just two matches left in the series, India must win both to clinch a comeback series victory.",Jasprit Bumrah remains a doubtful starter for the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford.

Why are Edlow and Vaughan calling OPT illegal? Here’s the real story,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/why-are-edlow-and-vaughan-calling-opt-illegal-heres-the-real-story/articleshow/122779825.cms,"OPT faces mounting legal and political attacks, putting the future of 200,000 international graduates at risk.

Edlow and Vaughan ’s case against OPT: Congress didn't sign it, so let's burn it

What really lies beneath Edlow and Vaughan’s constitutional and legal arguments?

Come, pay, tuition and leave

In the quietly panicked corridors of international education policy, a storm is gathering around the United States’ Optional Practical Training (OPT) program—and for once, it’s not hyperbole to say that the damage may already be done. The numbers are stark, the policy narrative even starker. According to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) SEVIS 2024 report, over 194,554 international students received work authorisation under OPT last year. Of these, a staggering 95,384 secured extensions under the STEM OPT provision. And standing at the centre of this tectonic shift are Indian students, who account for nearly 98,000 of those OPT authorisations during the 2023–24 cycle, as confirmed by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.But now, the very scaffolding of this bridge—from academic promise to professional foothold—is under coordinated assault by voices both influential and ideological. Leading the charge are Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), and Joseph Edlow, the newly confirmed Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Both have testified before Congress in 2025 that OPT is not only legally suspect but structurally dangerous.The rhetoric may be wrapped in legalese, but the intent is clear: Dismantle the post-study work rights that have long made U.S. degrees a prized aspiration for international—and particularly Indian—students. What’s at stake is more than immigration. It is the erasure of a pipeline that has quietly underwritten America’s dominance in global tech and innovation.At the core of the campaign to dismantle the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program lies a foundational dispute—not merely about visas or foreign labour, but about who gets to define the boundaries of lawful work in postsecondary America. And in this ideological contest, Jessica Vaughan and Joseph Edlow have emerged as the architects of what they frame as a long-overdue correction.Their argument is deceptively simple: OPT is not law—it is regulation. Worse, they claim, it is unregulated regulation, sustained not by statute but by administrative inertia and legal loopholes.In her detailed testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee in June 2025, Vaughan—Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)—delivered a withering critique of what she called “the largest unregulated guest worker scheme in the United States.” Drawing from internal data sets provided by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, Vaughan revealed that over 540,000 work authorisations were granted under OPT and CPT (Curricular Practical Training) in FY2023 alone.This, she argued, was not just administrative generosity—it was regulatory anarchy.In her words, OPT had ""spawned an industry of diploma mills, fake schools, bogus training programs, and illegal employment."" According to her testimony, the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)—the body meant to oversee the legitimacy of these academic affiliations—was too chronically under-resourced to vet the scale of demand. The result, she concluded, was a parallel ecosystem of academic storefronts and training programmes designed not for learning, but for visa preservation and labour substitution.But perhaps her sharpest critique was constitutional in tone. OPT, she reminded the Committee, is not authorised by the US Congress. It was created as an extension of executive rulemaking, first formalised under the Bush administration and later expanded under Obama. “There has never been a vote in Congress,” Vaughan noted, “to allow hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates to work on US soil under this program. ”Edlow, a former Trump-era official brought back to restore “legal fidelity” to immigration enforcement, seconded the legalistic rebuke. In multiple briefings before the Senate and in internal USCIS memoranda from April–June 2025, Edlow contended that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) makes no provision for post-completion work for F-1 visa holders. ""The INA is unambiguous,"" he said. ""Student visas are for study—not for work after graduation. ""He took particular aim at the 2023 D.C. Circuit Court ruling, which upheld the legality of OPT and its STEM extension. The decision, Edlow claimed, rested on an “erroneous reading of statutory intent”—one that unjustifiably enlarged the executive branch's power to define immigration eligibility criteria without congressional consent.In his congressional appearances and in internal DHS documents, Edlow has further proposed reorienting USCIS enforcement priorities. Specifically, he has called for an expanded role for the Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) directorate in vetting OPT applicants and employers—a move that signals a coming compliance-heavy era, where student employment records could be re-audited, revoked, or flagged for deportation if found wanting.Both Vaughan and Edlow converge on the same policy prescription, stated either in soft legalism or hard numbers: The OPT program must either be terminated outright or restricted so severely that it becomes operationally nonviable for most international graduates. In other words, OPT must be stripped of its current utility to ensure it cannot continue under the guise of administrative legitimacy.Behind Edlow and Vaughan’s polished legal rhetoric lies a deeper mission—one that has less to do with statutes and more to do with reshaping America’s relationship with global talent. Woven beneath the testimony is a broader, more ideological belief that international student mobility has been hijacked by corporate interests, and that foreign graduates are now indistinguishable from guest workers, hired to circumvent wage floors, sidestep payroll taxes, and bypass labour market tests that would otherwise favour American graduates.To this end, Vaughan and Edlow’s critique is not merely of OPT as policy, but of OPT as economic architecture—an invisible scaffold that supports tech giants, universities, and global talent mobility. For them, removing that scaffold is not disruption. It is restoration.What Edlow and Vaughan propose is more than a policy fix—it is a structural decoupling of education from employability, one that threatens to return the F-1 visa to a narrow, transactional instrument: come, pay tuition, and leave.It is this return to pre-globalisation thinking that most alarms educators and economists alike. And it is this version of “legal clarity” that could leave hundreds of thousands of students—including the 98,000 Indian graduates currently working under OPT—on the edge of a bureaucratic cliff, with no safety net beyond the 90-day unemployment cap.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

CHENNAI: Enforcement Directorate is not a “loitering munition or drone” that can strike at will, nor a “super cop” empowered to investigate every matter that comes to its notice, Madras HC has observed while quashing a Rs 901-crore fixed deposit freeze order issued by the agency.A division bench of Justices MS Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan ruled that ED’s powers under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) can only be invoked when there is a scheduled offence — termed a “predicate offence” — and the existence of proceeds of crime arising from it. “PMLA demands the existence of a predicate offence.When there is no predicate offence, initiation of proceedings under PMLA is anonstarter,” the bench said. It likened ED’s jurisdiction to a limpet mine requiring a ship to function. “The ship is the predicate offence and proceeds of crime,” it added.The ruling came in response to a plea by RKM Powergen Pvt Ltd, which challenged ED’s January 31 order freezing its fixed deposits. The company, represented by senior advocate B Kumar, said the freeze disregarded earlier court rulings and lacked fresh material. RKMP was allocated the Fatehpur East coal block in 2006.The Supreme Court cancelled the allocation in 2014.CBI initially registered an FIR but closed the case in 2017. Despite this, ED launched a PMLA probe in 2015 and froze RKMP’s accounts, which was struck down by Madras HC earlier. Rejecting ED’s stand, HC said actions under PMLA must follow legally prescribed route and termed the freeze order “legally untenable.”",Madras HC quashes a Rs 901-crore fixed deposit freeze order issued by the agency.

BJP's reaction

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s silence following fresh comments made by US President Donald Trump about mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.This time, Trump went a step ahead and claimed that ‘five jets were shot down’ in the conflict.Sharing a video of Trump’s remarks, Gandhi posted on X: “Modi ji, what is the truth about the 5 jets? The nation has a right to know!”Rahul’s post came as Trump, in what is now his 24th such claim, said at a private Republican dinner that he helped stop a war between India and Pakistan using trade threats. Trump claimed that “planes were being shot out of the air… five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down, actually.”Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram also criticised the government’s silence.“After President Trump’s latest statement, what does the government of India have to say? Silence is no answer,” he wrote on X.“I would like to believe the government of India, but if the government does not state the truth — does not say anything at all on the outcomes of the 5-day war — what do we believe?”, he added.Responding sharply to Rahul Gandhi’s post, BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya accused the Congress leader of echoing anti-India sentiments.In a post on X, Malviya wrote, “Rahul Gandhi’s mindset is that of a traitor.” He argued that Trump never explicitly mentioned India while speaking about the downing of five jets, and questioned why Gandhi assumed the aircraft belonged to India.“Why not assume they were Pakistan’s? Does he have more sympathy for Pakistan than for his own country?” Malviya asked.Taking a direct swipe, he added, “Whenever the country’s army teaches the enemy a lesson, Congress gets riled up. Anti-India sentiment is no longer just a habit for Congress; it’s become their identity.” Malviya ended his attack by questioning Gandhi’s allegiance: “Rahul Gandhi, tell us — are you Indian or Pakistan’s spokesperson?”The Congress party earlier said PM Modi’s silence was a compromise of India’s national honour.“Trump keeps repeating this, and PM Modi remains silent. Why is the nation’s honour being bartered for trade?” the party posted.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh also weighed in and said that the PM must make a statement in Parliament. “Just two days before the Monsoon Session of Parliament begins, the Trump missile gets fired for the 24th time,” he said, highlighting Trump’s repeated claims that a potential nuclear conflict was stopped due to US pressure linked to trade talks.Ramesh also referred to PM Modi’s past closeness with Trump, including events like ‘Howdy Modi’ in 2019 and ‘Namaste Trump’ in 2020. “The Prime Minister must respond himself in Parliament. No substitute batsman will do,” he added.Trump has claimed multiple times that he used trade pressure to stop escalating tensions following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.India responded with Operation Sindoor on May 7, striking nine terror camps. Pakistan retaliated with drones and missiles, which were intercepted by Indian air defences.India later targeted 11 Pakistani airbases in precision strikes.Though Trump insists his trade warnings helped prevent further escalation, India maintains that the ceasefire came after Pakistan’s director general of military operations reached out to his Indian counterpart.",Congress leader Rahul Gandhi questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence following fresh comments made by US President Donald Trump about mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

The post begins with “The ugly side of travel I had to come across as an Indian passport holder who loves travelling. It’s not in the guidebooks…It’s in the stares. The silence. The paperwork that makes you prove your humanity”.The creator recounted the emotional toll of having to justify short trips to embassies, often spending more time securing visas than planning the actual journey. “A border control officer, with a 3-second glance, can make me feel like a threat — before I’ve even said a word,” he noted.“Every time I hand over my passport, I also hand over the burden of assumptions,” he wrote, highlighting the constant questions and doubts that accompany travellers from developing countries like India.The account reflected on how rejections are often delivered without explanation, leaving behind feelings of humiliation and helplessness.“We dress a certain way. Speak softer. Carry more documents. Plan escape routes through countries that are ‘easier,’” he wrote, describing the silent strategies employed to navigate bias.Online reactions have poured in support for the user and praised his candid narrative, describing it as a long-overdue conversation. One user wrote, “This is such a needed post! Thank you for writing this.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has proposed doubling of penalty for traffic rule violation by people driving with children, a move that will ensure safety and responsibility. It has also proposed a ""merit and demerit (positive and negative) point system"" for all drivers based on their compliance with or violation of traffic rules.The changes have been proposed as part of amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, and these have been circulated among ministries for their feedback, TOI has learnt. Sources said the proposal of doubling penalty for traffic rule violation has been made considering rampant non-compliance of norms by parents and family members driving with children and by buses owned or hired by schools to transport students. The higher penalty is aimed at making both drivers and vehicle owners responsible.However, a section of road safety experts feel that any addition to the list of offences may end up only as a ""better"" legislative exercise and another avenue for corruption, if not implemented objectively.""Even now traffic cops catch and penalise drivers only for half a dozen offences such as speeding, drunk driving, jumping red signal, using phone and not wearing seatbelt or helmet, while the MV law covers over 100 offences.How will cameras installed identify if a juvenile is sitting in the rear seat of a car and will police personnel stop vehicles and check the age of people sitting inside? While framing laws and policies we don't think of India but Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and big cities,"" an expert said.As far as the proposal of ""merit and demerit"" points system for drivers is concerned, govt will set a threshold for demerit points and any driver accumulating negative marks beyond that will face the risk of suspension and cancellation of his/her driving licence. The ministry has also proposed to link insurance premium to behaviour of drivers, which will be reflected through positive and negative points.Sources said the proposed amendments include mandatory driving test for DL holders applying for renewal before expiry of licence, if they have violated traffic rules.","Road transport ministry has proposed doubling of penalty for traffic rule violation by people driving with children.

Days After Air India Mishap, 7 Dead In Kedarnath Helicopter Crash In Uttarakhand | Gaurikund

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has released its preliminary report on the helicopter crash that occurred near Gangnani in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand, on May 8, 2025. The accident involved a BELL 407 helicopter operated by Aerotrans Services Pvt Ltd.The crash resulted in the death of six people, including the pilot, and left one person seriously injured. Among the deceased were five women pilgrims who were on their way to the Gangotri temple.According to the AAIB report, the helicopter began descending from its assigned altitude about 20 minutes after takeoff. The pilot attempted an emergency landing on the Uttarkashi-Gangotri National Highway but was unsuccessful. During the landing attempt, the helicopter’s main rotor struck an overhead fiber cable running alongside the road, leading to the crash.The pilot, who was among those fatally injured, was 59 years old and had 6,160 hours of flying experience, the report stated.The AAIB also noted, ""The NTSB, USA & the TSB, Canada have appointed Accredited Representative & Technical Advisors for this investigation.

1st Parliament session after Operation Sindoor set to open on stormy note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1st-parliament-session-after-operation-sindoor-set-to-open-on-stormy-note/articleshow/122790029.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Demonstrating unity over the parliamentary agenda, opposition Saturday said its demand for discussion on Pahalgam terror attack-Operation Sindoor and “drift” in foreign policy is non-negotiable, and PM Narendra Modi should reply to the debate — an apparent red line that threatens a stormy monsoon session which gets under way Monday. The opposition has listed the controversial “special intensive review” of Bihar electoral rolls as another major issue for discussion.The opposition argued that US President Donald Trump has been speaking non-stop about having forced cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan by using trade as the bait, and only PM Modi, who has allegedly been silent on the issue, can reply to him.Just how much is govt willing to accommodate the opposition’s demand — subjects of discussion, duration of debate, PM’s reply — would decide the trajectory of the monsoon session. But the govt appears to have made up its line of defence for the opposition’s charge on Pahalgam-Sindoor. Official sources said the treasury will focus on how it has shown “zero tolerance” towards terrorism and its sponsors, and didn’t hesitate to target the terror hideouts deep inside Pakistan territory. They refuted allegation that PM has been silent on Trump’s mediation claim, pointing out that in a one-on-one telephonic chat the PM had rejected Trump’s assertion that he leaned on a reluctant India to suspend Operation Sindoor , pointing out that India decided to pause fire on May 10 after Pakistan conveyed its willigness to do so through military channels.Although the expected confrontation can potentially disturb govt’s plan to get eight bills passed, it has in the recent past been able to achieve its legislative agenda by working around protests.The INDIA bloc Saturday evening brainstormed on issues of “national concern” in a virtual meeting, that saw the participation of 24 parties and included Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, K C Venugopal, Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Dipankar Bhattacharya (CPI-ML), N K Premachandran (RSP), Abhishek Banerjee (TMC), Tejashwi Yadav (RJD), Ramgopal Yadav (SP), Omar Abdullah (NC), Hemant Soren (JMM) and Tiruchi Siva (DMK). Rahul is learnt to have pushed for a united fight in Parliament.Aam Aadmi Party which had decided to disengage itself from the opposition grouping, did not attend the meeting.Another contentious issue in the session would be the “attack on migrants across the country”. TMC’s Banerjee, CPI (ML)’s Bhattacharya, and other netas highlighted that migrants from Bengal and other regions were being attacked. They linked it to the voters’ review. The discussion on migrants and voters rolls in the meeting suggests opposition may be unrelenting on the SIR.BJP is sure to return fire by saying that the scrutiny of voters was consistent with the Constitution which lays down that only Indian citizens have the right to vote, and by accusing the oppoosition of trying to shield infiltrators from Bangladesh as part of their “votebank politics”.Amid the differences between the govt and the opposition, a rare bipartisanship will see the Lok Sabha bring a motion to impeach Justice Yashwant Varma for alleged corruption. But even here, a fresh faultline is the pendency of the impeachment notice submitted by the opposition against Justice Shekhar Yadav of Allahahad HC for “hate speech”. While the opposition is pushing for Yadav’s sacking, the govt is reluctant to entertain it.",The opposition has listed the controversial “special intensive review’ of Bihar electoral rolls as another major issue for discussion.

KOCHI: Bitra Island, one of the 10 inhabited isles in the Lakshadweep archipelago, is set to be taken over by government for defence purposes. There are 105 families on the island and many have opposed the move.The Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA). It stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its “strategic location” and “national security relevance”.Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Sayeed alleged that the move was aimed at disrupting peace in the area and would be opposed tooth and nail.Lakshadweep MP vows to fight for Bitra islandersIn a video message, Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Syeed asked Bitra natives not to worry or be anxious about the notification.“As your MP, we held a conference that included leaders from Bitra and Lakshadweep and discussed it in detail. We have decided to fight with the people of Bitra, politically and legally,” he said.Sayeed said the government had already acquired land required for defence purposes on several islands.Targeting Bitra, which has had an indigenous population for decades, without considering any alternative, is unacceptable. He also criticised the administration for not holding any consultation with the islanders.The notification said that a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was needed as per provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Trans- parency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Naming the department of revenue as the project developer, it said SIA activities included consultations with all stakeholders of the proposed area, including the gram sabha.“The SIA and Consent Society, UT of Lakshadweep, will complete the survey of the proposed area under acquisition within two months from the date of the notification,” it said, adding that consent of gram sabhas and/or landowners was not mandatory.","The Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA) The intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its ‘strategic location’ and ‘national security relevance’ There are 105 families on the island.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122772958,imgsize-2953706,width-400,resizemode-4/122772958.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A new development came in the Balashore self-immolation case, where the victim's friend on Friday claimed that the HoD threatened to fail her if she didn't fulfil his demands and accused the principal of provoking her to reach such an extent that she killed herself.The victim, a 20-year-old second-year B.Ed student at Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College, Balasore, died after setting herself ablaze on July 12 outside the college gate during a peaceful protest that had been ongoing since July 1, demanding action against the head of the education department.The B.Ed student's friend Koshish Das also said that the HoD has been doing this for six months with her.""All of this was going on with her for six months... On 30 June, she told us that the HoD had stooped to the extent of telling her, 'I will fail you. I will keep you in this class for six years. You will not be able to leave this college till I am here.' Her backlogs were deliberately not being cleared. She was extremely depressed... She told us that she wants support to go and talk to the principal about this.

She kept waiting outside the principal's chamber, since there was a large crowd for admissions. We waited there for two hours, but then we told her, 'Let's have our lunch, and afterwards we can talk to the principal.' But before we could come back, we were told that she had lit herself on fire. By the time we got back, the college had been sealed, and I couldn't even see what condition she was in. The principal or some authority must have provoked her...""Das also said that after the incident, the HoD had gathered many students to write an application against the victim and claimed that most of the fellow mates hate her because she was part of ABVP.The victim was used as a political tool for students, who wrote an application assassinating her character to principal, the friend said."" These students were in opposition to her (the victim), since she was in ABVP. She had become a political tool for these students, who wrote an application in which they assassinated her character, and submitted it to the principal.

Baghel’s son laundered Rs 16.7 crore through shell firms: ED to court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baghels-son-laundered-rs-16-7-crore-through-shell-firms-ed-to-court/articleshow/122790101.cms,"Ex-CM’s son arrested to bury the truth, crush people’s voice, says Priyanka

RAIPUR: ED informed a special court that former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel’s son Chaitanya Baghel laundered Rs 16.7 crore through shell firms and under-invoiced real estate deals tied to a Rs 2,100 crore liquor scam. Chaitanya was arrested under Prevention of Money Laundering Act on July 18 (his 38th birthday) following searches at his home.A PMLA court in Raipur granted five days’ remand. Congress functionaries responded to this with a call for statewide “Aarthik Nakabandi” on July 22. It has planned road blockades, protests, and mineral transport disruption across Chhattisgarh. The protest aligns with the final day of Chaitanya’s ED custody and his scheduled production before a PMLA court.According to ED’s remand report, Chaitanya played a “central and active role” in laundering illegal proceeds from a liquor syndicate that allegedly manipulated Chhattisgarh’s excise system from 2019 to 2022. One transaction flagged involved Rs 5 crore funnelled from Saheli Jewellers into a project, Vitthal Green, by Baghel Developers. While project costs were officially declared as Rs 7.14 crore, ED estimates actual expenditure between Rs 13 crore and Rs 15 crore — mostly in cash.Key witness Pappu Bansal told ED that only Rs 2.62 crore was recorded in payments to the contractor, while Rs 4.2 crore was allegedly paid off the books. On Oct 19, 2020, liquor businessman Trilok Singh Dhillon allegedly paid Rs 5 crore for 19 flats in the same project under employee names.CM Vishnu Deo Sai defended ED’s actions. “ED doesn’t act randomly. It knows what it’s doing,” he said Saturday. While ex-CM Baghel accused the Centre of vendetta politics. “They raided me during Budget session. Now, after Mahant’s adjournment notice on Hasdeo forest felling, they’ve targeted my son,” he said. “I won’t break. Let them jail him — he’s strong.”Baghel alleged a “selective pattern” of enforcement: “Nothing happens to Himanta Biswa Sarma, or Suvendu Adhikari, or Ajit Pawar. Those who bow walk free.”Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday claimed that as former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel was about to raise the issue of govt “gifting” all the state’s forests to industrialist Adani in the assembly, govt arrested his son to pressure him to bury the truth. The public has understood that these tactics under BJP are aimed at crushing the voice of people but it will not succeed, she said.“The forests are being destroyed in defiance of PESA Act and NGT directives. Baghel was going to raise the issue in the assembly. To stop him, ED raided his house early in the morning and arrested his son. In past 11 years, the country has understood well that these are methods to suppress opposition. But every Congress worker stands firmly with Baghel,” Priyanka said.","Chaitanya Baghel laundered Rs 16.7 crore through shell firms and under-invoiced real estate deals tied to a Rs 2,100 crore liquor scam.

VIJAYAWADA: YSRCP MP P V Midhun Reddy was arrested by Andhra SIT late on Saturday after nearly seven hours of questioning in the alleged Rs 3,200 crore liquor scam. The arrest comes after the anticipatory bail petitions of Mithun Reddy were rejected by AP high court and Supreme Court, reports Madhu Rasala.He is the second politician to be arrested in the alleged scam that took place during the previous YSRCP rule. With the latest arrest, the number of accused arrested so far has increased to 12.Earlier, Midhun Reddy arrived in Vijayawada from New Delhi amid heightened security. Krishna district police, under the supervision of Gannavaram DSP, ensured a tight security cordon around the airport. All vehicles entering the premises were thoroughly inspected, and the MP was escorted by police to the SIT office. Police had earlier issued a lookout notice and alerted immigration authorities.The SIT, constituted to investigate alleged irregularities in the liquor policy during the previous YSRCP regime, has been probing alleged illegal financial transactions, policy manipulation, and the misuse of official machinery in the framing and implementation of the state's liquor policy.Sources close to the probe said Reddy was allegedly involved in key decision-making meetings regarding the state's liquor procurement and distribution mechanisms. The SIT has reportedly tracked a Rs 5 crore fund transfer from a third-party company to a firm linked to the MP, raising suspicions of money laundering and quid pro quo arrangements.Officials believe Midhun Reddy possesses crucial information about the ultimate beneficiaries of the proceeds generated through the liquor policy.","YSRCP MP P V Midhun Reddy was arrested by Andhra SIT late on Saturday after nearly seven hours of questioning in the alleged Rs 3,200 crore liquor scam.

Srinagar: Urdu has become the latest political hot potato in Jammu and Kashmir. After the row over mandatory knowledge of the language for naib tehsildar recruitments, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) legislator Waheed Parra on Saturday accused Omar Abdullah-led National Conference govt of digitising the land records in English, instead of Urdu.Parra claimed the NC govt, with chief minister Omar holding the revenue portfolio, has ordered “another round of land record digitisation” across J&K. “This time, the process is being carried out exclusively in English, with Urdu, a language that has been integral to our revenue records for generations, completely removed,” he said.Earlier, long before the 2024 govt formation, the J&K administration had allegedly given “a multi-crore land digitisation contract” to one company, Parra said. “The company scanned every single land document across districts, but digitised only Srinagar and Jammu in three years. The rest were rushed by overburdened revenue staff for months,” he alleged.The PDP MLA also questioned the CM’s silence on the issue.Govt has not come up with any response on the issue so far. “We will check it,” a govt spokesperson said, when asked.Last month, a controversy erupted after J&K Services Selection Board issued a notification for naib tehsildar posts in the revenue department, making knowledge of Urdu, one of the five official languages of J&K, a mandatory requirement.BJP strongly protested the decision and termed it discriminatory.Earlier this month, the Central Administrative Tribunal’s Jammu bench stayed the mandatory Urdu clause in an interim order on a petition.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti led the charge against the order, calling it “deeply unfortunate”. In a post on X, she said: “Urdu, a recognised official language for decades, is now being unfairly communalised. Our revenue records and administrative work continue to be maintained in Urdu, and it is only logical that applicants for the post of naib tehsildar possess basic proficiency in the language. This requirement is rooted purely in administrative efficiency, not in any form of divisiveness. ”","PDP legislator Waheed Parra accused Omar Abdullah-led National Conference govt of digitising the land records in English, instead of Urdu.

If the Constitution is weakened, you (the BJP) will be finished.

India warns West on energy security double standards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-warns-west-on-energy-security-double-standards/articleshow/122674405.cms,"Petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri

NEW DELHI: India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday in what is seen as the first official reaction to the US and EU threat of secondary sanctions for buying those barrels.“India has diversified the sources (of oil). I am not worried at all. If something happens, we will deal with it. There is sufficient supply available,” Puri said at an industry event.Separately, the foreign ministry said govt’s overriding priority was to secure the energy needs of its people, while also cautioning against any double standards on the issue.The comments, in response to media queries, followed NATO chief Mark Rutte’s threat, echoing the US, that countries like India, China and Brazil would take a battering for buying Russian exports.“Let me reiterate, and I have said this in the past as well. Securing energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“In this endeavour, we are guided by what is there on offer in the markets, as also by the prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter,” he added. India has in the past too accused the West of having double standards on the issue, saying that European countries have themselves benefited from importing Russian energy for prolonged periods.Puri said India has built up “navigational resilience” by expanding the sourcing of oil from 40 countries against 27 countries earlier. “India has been clear that it will buy oil from wherever it has to. The prime minister’s commitment, in the final analysis, is to the Indian consumer,” he said.In addition, Puri said, more oil was coming into the global market from countries such as Brazil, Guyana and Canada that are not members of the OPEC+ grouping. “If a major source goes off the market, you diversify. The current debate in the oil market is whether prices will be in the range of $65-70 or $60-65 (per barrel),” he said.","India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said.

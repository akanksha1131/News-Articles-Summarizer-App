NEW DELHI: NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday made a significant revelation about the future of the Nationalist Congress Party, saying that talks to merge the two rival NCP factions were already under way and had progressed to an advanced stage before the sudden death of his nephew and party chief Ajit Pawar Speaking at a press conference, Sharad Pawar said the proposed merger was not only under discussion but was also in line with Ajit Pawar’s own wishes.“Now we feel his wish should be fulfilled. Ajit Pawar, Shashikant Shinde and Jayant Patil had initiated the talks about the merger of the two factions. Even the merger date had been fixed — it was scheduled on the 12th (February). Unfortunately, Ajit left us before that,” Sharad Pawar said.This disclosure comes amid intense political activity in Maharashtra following Ajit Pawar’s death and reports that his wife, Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Pawar, is likely to be sworn in as deputy chief minister.Sharad Pawar, however, maintained that he had no prior information about her possible elevation, underlining that key decisions were being taken by leaders in Mumbai and not in consultation with him.When asked whether he, as a senior member of the Pawar family, was taken into confidence regarding Sunetra Pawar’s possible appointment as deputy chief minister, Sharad Pawar sought to downplay any suggestion of discord.“Family stands united if an issue occurs in the family. There are no issues in the family,” he said.Sharad Pawar made it clear that discussions on political and organisational decisions were taking place away from him.Responding to questions on the apparent haste in decision-making after Ajit Pawar’s death, he said, “All these discussions are not taking place here; they are happening in Mumbai. Praful Patel, Sunil Tatkare and other senior leaders are having these discussions. Whatever is being seen appears to be decisions taken by them. I will not comment on this.”","Sunetra Pawar likely to be sworn in as Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister, replacing her late husband and NCP chief Ajit Pawar in the state cabinet.

Malaysian diaspora gears up for tryst with PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malaysian-diaspora-gears-up-for-tryst-with-pm-modi/articleshow/127813769.cms,"PM Modi

KUALA LUMPUR: The stage is set for PM Narendra Modi to once again showcase India’s soft power on the global stage. This time round it’s Malaysia, on Feb 7, as thousands of Indian diaspora members will be waiting to see and hear Modi.Adding to the excitement is the murmur of Malaysia’s prime minister Anwar Ibrahim joining Modi at the event. For Anwar, the Thaipusam festival which is largely an occasion to assert Indians’ cultural and political identity, Modi’s visit, and address to the Indian diaspora, could all blend together to provide some sort of firm ground in changing electoral scenarios.Further, with Chinese New Year celebrations also round the corner, and the Dragon Dance as one of the elements of the cultural extravaganza, the opportunity for affirming India’s image as the unifier in the Global South is huge.Around 15,000 Indians, including ‘Malay Indians’ as PM Modi had referred to them in his last community address in 2015, and expatriates, will gather at MINES International Exhibition & Convention Centre (MIECC) in Kuala Lumpur to listen to Modi. More than 60 Indian community organizations and NGOs in Malaysia have come together to form the `Selamatdatangmodiji’ event.Talking to TOI, Nabhesh Khanna, director of MI Cultural Events, which is supervising the event, said, “The event has been conceptualised in such a way that it will highlight the unity and diversity of Indians and Malaysians; reminding that our bonds transcend boundaries and are rooted in everyday culture, lives.”Malaysia Hindu Dharma Maamandram, a Hindu NGO with 40 branches across Malaysia, has reached out to various temples in the country for participating in the grand event. Rishi Kumar Vadivelu, head of the NGO said, “Modiji has brought our culture, tradition, our roots, in the international arena. He has been promoting Thiruvalluvar, the great philosopher.”Pradip Batra, head of OFBJP in Malaysia, said, “The excitement is huge. Senior BJP functionaries have already reached here for preparations and everyone is working to make this event a grand success.”","Around 15,000 Indians, including ‘Malay Indians’ as PM Modi had referred to them in his last community address in 2015, will gather at MINES International Exhibition & Convention Centre (MIECC) in Kuala Lumpur.

Traders and distributors who do not manufacture food will not be covered under this requirement.The draft also seeks to enforce stricter storage practices. Food businesses will have to follow “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) and “first-expire, first-out” (FEFO) principles, ensuring that older or near-expiry food is used or sold first. This is intended to reduce the risk of expired or unsafe food reaching consumers. Retail shops, however, have been kept out of this provision.FSSAI has invited public feedback for 30 days before finalising the rules.Officials say the move is part of a wider effort to strengthen food safety as India’s food market expands, and to give consumers greater confidence in the quality of food they buy.","Proposed changes aim to improve hygiene, accountability and consumer safety.

Owaisi Slams MCD Demolition, Says Turkman Gate Land Fully Belongs To Waqf

New Delhi: Supreme Court has said offering of prayers by Muslims at premises not included on the list of auqaf cannot give it the character of a mosque and ruled unless the mosque stood over waqf land, waqf tribunal could not entertain a suit to declare the place a mosque.The ground floor of an apartment on prime land in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was claimed to be a mosque since 2008 but the owner of the land and the builder of the apartments stopped access to it in 2021.One Mohammed Ahmed filed a suit before the waqf tribunal seeking to restrain Habib Alladin and others from causing hindrance to those visiting the Mahmood Habib Masjid and Islamic Centre. The owner of the plot moved Telangana HC, claiming the building plan made no mention of the area in dispute as a mosque and, hence, the tribunal could not have entertained the suit. The HC had rejected the plea.After analysing judgments on the issue, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran said, “A reading of Section 6 and 7 (of Waqf Act, 1995) makes it clear that the jurisdiction, to determine whether or not a property is a waqf property, or whether a waqf is a Shia waqf or a Sunni waqf, inheres in the tribunal only if the particular property is specified as waqf property in the ‘list of auqaf’.”The bench said, “A bare reading of the plaint would indicate that neither is the property specified in the ‘list of auqaf’ as published in Chapter II nor registered under Chapter V and hence the decision as to whether the property is a waqf property or not cannot be decided by the tribunal since the property is not one specified in the ‘list of auqaf’, which is the mandatory requirement... to approach the tribunal.”SC said, “We will not consider the issue as to whether the property can be deemed to be a ‘waqf by user’ since the question is still at large.” It set aside the tribunal order assuming jurisdiction and the HC order affirming it.","The ground floor of an apartment on prime land in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was claimed to be a mosque since 2008.

The penguin walked away quietly. But what was it trying to say?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-penguin-walked-away-quietly-but-what-was-it-trying-to-say/articleshow/127803414.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. The internet loves noise, but this time it fell in love with silence. A short video went viral: a lone penguin walking away from its colony, not toward the sea, not toward its companions, but straight toward the frozen mountains of Antarctica. No drama. Just a steady, deliberate walk into white nothingness. Memes followed, as they always do. Even the White House posted one where the American President escorts the penguin to Greenland. Social media crowned it the nihilist penguin . Laughter spread, but beneath it lay recognition. This penguin wasn’t protesting. It wasn’t rebelling. It wasn’t asking to be saved. It was simply walking away. And that quiet exit felt deeply familiar, especially to Gen Z—a generation tired of performing happiness, exhausted by constant comparison, crushed by the pressure to prove that life is “working out”. Somewhere inside, many whispered the same thought the penguin seemed to carry: Enough is enough. What many forgot — or never knew — was that this was not a new moment. The footage came from a 2007 documentary by Werner Herzog , titled ‘Encounters at the end of the world’. At the time, the scene passed quietly, almost uneasily, without commentary or conclusion. It was neither analysed nor celebrated. The internet was not yet ready for it. Two decades later, in an age of burnout and quiet quitting, the clip resurfaced and suddenly felt uncannily current, as though the penguin had been walking all this time to meet us here. From a Western philosophical lens, the label came easily: nihilism. The word itself comes from nihil , Latin for nothing. Nihilism argues that life has no inherent meaning, no objective values, and no moral truths beyond human invention. It emerged in modern Western thought, especially in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, who saw it as a dangerous vacuum left by the collapse of religion and tradition. For Nietzsche, nihilism was a crisis, not a destination. Closely allied is existentialism, articulated by thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir. Existentialism claims that humans are not born with purpose; we exist first and define ourselves later through choice. Meaning is not given; it is made. Everyone saw the solitary walk of the penguin to be in synchronisation with western philosophical ideas that inherently indicated purposelessness. But here is where the Eastern lens gently interrupts the Western conclusion. Indian philosophy talks about renunciation. At first glance, nihilism and renunciation seem similar. But nihilism often carries a bleak tone, disillusionment after belief collapses. Renunciation, or vairāgya , begins not in emptiness but in insight. The world is not denied; it is understood as transient. Suffering does not arise from existence itself, but from clinging. The renunciate does not walk away in despair, but in clarity. There is freedom here, not apathy; compassion, not cynicism. Thiruvalluvar captures this radical lightness with stunning economy. In Kural 345, from the chapter on renunciation, he writes: Matrum thodarpaadu evankol pirapparukkal Utraarkku udambum migai. “For those who have renounced, even the body itself is a burden; what more could they desire?” This is where the penguin begins to look different. Perhaps it is not rejecting life. Maybe it is stepping out of the noise. Perhaps it is not a nihilist at all, but an accidental symbol of letting go.","The classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

ETFs crashes 14%

'2008-crisis levels'

What now

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and silver futures saw a sharp decline on Friday as traders locked in profits following Thursday's record-breaking rally. Both Gold and silver futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange ended Friday’s session with steep losses, retreating sharply as traders booked profits following a powerful rally earlier in the week that had driven both metals to new all-time highs. Bearish global markets and a stronger US dollar also influenced the sentiment. It was one of the steepest single-day fall for both gold and silver prices in the past few months in futures trade. Gold and silver exchange traded funds or ETFS have also dropped up to 20% n the domestic markets.Gold futures expiring on February 5, 2026, slid by as much as Rs 11,000, or 6.5%, to settle at Rs 1,59,984 per 10 grams. Silver contracts for March 5, 2026, delivery saw an even steeper decline, plunging Rs 68,000, or 16.6%, to Rs 3,34,503 per kg - going below the Rs 3.5 lakh per kg mark.The dramatic shift came after both metals had achieved historic highs the previous day. Silver had peaked at Rs 4,20,048 per kg before settling lower, while gold had touched Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The pullback was particularly noticeable in international markets, with Comex gold falling 2.2% to USD 5,236.74 per ounce.""After hitting record highs, gold and silver prices dropped as a rebound in the US dollar triggered aggressive profit-taking,"" said Manav Modi from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, as quoted by PTI.The dollar index bounced back from recent lows of 96, while the USD/INR pair hit a record high.The World Gold Council has raised concerns about India's future gold imports. They expect a decline in jewelry demand from the world's second-largest consumer due to record-high prices. The council also noted that central bank purchases slowed in Q4 2025, though strong investor interest helped offset this decrease.Despite the current dip, gold is still headed for its best monthly performance since the 1980s. Silver, too, remains impressive with a potential January gain exceeding 50%, its strongest monthly showing ever. Market expert Jigar Trivedi attributed this to ""a weak US dollar and shifting US monetary policy outlook.""Looking ahead, traders are turning their attention to upcoming US Producer Price Index numbers, which will offer new insights into monetary policy direction. The recent price movements highlight the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions on precious metals markets.Gold and silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also plunged by up to 14 per cent on Friday as investors rushed to book profits after precious metals retreated sharply from record highs, prompting debate over whether the correction offers a buying opportunity or signals the end of the powerful rally.The fall followed a surge in January, when silver jumped 56 per cent, putting it on course for its strongest monthly performance on record, while gold logged its biggest monthly gain since January 1980, rising more than 20 per cent in dollar terms.Silver-focused ETFs led the losses. Zerodha Silver ETF and SBI Silver ETF fell 14 per cent, while Nippon India Silver ETF dropped 14 per cent and Kotak Silver ETF declined 12 per cent. Gold ETFs also slipped, with Nippon India Gold ETF down 10 per cent and ICICI Prudential Gold ETF losing 6 per cent. ICICI Prudential Silver ETF fell 7 per cent.The domestic selloff tracked global markets, where spot silver slid 5.7 per cent to $109.55 an ounce after touching a record $121.64 a day earlier. Spot gold fell 3.9 per cent to $5,183.21 per ounce, after dropping as much as 5 per cent from Thursday’s peak of $5,594.82.The sharp reversal came after US President Donald Trump said he would soon announce his pick to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with reports pointing to former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a likely candidate.“So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar, and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,” said KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer, as quoted by ET.Expectations of a more hawkish Fed unsettled investors who had been betting on looser monetary policy. “Gold and silver show very high volatility, and prices dip from record high levels amid heavy profit-taking; safe-haven buying could support prices,” said Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart.Jain noted that both metals had ended the previous session higher in global and domestic futures markets before surging to fresh records in early trade, only to face intense profit-taking at elevated levels.Despite the selloff, the broader trend remains strong. Silver is set for its ninth consecutive monthly gain, while gold is heading for a sixth straight monthly advance. “Silver fell about 4% toward $110/oz, retreating from all-time highs as investors locked in profits following the record rally, while, rebound in the dollar added pressure on the metal,” said Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at Indusind Securities. “Despite the pullback, silver is on track to gain more than 50% in January, marking its best monthly performance on record and extending a winning streak to nine consecutive months,"" he added.The rally has been supported by persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainty, strong safe-haven demand, and a weaker dollar. Trivedi added that “silver’s surge was further supported by a tight physical market, with both investment and industrial demand hitting record levels.”An industry commentary on the global capital markets platform The Kobeissi Letter made a remark that vent viral on how gold's volatality has reached ""2008-crisis levels"".""This is absolutely insane: Gold just posted its largest daily swing in market cap in history, at $5.5 TRILLION. Between 9:30 AM ET and 10:25 AM ET, gold lost -$3.2 trillion in market cap, or -$58 billion PER MINUTE. Then, between 10:25 AM ET and 4:00 PM ET, gold added back +$2.3 trillion. That's over 3 TIMES the market cap of Bitcoin swung in 6.5 hours, or ~$850 billion per hour,"" it said on X.Further commenting on its significance, it added, ""We are witnessing one of the most historic trading opportunities of all time. Gold's volatility is above 2008 levels.""Outlooks for both gold and silver for the year point to strong long-term support but elevated volatility. Major banks such as UBS, Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale remain bullish on gold, citing safe-haven demand, geopolitical tensions and portfolio diversification, according to ET. Silver forecasts are more divided. Some, such as Citigroup, see significant upside driven by structural demand and supply deficits, while stretigists Marko Kolanovic warn that prices could correct sharply if speculative positions unwind.However, across both metals, analysts agree that price swings will remain a defining feature, shaped by macro uncertainty, monetary policy, liquidity conditions and shifting investor positioning.",Both Gold and silver futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange ended Friday’s session with steep losses. Bearish global markets and a stronger US dollar also influenced the sentiment.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup, admitting that the moment for such a move has passed. While ruling out a full withdrawal, the former wicketkeeper-batsman floated a different form of protest, suggesting Pakistan could take part in the tournament but decline to play fixtures against India. He stressed, however, that any such call would have to come from the Pakistani government rather than the cricket board.“If the government says we won’t play against India, the ICC will have to accept it,” Latif said. “If they don’t, that’s where the real confrontation begins.” Asked what would happen if India and Pakistan met in the final, Latif replied, “nahi khelenge’ (we won’t play)”.Latif, who had earlier urged Pakistan to boycott the World Cup to challenge what he described as India’s influence over global cricket administration, said on Wednesday that the opportunity slipped away when the Pakistan Cricket Board did not act immediately after Bangladesh were excluded from the event.“The time for a strike has passed,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehind. “Every decision has a timing.

Magh Mela row: Seer ups the ante; asks CM Yogi to prove he is 'Hindu sympathiser',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/swami-avimukteshwaranand-saraswati-magh-mela-row-seer-ups-the-ante-asks-cm-yogi-to-prove-he-is-hindu-sympathiser/articleshow/127802581.cms,"Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati and UP CM Yogi Adityanath (Images/Agencies)

Maha Kumbh Stampede Compensation, Sambhal Violence Bail, Magh Mela Footfall And More

NEW DELHI: Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati on Friday asked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stop beef exports from the state and declare the cow as ‘Rajya Mata’. He stated that such steps would prove the chief minister’s commitment as a “Hindu sympathiser”.The remarks come amid an ongoing controversy after the seer was allegedly prevented from taking a holy dip at the Sangam during the Magh Mela in Prayagraj earlier this month.Speaking to reporters in Varanasi, Swami Avimukteshwaranand said that he had staged a sit-in protest for 11 days after the incident but left the Magh Mela ground last Wednesday “with a heavy heart”.“When I sat there for 11 days, no official asked me to take a dip. Now it is too late. I will go to the Magh Mela next year and take a respectful bath,” he said.Challenging the UP government, the seer said that stopping cow slaughter and beef exports should be the first step in demonstrating commitment to Hindu values.“Our credentials were asked for, and we submitted them. Now you have to give proof of being a Hindu sympathiser. The first step of being a Hindu is love for cows. Declare the cow as ‘Rashtra Mata’ and stop the export of cow meat from Uttar Pradesh,” he said.The controversy dates back to January 18, when Swami Avimukteshwaranand was travelling in a palanquin to the Sangam on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya.A dispute broke out after police and administrative officials asked him to dismount and proceed on foot, citing heavy crowds. The Mela administration later alleged that his supporters broke a barricade on a pontoon bridge, creating difficulties in crowd management.Following the incident, the seer began a sit-in protest outside the Shankaracharya camp, demanding an apology and a dignified escort for the ritual bath. He later announced that he would not take a dip until the administration apologised for misbehaviour towards him and his followers.Amid the row, the Mela administration issued a notice seeking an explanation on his use of the title of Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth, citing a civil appeal pending before the Supreme Court. The seer hit back, questioning how camps of two Shankaracharyas from Puri were allowed at the same mela.The issue has since triggered political and administrative reactions. Prashant Kumar Singh, a deputy commissioner in the Uttar Pradesh GST department posted in Ayodhya, resigned from service citing moral reasons and said that he was hurt by baseless allegations against the chief minister and the prime minister by the seer.Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri also resigned, citing concerns over the alleged insult to Swami Avimukteshwaranand and broader social issues.The Congress has announced an awareness campaign against the insult of the Shankaracharya. Party leaders have accused the state administration of insensitivity and demanded that the governor take suo motu cognisance of the matter and initiate action.",Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati asked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stop beef exports from the state.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the right to menstrual hygiene is an integral part of the right to life and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools to ensure dignity, health and equality for girls and women.The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Pronouncing its judgment on a plea seeking free sanitary pads and adequate sanitation facilities for schoolgirls, the apex court directed all states and Union Territories to provide biodegradable sanitary napkins free of cost to girl students in all schools.“Before parting with the issue, we want to say that this pronouncement is not just for stakeholders of the legal system. It is also meant for classrooms where girls hesitate to ask for help. It is for teachers who want to help but are not able to due to the lack of resources. Progress is measured by how we protect the vulnerable”, Justice Pardiwala observed before parting with the judgment.It also ordered authorities to ensure separate toilets for female and male students, along with disability-friendly toilets, in every school.The apex body made it clear that the compliance would be mandatory for both government and private institutions. It warned that private schools could face derecognition if they fail to provide separate toilets for girls and boys or do not ensure access to free sanitary pads for students.The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion, but a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to live with dignity and bodily autonomy.The top court further directed that it will hold government accountable if they fail to provide toilets and free sanitary pads to girls.It observed that lack of basic facilities and stigma around menstruation directly affects girls’ health, education and privacy.The judgment follows proceedings initiated in November last year, when the court took cognisance of a disturbing incident at Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana, where three women sanitation workers were allegedly forced to send photographs of their sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating. The incident had triggered nationwide outrage over “period-shaming”.At that stage, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan had expressed concern over such practices in educational institutions and workplaces, observing that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset.The court had issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which highlighted multiple instances of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks.In its petition, the SCBA argued that such practices were “in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21”.It also stressed that women workers, particularly in the unorganised sector, are entitled to decent working conditions that respect biological differences and protect them from humiliating treatment during menstruation.During the earlier hearing, the court had observed that if a woman was unable to perform heavy work due to menstruation-related pain, alternative arrangements should be made instead of subjecting her to degrading scrutiny.“If someone is saying that because of this reason heavy work could not be done, it could have been accepted and some other persons could have been deployed,” the bench had said, expressing hope that meaningful guidelines would emerge from the case.The Haryana government had informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated into the university incident and that action had been taken against two persons responsible.","The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools.

NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sought to reassure the public over India’s latest Nipah virus outbreak, saying the risk of spread remains “low” and that there is no need for travel or trade restrictions following the confirmation of two cases in West Bengal.The cases were reported from North 24 Parganas district, an area that has seen Nipah outbreaks in the past.Both patients are 25-year-old nurses—a woman and a man—working at the same private hospital in Barasat. They developed initial symptoms in the last week of December 2025, which rapidly progressed to neurological complications. The two were placed in isolation in early January.In an update shared on its website, following confirmation of the cases, WHO said an extensive public health response was activated. Authorities identified, traced, monitored, and tested 196 contacts linked to the two patients. All contacts were asymptomatic and tested negative for Nipah virus infection. As of 27 January, no additional cases were been detected. “ The likelihood of spread to other Indian states or internationally is considered low. ”WHO assessed the risk at the sub-national level in West Bengal as moderate due to the presence of fruit bat reservoirs in border areas and the possibility of sporadic spillover.However, the agency said the national, regional, and global risk remains low.“Based on current evidence, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions,” said the agency.The national government deployed an outbreak response team to West Bengal to work closely with state authorities. Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control measures, and field investigations are underway. WHO said coordinated efforts between central and state health teams have enabled timely containment of the outbreak.""Nipah virus is a zoonotic disease transmitted mainly from bats to humans, sometimes through contaminated food or close contact. With no licensed vaccine or treatment currently available, early detection, supportive care, and strong infection prevention measures remain essential,"" said WHO on it's website.Historically, Nipah outbreaks in the WHO South-East Asia Region have been limited to Bangladesh and India, occurring sporadically or in small clusters. Human-to-human transmission is rare and usually confined to health-care settings or close family contacts, with no known instances of international spread through travel.This is the seventh documented Nipah outbreak in India and the third in West Bengal, following earlier outbreaks in Siliguri in 2001 and Nadia in 2007. The affected districts border Bangladesh, where Nipah outbreaks occur almost annually.WHO said several vaccine candidates are under development, but early supportive care, including intensive treatment for severe respiratory or neurological complications, remains critical for improving survival.","The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sought to reassure the public over India’s latest Nipah virus outbreak.

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP, Sunetra Pawar, is set to take over the reins of the party after his passing as she ticks the boxes of seniority, parity (with the rest of the Pawars), continuity and stability that the party wants bold and underlined.While the names of Ajit's sons Jay and Parth are also doing the rounds, what weighs things far more in Sunetra's favour is the feeling that there needs to be continuity, which the 62-year-old widow of the Maratha strongman will provide more than anyone else as she is the spouse, plus the fact that seniority considerations have to be kept in mind to some extent while picking a successor.Ajit had a team of senior politicians around him in his NCP. Praful Patel, Dilip Walse Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Hasan Mushrif, Sunil Tatkare, Dhananjay Munde are all politicians with experience in politics, legislature and administration. The party would accept the sons without hesitation as Parth and Jay are carriers of Ajit's name and legacy. But Sunetra's name would not require a negotiation with even the most experienced of the lot.The transition would be smooth and unquestioned, and acceptance of responsibilities would be genuine under her leadership among both seniors and juniors in NCP. Crucially, it is expected to stymie attempts to wean away a section of the outfit or some of its 40-odd MLAs either owing to injured egos or groupism or simply the promise of greater benefits and stability in other political camps.Sunetra's loss to Supriya Sule in 2024 Lok Sabha elections had rankled with Ajit, and placing her in the top position now would be one way of making amends, of assuaging sentiments of those in NCP who have a sense of hurt about that defeat, and of also making a political statement in the process.Sunetra's parity with the other seniors in the Pawar household would be another key factor. She would be able to speak to the leadership of the other faction of NCP as an equal and make acceptable decisions, including those about a merger. If, say, she decides to assert the identity and independence of the Ajit-led NCP, all forces within the party would instantly rally around her.Jay and Parth would also be able to negotiate or talk to the other faction, but Sunetra at the helm would be enough to scotch the rank and file's fears of a hasty decision taken by an impressionable person or one weighed down by thoughts of deference to elders, which is natural in a household as famously close-knit as those of the Pawars.Sunetra is the sister of former state minister and education baron Padamsinh Patil. Apart from her experience in Rajya Sabha, she has seen political activity up close all her life. She has also been engaged in social work for nearly two decades. She founded Environmental Forum of India in 2010, which works on promoting adoption of eco-friendly practices by villages and creation of eco-conscious communities.She's been a trustee of educational institution, Vidya Pratisthan in Baramati, on whose grounds Ajit's mortal remains were kept for people to pay their respects and where his last rites were carried out. The party believes that this experience in the social sector also makes her the ideal pick to lead it.","Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP, Sunetra Pawar, is set to take over the reins of the party after his passing.

‘Some Historians, Politicians Tried To Whitewash History Of Invaders’: PM Modi Hits Out In Somnath

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Friday strongly criticised former Vice President Hamid Ansari over his remarks describing Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire Mahmud of Ghazni as an Indian. The party accused him of distorting history and attempting to “whitewash” the brutal invasions of India.Ansari, who served as Vice President during the Congress-led UPA governments from 2007 to 2012 and again from 2012 to 2017, had said that figures commonly described as foreign invaders in textbooks were, in fact, Indians.“Those whom we describe in our textbooks as foreign invaders—whether it is the Lodhis or Ghazni—were all Indian plunderers. They did not come from outside,” Ansari said.Reacting sharply, BJP National Spokesperson CR Kesavan questioned the Congress party’s position on Ansari’s statement and accused it of attempting to sanitise violent episodes from history.In a post on X, Kesavan said the remarks were “shocking” and recalled that Ansari had been the Congress-led UPA’s choice for Vice President twice.“Ghazni was not a foreign invader, he was Indian'! Indeed shocking remarks by former Vice President Shri Hamid Ansari ji, who was the Congress led UPA govt's choice for the post of Vice President, not once but twice. Does the Congress leadership and Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi agree with such whitewashing of mercenary brutal raids as mere domestic acts, which demolished Hindu temples and murdered thousands?” Kesavan said.He alleged that Islamic invasions beginning in the early eighth century had systematically targeted Hindu religious sites.Kesavan further said Mahmud of Ghazni carried out 17 raids into India in the 11th century, during which he claimed major temples such as those in Mathura and Somnath were attacked.He also linked the issue to the Congress party’s historical opposition to the reconstruction of the Somnath temple.Shehzad Poonawala, also attacked the Congress over Ansari’s comments, accusing the party of consistently “eulogising Hindu haters” and downplaying atrocities committed against Hindus.Speaking to ANI, Poonawala said, “The Congress ecosystem always eulogises Hindu haters. Whoever attacks or commits atrocities on Hindus is always subjected to whitewashing by the Congress ecosystem. Now, Hamid Ansari says that Ghazni was not a cruel person, that he was just an Indian. It shows the Hindu hatred they have in their mind.”Poonawala also expanded his criticism to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of disrespecting constitutional institutions and national traditions by skipping key official events.“‘Sena and Samvidhan ka apmaan is Congress’s pehchaan’. Rahul Gandhi feels his family is above the Constitution and the Army. For him, ‘parivar tantra’ is more important than ‘samvidhan tantra’,” he alleged.","BJP National Spokesperson CR Kesavan accused Congress of attempting to sanitise violent episodes from history.

NCP factions eyeing February merger?

Will Ajit Pawar’s death speed up reunification?



Who will fill the vacuum?



Maharashtra ’s power dynamics



NEW DELHI: The sudden death of Maharashtra deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Ajit Pawar in a plane crash has triggered fresh churn in the state’s politics, reopening talks of a reunification of the two NCP factions led by the Pawars.The rumoured merger of the two NCP factions led by Ajit Pawar and his uncle Sharad Pawar is ""very much on course"", with talks having reached an ""advanced stage"" even before the deputy chief minister’s death in Wednesday’s plane crash, sources aware of the talks told news agency PTI.""The process of bringing the family and the party back together was already in motion. Ajit dada himself had held several rounds of discussions with senior leaders to bridge the gap,"" the sources said.The tragedy, they say, may now accelerate the process rather than stall it.Negotiators from both the ruling NCP and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) confirmed that discussions were well underway, with a tentative announcement earlier planned for February 8, shortly after the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti elections, the agency said.The two factions had already ""tested the waters"" by jointly contesting the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic polls under the NCP’s clock symbol, which was a clear sign of a thaw after the dramatic 2023 split.Sources said Ajit Pawar had meticulously planned the reunification of the two NCP factions and viewed the merger as part of a long-term strategy, keeping the 2029 elections and the party’s future relevance in mind. He was confident the reunion would take place with the consent of his uncle, Sharad Pawar.Reunification was also Ajit Pawar’s last wish, according to Kiran Gujar, a member of Vidya Pratishthan and a close associate of the Pawar family for over four decades.Speaking to reporters after the immersion of Ajit Pawar’s ashes, Gujar said, ""Today, the ashes of Ajit Pawar were immersed at Sangam here. It was ‘Dada’s’ last wish that this (merger of two factions of NCP) should happen. All should be united. Talks about this were happening throughout the family. In my last phone call with him, he had asked me for some election-related papers.""""He was one hundred per cent keen on merging both the factions. He had told me five days ago that the entire process was complete and the merger was imminent in the next few days,"" Gujar told PTI.Asked whether Ajit Pawar had discussed the issue with Sharad Pawar, Gujar said that ""positive talks were underway with Pawar saheb, Supriya Tai (Supriya Sule) and other leaders"", and there were indications that the senior Pawar would endorse the move.""Many positive things were on the cards, but this tragedy struck and took Ajit 'Dada' away from us. Now, after his death, it has become even more imperative that both factions come together and work for the betterment of Baramati and the state,"" he said.Just days before the fatal plane crash, Ajit Pawar had also met NCP (SP) leader Jayant Patil to finalise organisational unity and power-sharing arrangements. Even as merger talks gathered momentum, a section of party workers in the NCP has begun debating Ajit Pawar’s successor.Ajit Pawar himself had earlier told TOI that reuniting the party was his immediate political goal, with the blessings of Sharad Pawar.The moment carries a stark irony. Ajit Pawar was the architect of the 2023 split that fractured the NCP and aligned a majority of its legislators with the BJP–Shiv Sena-led Mahayuti government, leaving Sharad Pawar’s faction in opposition.Yet, despite the split, Ajit Pawar retained the party’s official identity, with the Election Commission recognising his group as the ""real"" NCP and awarding it the ""watch"" symbol.Ajit Pawar’s death has left the ruling NCP without a clear leader, triggering uncertainty over both leadership and key cabinet portfolios, including finance and excise, which he handled. With senior leader Chhagan Bhujbal unwell, the leadership question has become more urgent.While the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) believes the veteran leader will naturally return to a ""central role"" in guiding a unified party, the ruling NCP is keen to preserve the Pawar family’s political legacy.The NCP will hold a meeting of its legislature party on January 31 to formally name Sunetra Pawar, wife of the late deputy chief minister, as its leader, Bhujbal said on Friday.Speaking to reporters at the NCP office, Bhujbal said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has conveyed that he has no objection to Sunetra Pawar taking oath as deputy chief minister as early as Saturday, provided the legislature party takes a formal decision.Ajit Pawar’s NCP currently holds 40 MLAs, while the Sharad Pawar faction has 10.A merged party would command over 50 MLAs, potentially altering equations within the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).However, even if a unified NCP were to exit the ruling alliance, the Devendra Fadnavis government would remain secure, with the Mahayuti holding 235 MLAs in the 288-member Assembly.Political analysts say the bigger impact could be in western Maharashtra, the NCP’s traditional ""sugar belt"" — where the BJP has made recent inroads.For now, the February 7 local body polls will act as a ""coordinated tribute"" to the late leader, with both NCP factions contesting together under the clock symbol, seen as a prelude to a possible reunification after the results are declared on February 9.","The rumoured merger of the two NCP factions led by Ajit Pawar and his uncle Sharad Pawar is ""very much on course"", sources say. Talks had reached an ""advanced stage"" even before the deputy chief minister’s death in Wednesday's plane crash.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127803276,imgsize-42162,width-400,resizemode-4/127803276.jpg"

Russia Backs India’s Energy Needs As Putin Defies Trump And Promises Steady Fuel Supplies To Delhi

New Delhi: Russian state-run atomic energy corporation Rosatom, during the India Energy Week in Goa, presented an integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs), including floating power units — a unique Russian technology for countries like India with long coastlines and developed island territories.Rosatom also presented a comprehensive approach to solving problems in the field of nuclear energy and showed openness to the implementation of joint research projects.Russian company officials at the Goa event paid special attention to possibilities of scientific and technical cooperation based on multipurpose fast research reactor MBIR, which, after commissioning in 2028, will become the most powerful research reactor globally. India has also been invited to join an international consortium based on the reactor and participate in multilateral research programmes.“India is a strategic partner, cooperation with which has been building for many years and is aimed at developing nuclear and related industries. Joint nuclear projects form a solid technological and human foundation, designed for decades to come. The experience of implementing our flagship project, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, shows that we do not just work on individual tasks for the facility, but accompany the project throughout its life cycle, contributing to the industrial transformation of India,” Rosatom International Network CEO Egor Kvyatkovsky said.“We see great potential for deepening cooperation in both large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs) construction projects, as well as in non-energy areas such as nuclear medicine, isotope supply, joint research projects, additive technologies and digital solutions,” he said.Rosatom, which has been actively helping India build six 1,000 MW VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, is also discussing new areas of cooperation such as construction of Russian-designed low-power nuclear power plants (ASMMs) in India. ASMM technologies are focused on providing clean electricity to remote areas with limited network infrastructure, as well as energy supply to individual industrial enterprises.ENDSCaption: Rosatom is already helping India set up six nuclear reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu","Rosatom presented an integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs), including floating power units.

New Delhi: The govt may consider allowing export of wheat as the stock of the foodgrain with Food Corporation of India is now almost double of the required buffer and the prospect of a bumper harvest this year.As per govt data, the overall wheat sown area this year is at a record 33.4 million hectare, 3% higher than last year. There is a prospect of another bumper crop this year, following a record 118 million tonne (MT) of wheat production in 2024-25.TOI has learnt that deliberations over the issue of allowing wheat export at an inter-ministerial committee are underway and a decision would be taken soon. The govt had imposed a ban on wheat export in May 2022 following less production.At present, FCI holds wheat stock of 25.9 MT against the required buffer of 13.8 MT for Jan 1. “So, there is no issue so far as meeting the domestic demand is concerned. There is enough wheat available in the domestic market. It won’t be an issue, if we allow export of some quantity of the foodgrain,” said a govt official.Earlier this month, the govt eased the ban on wheat product exports by permitting limited, regulated shipments of wheat flour and related processed products. The govt has capped such exports at five lakh tonnes.","The overall wheat sown area this year is at a record 33.4 million hectare, 3% higher than last year.

New Delhi: NHAI has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between Jan and Dec 2025 for incorrect deductions and in nearly 35% of these cases, the vehicles were not at the toll plaza when the user fee was debited from FASTag wallet.Considering that such transactions happen due to manual entry of vehicle details by toll operators because of some issue, the road transport ministry is mulling doing away with this option completely.In a written reply, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari informed the Lok Sabha Thursday that National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), which provides the Central Clearing House (CCH) services of electronic toll collection , ""has reported 17.6 lakh transactions where refunds were made due to incorrect user fee (toll) deductions from Jan-2025 to Dec-2025 out of a total of 464 crore FASTag transactions"".This is barely 0.03% of all FASTag transactions.An official said, ""Though the number of faulty transactions is miniscule, this shouldn't happen. A decision will be likely taken soon on stopping the practice of manually feeding vehicle registration numbers in the system to deduct toll.

Blatant lie: Gaurav Gogoi slams Assam CM Himanta Sarma over ‘Miya Muslims’ remarks; alleges misuse of SC's name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/blatant-lie-gaurav-gogoi-slams-assam-cm-himanta-sarma-over-miya-muslims-remarks-alleges-misuse-of-scs-name/articleshow/127804280.cms,"Photo credit: ANI

Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, who represents Assam ’s Jorhat constituency, on Friday sharply criticised chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over his “Miya Muslims” remarks, accusing him of “misusing” the name of the Supreme Court to justify his statements and calling his claims a “blatant lie.”In a post on X, Gogoi described Sarma’s politics as driven by “dishonesty and shamelessness” and alleged that the chief minister falsely attributed certain words to the apex court in the Sarbananda Sonowal case.“Dishonesty and shamelessness define Himanta Biswa Sarma's politics. He has stooped so low that he is misusing the name of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. He claims to rely on the Hon'ble Court's 'own words' from the case of Sarbananda Sonowal. This is a blatant lie,” Gogoi wrote in his X post.He added, “The language he quotes is not the Supreme Court's. The Hon'ble Court neither authored the said words nor adopted it. To pass off an executive report as a judicial pronouncement is a deliberate contempt.”Gogoi further said that a chief minister attributing words incorrectly to the Supreme Court amounts to a violation of constitutional norms and urged the court to take note.“For a chief minister holding a constitutional office to falsely attribute words to the Hon'ble Supreme Court is not just contemptuous, it is an assault on constitutional propriety and institutional integrity. The Hon'ble Supreme Court may take cognisance of the remarks of Himanta Biswa Sarma that violate the Constitution and falsely attribute to the Court,” he said.The Congress MP’s remarks came after Sarma defended his comments on “Miya Muslim” in the context of alleged Bangladeshi infiltrators and said the Supreme Court itself had expressed concern over the influx of immigrants into Assam.Responding to criticism from the opposition, Sarma told reporters, “Those who have come from Bangladesh call themselves 'Miya'. I did not give them that name; it is they who call themselves that,” ANI reported.He added, “They only said to call them Miya. They wrote Miya poetry. If we say 'miya, miya', they can also call us 'Assamese, Assamese'; and what is the problem with that?”In a separate post on X, Sarma said critics should read the Supreme Court’s observations on Assam and illegal migration.“Those who are attacking me for my remarks on ""Miyan""--a word used in Assam in the context of Bangladeshi Muslim illegal migration--should pause and read what the Supreme Court of India itself has said about Assam.

Lucknow: Akhilesh On UGC Rules, SC Stay Sparks Student Debate, Sambhal Police FIR Issue And More

New UGC norms silent on penalty for false complaints

New Delhi: A day after Supreme Court stayed UGC's Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, the education ministry began examining on Friday the removal of the “false complaints” clause that featured in the 2025 draft but was dropped from the final notified rules.Those from the general category have argued that in the absence of a deterrent, false complaints may be used to harass them. Opponents of the regulations pointed out that the new framework includes other backward classes — a category not covered under the 2012 regulations — leaving the general category “without remedies for discrimination faced by them”.While removing OBCs from the purview of the regulations may not be an easy option, sources said the Centre is examining whether safeguards against false complaints need to be restored and the ambit of the anti-discrimination mechanism be expanded to cover EWS.Supreme Court put on hold Thursday the regulations notified on Jan 13, taking serious exception to several provisions and observing that they could fuel societal divisions and have a dangerous impact on the goal of a casteless society.Sections 2 and 3(c) of the regulations, which define beneficiaries as “socially and educationally backward classes” and state that “caste-based discrimination” refers to discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs.Notably, OBCs were not mentioned in Regulation 3(c) of the draft but were added in the notified rules this year.The draft regulations provided for penalties against false complaints. The deleted provision stated that anyone filing a false discrimination complaint could face a fine determined by the equity committee, with repeat or serious violations potentially leading to disciplinary action under institutional rules.A senior govt official said, “This is being examined along with compliance with SC’s directions, including its observation on setting up a panel of experts to study the regulations.”The court flagged concerns around possible “segregation” of students. Section 7 of the regulations, dealing with measures for promotion of equity, states that any selection, segregation or allocation related to hostels, classrooms or mentorship groups must be transparent, fair and non-discriminatory.","Supreme Court stayed UGC's Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026.

NEW DELHI: As the March 31, 2026 deadline for making the country ""Naxal-free"" approaches, the security forces are in the final leg of intelligence-based operations to get the remaining 'Big Four' of the apex CPI(Maoist) leadership -- three politburo-cum-central committee members and one central committee member -- and an estimated ""300-350 regular, uniformed cadres of concern"" still out there in the jungles.""Time is running out for these leaders, and full-time cadres spread across Chhattisgarh (around 200-250) and totalling no more than 10-20 each in Telangana, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra. They must choose between eschewing the path of violence and being confronted by the security forces in their hideouts across the Indravati national park area, small pockets of Jharkhand, and the inter-state borders of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Telangana,” Bastar range Inspector General P Sundarraj told TOI.There are only four surviving politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) members, of which two are not known to be active. Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji is the de facto No. 1, though not formally anointed as the CPI(Maoist) general secretary. Former general secretary Muppalla Laxman Rao @ Ganpathy is in his late seventies and supposedly ailing. Misir Besra, who is heading the CPI(Maoist) Eastern Regional Bureau since his predecessor Prashant Bose's arrest in 2021 and is the only non-Telugu face in PB, is currently operating in the Saranda forests of Jharkhand, where his aide and CC member Patiram Manjhi @ Anal Da was killed only a few days ago.The forces are already on Besra's trail. Malla Raji Reddy @ Sangram, who is in charge of Maoist operations in Odisha, is not known to have been involved in any active operations for quite some time.Though some state police have a 5th CC member — Asim Mondal — in their ‘active’ list, opinion is divided on whether he indeed is part of the CC.Devji, though currently No. 1 in CP( Moist), is debilitated by the series of killings and surrenders by his PB/CC colleagues, senior commanders and armed cadres in the past year or so. ""There have been multiple public appeals for surrender, including at the political level, but Devji may prefer to go down fighting, holding on to Maoist ideology,"" said a senior officer.As a senior MHA functionary had told TOI earlier, the “end” of Left-wing extremism may not mean there will be no incidents of Maoist violence. “But such incidents will be isolated and dealt with at the police station level. CPI(Maoist) will no longer have an organised, cadre-based strength operating across states,” said the officer.Between January 1, 2025, and January 22, 2026, a dozen central committee members, including general secretary and politburo member Basavaraju, were neutralised by the counter-Naxal forces, and five opted for surrender. There are still two senior commanders -- Pappa Rao and Prabhakar, both members of the Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC) — on the loose. They are said to be active in the inter-state border of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, covering Kanker, Gadchiroli and south of Indravati.The flood of Maoist surrenders last year, including by PB and CC member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu; CC members Chandranna and Sujata in Telangana; and Ramder and Rupesh in Chhattisgarh, along with the huge dent in Naxal arsenal with the recovery of 698 weapons and 915 IEDs in Chhattisgarh alone over the past year, have left the Maoists a depleted army on ventilator support.","There are only four surviving politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) members, of which two are not known to be active.

New Delhi: Delhi high court on Friday questioned the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) over the “indefinite” relaxation granted to airlines on implementing the new regulations governing pilots’ weekly rest and leave, reports Abhinav Garg.Hearing a PIL that raised the issue, a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia sought an explanation as to why the aviation regulator deferred the implementation of the new flight-duty norms soon after introducing them. “What is the rationale for withdrawal of this? And this applies to all airlines,” the bench asked the DGCA counsel. The HC issued notice, giving DGCA two weeks’ time to respond.The new regulations mandate that “no leave shall be substituted by weekly rest”. On Dec 5, 2025, DGCA eased the Flight Duty Time Limitations to allow IndiGo to deploy more pilots on duty in order to reduce disruptions. The move came after IndiGo cancelled hundreds of flights nationwide in the first week of Dec after failing to prepare for the implementation of the new flight-duty norms for pilots.",The Delhi high court questioned the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) over the ‘indefinite’ relaxation granted to airlines on implementing the new regulations governing pilots’ weekly rest and leave.

New Delhi: Observing that doctors administering speculative, unproven or experimental treatments on patients amounts to professional misconduct and negligence, Supreme Court on Friday said stem cell therapy cannot be used for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as it has not been approved for clinical treatment and expressed displeasure that the Centre has not taken suitable action to prevent it.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan also directed putting in place rules, regulations and guidelines to govern stem cell-based clinical trials and research in the country.“A medical practitioner who administers speculative, unproven or experimental treatment even when credible professional bodies have expressly advised against the use of such an intervention, may be held liable on count of professional misconduct. We say so because the administration of such a treatment would fail to satisfy the standard of reasonable care necessitated under the established medical negligence jurisprudence in India,” the bench said.It said every medical practitioner owes to his or her patient a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care, skill and knowledge expected of a prudent practitioner in the field. “A medical practitioner cannot be said to meet the standard of reasonable care if he administers an intervention that lacks credible scientific evidence of safety and efficacy, or where authoritative medical bodies unequivocally state that such form of treatment is not recommended,” the bench said.The court noted that although stem cells administered for therapeutic use in ASD are characterised as “drugs” under the Drugs Act, 1940, yet the same by itself is not determinative of the fact that it is permissible to be administered as a clinical service. It said if a medical intervention is characterised as unproven, experimental, obsolete or lacking justification by the scientific community, then such an intervention cannot be allowed by doctors.“It is unfortunate that the Union has let the matter worsen without any suitable and timely intervention. Such inaction has led to several parents/guardians seeking an unproven method of treatment for their children suffering from ASD, incurring huge financial cost and in alternative to other approved treatments,” the Supreme Court said.It said, “It cannot be denied that various clinics, in flagrant violation of the statutory mandate, continued to recommend and perform stem cell therapy as a routine clinical treatment for ASD because there was lack of executive action against the same. Therefore, we urge the Union to consolidate and clarify the position of law for enabling better implementation of the same in this regard at the earliest.”","Stem cell therapy cannot be used for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as it has not been approved for clinical treatment.

Failure to provide pads creates gender-specific barrier, says SC

New Delhi: Bringing the right of access to menstrual hygiene and gender-segregated toilets within the ambit of fundamental rights, Supreme Court directed states and Union territories on Friday to provide free sanitary napkins to adolescent girls in all govt and private schools and also construct separate toilets for them on campus.In a judgment jointly authored by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, the bench fixed a timeline of three months for the govts to enforce its direction. In order to ensure that its directions did not remain only on paper, it decided to monitor its implementation and posted the case for hearing after three months to examine compliance. ""We wish to communicate to every girl child, who might have become a victim of absenteeism because her body was perceived as a burden, that the fault is not hers. These words must travel beyond the courtroom, law review reports, and reach the everyday conscience of society at large,"" the bench said.The court passed the landmark judgement on a PIL filed by social activist Jaya Thakur after her lawyer Varun Thakur brought to the SC's notice various studies which showed that lack of access to menstrual hygiene is a big stumbling block for girls to get education, particularly in rural areas.The court said the absence of the measures entrenches gendered disadvantage by converting a biological reality into a structural exclusion which must be removed.“Dignity finds expression in conditions that enable individuals to live without humiliation, exclusion, or avoidable suffering. The right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to menstrual health. Access to safe, effective, and affordable menstrual hygiene management measures helps a girl child attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. The right to healthy reproductive life embraces the right to access education and information about sexual health,” it said.Observing that quality of education goes beyond textbooks, teachers, or classrooms, and it includes all the conditions that enable effective learning and continuity of schooling, the bench said the failure to provide sanitary napkins creates a gender-specific barrier that impedes attendance, and continuity in education, thereby defeating the substantive guarantee of free and compulsory education.It directed measures be taken to spread awareness about it to ensure that menstruation should not be a topic that is only shared in whispers. It ordered NCERT and the State Council of Educational Research and Training to incorporate gender responsive curricula, more particularly on menstruation, puberty, and other related health concerns, with a view to break stigma and taboo associated with menstrual health and hygiene.“It is crucial that boys are educated about the biological reality of menstruation. A male student, unsensitised towards the issue, may harass a menstruating girl child which may discourage her from attending school… Time is overripe that we recognise menstrual health as a shared responsibility rather than a woman’s issue. Awareness must not be limited to girls, but extends to boys, parents, and teachers. When menstruation is discussed openly in schools, it ceases to be a source of shame. It is recognised as what it is, a biological fact. Needless to say, it must be seen as a collective effort rather than a constitutional pull,” the bench said.Regarding lack of gender-segregated toilets in schools despite almost two decades after the Right to Education law was passed, the bench said, “What emerges is a stark constitutional failure, inasmuch as, although the statute mandates barrier-free access to the school building and separate toilets for boys and girls, yet, even after almost 17 years of enactment of the legislation, many schools continue to lack basic necessities for students. The norms and standards laid down in the Schedule are not merely procedural in nature but are integral to the effective realisation of Section 3 of the RTE Act, and more particularly, the right to education under Article 21A.”",Supreme Court directs states and Union territories to provide free sanitary napkins to adolescent girls in all govt and private schools.

BMC Polls 2026: Inside Mumbai’s Civic Giant Whose Budget Is Bigger Than Many Indian States

NEW DELHI: Delay in municipal elections in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru has deprived their civic bodies from getting grants earmarked as per the 15th Finance Commission. The tenure of the current commission ends on Saturday. All grants under the commission were linked to the timely election for municipal entities.Considering that the civic election in Mumbai was held after a gap of seven years, the BMC and the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) did not get the entire Rs 4,031 crore allocated under the Finance Commission’s framework. Similarly, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike did not get Rs 2,304 crore as the municipal election was delayed by five years.“This provision of linking grant to existing elected local govt was a significant move by the 15th Finance Commission. But it seems political reasons override the expected financial grant that a city would get. Municipal elections have been subject to political considerations across all political regimes,” said an expert in urban governance.A recent study by Janaagraha, a Bengaluru-based not-for-profit institution, found that as many as 61% of urban local bodies across 17 states experienced postponements of municipal elections in recent years."," delay in municipal elections in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru has deprived their civic bodies from getting grants earmarked as per the 15th Finance Commission.

This government took the votes of the poor by issuing ration cards during the elections, and now their ration cards are being arbitrarily canceled.Hooda was in Kurukshetra to offer condolences to the families of former minister Harmohinder Singh Chatha's wife and MLA Ramkaran Kala's elder brother, who recently passed away.Speaking to reporters later, Hooda said the BJP government is committing a great injustice against the poor in the name of Family IDs. “Ration cards of 70,000 families have been canceled in the last six months alone due to minor errors in names, ages, and other details,” he said.“This is not just a statistic, but a painful story of snatching food from the plates of thousands of poor families. Earlier, Haryana topped the entire country by canceling approximately 14 lakh ration cards,” he added.“Ration cards are being canceled, pensions are being stopped due to minor errors in Family IDs, and people are forced to make rounds of district Saral Kendras (government service centers) for months.Most concerning is that even after correcting the errors, the ration and pensions of many families are not being restored. According to reports, the pensions of more than 500,000 people have been stopped so far,” he pointed out.Hooda said that the BJP added 1 crore additional people to the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category to garner votes in the 2024 elections, and immediately after securing votes, they started arbitrarily canceling ration cards.“In response to a question asked during the winter session of Parliament, the central government stated that 4,141,385 ration cards were canceled across the country, with the Haryana government topping the list with 1,343,474 cancellations,” the former Chief Minister said.Hooda questioned why so many ration cards were issued before the elections and why they are being canceled now? “Why is the government not answering this question,” he asked.",Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the BJP government is committing a great injustice against the poor in the name of Family IDs. Hooda was in Kurukshetra to offer condolences to the families of former minister Harmohinder Singh Chatha's wife and MLA Ramkaran Kala's elder brother.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127807127,imgsize-1688797,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2026-01-30t230505512.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Shaheen Malik does not call it a victory. When her petition came up before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Bench made observations that could reshape how acid attack cases are treated—flagging the need for “extraordinary punitive measures”, questioning why the assets of convicted attackers cannot be seized and auctioned to compensate victims, and stating that a reformative approach has “no place” for attackers.While stopping short of issuing binding directions, the court assured Malik legal assistance of her choice, urged high courts to fast-track trials, and sought detailed data from states on acid attack cases. But for Malik, there is a long way to go. “This is not closure or a win. For survivors, it is only a beginning,” she toldon Friday.In 2009, acid was thrown on Malik’s face outside her workplace in Panipat. Since then, her life has unfolded inside hospital wards, police stations and courtrooms. She accused her employer’s wife and two students, one a juvenile, of carrying out the attack.Earlier data submitted by 15 HCs showed UP with the highest number of pending acid attack cases (198), followed by West Bengal (160), Gujarat (114), Bihar (68) and Maharashtra (58).For Malik, the numbers only echo what her body has carried for years.“For one second, I thought it was a prank,” she recalled. “Then the burning started.”Her parents and brothers rushed to bring her back to Delhi, hoping she would be admitted immediately, but they were turned away. “Hospitals initially refused to admit me unless we deposited lakhs of rupees, saying it was a criminal case,” she told the court. Even after an FIR was registered, she said, nothing moved. “Years passed… The case didn’t move. ”What followed was not only physical devastation, but systemic abandonment. Survival itself came at a cost that never stopped mounting.The corrosive liquid caused third-degree burns and permanent disfigurement, melting skin and facial tissue across nearly 90% of her face and parts of her body. Malik permanently lost vision in one eye. After more than two dozen reconstructive surgeries, her remaining eye still requires lifelong treatment and specialised cylindrical lenses.In 2012, after writing to then Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, she received Rs 3 lakh towards medical expenses. Malik said, “Justice was never about the money. But the cost of surviving is crushing.”Years blurred into each other—endless travel, hospital visits followed by court dates, and a support system that slowly shrank. “I lost friends, connections… everything.”Then came 2025. After more than 15 years of litigation, a Delhi court acquitted the three accused, citing lack of substantial evidence and serious gaps in the investigation. “I was disfigured, visually impaired, mentally shattered—and the people responsible walked free.” That moment became the trigger for her PIL in the SC. “I woke up and decided, this needs a fight,” Malik said.“I could give up—or continue fighting for every woman facing injustice.” She chose the latter not just for herself but to flag what she calls a ""structural failure"".Malik spoke of time slipping away. Pleading for an expedited hearing, she told the court the violence does not end with the crime. It stretches across years of trauma, isolation, treatment, hearings and waiting. “I told the SC that the pain I carry, no one else should have to carry for this long. I have given this case sixteen years of my life. I cannot give another sixteen,” she said.If Malik has one demand, it is not sympathy but sensitisation with consequences. Her petition sought police training, time-bound investigations, fast-track courts, judicial sensitivity and stricter punishment. “Acid violence comes from patriarchy, entitlement. When there is no fear, crimes continue.”Like hundreds of hearings she has attended before, that Tuesday began with cautious hope. She reached early, even though her case was listed for the afternoon. When the order finally came, she wiped away a tear.Malik believes the court’s suggestion to auction assets of convicted attackers is crucial. She said, “Medical care for acid survivors is primary for their survival. No one should live wondering if better treatment could have saved their sight, face, or future.”Acid violence, she said, imposes lifelong financial, psychological and social costs. “If the crime is created by society, then society must step in—not through charity, but accountability.”The violence stripped her of an ordinary future, with marriage out of the picture long ago. She lives alone, often wishing she had a companion. “No one wants to accept you with this face… this disability. I have to live like this for the rest of my life.”In 2021, Malik founded Brave Souls Foundation in Delhi, supporting over 300 acid attack survivors with medical aid, legal assistance, trauma counselling and rehabilitation. But stigma remains. “People don’t want to rent us houses, don’t want to give us jobs. They say our faces bring bad luck. The culprits, meanwhile, blend back into normal life.”Still, Malik says she has purpose. “My work is my life’s goal. If I can ease someone else’s struggle, it’s enough.” She hopes to be remembered not as a victim, but as proof that fighting yields something.“This isn’t personal anymore,” she said.","Shaheen Malik was attacked with acid outside her workplace in Panipat in 2009.

My Take 5 (Edition 63): The week that was in international affairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-take-5-edition-63-the-week-that-was-in-international-affairs/articleshow/127805483.cms,"Image: ANI

Update

Welcome back to another edition of My Take 5, your weekly round-up of top international news. This week we are covering developments in Syria between Damascus and the Kurds, the signing of the India-EU FTA, Russia-Ukraine war negotiations, China’s purging of its top general, and EU’s recognition of Morocco’s position on the Moroccan Sahara. So, let’s get to it.Syria focus: In significant developments in Syria over the past two weeks, the transition government of Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus launched offensives against Kurdish forces in that country’s north and east. The conflict began in Aleppo and then spread out, leading to Kurdish forces retreating from several towns. Importantly, many of these towns had Kurdish SDF run prison camps hosting former ISIS fighters. The US, which has been an ally of the Kurdish SDF, transported many of those fighters to Iraq. But a significant number of former ISIS fighters were also released by Damascus’s forces.There are two points here. First, the conflict between Damascus and the Kurds practically ends efforts to integrate Kurdish forces into the new Syrian army and governance structures as per an agreement last year. I interviewed senior Kurdish-Syrian politician Foza Yusif of the Democratic Union Party, the leading party among Syrian Kurds, on this subject. You can watch the interview here: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/international/turkey-instigating-syrian-govt-kurdish-politician-slams-u-s-for-damascus-vs-sdf-fighting-watch/amp_videoshow/127467458.cms Yusif was clear that Turkey is instigating al-Sharaa and the Damascus interim government to carry out the attacks against the Kurds.The latter are now left with no choice but to call for a general mobilisation to defend themselves, even as a fragile 15-day truce was announced.Second, there is a larger strategic game being played between Damascus, Turkey, Russia and US. Al-Sharaa is in Moscow to meet Putin as I write this. Moscow is using this meeting to secure its two major military bases in Syria, Hmeimim airbase and the Tartus naval base. Al-Sharaa, despite expectations that he would kick out the Russians completely from Syria after the fall of Assad in 2024, hasn’t done so. Turkey, which is essentially controlling al-Sharaa, wants to neutralise the Syrian Kurds of Rojava. So, Russia, despite sheltering Assad after his ouster, is trying to strike a grand bargain: allow Damascus and Turkey to move against the Kurds in exchange for retaining its military presence in Syria. Earlier this week, Russia also evacuated its forces from Qamishli airport in Kurdish-held northeast Syria, possibly to facilitate Damascus’s oncoming assault against the Kurds.Turkey will be very happy with this. Moscow may already have reached a tacit understanding with Ankara whereby the latter doesn’t create problems for it in the Black Sea in the context of the war in Ukraine where the Europeans have now aggressively started targeting Russian shadow fleet ships. Meanwhile, the US is waiting to see how things pan out. But if it waits longer to deter Damascus from attacking the Kurds, it will lose a huge strategic asset in Syria. True, Washington might think it can deal directly with al-Sharaa. But it should remember that it was the Kurds that fought and defeated ISIS. Not standing with the Kurds now would be a strategic blunder.: At the time of publishing, a deal has been struck between the Syrian interim government and the Kurds, laying out a phased integration of Kurdish forces into the new Syrian army. This will be followed by integration of Kurdish governance structures into Syrian state institutions. But we have been here before. An integration deal between Damascus and the Kurds in March last year went nowhere. Also, already there appears to be some disagreement with the new integration plan – Damascus wants Kurds to join the Syrian military on individual basis, but Kurds favour joining as complete brigades with four such Kurdish brigades being planned. Let’s see if the new integration plan actually works or just serves as a temporary reprieve in tensions.India-EU FTA: India and EU finally concluded their FTA after 18 years of negotiations to produce what is being described as the mother of all trade deals. The deal will either eliminate or substantially reduce tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports by trade value. Many of these are labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, footwear, tea, spices, gems and jewellery, and marine products that were hit by US tariffs. Similarly, EU gets duty-free or lower-tariff access for 97.5% of its exports by value. These will include wine, beer, olive oil, confectionary, European cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals. Of course, the deal has to be signed off on by the EU Council and EU Parliament. That process might take up to a year. There could also be some hurdles as seen with the recent trade deal between EU and the South American Mercosur group.However, the main import of the India-EU trade deal is strategic. Facing American tariffs and threats, New Delhi and Brussels have essentially signalled their defiance and independence to Washington with this deal. This is indeed welcome. Europe for far too long was complacent in the knowledge that the US will always have its back. Trump has shattered that illusion. EU now has to stand on its own feet, reinvigorate its own defence industry and make some smart strategic moves. This is precisely what it is doing with the FTA with India. The latter on its part is also slowly accepting the fact that it can’t perpetually mollycoddle its industries such as automobiles. It must open them up to competition, gain efficiency and compete globally.Overall, a diversified trade profile is any day better than relying on just a few markets. It took Trump to hammer home this truth. Both India and EU are better off for it.Russia-Ukraine war negotiations: Following the Davos summit last week, Ukraine, Russia and US have been engaging in a new round of talks to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. From the Ukrainian side, this round of talks and the Russian participants have appeared to be somewhat constructive. But the sticking points remain Russia’s unjustifiable demand that Ukraine give up all of its Donbas region, control over the now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power, and security guarantees for Ukraine. Russia has said it won’t accept foreign Nato-member troops in Ukraine after the war – UK and France are ready to send troops. But this would be a key pillar of Ukraine’s security guarantees. Without this how can Russia be deterred from carrying out another aggression against Ukraine in the future? It just doesn’t make sense, especially when Nato membership for Ukraine is off the table as per the US.Plus, why should Ukraine give up those territories in Donbas that it currently holds? All of these Russian demands suggest that Moscow is simply putting the entire burden of ending this war on Ukraine when it is itself the aggressor. There is no indication so far of any meaningful climbdown on Russia’s part.That said, as I write this, there are unconfirmed reports of a potential energy ceasefire between the two sides. Trump has also said that he spoke with Putin and asked for a week-long cessation of Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as temperatures are set to dip further next week – Putin has ostensibly agreed, but there is no confirmation of this as yet. Russia has been relentlessly targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure to deliberately heap misery on Ukrainian civilians in the middle of peak winter with sub-zero temperatures – Ukraine has responded by hitting Russian oil infrastructure. So, a pause will be welcome for Ukrainian civilians who are being subjected to Russia’s brutal weaponisation of winter. With another round of talks this weekend, one can only hope for a minor breakthrough.Xi purges top general: In another massive shakeup at the top echelons of the Chinese military, PLA’s top general and vice-chairman of China’s Central Military Commission (CMC) Zhang Youxia was purged along with the head of PLA’s joint operations, Liu Zhenli. This round of purge effectively hollows out the PLA’s top leadership. The CMC now has just two members – President Xi Jinping as chairman and Zhang Shengmin, PLA’s anti-corruption tsar. Critically, all top PLA generals with military experience have now been purged.Again, there can be two interpretations. First, Xi clearly saw a threat in Zhang, who was actually believed to be a close ally of the Chinese president. Officially he has been removed for violation of discipline – a Chinese euphemism for corruption. But there are rumours that he was leaking Chinese nuclear secrets to the Americans. This too may be a red herring and the actual reason could be that Zhang was planning a coup against Xi. After all, he was senior and influential enough to take this risk.Second, whatever the reason, the whole episode makes Xi look bad. If it was an attempted coup, that means divisions within the Chinese leadership. If it was corruption, that means Xi’s anti-corruption drive hasn’t succeeded even after a decade. And if Xi did this to achieve total control over the PLA, that shows insecurity and paranoia. Plus, there are now serious questions about the military preparedness of China. Without experienced generals, a Taiwan invasion is unlikely. Unless Xi is so desperate to get himself another term at the party congress next year that he is willing to surround himself with military yes-men and do that Taiwan invasion to unify domestic support. But he should know better – this strategy totally backfired for Putin in Ukraine. But given China’s economic size and global trade dominance, such unpredictability can only put the world on edge. Here’s the TOI editorial written by me on the subject this week: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/xiopolitics/ EU supports Morocco’s Sahara Autonomy Plan: In another big diplomatic victory for Morocco, the EU officially adopted a unified position supporting Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Moroccan Sahara. In a joint communique with Rabat, the European bloc agreed that “genuine autonomy could represent one of the most realistic solutions” for the long-running artificial dispute. It will be recalled that the Moroccan Sahara issue is a leftover baggage from Morocco’s colonial history. Even after Morocco gained full independence and reunified the Sahara through the historic Green March of 1975, different international players, led by Algeria, have used the Moroccan Sahara issue to strategically hem in Morocco. Algeria’s propping up of the Polisario Front separatist group and sustaining of the artificial Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic has been nothing but a strategic tool to prevent Morocco’s natural rise.But the other interesting point is EU’s changed position. Earlier, there wasn’t unanimity among EU members about the Sahara question. But today, faced with Trump’s tariff threats and bullying over Greenland, EU is willing to do more to have an independent, clear, consolidated position on foreign policy and strategic issues. This is welcome, just like the India-EU FTA mentioned above. Happily, on Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Sahara, EU’s and US’s positions now align. That’s a huge win for Rabat.","My Take 5 is your weekly round-up of top international news.

New India Q3 profit up 29% to Rs 826 cr; Health segment drives 48% of business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-india-q3-profit-up-29-to-rs-826-cr-health-segment-drives-48-of-business/articleshow/127804430.cms,"Photo credit: X/@NewIndAssurance

MUMBAI: New India Assurance reported a 28.86% rise in net profit to Rs 826 crore for the December quarter, driven by higher investment income and steady growth in premium collections, even as one-time wage-related provisions weighed on underwriting results. Profit before tax rose 61.89% year-on-year to Rs 824 crore in Q3 FY26.Premium income remained firm, with gross written premium increasing 10.47% to Rs 35,555 crore during the quarter. The strongest growth came from the health and personal accident segment, which expanded 16.15% year-on-year to Rs 17,127 crore, reinforcing its position as the company’s largest business line and accounting for 48% of the company’s business. Fire insurance premium grew 15.31% to Rs 5,519 crore. Motor insurance saw a mild contraction, with motor third-party premium down 1.04% and motor own-damage premium lower by 1.34%.Net written premium rose 10.4% to Rs 29,326 crore, while net earned premium increased 9.34% to Rs 28,494 crore. Net incurred claims climbed 11.85% to Rs 28,387 crore, reflecting higher claims across segments. Commission expenses increased 14.18% to Rs 2,883 crore and operating expenses jumped 36.07% to Rs 4,270 crore, largely due to provisions towards wage arrears and retirement benefits.Chairperson Girija Subramanian said domestic gross direct premium growth outpaced the industry average, helping lift the insurer’s market share to 13.4%. She added that global gross written premium for the nine-month period grew 10.5%.“The company recognized provisions of approximately Rs 2,500 Cr toward wage arrears and retirement benefits. While this had a substantial impact on the Combined Operating Ratio, it was partially offset by robust investment income from our equity portfolio. Despite these onetime costs, the company reported stellar Profit Before Tax,”she said.The Rs 1,696 crore for wage arrears and retirement benefits pushed the underwriting loss to Rs 7,046 crore from Rs 4,982 crore a year earlier. The claims ratio for the quarter stood at 99.62%, while the expense ratio rose to 14.56%, taking the combined ratio to 124.01%. Management said the impact was largely due to wage revisions implemented in January, which required total provisions of around Rs 2,500 crore.Investment income provided a cushion, rising 50.99% year-on-year to Rs 8,599 crore, supported by gains from the equity portfolio and favourable market conditions. For the nine months ended December, the company reported profit before tax growth of about 62%.The insurer closed the quarter with a solvency ratio of 1.81 times, well above the regulatory threshold, and said it remained optimistic about sustaining growth momentum amid ongoing reforms and a stable capital position.","New India Assurance reported a 28.86% rise in net profit to Rs 826 crore for the December quarter.

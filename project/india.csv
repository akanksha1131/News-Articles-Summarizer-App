‘Nothing to learn’: How Congress reacted to Digvijaya Singh’s RSS praise; senior leader clarifies stance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-to-learn-how-congress-reacted-to-digvijaya-singhs-rss-praise-senior-leader-clarifies-stance/articleshow/126212155.cms,"'Power of the organisation'

BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday stopped short of agreeing with its senior leader Digvijay Singh after he gave example of Rashtriya Swayamseva Sangh ( RSS ) to call for organisational reforms within Congress.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera, reacting to former Madhya Pradesh chief minister's remarks said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Earlier on Saturday Digvijay praised the organisational strength of RSS and shared a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi seated back on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, acknowledging how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh BJP worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""However, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO. If it's an NGO, then where have your rules and regulations gone? But I admire their organisational capacity,"" he added.Earlier this week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him ""full marks"" while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'संघटन सृजन' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Digvijay's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the party.BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Rahul was bringing his party ""upside down"" because he had been sidelined in the party.""It's because our Narendra Modi is 'guddri ke lal' (diamond in the rough) and their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' (great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru). Since our Narendra Modi has risen to top from bottom, he is taking the party (BJP) also to the top from bottom,"" Trivedi told a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.In a swipe to Rahul, he said, ""Since their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' who is now 'side down from up', he is bringing his party upside down.""This comes after the Congress held the CWC meet in Delhi on Saturday under the chaimanship of party chief Mallikarjun Kharge -- first after the party suffered a huge loss in Bihar assembly elections.After the CWC meet, Kharge announced that the grand-old-party launch a nation-wide protest against the Centre for replacing rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law from January 5.""In the meeting, we took an oath. We decided to launch a massive movement across the country, making the MNREGA scheme the central point. Indian National Congress party, taking a leading role, will launch the Save MNREGA Campaign from January 5th,"" Kharge said.","Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi. BJP alleged that Digvijay's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126212213,imgsize-908259,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
30–35 terrorists on radar: Army steps up counterterror ops in J&K; heightened vigilance amid 'Chillai Kalan',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3035-terrorists-on-radar-army-steps-up-counterterror-ops-in-jk-heightened-vigilance-amid-chillai-kalan/articleshow/126211810.cms,"'India Faces Two War Realities: Counter Terror Strikes And Long Conflicts', Says CDS Anil Chauhan

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir , the Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.Army units have expanded their operational reach into higher and snowbound areas to pursue and neutralise Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment, news agency ANI reported, citing sources.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.The sources said that the Army and security forces have adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.This year's counter-terror strategy has been the integrated approach to operations. The Indian Army is leading a synchronised effort involving multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the civil administration, the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Special Operations Group (SOG), Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards (VDGs).This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution, sources said.ANI reported that intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully synthesised to draw precise situational pictures of terrorist movement and hideout patterns. Once intelligence is verified, coordinated joint operations are planned and launched, minimising overlaps and ensuring maximum impact with tactical precision.The synergy among ground units and intelligence frameworks has enhanced response time, enabling security forces to act the moment actionable information surfaces.According to the report, the terrorists, who are hiding in this region, are attempting to coerce or threaten local villagers for shelter and food supplies, though their support among locals and overground workers has sharply declined.Sources emphasised that this season's winter operations are guided by a clear doctrinal approach: Surveillance to Swift Operations and then Back to Surveillance.The philosophy emphasises an unbroken cycle of monitoring, quick response, and sustained watchfulness, minimising the chances of terrorists regrouping. This methodical rhythm allows forces to keep pressure constant while conserving resources and adapting to environmental challenges, they added.This comes with the onset of Chillai Kalan, the harshest phase of Kashmir's winter, spanning from December 21 to January 31. During this period, most activity in the mountains comes to a standstill.Meanwhile, the Indian Army has also deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units across several key sectors. These troops, adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat, have been instrumental in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.",The Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.

Why India’s betting on new tactic against digital arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indias-betting-on-new-tactic-against-digital-arrest/articleshow/126211416.cms,"AI image

Central teeth for national problem

Banking, telecom breaches

What’s the counterpunch?

Over to CBI

As another year winds down, a cybercrime epidemic of mindboggling proportions continues unabated in India. Striking with impunity and alarming frequency, there is seemingly no tactic that’s too bizarre and no target that’s out of reach for cyber fraudsters. Earlier this year, a doctor in Gujarat was kept under video surveillance for three months, reportedly losing Rs 19 crore during her digital-arrest ordeal. More recently, a former Punjab Police IG was defrauded of more than Rs 8 crore in an investment scam. The shock led him to shoot himself in the chest.While the law of the land does not specifically recognise the concept of “digital arrest”, cases are reported every day from across India — mostly, instances of cybercriminals impersonating police and central security officials and using panic and manipulation to wipe people’s bank accounts clean.But there are many more ways in which they come for your money (see box), like infecting your phone with forwards that transfer control, catching you by surprise with a video call and morphing the footage for blackmail, or ‘pig butchering’ you with texts about lucrative investment returns.The number of cases, and the swindled cash involved in those, has seen an exponential rise: 23 lakh cybercrime complaints were registered on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) in 2024, a 42% jump over 2023.And the money lost to such frauds in 2024 was estimated to be Rs 23,000 crore, a 200% jump from Rs 7,500 crore in 2023. As a hydra-headed monster that takes new forms virtually every month, cybercrime is no longer a battle that state police can fight within their own limited jurisdictions and win. Which would explain why Supreme Court this month ordered CBI to launch a sweeping probe into all digital arrest scams.Bringing in the might of a central agency was an overdue move. As a senior cyber cell officer in Delhi pointed out, “the core challenge lies in the complex inter-state and geographical nexus of these operations, where the victim and the perpetrator are separated not just by distance but also by an intricate web of digital and financial layering.”Cybercrime presents a challenge entirely different from that posed by conventional crime. In a ‘digital arrest’ scam, which is perpetrated over a video call that can last hours, weeks, days, or even months, the money moves quickly through a series of what are known as ‘mule accounts’.These are usually located in places far apart and opened using forged documents or with the connivance of bankers. For example, money from a ‘digital arrest’ in Delhi, Gurgaon, Bengaluru or Hyderabad could be routed to mule accounts in West Bengal, Uttarakhand and Gujarat. That is why recoveries are only a fraction of the defrauded cash because, by the time the labyrinth of transactions has been decoded, the money has vanished.In India, two key hubs of cybercrime have been identified in Jharkhand’s Jamtara and the triangle of Bharatpur (Rajasthan), Mathura ( Uttar Pradesh ), and Nuh (Haryana). But an even more concerning dimension is the rise of large organised overseas operations in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and, of late, Myanmar.These are operations that run call-centre-style scam compounds, drawing their manpower from human trafficking victims, including Indians who are snared by local placement agents with the lure of foreign jobs in data entry, IT and management. “Once trapped, these recruits are held in prisonlike conditions and coerced into undertaking cybercrimes targeting their own countrymen,” said a Delhi Police officer.Several of these international operations have been traced to Chinese criminal syndicates that provide technical infrastructure like apps and VoIP. “CBI is uniquely positioned to connect these disparate dots: like a SIM card issued in one state, a bank account opened in another, and an IP address originating at a third location,” said a government official.The digital epidemic has fed on an explosive growth of the internet user base. While India has become an increasingly digital society, large sections of people remain digitally naïve because initiation to new technology and devices happened at a later stage in life. But cybercrime’s uncontrolled spiral has also exposed major vulnerabilities in two critical pillars — the telecom sector and the banking system. Both have failed to build adequate safeguards.“Fraudsters routinely exploit lax Know Your Customer (KYC) norms to illegally procure huge numbers of SIM cards. They are similarly also able to open mule bank accounts, the lifeblood of their operations,” said a Delhi cyber cell investigator. Systematic targeting of senior citizens with pension funds in their accounts and women makes it clear that scammers have access to banks’ customer data, investigators said.Recently, CBI arrested the manager of a prominent bank in Mumbai for allegedly accepting illegal gratification to process account-opening forms, creating channels for rapid layering of cybercrime proceeds. The accused is said to have facilitated the use of accounts that are linked to multiple cybercrime cases.Similar crackdowns across states, like ‘Operation Insider’ by Telangana Police, have led to the arrest of many bank officials for opening current accounts without due diligence in exchange for commissions from fraudsters.It’s the transnational cybercrime syndicates in Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam that execute the most complex frauds, increasingly deploying AI and deepfakes. These are the crimes that have so far proved the hardest to crack for police across Indian states. “Funds siphoned from Indian victims are quickly laundered, often converted into cryptocurrency and then moved internationally to accounts in countries like China, Singapore and Vietnam to evade detection,” explained a senior police officer.Sleuths may still have to play catch-up with new tactics, but the fight against cybercrime is much more organised now than it was two years back, which will help CBI.The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), through its Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System, has helped save around Rs 7,130 crore by facilitating rapid freezing of funds. NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India), too, has helped freeze scam proceeds in real time. A centralised toll-free helpline number, 1930, has been operationalised for quick assistance in lodging cybercrime complaints.Govt has blocked over 11 lakh SIMs and around 3 lakh IMEI numbers linked to frauds, underscoring the necessity of a coordinated, technological counteroffensive. Creation of a ‘Suspect Registry’ by I4C to flag suspect bank accounts and use of the ‘Pratibimb’ module to map criminal locations based on telecom and crime data are among other tech responses that have taken shape.“A state-of-the-art Cyber Fraud Mitigation Centre has been set up at I4C. It has brought together representatives of major banks, financial intermediaries, payment aggregators, telecom service providers, IT intermediaries and representatives of states/UTs and police to tackle cybercrime,” a government official said.By combining domestic reach and collaborations with security agencies globally, CBI can serve as the lead enforcer and nodal point for busting complex, transnational cybercrime networks. Through specialised initiatives like Operation Chakra, CBI has been coordinating simultaneous raids on financial nerve centres of cybercrime with organisations like FBI and Europol. This is something that no state police force can do.CBI can ensure that the digital trail of a crime — which might involve a victim in Delhi, a server in Europe, and a perpetrator in Southeast Asia — is traced and documented for prosecution. By utilising the Bharatpol portal and its Global Operations Centre, CBI can also create a bridge between state police forces and international intelligence, allowing real-time sharing of data. CBI’s strength also lies in its role as National Central Bureau for Interpol in India, which gives it a direct line to law enforcement in over 190 countries.The agency is also equipped to lead large-scale crackdowns on illegal call centres that have been operating as hubs for international extortion. Besides, it has extraterritorial mandate under Section 75 of the IT Act, which gives it legal authority to investigate any individual, regardless of nationality, whose digital actions impact systems within India.","The number of cases, and the swindled cash involved in those, has seen an exponential rise. 23 lakh cybercrime complaints were registered on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) in 2024. The money lost to such frauds in 2024 was estimated to be Rs 23,000 crore, a 200% jump from Rs 7,500 crore in 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126211438,imgsize-98250,width-400,resizemode-4/cybercrime39s-grip-on-india.jpg"

CHANDRAPUR: The SIT probing illegal sale of a farmer's kidney in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, has uncovered a direct operational link to China. Fresh disclosures indicate that a Chinese surgeon, Dr Chiang, conducted transplant procedures in Cambodia and supplied harvested organs to clients in his home country.The revelations, based on statements of two key accus-ed during interrogation, have prompted officials to expand the scope of inquiry across international networks.Police sources said Ramakrishna Sunchu of Solapur (who also posed as 'Dr Krishna' and Mallesh) and Himanshu Bhardwaj from Mohali, Punjab, told interrogators Chiang performed the surgeries and ensured that all procured kidneys were routed to Chinese recipients.The kidney of Roshan Kule, a marginal farmer from Minthur village who was lured into selling his organ, was allegedly transplanted to a patient in China within 12 hours of the kidney removal, sources said.Investigators believe Chiang played a key role in recruiting intermediaries, allegedly enticing Sunchu and Bhardwaj with significant financial rewards to supply donors. Police are pursuing the third accused in the chain from West Bengal, who remains on the run.Himanshu Bhardwaj once ran a tour and travel business. His life took a turn when he fell in love with a young woman and began taking care of all her expenses.When she expressed her desire to travel to the US, Himanshu decided to fulfil her dream — even if it meant selling his own kidney.That decision made him enter the kidney trade.","SIT probing illegal sale of a farmer's kidney in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, has uncovered a direct operational link to China.

‘Woman married 2nd time, not entitled to maintenance’

MUMBAI: In an unexpected turn, a woman’s current husband took the witness stand to depose on behalf of her ex-spouse, ending a nearly 17-year-old domestic violence case.The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband. She sought protection and monetary relief, claiming she was ousted from her home. However, a Borivli court ruled that with her current husband confirming marriage, she was not entitled to maintenance.Additional chief judicial magistrate B N Chikne said, “As such, in such facts and circumstances and the evidence on record, it appears to me that it is proved from the evidence and documents produced on record, after divorce from the respondent No. 1 (ex-husband), the applicant (woman) performed a second marriage. Therefore, she is not entitled to get maintenance from respondent No. 1.”The judgment centred on the revelation that the woman had entered into a second marriage while her original maintenance claim was still active.In her plea, the woman said she married her ex-husband in 2005 through an arranged setup. She alleged that she later found out that the man was already married and his first wife began to frequent their home.Along with the ex-husband, his first wife would abuse her too. She alleged numerous incidents of physical, emotional and economic abuse. In Dec 2009, the first husband was directed to pay the woman an interim monthly maintenance of Rs 3,200 until the disposal of the case.While the woman’s sister served as a witness to support her allegations, the man brought to court an imam who officiated the woman’s second marriage, a handwriting and fingerprint expert who testified on the signatures and thumb impression on the nikahnama of the second marriage, and her husband.The trajectory of the trial shifted dramatically when her ex-husband produced her current husband as a defence witness to confirm their marital status. By confirming the second marriage through the evidence of the current husband himself, the defence nullified the woman’s status as a dependent of her former spouse.The court ruled the existence of this second union, confirmed by the man who entered into it, extinguished the woman's right to seek further maintenance or protection from her first husband.","The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband.

BENGALURU: What began as a tattoo of ""another woman"" on the husband's forearm ended in the murder of his wife and a sentence of life imprisonment for him.Earlier this week, a city court convicted 33-year-old Vinay Kumar, a resident of A Narayanapura in Mahadevapura, of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021. Since his arrest, Kumar had remained lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara, with his attempt to secure bail failing.Kumar and Ashwini, an engineer and his younger sister's classmate, met at a family wedding, fell in love, and married in 2018. But the marriage began to unravel three years later when Kumar returned home with a tattoo reading ""Roopa"" inked on his right forearm. When Ashwini questioned him about the tattoo and demanded to know who Roopa was, Kumar gave evasive answers. She later discovered that he was having an affair.According to the prosecution, Kumar feared she might take legal or personal action against him. Unwilling to end the relationship with Roopa, he decided to eliminate his wife.Public prosecutor Satyavati HR told TOI the murder was planned carefully. On the night of April 16, 2021, Kumar purchased a can of beer and a strip of 10 sleeping tablets before returning home.After having chicken biryani for dinner, he forced Ashwini to drink the beer, secretly mixed with the tablets. She soon slipped into a deep sleep. Kumar believed the overdose would be fatal. When he found Ashwini still breathing early the next morning, Kumar strangled her using her dupatta.""Afterwards, he stepped out of the house and raised the alarm, claiming his wife was lying motionless,"" Satyavati said. With a neighbour's help, he took Ashwini to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. Kumar initially managed to convince Ashwini's parents and relatives that it was a natural death. However, Mahadevapura police ordered an autopsy, while viscera samples were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory.The autopsy revealed the death was due to strangulation, leading to Kumar's arrest. Subsequent FSL reports confirmed the presence of alcohol and sleeping tablets in Ashwini's system.During the trial, circumstantial evidence sealed Kumar's fate. Testimonies from a wine shop cashier and a medical store assistant, backed by CCTV footage, established that Kumar had purchased the beer and sleeping tablets on the night of the murder.After police filed the charge-sheet, Kumar filed his bail application. Police, however, discovered that the surety documents submitted were fake and informed the court that his family had distanced themselves from him after the crime. The bail plea was rejected, forcing him to spend time in prison.","Vinay Kumar, 33, convicted of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhi continued to struggle with toxic air on Sunday, with several areas recording ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ air quality levels, as a dense layer of smog blanketed the city.The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Sunday reached 391, entering the 'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Morning visuals from Akshardham Temple showed the iconic structure fading into a thick, dense layer of smog that drastically reduced visibility.The AQI (Air Quality Index) in the area stood at 445, placing it in the ‘severe’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Around AIIMS, the AQI was measured at 340, categorised as ‘very poor’. Meanwhile, visuals from the ITO area showed the city shrouded in a thick blanket of smog, with hazy conditions reducing visibility.The AQI there had crossed 400, also falling under the ‘severe’ category.Meanwhile, in Mumbai, a light layer of fog enveloped the Bandra Kurla Complex, where the AQI was measured at 123, classified as ‘moderate’.Authorities have invoked Stage III measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which include restrictions on construction and industrial activities.The ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ rule is being enforced to curb emissions.Officials attributed the worsening conditions to a combination of cold weather, calm winds, and dense fog that trap pollutants close to the ground.

'I'm Indian': Tripura student's last words before he was killed in a racial attack; protests erupt seeking justice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/im-indian-tripura-students-last-words-before-he-was-killed-in-a-racial-attack-protests-erupt-seeking-justice/articleshow/126209417.cms,"Family and friends pay tribute to Anjel Chakma at his home in Tripura



'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed.""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine. Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly. But when students from north Indian states come to central institutions in the northeast, they are welcomed like fellow countrymen. We lost an innocent soul in a hate crime. That's the tragedy. ""Police said the case was registered on Dec 12 on a complaint filed by Michael Chakma, 21. Five of the six accused - including two juveniles - were apprehended on Dec 14.Senior sub-inspector Jitendra Kumar of Selaqui police station said on Sunday, ""Yagya Awasthi, the main accused, is suspected to have fled to Nepal... Two police teams have been dispatched to track him down and nab him, and a reward of Rs 25,000 has been announced. After Anjel's death, we added additional BNS sections - 103(1) (murder) and 3(5) (committing crime with common intention).""Initially, the FIR was filed under BNS sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 118 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 351(3) (criminal intimidation). On Dec 14, based on doctors' statements, sections 109 (attempt to murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) were added.The charges were upgraded again after Anjel's death. In his final days, friends recalled how Anjel struggled but never regained full consciousness. Protests have begun in colleges in the northeast, demanding a national law against racial hate crimes. In Dehradun, too, student organisations are beginning to speak up.","Anjel Chakma, 24, died in Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days.

Aravali mining row: Supreme Court takes suo motu cognisance; hearing set for Monday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aravali-mining-row-supreme-court-takes-suo-motu-cognisance-hearing-set-for-monday/articleshow/126208577.cms,"Supreme Court (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of concerns linked to the definition of the Aravali Range, signalling fresh judicial scrutiny of an issue that has sparked protests and debate over mining and environmental protection.According to news agency ANI, a three-judge vacation bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant will hear the matter on Monday.The court’s decision comes amid widespread concern over how the Aravali hills are being defined for regulatory purposes, particularly in relation to mining activities.The definition accepted earlier by the apex court has triggered objections from environmentalists and civil society groups, who fear it could weaken conservation safeguards for one of India’s oldest mountain systems.The Union environment ministry has moved to address some of these concerns by deciding to further expand areas where mining will be prohibited across the Aravali range.The ministry has directed the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to identify additional landforms and zones where mining should be banned, beyond areas already under restriction.Currently, only about 0.2 per cent of the Aravali’s total area of around 1.4 lakh sq km is eligible for mining, and the new exercise could reduce this further.The ministry has said this step would “further enlarge the coverage of areas protected and prohibited from mining in the entire Aravalis, keeping in mind the local topography, ecology and biodiversity”.States spanning the Aravali range, including Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, have also been told not to grant any new mining leases until a comprehensive Management Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM) is finalised.The controversy centres on a 100-metre height-based definition of Aravali hills adopted by the Supreme Court on November 20 for mining-related decisions.Under this definition, a hill is identified as a landform rising 100 metres or more from the lowest enclosing contour, with nearby hills within 500 metres grouped as a range.Environmentalists argue this approach could significantly shrink the area officially recognised as Aravali hills, as much of the range is low-lying.Despite the criticism, the environment ministry has maintained that the new definition does not dilute mining controls and that existing safeguards remain in place. It has also clarified that for mines already in operation, state governments must ensure strict compliance with environmental norms and Supreme Court directions.",The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of concerns linked to the definition of the Aravali Range.

Congress Rift Out In Open? Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday created a stir by praising the organisational strength of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- a group the Congress has long opposed ideologically. Sharing a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Narendra Modi seated on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, Singh acknowledged how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.He pointed to the image as an example of how a grassroots worker from the RSS and Jan Sangh rose to become prime minister of the country.Posting the picture on X, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister wrote, ""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh @BJP4India worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""But later in the day, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I support the organisation. I am against the RSS and Modi ji... You have misunderstood... I have praised 'sangathan'. I was, am, and will remain a staunch opponent of the RSS and Modi... Is it a bad thing to strengthen and praise the organisation?...""BJP leader Gaurav Vallabh, once a staunch Congress member, weighed in on Digvijaya Singh's remarks and used the moment to criticise the grand old party.Speaking to news agency ANI, he said Singh’s comments confirm that it is a ""family-owned company"".Also read: BJP attacks Gandhi-Vadra family over Kharge's treatment in presser; shares Jairam clip Vallabh said, ""Digvijay Singh is saying that the Congress party has today become a 'family-owned company' where only the person born into that family can make all the decisions...

"Salt Lines: A forgotten 4,000-km 'living border' reappears in a Mumbai museum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salt-lines-a-forgotten-4000-km-living-border-reappears-in-a-mumbai-museum/articleshow/126206594.cms,".

In the open-air plaza of Mumbai's oldest museum, a long, zig-zag wall of cloth ripples in the breeze. At first glance, it looks like a giant curtain. Step closer to squint at the crimson prints on it and the cloth becomes a partition: neat plant patterns on one side and chaotic termite marks on the other.Block-printed deliberately with dyes from homegrown shrubs like babool and karonda, this 20-metre-long cotton wall at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum quietly leads visitors back to a little-known 4,000-km hedge that once formed a thorny botanical border across India, buzzing with birds and bees.Part hedge, part fence, the Inland Customs Line — a forgotten boundary created by the British in the 19th century to enforce the Empire’s deadly salt tax— is the centrepiece of 'Salt Lines', the first Indian solo exhibition by artist duo Himali Singh Soin and David Soin Tappeser who go by Hylozoic/Desires.Created in collaboration with RMZ Foundation and India Art Fair and supported by Alkazi Foundation, the show revisits the colonial 4,000km long border of which 2,500km constituted a fence of plants also known as ‘The Great Hedge of India’.Stretching from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and patrolled by thousands of customs staff, the hedge--described as ""utterly impassable to man or beast""--was built by the East India Company and later the British Raj to enforce the salt tax in the mid nineteenth century.“We first stumbled upon the incredible history of the Inland Customs Line when we were doing more general research on… salt,” the artists say. Its scale shocked them: “It seemed improbable to us that such a large botanical infrastructure could have existed for much of the 19th century without everyone knowing about it.”Salt, which had been lightly taxed under earlier Indian rulers and the Mughals, became one of the British Empire’s most lucrative revenue streams after Bengal Presidency governor Robert Clive’s victory at The Battle of Plassey in 1757.Through monopolies and price controls, the East India Company's officials forced peasants and merchants to buy salt from government depots at inflated rates. Even during the catastrophic Bengal famine of 1770, which killed an estimated ten million people, land revenue and salt taxes were collected in full.Originally consisting of thorny branches and deadwood piled into a crude fence, it was designed to stop smugglers from moving coastal salt into British-controlled territories, where it was heavily taxed. From the 1860s, the British began converting it into a living hedge, planting hardy native shrubs, digging trenches, building embankments, and maintaining a patrol road. Under officials such as AO Hume, entire teams tended the hedge, watering, pruning, and replanting it.Between 1867 and 1870, Hume oversaw a dramatic expansion of the hedge. By 1869 it stretched more than 2,300 miles from the Indus to the Mahanadi, patrolled by nearly 12,000 men. The line snaked through what is now Pakistan, skirted Delhi, passed Agra, Jhansi, Hoshangabad, Khandwa, Chandrapur and Raipur, and terminated in present-day Odisha. Where living shrubs failed due to rocky soil or frost, stone walls were erected instead; elsewhere, dry hedges of dwarf Indian plum had to be rebuilt constantly after damage from insects, fire and storms.At its height, the hedge was said to be up to 12 feet high and 14 feet thick, made of tightly trimmed trees and shrubs of babool, Indian plum, carounda, prickly pear, and thuer, depending on the soil and climate, with a thorny creeper woven throughout. By the 1870s, more than 14,000 men were employed to guard and maintain it, making it one of the largest security operations in the subcontinent.“On no branch of their duties have the whole establishment bestowed anything like so much time, labour, care, and thought, as on the rearing of this barrier...after all it must be remembered that our barrier is to the Line what the Great Wall once was to China: alike its greatest work and its chiefest safeguard,"" wrote Hume.The hedge was lost in the archives, say the artists who scoured the National Archives of India, the British Library, the South London Botanical Institute, the Alkazi Collections and more for its history. “We found textual evidence… but no imagery.”To fill the gap, they created speculative visual records such as re-enactments at Sambhar Lake, an important British salt outpost, and AI-generated images, printed using a 19th-century salt process and toned with gold.At the centre of 'Salt Lines' is 'The Hedge of Halomancy' (2025), a 23-minute film. It follows Mayalee, a courtesan known to history for resisting the British. “She refuses the British administrators… when they attempt to replace her traditional salt stipend with cash payments,” the artists explain.Salt, in the film, becomes material and metaphor. A three-dimensional salt crystal acts as “a magical talisman,” linking Mayalee to Hume and, symbolically, to Gandhi’s march to Dandi. In another room called the 'Salt Office', historical salt-tax objects including two photographs of Bombay’s salt satyagraha from the Alkazi Collection sit beside Salt Prints (2024). “Salt is an acid and a base, an amazing symbol of equilibrium,” the artists say.Sound underscores this tension. “The speculative chapters… are underpinned by bansuri and sitar,” says David. The archival sections use “tuba and percussion,” echoing British military bands and their transformation into Indian wedding music.How did the hedge disappear from public imagination? Nature played the first role. “Termites… begin to eat into the hedge,” the artists note. “Winds, rats, tigers stormed through parts of the hedge.” Human anger, it seems, finished the job. “During the 1857 mutiny, people burnt parts of the hedge down in fury.”When the British gained control over salt-producing regions like Sambhar Lake, they found a cheaper way to tax salt at its source. The hedge — expensive and unwieldy — was dismantled on April 1, 1879.Nature reclaimed it. The living shrubs died or were cut; deadwood was carted off by villagers; embankments eroded. Within decades, almost nothing remained. ""The natural world’s resistance not only contributed to the fall of the hedge but also to its utter erasure from history,"" say the artists.Many historians had never heard of it until British writer Roy Moxham rediscovered it in the 1990s, travelling across India to piece together its remnants for his book 'The Great Hedge of India'. “People seldom realise how critical salt is to health,” wrote Moxham. “And yet, it seems inconceivable to me how this incredibly painful part of history, the immense abuse people endured at this time, could be so utterly forgotten. ”When he set out to find the remnants of the Customs Hedge, Moxham had imagined the barrier as a piece of British whimsy constructed to collect a minor tax. Along the way, he realized that the men posted along it, mostly local recruits, worked in isolation for months, patrolling harsh terrain with sticks, whips, and firearms. Those caught bypassing the hedge faced imprisonment. Famine, he discovered, was worsened by the Salt Tax. In 1877–'78, crops failed from poor rains in the North-Western Provinces while grain was exported, causing starvation. Official reports recorded 1.3 million deaths, with most deaths attributed to disease rather than hunger, though salt deficiency increased mortality.""I had assumed it was merely a flamboyant boundary, perhaps fashioned by administrators with fond memories of English hedgerows,"" wrote Moxham. ""It was a terrible discovery to find that it had been constructed, and ruthlessly policed, so as to totally cut off an affordable supply of an absolute necessity of life,"" he concluded.The hedge entered public conversation again in recent years. In 2022, UK-based runner Hannah Cox set out to trace the forgotten border by running 100 marathons in 100 days, following the path of the Great Hedge across the country. Her journey — physically retracing a line most Indians have never seen — sparked renewed interest in how a structure so long, so intrusive, and so central to colonial revenue vanished almost without a trace.It is fitting that the exhibition sits inside the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai’s oldest, built by the British in 1857 as the Victoria & Albert Museum, Bombay. For the artists, its vitrines and industrial models echo the themes of extraction in the exhibition while Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the museum’s managing trustee and director, says 'Salt Lines' allows the institution to “engage with the nature of colonial artistic production… including local people who harvested and consumed salt. ”As visitors leave 'Salt Lines', Hylozoic/Desires offer a last thought — a reminder of what the exhibition ultimately attempts: “All we know is that the artist’s work is to research rigorously, and then… enter into the missing gaps of history and the doubt of the future, and imagine how else we can be.”","'Salt Lines' revisits the colonial 4,000km long border of which 2,500km constituted a fence of plants also known as ‘The Great Hedge of India’ Stretching from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and patrolled by thousands of customs staff, the hedge was built by the East India Company and later the British Raj to enforce the salt tax in the mid nineteenth century.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126206642,imgsize-269872,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-2025-12-27t221614743.jpg"

SRINAGAR: A day after Mirwaiz Umar Farooq justified the removal of the “Chairman, All Parties Hurriyat Conference” designation from his X account as a “Hobson’s choice,” People’s Conference chairman and MLA Sajad Lone on Saturday urged people to question the Kashmir chief cleric’s “surrender in lieu of protocol and CRPF security. ”“I visited my constituency, where villagers told me that a young man was arrested for sharing a Facebook post and released after two years, while another was picked up 15 days ago merely for liking a post,” Lone said, adding that in contrast, Mirwaiz modified his X bio to receive “five-star treatment”.Accusing the Kashmiri separatist of double standards, Lone recalled how Hurriyat brass vilified him as an “agency man” after he entered mainstream politics decades ago.“There was intense militancy at the time, and how I am alive today is known only to God,” Lone said. While asserting that he does not seek public vindication, he added, “He (Mirwaiz) should apologise for what was done to me in the past. That is the least he can do.”After removing the Hurriyat chairman designation from X on Thursday, Mirwaiz said on Friday, “I was being pressured by the authorities to make changes to my X handle as Hurriyat chairman, as all constituents of the Hurriyat Conference, including the Awami Action Committee that I head, have been banned under the UAPA.”“At a time when public space and avenues of communication stand severely restricted, this platform remains among the very few means available to me to reach out to my people... Under such circumstances, it is a Hobson’s choice I was left to make,” Mirwaiz said.PDP and National Conference have backed Mirwaiz, calling the removal of bio as a personal choice and condemning the authorities for harassing Mirwaiz.Commenting on the Dec 23 HC judgment dismissing former CM Mehbooba Mufti ’s plea seeking the transfer of Kashmiri political prisoners from jails outside J&K to prisons within the UT, Lone said, “I am convinced Madam (Mehbooba Mufti) is doing drama.”The People’s Conference chief also criticised the growing incidents of harassment of Kashmiris in different parts of the country. “It is eroding the very foundations of national integration and must be treated as a matter of national security... If nothing changes, we will collectively go to Delhi and protest,” Lone said.","Mirwaiz Umar Farooq justified the removal of the “Chairman, All Parties Hurriyat Conference’ designation from his X account as a “Hobson’s choice” People’S Conference chairman and MLA Sajad Lone on Saturday urged people to question the Kashmir chief cleric.

CWC Meet: Top Congress Leaders Huddle Up In Delhi, Discuss Action Against Govt On G RAM G Law

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday targeted the Gandhi–Vadra family, alleging that ""their hate for Dalit is so open."" The charge from the saffron party came shortly after the Congress held a press conference in which party president Mallikarjun Kharge initially said he would not read the full note aloud and would instead circulate it to the media, before being interrupted moments later by the party's general secretary, who urged him to read it out.Sharing a clip of the exchange, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari accused the Congress leadership of disrespecting Kharge. He wrote on X, ""Be it Rahul Gandhi Priyanka Gandhi or Jairam Ramesh, their hate for a 'DALIT' is so open! Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge clearly stated that he would not read the full note and would circulate it to the press instead. Within seconds, Jairam Ramesh cut in and directed him to read it out. And Kharge ji complied. This is how Gandhi - Vadra family treats their own President!""At the press conference, the Congress announced a nationwide protest against the Centre's decision to replace the rural employment scheme MGNREGA with what it called the VB G Ram G Act.Following the Congress Working Committee meeting, Kharge said replacing a scheme named after Mahatma Gandhi amounted to an insult to the Father of the Nation.Meanwhile, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the decision to scrap MGNREGA without consulting relevant ministers or even the Union Cabinet.The LoP also pledged to oppose the move, saying, ""As Kharge ji has said, we are going to resist it. We are going to fight it. And I'm confident that the entire opposition is going to be aligned against this action.""","BJP accuses Congress leadership of disrespecting Mallikarjun Kharge.

He mentioned medical care, transport, internet and mobile services.The visitor compared these with costs in the US. According to Jain, his friend ""pays $600 for mobile and data at his house Pays $30k for health insurance for 4!!

NEW DELHI: The shipping ministry has notified the guidelines for two major shipbuilding initiatives with an outlay of Rs 44,700 crore, aimed at boosting India’s shipbuilding capacity.The two schemes include the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme (SBFAS), with a corpus of Rs 24,736 crore, and Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), with an allocation of Rs 19,989 crore. These schemes are expected to provide a strong policy push to revive shipbuilding activity, attract investments and strengthen India’s maritime ecosystem.Under SBFAS, the government will provide financial assistance ranging from 15% to 25% per vessel, depending on the category of ships built. The scheme offers graded incentives for small normal, large normal and specialised vessels, with disbursement linked to clearly defined construction milestones and backed by security instruments. Incentives for series orders have also been included to encourage scale and efficiency.Under Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), greenfield shipbuilding clusters will receive 100% capital support for common maritime and internal infrastructure through a 50:50 Centre–state special purpose vehicle, while existing shipyards will be eligible for 25% capital assistance for brownfield expansion of critical infrastructure such as dry docks, shiplifts, fabrication facilities and automation systems.“These guidelines create a stable and transparent framework that will revive domestic shipbuilding, boosting forward and backward linkage amping ‘Make in India’ initiative, enable large-scale investment and build world-class capacity, positioning India as a major maritime nation on the path to Viksit Bharat and Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” port and shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal said on Saturday.A key feature of SBFAS is the proposed National Shipbuilding Mission, which will ensure coordinated planning and execution of shipbuilding initiatives. The scheme also introduces a Shipbreaking Credit Note, under which ship owners scrapping vessels at Indian yards will receive a credit equivalent to 40% of the scrap value, linking ship recycling with new ship construction and promoting a circular economy. Over the next decade, SBFAS is expected to support shipbuilding projects worth about Rs 96,000 crore and generate employment.The SbDS focuses on long-term capacity and capability creation, including establishment of an India Ship Technology Centre to support research, design, innovation and skills development. The scheme also includes a Credit Risk Coverage Framework, offering govt-backed insurance for pre-shipment, post-shipment and vendor-default risks to improve project bankability and financial resilience.","The shipping ministry has notified the guidelines for two major shipbuilding initiatives with an outlay of Rs 44,700 crore.

JAMMU: A large number of protesters on Saturday gathered outside Lok Bhavan in Jammu, demanding revocation of the MBBS admission list of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi district.The protesters were mostly activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti, who are up in arms against 42 of the total 50 seats going to Muslim candidates.Waving flags and holding banners, around 250-300 activists shouted slogans against Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha, who is the chairperson of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board as well as SMVDIME, as they struggled to make their way into the Lok Bhavan. A strong police contingent foiled their bid.Later, the protesters were joined by J&K BJP’s women members and several trade leaders, including president of Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries Arun Gupta.Talking to media persons, convener of the Sangarsh Samiti, Colonel Sukhvir Singh Mankotia, said the protest would continue “till the resolution of our genuine demands which are related to our faith”.“We are not against students of any particular religion. We just want the seats in the medical college to be reserved for Hindu students alone,” he said, adding that the selected Muslim students be transferred to other colleges.The controversy erupted after seats for the inaugural MBBS batch of 50 students were filled through the NEET merit list last month. While 42 Muslim candidates, mostly from Kashmir, were selected for admission, only seven Hindu students from Jammu and one Sikh made it to the list.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) has demanded a resolution of the dispute, saying it was possible through the joint efforts of the Centre and Omar Abdullah govt.The party’s J&K unit chief Manish Sahni, in a veiled attack on BJP, said, “Those who are fanning the flames of agitation from behind the scenes are largely responsible for the dispute. Even when Articles 370 and 35A were abrogated in J&K in 2019, no interest was shown in amending the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University Act to prioritise Hindus.”He also demanded that Hindus should be granted minority status in J&K.",Protests outside Jammu Lok Bhavan against MBBS admission list of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence.

Pakistan Embarrassed Globally As Saudi Deports 56000 Beggars Despite No Fly Lists And Warnings

Most Indians deported for staying beyond visa validity

HYDERABAD: Over 24,600 Indians were deported from 81 countries in 2025, as per the latest ministry of external affairs data tabled in Rajya Sabha. It wasn't the US but Saudi Arabia that recorded the highest deportations - over 11,000 in 12 months.While in comparison, only 3,800 Indians - mostly private employees - were deported from the US in 2025, these numbers are the highest recorded from the country in the last five years, the report says. Experts attribute it to the recent crackdown and increased scrutiny of documents, visa status, work authorisation, overstays, etc, by the Trump administration.Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234).Countries that saw a significant number of deportations of Indians include Myanmar (1,591), UAE (1,469), Bahrain (764), Malaysia (1,485), Thailand (481), and Cambodia (305). According to latest MEA data, common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers, and involvement in civil or criminal cases.""This is a pattern with Gulf countries, which see a large migration of workers from India who either take up jobs as labourers in the construction sector, become caregivers, or work as househelp. Most of them are low-skilled workers who migrate through agents and, in many cases, in an attempt to earn extra money, end up involved in minor offences,"" said Bheema Reddy, vice-chairman of Telangana govt's NRI advisory committee. ""In other instances, lack of awareness about local laws and regulations proves costly,"" he added.In many cases, these migrant workers fall prey to fraud perpetrated by agents back home and are deported once caught by police abroad.Deportations from countries like Myanmar and Cambodia, however, follow a different pattern. ""Most of these are linked to cyber slavery. These countries have emerged as major hubs of a multi-billion dollar cybercrime industry where Indians are lured with promises of high-paying jobs but are later trapped, forced to work in illegal operations, and eventually detained and deported,"" Reddy explained.It is, therefore, important that workers are made aware of rules before they land on foreign shores, said Naga Bharani of Telangana Overseas Manpower Company. ""People should be told to closely track their visa timelines, and comply with local rules. There is always an option to apply for a visa extension,"" she said. Deportation of Indian students was the highest from UK, with 170 sent home in 2025. This was followed by Australia (114), Russia (82) and US (45).","Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234) Common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126196015,imgsize-86626,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image.jpg"

'If Pakistan Comes in Dowry...': Rajnath Singh Recalls The Humorous Side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee

India's beloved former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained unmarried his entire life, but there was a time when he was proposed to by a woman, a Pakistani woman to be precise.On the late prime minister's 101st birth anniversary on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh narrated the anecdote, recalling Vajpayee's repartee and sense of humour.Singh recalled that during Vajpayee's visit to Lahore, a Pakistani woman reporter proposed to him, inspired by his speech.""I would like to share one incident. Inspired by his speech, a Pakistan i reporter said she was ready to marry him, but sought ceding of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan in Mehr,"" Singh said.Atalji, with a smile on his face, said, 'Madam, I am ready to marry you, but in return, I want Pakistan as dowry,"" Singh said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.Vajpayee definitely had a way with his words. He was admired for his oratory skills across parties and was an accomplished poet known for his patriotic and humanist compositions.Once, when a supporter urged him to remain ""atal"" (unshakeable), Vajpayee quipped back playfully, with, ""Atal toh hoon, lekin Bihari bhi hoon!"" (“I am Atal, but I am also a Bihari!”).Vajpayee travelled to Lahore by bus in 1999 and embraced Pakistan’s then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, a gesture that came to symbolise hope for better ties between the two neighbours.However, the bonhomie did not last long. Just months later, the Pakistan Army carried out a covert operation to send troops into the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir, triggering a limited conflict that Pakistan ultimately lost.Rashtra Prerna Sthal was inaugurated by PM Modi on Thursday and has been developed as a landmark national memorial and inspirational complex of enduring national significance. Constructed at an approximate cost of Rs 230 crore and spread across an expansive area of 65 acres.","'If Pakistan Comes in Dowry...': Rajnath Singh Recalls The Humorous Side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

JAIPUR: Over 1,230 mining leases, most of them disputed, continue to exist across Rajasthan's Aravali region. Together, these leases cover 17,393 hectares within the Aravali system.""At present, most leases in the Aravalis are under dispute and pending before courts. Some mines are closed, while others continue to operate,"" a senior mining official said.Incidentally, Rajasthan mining department was considering a proposal to lease out additional pits for excavation in the Aravalis but the Centre invoked a blanket ban on the grant of new mining leases in the mountain range following public outcry over a proposed ""new definition"" of one of the world's oldest mountain ranges.An official source said, ""The mining department issued notifications for 126 new leases in Nov 2025. Of these, 50 are located within Aravali districts, while 76 fall outside the Aravali region.""District-wise data highlights the scale of concentration, with Rajsamand district alone accounting for over 540 leases. Udaipur follows with 162 leases and Jaipur has 139. Alwar, Sirohi, and Bhilwara together account for over 250 leases, reflecting how deeply mining has penetrated the Aravali belt.Mining expert Pradeep Singh said the new ban does not cancel existing permissions retrospectively, allowing hundreds of leases to continue, particularly in Rajasthan. ""In many areas where leases are operational, environmental degradation is visible and, in several places, irreversible. Hills have been hollowed out, forest cover has thinned, and natural drainage systems have been disrupted,"" he said.Across Rajasthan, the mining footprint extends far beyond the Aravalis. The state has 16,116 mining leases, of which around 10,060 are operational, along with nearly 18,000 quarry licences.Mining expert Kishore Kumawat said area-wise data within the Aravali region shows Udaipur accounting for 6,084 hectares under mining, followed by Sojat with 2,575.4 hectares, Bhilwara with 1,229 hectares, and Rajsamand with nearly 800 hectares.","Over 1,230 mining leases, most of them disputed, continue to exist across Rajasthan's Aravali region. Most leases in the Aravalis are under dispute and pending before courts. Rajsamand district alone accounts for over 540 leases, Udaipur follows with 162 leases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126211117,imgsize-1546249,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-19.jpg"

AGRA: Back in his hometown in Agra’s Bah to a grand reception on Saturday after receiving the prestigious Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar from President Droupadi Murmu in Delhi, Ajay Raj Nishad (9), who on July 25 saved father Vir Bhan from the jaws of a large crocodile in the Chambal, said, “I was afraid for my life too. But at that moment, the only thing that came to my mind was how to save my dad.”On that July afternoon, armed with only a long stick, the thin and diminutive 9-year-old boy struck the predator’s eye, forcing it to release his father and retreat back into the waters. And the child’s act of bravery was not just noticed by Bah’s residents, but it also went right up to the corridors of power in the national capital.In Delhi, inspired by his brief interaction with PM Narendra Modi at the award ceremony, the Class IV stud-ent, while dedicating the honour to his grandmother, Ratna Devi, said, “I want to join defence forces and serve the nation in the future... I want to protect my country the way I protected my father.”The award honours extraordinary accomplishments in various categories. Ajay was awarded in the category of ‘bravery’.His father, Vir Bhan, told TOI: “I’m a small-time labourer and also rear a few goats. On July 25, I, along with my children — Ajay and my daughter — took our goats out for grazing. It was around 2pm, I felt thirsty and went to fetch water from the river.To my horror, a full-grown crocodile moved towards me and before I could react, it grab-bed my right leg and tried to pull me into the water.”“Ajay quickly picked up a long stick and hit the crocodile at least 15 times. But it had little impact on the reptile. Then he struck the crocodile in the eye... It all happened within a few seconds. I thought that I was gone that day. I am alive today only because of my 9-year-old son,” Vir said, showing the months-old scar on his leg. The 37-year-old added that he had lost his wife a few years ago and his children were being raised by their grandmother.Back home, Ajay has become a local hero with people from neighbouring villages streaming in to catch a glimpse of him. Fatehpur Sikri MP Rajkumar Chahar also met the child and awarded him Rs 51,000.","Ajay Raj Nishad, 9, saved father Vir Bhan from the jaws of a large crocodile in the Chambal on July 25.

Aravalis would lose continuity and integrity, amicus had argued

NEW DELHI: As the controversy over its November 20 order on the Aravali hills refuses to die down and environmentalists and citizens oppose the verdict, Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the issue and registered a case which will be taken up on Monday.The cause list put up on the Supreme Court website says suo motu civil case regarding 'Definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges and Ancillary Issue' will be taken up by a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices J K Maheshwari and A G Masih.The apex court, in its Nov ruling, had accepted the expert committee's definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges in the context of mining as any landform located in the Aravali districts having an elevation of 100m or more, measured from the local relief. Aravali Range has been defined as two or more Aravali Hills, located within 500m from each other.The definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges was given by a committee comprising secretary, MoEFCC; secretaries of the department of forests of NCT, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat; a representative from Forest Survey of India, central empowered committee, Geological Survey of India and joint secretary, MoEFCC.Raising questions on SC's ruling, environmentalists alleged that it would lead to massive mining as the activity would be allowed on hills with height less than 100m.During the hearing of the case, senior advocate K Parameshwar, who was assisting the court as amicus, had objected to the definition and contended that all hills below 100m would be opened up for mining and as a result the Aravali Hills and Ranges would lose their continuity and integrity. ""If the definition as suggested by the Committee is accepted, it would totally endanger the environment and ecology of the mountains,"" he had submitted, which was also incorporated in the order.Against his submission, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati had contended that if the definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges as suggested by the FSI (slope of 3 degree or more) is accepted, it would exclude large areas. If the definition suggested by the committee is adopted, she submitted, a larger area would be included as part of Aravali Hills and Ranges.","Aravali Range has been defined as two or more Aravali Hills, located within 500m from each other.

'MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan': Congress Announces Nationwide Protest Against VB-G RAM G Act

NEW DELHI: BJP Saturday seized upon the disclosure made by Sam Pitroda, head of the overseas wing of the party and part of Nehru-Gandhi family's inner circle, that Congress is a member of the George Soros-linked Global Progressive Alliance and that Rahul Gandhi is part of its presidium saying that it fully explains why the LoP has become the permanent spokesperson of anti-India global forces within Indian politics.At a presser, BJP s Sudhanshu Trivedi pointed to Pitroda's remarks to a channel confirming Congress's membership of the global conglomerate of left-leaning parties with links to the controversial billionaire hedge fund operator, and said that it has confirmed what BJP had maintained about real cause of Rahul's frequent foreign visits.Pitroda was responding to a question about Rahulchoosing to visit Germany and skipping the passage of the legislation for substituting MNREGA. Pitroda justified Rahul's absence by saying it was necessary because of Congress's membership of GPA.Trivedi flagged Pitroda's answer to say that it speaks about priorities of Congress.""If Pitroda and Congress do not care about this, then they must answer whom do they care or?""The RS MP referred to Soros's statements against Modi govt and his mission of regime change to ask: ""Rahul travels abroad, but why does he always meet anti-India organisations and anti-India individuals? Why does he never meet India-supporting institutions, India-friendly think tanks, industry leaders, parliamentarians, or thought leaders? Congress must answer this before the nation.""Trivedi said that on one hand, Rahul objected to not getting a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but during his Germany visit he shared the stage of the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung an organisation declared illegal by Russia and expressed anti-India statements.Trivedi remarked that even before this, Sonia Gandhi was found to be the co-chairman of Forum for Democratic Liberties Asia Pacific, and even today, she holds that post. ""This organisation was also funded by George Soros"".""When Pitroda was asked what connection the Global Progressive Alliance has with Congress, he reveals that Rahul Gandhi is a member of its presidium, and Sam Pitroda is also its member."" Trivedi said that Pitroda has claimed that it is an alliance of democracies of 110 countries.

Apart from this, there are 30-40 countries that have monarchies, and if these are excluded, number of democratic countries falls below 100.

Unnao Rape Convict Kuldeep Sengar's Bail Triggers Protests In Delhi, Victim’s Mother Demands Hanging

CBI: HC ignored MLA vested with public trust, authority

NEW DELHI: Invoking Supreme Court 's verdict in L K Advani case in which it was ruled that anyone who holds public office, like MPs or MLAs, would be deemed a public servant, CBI has told Supreme Court that Delhi high court erred by declaring that Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an MLA when the offence was committed, was not a public servant to be prosecuted under Pocso and granted him bail.A vacation bench will take up CBI's plea Dec 29.Seeking quashing of HC's order, CBI said when lawmakers can be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act for being a public authority, then they should be deemed public servants to be prosecuted under Pocso.HC had ruled that Sengar's case was not covered under Section 5(c), which talks about aggravated penetrative sexual assault.The provision says the offence becomes severe when penetrative sexual assault is committed by specific individuals like police officers, armed forces, public servants, or staff of educational institutions/hospitals, leading to stricter penaltiesCBI said, “The HC failed to consider that a sitting MLA, by virtue of holding a constitutional office, is vested with public trust and authority over the electorate and that such position carries heightened responsibility arising from duties owed to the state and society… It has erred in law by failing to adopt a purposive interpretation that advances the object and intent of the Pocso Act…”It said HC “failed to correctly appreciate the judgment of this Hon’ble Court in the case of L K Advani v CBI wherein the accused MLA was held to be a public servant within the meaning of Section 2 (c) (viii) of Prevention of Corruption Act…”“It is submitted that the offences under Section 5(c) of the Pocso Act are of greater gravity than corruption offences by MP’s/MLA’s… The legislature has therefore provided for stringent mandatory penalties, protective procedural safeguards, and enhanced liability for persons in positions of trust or authority, reflecting the higher societal interest in protecting the vulnerable over abstract institutional harm,” the appeal said.“A comprehensive and meaningful reading of section 5(c) the Pocso Act leads to an irrefutable conclusion that it seeks to punish exploitation and sexual abuse of children from public servants, owing to use of their power, position or status be it political or otherwise,” it said.CBI said a life convict can be given the benefit of suspension of sentence only if, prima facie, the conviction appears unsustainable and there is a high chance of success in appeal. “Mere long incarceration or delay in hearing the appeal, by itself, does not automatically justify suspension in heinous offences; courts must balance individual liberty with societal interest and the gravity of the crime,” it said.","CBI: Delhi high court erred by declaring that Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an MLA when the offence was committed, was not a public servant to be prosecuted under Pocso.

Shimla Hospital Assault: Doctors’ Strike Cripples OPDs, Surgeries Across Himachal Pradesh

SHIMLA: Healthcare services, except emergency care, were disrupted across govt hospitals in Himachal Pradesh on Saturday after doctors went on indefinite strike, demanding the immediate reinstatement of Dr Raghav Nirula, who was sacked for assaulting a patient at Shimla's Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) on Dec 22.There's a video of Nirula brutally thrashing the patient, who is also seen kicking him while lying in bed, but RDA says Nirula's side of the story hasn't been considered and the termination is unjust.RDA president Dr Sohail Sharma called Nirula's termination a ""humiliation of the medical fraternity"". Doctors will not resume work until govt reverses the decision, he said. ""We accept that there was misconduct, for which the doctor was suspended within six hours. However, terminating him within 48 hours based on the disciplinary committee's report is not justified,"" Dr Sharma said.Patients and their attendants visiting IGMC and Atal Institute of Medical Super Specialities (AIMSS) at Chamiyana, in Shimla, faced hardship due to doctors' absence. Several surgeries scheduled for Saturday had to be postponed.Health and family welfare minister Col Dhani Ram Shandil (retd) said the issue would be resolved soon.He added that he would call the doctors for discussions once the CM returned from Delhi. ""I always say doctors should not let anger take over. If they had quietly met the chief minister and apologised, saying it happened in a moment of passion, perhaps the entire matter could have been resolved,"" he said.The minister assured that steps were being taken to ensure patients did not face inconvenience. Emergency services would continue as usual, and reports were being compiled on doctors attending duty, he added.Jagat Ram (70), a resident of Gadakufar, in Theog tehsil of Shimla district, said his prostate surgery scheduled at AIMSS-Chamiyana on Saturday was postponed. ""Doctors advised me not to eat anything after 11 pm yesterday. But this morning, I was told the surgery could not be performed until the strike ends,"" he said.The directorate of medical education and research issued SOPs to ensure uninterrupted emergency healthcare services.",Healthcare services disrupted across govt hospitals in Himachal Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: A CWC meeting to map out the party's programmes to corner govt was overshadowed by inner turmoil after senior neta Digvijaya Singh praised the organisational strength of the RSS-BJP, citing how it enabled PM Modi 's rise from the grassroots to the top.Singh's remarks, made on social media timed with the meeting, appeared aimed at highlighting the need for organisational reforms within Congress . The post delighted BJP and raised eyebrows within the party, as Singh lauded the RSS-BJP system for allowing a ground-level worker to rise to CM and PM.At the CWC meeting, the former MP CM rued ""over-centralisation"" in Congress and pushed for decentralisation in the presence of top leadership, remarks that observers read with his X post in which he had said Rahul can do it but it is not easy to ""convince"" him.The post featured a 1990s photograph of Modi sitting on the ground while senior BJP netas, including L K Advani, sat on chairs at a meeting. Singh wrote that it was ""very impressive"" how an RSS volunteer and Jana Sangh-BJP worker rose to the highest offices, calling it the ""strength of organisation"". In another take, Singh warned that there are ""sleeper cells"" in the party, which need to be identified.BJP seized on the comments to target Congress leadership. Spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi said BJP's system recognises a ""gudri ke laal"" like Modi, while Congress focuses on ""Jawahar ke laal"".He said BJP's working style allows people connected to the ground to rise through talent and organisational support.Targeting Rahul, Trivedi said Singh was not the first to question his understanding, recalling former US President Barack Obama's description of Rahul in his memoir as having a ""nervous, uninformed quality"". He said while Modi rose from the bottom and took BJP to the top, Congress' ""top-down"" leadership was taking the party downward.As his comments triggered a storm, Singh clarified that he had merely praised the organisational strength of Sangh Parivar. ""I was, am and will be a trenchant critic of the RSS and Modi,"" he said, asking whether strengthening an organisation was a bad thing.In the CWC meeting, sources said Singh criticised govt's bid to undo decentralisation under MGNREGA through changes in the law and pressed for decentralisation within Congress. He complained that district and state chiefs were appointed by AICC and questioned why decisions taken at Udaipur Chintan Shivir, including setting up an election management department, had not been implemented.","Digvijay Singh's remarks appeared aimed at highlighting the need for organisational reforms within Congress.

NEW DELHI: Calling ""decimation of MGNREGA "" a one-man decision of PM Modi like demonetisation, Congress brass of Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi announced a nationwide campaign from January 5 to force the government to restore the job guarantee scheme.They argued the disbanding of the job scheme will devastate the rural economy, seriously hurt the SC/ST/OBC/women/minorities/poor, burden the states, and divert the money to billionaires like Adani.The announcement came after a marathon meeting of Congress Working Committee that discussed the Modi government's contentious replacement of MGNREGA with VB-GRAMG.After discussing the issue over three hours, the CWC members read out a five-point pledge that Congress ""vows to lead a MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan from January 5, 2026... to oppose by all democratic means possible the attempt to convert the rights of the workers to a government dole"".Following up on the elaborate brainstorming, Congress fielded its top duo of Kharge and Rahul to brief the press in a bid to send out a message of intent that would resonate beyond the party circles. Rahul expressed confidence that entire opposition will be united in the future course of action to seek restoration of MGNREGA.""Those dependent on MGNREGA are angry. That anger will cost this govt heavily. Remember, the government had to take back the three farm laws after the way the farmers and the opposition fought against them,"" Kharge warned.Rahul said MGNREGA was ""destroyed singlehandedly by the PM"" without studying the matter. ""I am told the PMO took this decision, even the minister and the Cabinet were not asked,"" he alleged, calling the move as reflective of ""one man show"" of present times in which ""Modi does whatever he wants to do"".""It will benefit Adani in full measure. That is the purpose of this - to take money from the poor and hand it to people like Adani,"" he said.CWC also discussed SIR, and Kharge spoke about the nexus between the BJP and the EC. It was said that party units and BLAs should take care that the votes of marginalised communities are not deleted.Kharge mocked the Modi government's claims to have made India the fourth largest economy, in which Adani, Ambani can take unlimited money as bank loans, but govt could not bear 30% of the MGNREGA budget that has now been shifted to the states under the new law. He said the extra financial burden will stall development work in states.","Congress brass of Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi announced a nationwide campaign from January 5 to force the government to restore the job guarantee scheme.

Bangladesh Unrest: Another Hindu Man Lynched; Police Claim Extortion Bid





LONDON: A protest by Hindus over the lynching of Dipu Das and general persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh outside the Bangladesh high commission in London was met with a counter-protest by Khalistanis on Saturday.More than 500 protesters, mostly Bangladeshi and Indian-origin Hindus shocked by the brutal lynching of garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das on Dec 18 in Mymensingh, joined the protest and shouted “Hindus Lives Matter”.They carried placards calling for justice for Das, for minorities to be saved, and raising the incarceration of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das.A digital van drove around with flashing images that read “Hindus have right to live.”The protest, organised by Bengali Hindu Adarsha Saangha (UK), was peaceful. Protesters stood behind barriers, on the opposite side of the road to the mission.Then around 10 men arrived directly in front of the high commission holding yellow Khalistani flags, shouting anti-India and anti-Hindu slogans, and praising the recently assassinated extremist Sharif Osman Hadi . Police then arrived to keep the two sides apart.One of the organisers, Prajjwal Biswas, from West Bengal, said, “I don’t know why Khalistanis are protesting as this is not their cause.They are trying to instigate us.”Bangladesh-born Shuchishmita, whose wider family still live in Bangladesh, said, “The persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh is something that has been going on for centuries and no media speaks about it. I am here to ask for justice for the Hindu community. We shouldn’t tolerate what is happening.”Vikram Banerjee, a British PIO whose family migrated from then East Pakistan to India, said: “We want India and the UK to take assertive action.

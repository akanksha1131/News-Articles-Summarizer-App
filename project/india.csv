NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday strongly objected to recent remarks by Goa CM Pramod Sawant on the Mahadayi river water project, calling them an “insult to the people of Karnataka. ”Siddaramaiah said that Karnataka would fight “legally, politically, and morally until Karnataka gets its rightful share” in the project.""The Goa CM’s remark on the Mahadayi project is an insult to the people of Karnataka. Why hasn’t the Union government officially communicated any concerns? Is this how federalism works under BJP? Backdoor sabotage, silence, and betrayal? What crime have Kannadigas committed? Are we being punished for not surrendering to the BJP?"" he posted on X.“Mahadayi is not for luxury or waste, it is for the drinking water needs of North Karnataka. For decades, our people have waited for justice,” he added.The remarks came after Sawant told the Goa Assembly that Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav had assured him the Centre would not, under any circumstances, clear the Mahadayi project — also known as the Kalasa-Banduri project.Karnataka law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil also strongly responded to Sawant’s statement, saying the Goa CM's comments on the project have come as a ""shock"" to Karnataka.Patil urged the Centre to immediately grant approval for the project, keeping in mind the interests and needs of the people and farmers of the region.“Despite no judicial hindrances, Karnataka faces unnecessary obstacles in implementing legitimate, legal, and constitutionally protected projects, which is unjust in a federal system,” said Patil.Karnataka had initially sought to divert 7.6 tmc ft of water from the Kalasa-Banduri project to the Malaprabha basin. However, while permitting the inter-basin diversion, the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal sanctioned only 3.9 tmc ft.Karnataka later submitted a proposal to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) seeking clearance to proceed with the project. The Goa government objected, citing that 10.6 hectares of forest land involved in the project falls within the Kali and Sahyadri tiger reserve zones.NTCA recommended use of this forest area on January 23, 2024.Water from the Kalasa and Banduri nalas feeds into the Mahadayi River, which originates near Kanakumbi village in Khanapur taluk of Belagavi district, Karnataka. After flowing around 29 km within Karnataka, the river enters Goa, where it is known as the Mandovi.","Siddaramaiah said that Karnataka would fight “legally, politically, and morally until Karnataka gets its rightful share’ The remarks came after Sawant told the Goa Assembly that Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav had assured him the Centre would not, under any circumstances, clear the Mahadayi project.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122872263,imgsize-987905,width-400,resizemode-4/122872263.jpg"
From class struggle to Samajik Samrasta: How BMS redefined India’s trade union politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-class-struggle-to-samajik-samrasta-how-bms-redefined-indias-trade-union-politics/articleshow/122871648.cms,"Union Minister Mansukh L. Mandaviya addresses the 70th Foundation Day programme of the 'Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh'

NEW DELHI: As the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) celebrates its 70th anniversary, the highlight is its rise as India’s largest trade union — a position secured by eclipsing Left-leaning organisations like Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), which once dominated India’s labour movement. Rooted in the RSS ’ philosophy of “samajik samrasta” (social harmony), the BMS has consistently rejected class conflict in favour of cooperation, a theme RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat amplified in his address that blended pride, caution and a global vision.“This saffron flag was once dismissed as unsuited for India’s labour landscape. Today, it is not just fluttering but commanding attention across the world,” Bhagwat declared. Framing the union’s seven-decade journey as a vindication of the RSS’s worldview, he added: “After 70 years of sacrifice and effort, we have become the largest trade union in the country and a significant one globally. But this is not the time for complacency. ”Founded in 1955 by Dattopant Thengadi under the guidance of RSS Sarsanghchalak M S Golwalkar, the BMS was the last of India’s central trade unions to be formed but swiftly overtook its older rivals. Its rallying cry — “Desh ke hit mein karenge kaam, kaam ke lenge poore daam” (We shall work in the nation’s interest and earn full wages for it) — underscored its nationalist ethos and helped it carve a space distinct from Left-leaning unions.Rejecting the Marxist notion of class struggle, Bhagwat reiterated the Sangh’s alternative vision: “It is not workers on one side and owners on the other. The industry is a family. When workers and employers both act with responsibility, society benefits.” This philosophy has guided BMS’s engagement over decades, from resisting the Emergency — when over 5,000 activists were arrested — to advocating labour-friendly provisions in the new labour codes, even while distancing itself from policies it deems anti-worker.Calling for “Yuganukul” (era-appropriate) models to meet contemporary challenges, Bhagwat urged BMS to adapt to disruptions like automation and globalisation without compromising its “shashwat vichar” (eternal values). “In our early years, we were like square pegs forced into round holes. But the time has come to shape a system that reflects our ideology,” he said, highlighting the need to modernise without abandoning core principles. On the impact of technology, Bhagwat cautioned that while innovation and machines are inevitable, they must serve humanity and not displace it. “Technology should assist human workers, not replace them. The dignity of labour must remain central even in an age of artificial intelligence,” he added, signalling concerns about the social costs of unchecked technological adoption.Politically, BMS has positioned itself as a constructive force, eschewing frequent strikes for dialogue and negotiation. It has taken a policy of “responsive cooperation” with successive governments, including under Narendra Modi, and yet asserted its independence when needed.Bhagwat’s tone, however, carried an internal warning. “An organisation gains prestige when workers embrace anonymity and collective spirit — ‘not I, but thou.’ Success brings its own traps. We must guard against hubris and remember our core purpose,” he cautioned.Seventy years on, the saffron flag that once seemed an unlikely contender in India’s labour movement is now a global symbol, with Bhagwat projecting it as a model for worker movements worldwide. “Countries around the world are studying our methods. We must ensure workers’ interests, industries’ interests, and national interest align for global welfare,” he said, positioning BMS as a standard-bearer for a new vision of labour rooted in Indian ethos.","The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) celebrates its 70th anniversary.

NEW DELHI: Thirty-seven years after he raped an 11-year-old girl in Ajmer district of Rajasthan, Supreme Court Wednesday upheld the conviction of the accused but declared him a juvenile. The court directed the man, now 53 years old, to appear before the Juvenile Justice Board, which can at most send him to a special home for up to three years.The man was convicted in 1993 by additional sessions judge, Kishangarh, and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of five years for rape under Section 376. The trial court's order was upheld by Rajasthan high court in July 2024. The convict did not raise the issue of juvenility, which was pointed out for the first time in SC when he filed an appeal against the conviction and sentence.","Supreme Court upholds conviction of man who raped an 11-year-old girl in Rajasthan.

Ajmer Dargah's 'no liability' notice draws flak from Muslim groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ajmer-dargahs-no-liability-notice-draws-flak-from-muslim-groups/articleshow/122870453.cms,"Ajmer dargah

AJMER: A public notice issued by the nazim (chief executive officer) of Ajmer Dargah disowning responsibility for accidents caused by dilapidated structures within the shrine complex, has triggered widespread anger among Muslim organisations and the community's religious heads.The notice, dated July 21, was pasted inside Dargah premises, warning devotees to avoid old or structurally weak buildings that may collapse during heavy rains. It stated, ""In case of any accident or untoward incident, the individual will be solely responsible. The nazim office will not accept any legal liability.""The language and tone of the notice have been condemned by organisations from Delhi to Hyderabad, including the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind, All India Muslim Council and the Muslim Progressive Front (Rajasthan). Several groups have demanded an immediate withdrawal of the notice and called on the ministry of minority affairs to launch an inquiry into the matter.TOI texted and called Nazim Bilal Khan for a statement, but received no response. The Ajmer Dargah Committee functions under the ministry of minority affairs and the episode has renewed calls for greater accountability, transparency and professional oversight in the management of India's major religious heritage sites.Sohail Khandwani, managing trustee of Haji Ali and Mahim Dargah in Mumbai, who is currently overseeing renovation work at Haji Ali, expressed dismay: ""I came across the letter. I was shocked to learn that the nazim hasn't even identified which buildings are structurally unsafe, nor have any warning signs been placed. Simply issuing a letter will spark fear among devotees.""The Dargah receives 20,000 devotees on normal days, which jumps up to a lakh on Thursdays and Fridays.Syed Nadeem Hasan Nizami, chief in-charge of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah in Delhi, called the notice a ""hallmark of shamelessness and administrative negligence."" He said, ""Asking devotees to survey the complex, identify weak structures and then decide whether to proceed with ziyarat (visit the shrine) is absurd. What exactly is the Dargah nazim's role then? He should resign. I appeal to PM Narendra Modi to appoint qualified professionals with experience in management, auditing and public safety. ""The notice follows incidents of roof collapse and water seepage in at least three mosques within the Dargah complex in the past week.","A public notice issued by the nazim of Ajmer Dargah disowns responsibility for accidents caused by dilapidated structures.

Jeju Air Crash: Pilots shut off wrong engine; probe finds clear evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/jeju-air-crash-pilots-shut-off-wrong-engine-probe-finds-clear-evidence/articleshow/122811341.cms,"



South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike, a source familiar with the probe said on Monday.The investigation, led by South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), has found that the left engine, which was less damaged, was shut off instead of the right engine, which had been more seriously affected by the bird strike.The source told Reuters that cockpit voice recordings, computer data, and a physical engine switch recovered from the wreckage support this conclusion.""The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,"" the source said, speaking anonymously as the official report has not yet been released.The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operating a flight from Bangkok, crashed while attempting to land at Muan Airport on 29 December 2024. Of the 181 people on board, only two survived, making it the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.An examination of the recovered engines confirmed there were no defects before the bird strike and the crash, according to a government source.Investigators reportedly shared these findings with the victims' families during a private briefing on Saturday.A third source, who was present at the meeting, said the families were told the right engine had suffered greater damage, but the left, less-damaged, engine was shut down instead.The ARAIB has not officially commented on the findings. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, directed queries to ARAIB. Engine manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran, has not responded to requests for comment.Jeju Air said it is actively cooperating with the investigation and is awaiting the official release of the results.While a preliminary report issued in January confirmed the presence of duck remains in both engines, it did not specify the extent of damage. A scheduled media briefing on Saturday was cancelled after victims’ families objected to the report being made public, saying it unfairly focused on pilot error and failed to consider other factors.The Jeju Air flight overshot the runway during an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment. The collision caused a fire and a partial explosion, Reuters reported.Victims’ families and the pilots’ union have urged the investigation team to also examine the embankment’s role in the severity of the crash. Aviation experts believe the structure may have contributed to the high death toll.The pilots’ union has criticised ARAIB for “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine, even though bird remains were found in both engines. The union accused the investigators of making the pilots scapegoats and not providing enough scientific evidence to prove the aircraft could have landed safely with just the left engine running.The union also said the investigation has so far failed to address possible organisational responsibility. A group representing the bereaved families added that the language in the planned press release made it appear as if a final conclusion had already been reached. They have called for all facts surrounding the crash to be fully examined and clarified.Under international aviation rules, a final accident report is expected within a year of the incident.","South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike.

NEW DELHI: As India gear up for a must-win fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has weighed in with his predicted playing XI, calling for Sai Sudharsan’s return and expressing doubts over Karun Nair’s place in the side.With India trailing 1-2 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, the team’s selection decisions ahead of Wednesday’s Test have become a major talking point — particularly in light of Nitish Reddy’s injury and doubts over pacers Akash Deep and Arshdeep Singh.On his YouTube channel, Sidhu endorsed a lineup that included Sudharsan, dropped after a modest debut (0 and 30) in the first Test, and left out since.“Karun Nair is a promising cricketer, but his technical weakness has been exposed,” said Sidhu. “When you think of winning, I ask — what is the fault of Sai Sudharsan?”He hailed Sudharsan’s recent domestic and IPL form, saying, “You have one of the most promising players in India. He’s technically sound — low gravity, hand-eye coordination, and head over toe. Why shouldn’t he be in the team?”He also showered praise on Mohammed Siraj, calling him the unsung hero of India’s pace unit: “Siraj has bowled over 900 overs since 2020.He’s played 25 out of 27 overseas games. Controlled pace in England is key — and Siraj brings that in abundance.”Meanwhile, skipper Shubman Gill backed Nair, saying: “He didn’t bat at his number in the first game. We’ve had conversations with him, and he will turn it around.”With the series on the line and India’s middle order under the scanner, the final XI remains to be seen.",Former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu predicts India XI for fourth Test against England.

"Court says relationship consensual, grants bail to Mumbai school teacher",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-says-relationship-consensual-grants-bail-to-mumbai-school-teacher/articleshow/122868580.cms,"Representational image

MUMBAI: In a detailed order granting bail to a 40-year-old teacher from a prominent Mumbai school arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a male student, a special Pocso court said that there is evidence from both sides showing that subsequently there was a consensual relationship between them. Noting the victim was over 17 years old, special judge Sabina A Malik said, ""As the accused resigned from the school, the relationship of a teacher and student no longer existed and hence, the influence is diluted."" The judge further mentioned that the trial will take time to commence and in the meantime, nothing fruitful would be gained by keeping the accused behind bars.The victim opposed the bail plea, submitting that if the woman is released on bail, she will once again find ways to manipulate, intimidate, threaten and harm his life, and she will also tamper with the evidence. However, the judge said, ""The potential risk to the victim, if any, could be catered to by imposing necessary terms and conditions. The apprehension of the prosecution can be taken care of by imposing stringent conditions on the applicant (accused),"" the judge said.Imposing conditions on the release, the judge said the accused must not meet, contact or threaten the victim in any manner. She is forbidden from directly or indirectly inducing, threatening or promising anything to any witness or the victim.The judge said breach of any of these conditions will result in immediate bail cancellation.The maximum punishment attracted in the case is imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. The woman, who resigned from the school last year, was arrested on June 29. She said she is working in a different field now. The prosecution also opposed the bail, referring to the mental trauma suffered by the minor.Seeking bail, the woman's defence lawyers, Neeraj Yadav and Deepa Punjani, submitted that the case against her is ""false and fabricated and motivated."" It was also submitted that her grounds for arrest were provided solely in Marathi, a language she does not comprehend. She alleged that the grounds were never translated for her and that she was merely instructed to sign them, thereby failing to satisfy the mandate of the Constitution.","A 40-year-old teacher from a prominent Mumbai school was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a male student.

NEW DELHI: In a boost to India's military capabilities close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, the crucial Mudh airfield project in the high-altitude Nyoma area in eastern Ladakh is all set to be completed by Oct.The upgrade work by (BRO) at the airfield, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, included extending and strengthening the original airstrip into a 2.7km 'rigid pavement' runway with a dispersal area and turning pads, among other things.The Rs 230 crore upgrade will allow operations by all kinds of fixed-wing aircraft like heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. ""The runway, with 46m width, is fully ready. The allied infrastructure, including the ATC complex, hangar, crash bay, watch towers, accommodation and the likes, is also more or less complete,"" an official told TOI.""Nyoma will prove crucial as a forward staging ground for troops deployed in the region and transporting supplies quickly to them. The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026, though high altitude will be a limiting factor, much like what Chinese air force faces across LAC,"" he said.China, in fact, has systematically worked over the last five years to offset terrain constraints at its airbases facing India due to high altitude and rarefied air, which limits weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.With new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities, China has managed to deploy additional jets, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones, at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports along the 3,488km LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.India is trying to play catch-up. Located about 35km from LAC, Nyoma will be another operational base for IAF in Ladakh after the Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground). Nyoma was reactivated as an ALG when a medium-lift AN-32 transport aircraft first landed there in Sept 2009. The upgrade project began during the military confrontation with China that erupted after the People's Liberation Army made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.In addition to strengthening the capacity of existing airbases to handle more aircraft, India has progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Fukche and DBO in Ladakh, as well as Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh) of LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.",Mudh airfield project in the high-altitude Nyoma area in eastern Ladakh is all set to be completed by Oct.

Poll How do you feel about the current state of traffic management in Delhi during heavy rains? Much improved, it flows smoothly. Still chaotic, needs more work.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday hailed the Rekha Gupta-led Delhi government after ""traffic moved smoothly"" despite heavy rain at Minto Bridge which was first to flood every time.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared visuals of Minto Bridge, where vehicles were seen crossing without any hassle.""Despite heavy rain, traffic moved smoothly at Minto Bridge, once the first to flood with even a drizzle. That’s the change Delhi is witnessing under the BJP government in just a few months! From waterlogged roads to smooth flow, from chaos to order — a real transformation has begun,"" Malviya said in a social media post on X.""Delhi will now become the capital India truly deserves. Arvind Kejriwal had reduced it to a dustbin. BJP is cleaning up the mess and rebuilding the future.""The underpass, situated at the junction of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg and Connaught Place, is infamous for waterlogging every monsoon season. The issue gained national attention in 2020 when a 56-year-old man died after his mini-truck became submerged during a heavy downpour at the same location. In response, the government initiated new protocols to prevent similar incidents, but recurring waterlogging suggests these measures remain inadequate.Meanwhile, several low-lying areas in the capital reported knee-deep water following the downpour.Waterlogging and traffic disruptions affected several parts of Delhi, including South Delhi, South East Delhi, North Delhi, ITO, South Extension, NH-8, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, Nehru Place, East of Kailash, Colony Road, and several other areas.The Aam Aadmi Party accused the government of making false claims in the media about tackling the problem of waterlogging.""After the rain this morning, the road (NH-24) in the Western Vinod Nagar area is completely waterlogged. CM Rekha Gupta ji, where is your proper planning? You made grand claims in the media about tackling waterlogging, but today the whole of Delhi is submerged, and you're relaxing in your grand palace,"" AAP said in a social media post.""The public is now swimming on the streets and inviting all BJP leaders to join them for a swim,"" it added.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Safdarjung — the primary weather station of the national capital — recorded 5.6 mm of rainfall between 5:30 am and 8:30 am, while other stations reported higher amounts: Pragati Maidan recorded 16.6 mm, Pusa 10 mm, Janakpuri 9.5 mm, and Najafgarh 2 mm.Authorities have advised residents to stay indoors, avoid travel, follow traffic updates, stay away from electric poles and wires, and avoid sheltering under trees.The IMD has warned of continued rainfall over the coming days. The forecast predicts generally cloudy skies with very light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning, for the next seven days.Authorities have urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel and stay updated through official weather and traffic advisories.The minimum temperature was recorded at 25.6 degrees Celsius, 1.7 degrees below normal, while the maximum temperature is expected to settle around 33 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.","BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared visuals of Minto Bridge, where vehicles were seen crossing without any hassle.

As heavy monsoon rains lash several parts of India, a video of a young salesman braving the downpour to reach work has gone viral — sparking conversations around rigid office culture and unrealistic expectations from employees.The clip shows the salesman riding his bike in the rain without proper clothing, sarcastically narrating his ordeal. “I am going to work. I work in sales. The target has to be met. So I am going for sales,” he says, drenched, yet composed. “I am waterproof, friends. I am a waterproof person, I cannot get wet. The target must be met. We will sell so much that the company will go up, and we will go down. It will be really fun! The company must have sales. ”His deadpan delivery struck a chord online, resonating with thousands who face similar workplace pressures. The video, while humorous, shines a light on the everyday struggles of corporate employees — especially those denied the option to work from home, even during extreme weather conditions.Some users quickly responded to the video in the comments section. One humorously wrote, “Did you meet the target?” while another quipped, “Sell the company, bro.”A third commented, “There are toxic work scum everywhere.”Amid flooded streets and difficult commutes, the video has turned into a satirical but sharp critique of the expectations many employees face — highlighting the need for more empathetic workplace policies and flexible arrangements during adverse conditions.","A video of a young salesman braving the downpour to reach work has gone viral.

"India develops personnel sphere, completes welding on submersible after 700 trials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-develops-personnel-sphere-completes-welding-on-submersible-after-700-trials/articleshow/122867246.cms,"MATSYA-6000

NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement for India’s Deep Ocean Mission, Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000, designed to carry humans up to 6,000 metres (6km) below the ocean surface, by completing a critical welding process after 700 weld trials.‘Samudrayaan', a project under the Deep Ocean Mission of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), aims to strengthen India’s capabilities in deep-sea exploration. The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), under MoES, collaborated with Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) to design and fabricate the spherical crew compartment. The Deep Ocean mission will allow scientists to explore unexplored deep-sea areas, assess mineral resources like nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements, and study marine biodiversity. The mission is expected to be realised by 2026.Central to the Samudrayaan effort is the creation of a human occupied vehicle (HOV) that can withstand extreme pressure and temperature conditions on the seafloor. “At the heart of the HOV is a titanium personnel sphere, a 2,260mm diameter enclosure with 80mm thick walls, made from a high-strength alloy. Designed by VSSC, the sphere is built to endure pressure up to 600 bar and temperatures as low as -3°C,” Isro said Wednesday.One of the biggest challenges scientists faced in creating this weld lay in the properties of titanium as a metal. While titanium is known for its strength, it can be difficult to weld. The technical challenge was developing a reliable electron beam welding process capable of fusing thick (80-102 mm) titanium plates. Isro’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Bengaluru, took charge of augmenting its welding facility from a 15kW to a 40kW EBW capacity.LPSC developed the process and infrastructure for the welding process and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). While LPSC had the expertise to carry out welding up to 20mm thickness, it augmented the EBW machine from a 15kW rating to 40kW, while also making alterations to the chemical cleaning and handling equipment to accommodate the increased size and mass.Over 700 weld trials were conducted to optimise the process parameters, ensuring high quality and structural integrity. For quality assurance, Isro enhanced its X-ray radiography capability, one of the highest energy levels used in India, allowing detailed non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of the welded joints.The breakthrough came with the successful completion of the first high-penetration weld on the actual sphere hardware. This involved 80mm thick welds over a 7,100mm length, achieved in a continuous 32-minute operation, “a national first in scale and precision” as per Isro.The milestone marks a significant leap for India’s underwater exploration ambitions and brings Matsya-6000 closer to sea trials. Once complete, the vehicle will be among the very few human submersibles in the world capable of reaching such depths, opening new frontiers for deep sea science, resource exploration and technology development.","Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday directly asked BJP and the Modi govt to hold a farewell for Jagdeep Dhankhar, in a move that appeared to be the opposition party's bid to embarrass the governing camp which has given a curt parting to the VP after a sudden breakup in relationship.In a closed-door meeting of the business advisory committee of RS, senior Congress neta Jairam Ramesh conveyed to BJP stalwarts, which included key ministers and leader of the House J P Nadda, that Dhankhar should be given a send-off befitting of the high constitutional position he occupied. The context of his demand was the scheduled farewell on Thursday for RS MPs whose term is ending soon.Ramesh told TOI, ""There is going to be a farewell to the retiring members tomorrow in RS. So, I suggested why not have a farewell for the retired chairman also."" According to him, BJP netas kept mum.The appeal for farewell appeared more of a taunt as BJP and Dhankhar have had a bitter falling out amid indications that the VP resigned after earning the displeasure of the Modi govt for seeking to supersede the removal notice that the govt sponsored in Lok Sabha against Justice Yashwant Varma by entertaining a parallel one by the opposition in RS.His suggestion to suddenly move on the removal notice pending against Justice Shekhar Yadav of Allahabad HC for ""hate speech"" also did not go down well with the BJP brass. Post-resignation, there has been no praise or polite words that are customary for the high officials who leave their positions.Ramesh said, ""A farewell is the minimum courtesy we owe to the chairman who was also the Vice President of India. It is especially so for the govt which appointed him.""Meanwhile, CPM MP John Brittas demanded that the govt clarify the circumstances surrounding Dhankhar's resignation to ""protect the dignity of the second-highest constitutional office and address growing speculation"".

"Pak steeped in terrorism, says India as Islamabad raises J&K in UNSC; US doubles down on ceasefire claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pak-steeped-in-terrorism-says-india-as-islamabad-raises-jk-in-unsc-us-doubles-down-on-ceasefire-claims/articleshow/122869711.cms,"UNSC

NEW DELHI: A “serial borrower” from the IMF, Pakistan is steeped in fanaticism and terrorism, said India at the UN Security Council (UNSC) as Islamabad brought up the Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) issue in an open debate it organised under its July presidency of the Council on peaceful settlement of disputes.The meeting ended with the unanimous adoption of a Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging member-states to effectively utilize mechanisms for pacific settlement of disputes as outlined in the UN Charter Article 33, including “negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration…or other peaceful means of their choice”. The resolution did not name Kashmir or any other issue.In the debate presided over by Pakistan deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the US representative doubled down on President Donald Trump’s ceasefire claims, saying that the US leadership delivered ""de-escalations between Israel and Iran, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and between India and Pakistan”.After Dar raised issues related to J&K and New Delhi’s decision to place the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, Indian ambassador P Harish responded by asserting that it ill behoves a member of the Council to offer homilies while indulging in practices that are unacceptable to the international community.“The Indian Sub-Continent offers a stark contrast in terms of progress, prosperity and development models. On the one hand, there is India which is a mature democracy, a surging economy and a pluralistic and inclusive society.At the other extreme is Pakistan, steeped in fanaticism and terrorism, and a serial borrower from the IMF,” said Harish, adding that zero tolerance for terrorism is one of the fundamental principles that need to be respected while promoting international peace and security.The open debate on unresolved disputes was one of the signature events that Pakistan is organising under its presidency of the Council, the other being the upcoming meeting on UN-OIC cooperation. The resolution on pacific settlement of disputes was generic in nature, as it’s unlikely it would have found unanimous support from the Council by explicitly mentioning or talking about disputes.Pakistan had through the resolution urged full use of all Chapter VI mechanisms of the UN Charter for peaceful resolution of disputes between nations, hoping to spotlight the J&K issue. While Article 33 of the Chapter states that the parties to any dispute shall seek a solution by, among other things, mediation and arbitration, it also says the parties can seek a solution through “other peaceful means of their own choice”. For India, its emphasis on bilateralism in line with the Simla and Lahore Declarations conforms to other peaceful means.In his remarks, Harish highlighted the fact that Chapter begins with a recognition that it is the ‘parties to a dispute’ who must first of all seek a solution by peaceful means of their own choice. “National ownership and consent of parties are central to any efforts to achieve peaceful resolution of conflicts,” he said.Harish also said that there should be a serious cost to states who violate the spirit of good neighbourliness and international relations by fomenting cross-border terrorism, while mentioning the Pahalgam terrorist attack and its condemnation by the Council that underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors to justice.“India launched Operation Sindoor targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), which was focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature. On achieving its primary objectives, a cessation of military activities was directly concluded at the request of Pakistan,” he said.",Pakistan hosted an open debate at the UN Security Council on peaceful settlement of disputes.

Will show people in 'black & white' how BJP is stealing elections: Rahul

NEW DELHI: The opposition offensive against the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls brought Parliament proceedings to a halt for the third successive day on Wednesday, with leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi calling the exercise a BJP ""ploy to steal elections"".Opposition MPs in Lok Sabha raised slogans like ""SIR wapas lo "" and entered the well of the House carrying placards while in Rajya Sabha, the opposition, besides raising the issue, also demanded that Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge be allowed to speak. The govt, amid the din, introduced two sports-related bills in LS. tnnRajya Sabha saw its first adjournment after it met at 11am, and the second at noon. When it assembled for the third time at 2pm, it was adjourned for the day.During a protest by a large contingent of opposition MPs at the main entrance of Parliament over the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls, Congress' Rahul Gandhi raised questions about polling in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka, and said he would show the people and the Election Commission ""in black and white"" how the theft of votes is being done.Congress has unearthed BJP's strategy of election manipulation by studying a sample constituency in Karnataka, Gandhi said.The party spent six months compiling voters' lists in digital format followed by a ""deep dive"", and exposed BJP's strategy of adding new voters there, Gandhi claimed, adding this was done as EC does not provide the list in electronic format, and paper lists cannot be analysed.BJP also ""stole (assembly) elections in Maharashtra, but the opposition has spotted its gameplan"", he said.Amid reports that 52 lakh voters were being dropped in Bihar, Gandhi said, ""It is not just about 52 lakh. It is not just about Bihar, they cheated in Maharashtra. We have asked questions to EC, asked it to show us the voters list, they did not show us the list. We asked for videography, they changed the law. One crore new voters had come in Maharashtra and the election was stolen. Now, they are redoing the system in Bihar, in a new way. Delete the voters and make the voter list afresh. Elections are being stolen in India and that is the reality.""","Opposition MPs in Lok Sabha raised slogans like ""SIR wapas lo "" and entered the well of the House carrying placards.

Sibal seeks urgent hearing before LS admits Varma removal motion

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice B R Gavai on Wednesday recused from hearing a petition by Allahabad high court's Justice Yashwant Varma, who has sought quashing of an in-house inquiry panel report finding him complicit in the sacks of cash discovered at his official residence on the night of March 14 when he was a judge of Delhi HC.""It would not be proper for me (a bench headed by him) to take up the matter as I was part of the administrative processes related to the judge (linked to the cash-in-kothi incident).

The other members of the bench were Justices K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi.Justice Yashwant Varma's counsel Kapil Sibal, who in his YouTube show has already doubted the procedure adopted by the inquiry panel and questioned then CJI Sanjiv Khanna's decision to send the report to the govt along with the recommendation to initiate a removal motion, sought urgent hearing before a bench headed by CJI Gavai a day after the govt garnered signatures of more than 150 Lok Sabha MPs for the removal motion.Probably understanding the need for an expeditious hearing prior to the Lok Sabha speaker admitting the removal motion, Sibal said, ""There is some urgency. Please list the HC judge's petition for hearing. The recommendation for his removal raises some important constitutional issues.""In his social media panel discussion, which included former SC judge Sanjay Kishan Kaul and ex-Delhi HC judge Mukta Gupta, Sibal had said sending the in-house panel report to the govt amounted to mixing politics with a purely constitutional process.Justice Yashwant Varma's writ petition, filed through advocate Vaibhav Niti, has questioned why Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel, who discovered the cash, did not seize it or prepare a 'panchnama' (statement of witnesses in writing corroborating the discovery of cash), which alone could have been admissible evidence.Accusing former CJI Khanna of subjecting him to media trial by uploading ""unsubstantiated"" material against him on the SC's official website, Justice Varma has said principles of natural justice were violated as the then CJI did not grant him a personal hearing after offering him the choice of either resigning or taking voluntary retirement in the wake of the damning report.The May 3 report of the inquiry committee was sent to the President and the PM on May 8 with the recommendation to initiate removal motion.",Chief Justice B R Gavai recused from hearing a petition by Allahabad high court's Justice Yashwant Varma.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over death of five tigers in MM Hills sanctuary last month, Supreme Court on Wednesday sought Karnataka govt's response and asked the Union ministry of environment and forests to frame policy in consultation with states to end human-animal conflict, resulting in such avoidable tragic incidents.Amicus curiae and senior advocate P Parameshwaran placed the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) report before a three-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai and said it was a clear case of human-animal conflict as villagers poisoned a cattle carcass which was consumed by a tigress and her four cubs, resulting in their death. He said many cattle of surrounding villages strayed into the sanctuary and were attacked by wild animals, including tigers. It required robust patrolling by forest staff, but it was not being done as the majority of forest staff were hired by contractors.The contractors did not provide these outsourced forest guards, employed in most tiger reserves and sanctuaries, any weapon or scientific equipment to effectively patrol the sanctuary and protect it from stray cattle and poachers, resulting in such unfortunate incidents, Parameshwaran said.The bench asked additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to ask the MoEF take the initiative by consulting all states and stakeholders to solve this staff issue. Bhati assured the court that it would be done. ""This tragic incident underscores the urgent need for stronger preventive measures, including intensified patrolling, robust surveillance mechanisms like camera traps, community engagement to address human-wildlife conflict, rapid response protocols for carcass monitoring, and stricter enforcement of laws against wildlife poisoning to prevent recurrence of such deliberate killings,"" the CEC said in its report.

NEW DELHI: After a 5-year hiatus, and ahead of a possible visit by PM Narendra Modi to China next month for the SCO summit, India announced resumption of tourist visas for Chinese nationals. Both sides have looked to facilitate people-to-people exchanges to normalise ties and China, which has been keen to resume direct air services, welcomed the decision as a positive move.The Indian embassy in Beijing announced the decision effective July 24 on Weibo, China’s microblogging site, on a day the 2 countries also held another round of diplomatic talks on border affairs, expressing satisfaction with the “general prevalence of peace and tranquillity in the border areas, leading to gradual normalization of bilateral relations”.India and China have had frequent high-level engagements since Modi’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan last year, following the agreement to complete the disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh. The decision to restart tourist visa services for Chinese nationals is the second significant step towards normalisation, after the resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.“This is a positive move. Easing cross-border travel serves the interests of all parties. China will maintain communication and consultation with India to further facilitate travel between the two countries,” said the Chinese foreign ministry.Chinese foreign minister and special representative (SR) for boundary talks Wang Yi is expected to visit India soon for next round of SR talks with NSA Ajit Doval and, with the thaw in ties holding up, Modi himself is likely to visit China for the SCO summit on August 31-September 1. If it happens, this will be Modi’s first visit to the country in 7 years. During his recent visit to China, Jaishankar had said, while citing the complex international situation, that as neighbouring nations and major economies, an open exchange of views and perspectives between India and China is very important.In the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination (WMCC) talks on India-China Border Affairs, according to an Indian readout, the 2 sides agreed to maintain regular exchanges and contacts on issues related to the boundary affairs at the diplomatic and military levels through established mechanisms.The focus was also on the upcoming SR talks for which Wang will be in India. “The two sides also prepared for the next round of the Special Representatives' Talks on the India-China Boundary Question to be held in India later this year,” said the Indian readout. Doval had travelled to China for the last round of SR boundary talks in December, 2024. Doval and Wang had then reiterated the importance of maintaining a “political perspective of the overall bilateral relationship” while seeking a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for settlement of the boundary question, and resolved to inject more vitality into this process.","India and China have had frequent high-level engagements since Modi’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan last year.

Investigators went through witness accounts, reviewed footage from CCTV cameras installed within a 2km radius, and conducted forensic analysis of the area for vehicle movement but failed to find any evidence to support the girl's claims.The girl, who is allegedly traumatised, requires more time to stabilise before providing further details that can help clarify the sequence of events. The teenager was airlifted to AIIMS, Delhi, from AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. She is admitted in the burn ICU at AIIMS, Delhi, and underwent surgery for management of her injuries, hospital sources said Wednesday. Dr Rima Dada, professor in-charge, media cell, AIIMS, Delhi, said the patient was critical and on oxygen support.In the absence of evidence to confirm or refute the girl's claims, police are awaiting her recovery to gather a more accurate account of the case, suggesting the probe might drag on.A witness, who was nearby during the alleged attack, reported not seeing any motorcycle at the time.Initially, the probe focused on the teenager's statement and her mother's complaint, which accused three unidentified men of attacking her with a flammable liquid. However, police are now exploring all possibilities. They have questioned numerous individuals, including acquaintances of the girl, local residents, and those with criminal backgrounds, but are yet to find any concrete lead.Puri SP Pinak Mishra said, ""One must not speculate or attribute motives until the investigation reaches a more advanced stage.

So far, no formal complaint has been lodged from any side,"" he told TOI.Regional nodal security officer of block- 2 project of BCCL, Rajiv Ranjan, also said there is no information of any such incident in the closed underground mine of block-2 project.Health, food and civil supplies and disaster management department minister and Congress MLA, Irfan Ansari accused the BCCL for patronising illegal mining demanding appropriate compensation.He said, ""BCCL needs to be controlled first. They are patronising illegal mining with local mafia by engaging our innocent, poor workers. In case of mishap, they will be called as illegal miners to avoid giving compensation. I urge CM to announce appropriate compensation and take strict action. I will soon take up this matter with him.""State Congress hit out at the Centre as BCCL comes under it. ""The security of the mines is entirely managed by institutions like CCL and BCCL through CISF which is directly under the Centre and the state govt has no control. Coal companies, for their benefit, leave mines insecurely open after mining instead of closing them permanently, promoting illegal mining. This is a centrally orchestrated murder,"" said spokesperson Sonal Shanti.BJP hit back demanding a CBI probe. ""It's a state sponsored deaths and CBI probe should be instituted for such illegal mining and its related deaths. The state govt and local administration is aware about large scale illegal mining but chooses to remain mum,"" said BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo.","At least 12 miners are feared trapped in a caved-in illegal coal mine in Jamunia under Baghmara block, around 40 km from Dhanbad district headquarters. The police, administration and the Bharat Coking Coal Limited said that, so far, they have not found any sign of mine collapse. The alleged incident snowballed into a political brick-batting as both the ruling and coalition parties accused each other over the illegal mining menace in coal belt and the state at large.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122870161,imgsize-161810,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122870161.jpg"

Mission Sudarshan Chakra: Multi-layered air & missile shield integrated with offensive weapons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mission-sudarshan-chakra-multi-layered-air-missile-shield-integrated-with-offensive-weapons/articleshow/123328590.cms,"Mission Sudarshan Chakra

NEW DELHI: Mission Sudarshan Chakra will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, robust command and control posts, reliable land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles and other weapons.The defence shield will, of course, also require effective use of space-based assets for early-warning and tracking threats. Announcing the launch of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra’ just three months after cross-border military hostilities with Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said all important places in India, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035.This indigenously-developed national air and missile defence shield, which will also be integrated with potent counter-offensive weapons, will progressively be expanded, strengthened and modernised with “great intensity” in the coming 10 years, with a system in place to work out strategies to cater for futuristic warfare needs.“Every citizen of the country should feel safe. Whatever technology comes to attack us, our technology should prove to be better than that,” the PM said, adding that the country will move forward towards developing the “powerful weapon system for targeted precise action” like Lord Krishna’s Sudarshan Chakra in the battle of Mahabharata.This announcement comes soon after Pakistan Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir was reported to have recklessly threatened to destroy any dam India builds to impede water flow to his country, while also warning of a nuclear Armageddon.While Modi did not spell out any details, the plan to erect a defence shield, akin to Israel’s `Iron Dome’ (which only has to protect a very small country) and the proposed `Golden Dome’ of the US, will take a lot of doing along with huge funding.The PM’s remarks that Mission Sudarshan Chakra will not only neutralise the enemy’s attack, but will also hit back at the adversary “many times more”, points at the impending expansion of India’s conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles. These new missiles will include the induction of the new 500-km range quasi-ballistic missile Pralay and the 1,000-km range subsonic long-range land-attack cruise missile. The increase in strike range of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from 450-km to 800-km is also on the anvil.The building blocks for the robust air and missile defence shield are already in place. India’s existing integrated multi-layered air defence network, with a mix of Indian and foreign surface-to-air missile systems, had thwarted waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles during Operation Sindoor from May 7-10.Last week, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh had also declared that the IAF’s Russian-origin S-400 air defence system had shot down at least five Pakistani fighters and a large special mission aircraft -- the last at a distance of 300-km -- during the hostilities.Officials say the PM’s announcement is connected to the ongoing development of the indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system, being developed by DRDO under the ambitious Project Kusha, which will have interceptor missiles to hit hostile targets at 150-km, 250-km and 350-km ranges. Phase-1 of this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29, as was first reported by TOI.There could also now be a green signal for the operational deployment of Phase-1 of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, India had also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","Mission Sudarshan Chakra will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Kamba Ramayanam

Do not move from the word to the meaning — move from the meaning to the word. First search for the undertone in the poet’s heart; then explore what the chosen word could mean.”

Realize poems, don’t analyse them.

Poetry is not about dissecting but about integrating.

You don’t have to agree with the poet’s point of view;

Thirukkural

Those who are blessed with eloquence, assess the audience,

Study the words carefully and evaluate the underlying meaning.

At a recent literary festival in Chennai, a celebrated lyricist stirred controversy by interpreting a word from Kambar’sin an unusual way. The verse in question was Vaali’s dialogue to Rama — a moment rich with moral complexity. The wounded king, struck by Rama’s arrow, questions the fairness of being attacked while engaged in combat with his brother. Kambar lets this exchange unfold with grace: Vaali’s probing questions, Rama’s wise answers, and finally, Vaali’s surrender — seeing in Rama not a killer, but his redeemer.In one line, Vaali addresses Rama as a gem and asks,The word Kambar uses —— became the fulcrum of the debate. The lyricist claimed it meant ‘being out of one’s senses’, suggesting that Rama would have escaped punishment murder in such a state. The remark, unsurprisingly, drew outrage.Equally important, however, was the question this episode raised: where should one draw the line when interpreting a poet’s words?The following day,Ilangai Jeyaraj — an eminent scholar and foremost expert in— offered a profound response:He quoted Bharathiyar’s lament that some read epics without ever entering the mind of the creator.From my teachers, I have learned three lessons in the art of reading poetry .The finest poems give us gifts — to the head, the heart, or the soul. To read poetry is to embark on a pilgrimage, not to crack a code. It is the journey where a reader is transformed to a seeker who may walk alone, but whose heart is free and unbound.A poem is not a building where you remove every brick and scaffolding to understand the technicalities. It is a spiritual experience to see how every word and phrase integrate to show us that we are tiny droplets of water in the mighty ocean of life. Poet Billy Collins warns us not to tie poems to chairs and beat them with rubber hoses until they give up their meaning.It is one thing to disagree with a poet; it is another to drag the poet towards your own point of view, twisting words to fit accordingly. What are words, after all, but a container of the soul? Should we be disposing of the food and eating the container?Poetry, at its finest, is a mirror. It shows us what we are. It awakens what is unseen, untouched, and unspoken within us. As Thiru. Ilangai Jeyaraj reminded us, the purpose of epics is to lift human beings from the lowest valleys to the highest peaks — not the reverse.Thiruvalluvar knew well the weight a word can carry. In712, he cautions:","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love.

We will not endure it any further.

Nayara Energy in troubled waters

Russia-backed Nayara Energy, an Indian refinery, faced with European Union sanctions for its procurement of crude from Russia is looking at damage control. Nayara Energy is now sending a shipment to China, a first for India since 2021.According to a Bloomberg report, a shipment of Indian diesel is en route to China, marking the first such delivery since 2021. This development comes as Nayara Energy, which has Russian connections, faces uncertainty in its oil product exports due to new European Union sanctions.The vessel EM Zenith departed from Nayara's Vadinar terminal carrying approximately 496,000 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel on July 18, as reported by Kpler, a port agent document and vessel tracking information gathered by Bloomberg.Also Read | Fresh trouble for Russia-backed Nayara Energy! SBI stops trade & foreign currency transactions of Indian refinery; doesn’t want to risk US tariffs, EU curbs The ship left just before the EU announced sanctions on the Rosneft-supported refinery, as part of its intensified measures against Russian oil commerce. The ship, originally heading to Malaysia, changed course in the Strait of Malacca and remained anchored for approximately 12 days whilst several Nayara cargoes were affected by EU sanctions. The vessel has since changed its destination to Zhoushan, China, the Bloomberg report said.Recent sanctions have created payment difficulties for Nayara, prompting the company to request advance payments or letters of credit before loading fuel shipments. Additionally, the company had to reduce production at its Vadinar refinery due to disruptions in crude oil deliveries.According to Kpler data, this diesel cargo to China marks the first such shipment from India since April 2021, coinciding with improved diplomatic relations between the two Asian countries.Meanwhile, State Bank of India, India’s largest public sector bank, has discontinued processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff increases. According to a source who spoke to ET, this decision was taken to prevent potential US and European Union sanctions. The US administration has implemented a 25% additional tariff on India regarding its Russian crude oil trade.Also Read | ‘China issue more complicated…’: After tariff on India, will Donald Trump impose additional duties on China for Russia oil trade?

She was in court to tell the judges whether she wanted to live with her divorced father or mother.Minutes after a division bench of Justices M S Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan pronounced the order, the girl tried to escape by jumping off the first-floor corridor of Court No 5, clutching a wire. The girl, who suffered injuries due to the fall, was rescued by police and rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Govt General Hospital (RGGGH) in an ambulance stationed in the court.The issue pertains to a complaint made by M K Nair with the Neelankarai police alleging that his daughter was missing. Since considerable time had lapsed and the girl could not be secured, he moved a habeas corpus plea in high court. During the pendency of the petition, the girl was traced and produced before the court.The bench was informed that the girl had gone to her grandmother's house in the Andamans and was residing with her since she did not want to live with either her father or mother, who are divorced and living separately.In view of the wish expressed by the minor girl, the court subjected her to counselling before the Tamil Nadu Mediation and Conciliation Centre on the HC campus.However, the mediation talks failed, and the special counsellor's confidential report submitted to the court recorded that the child may require specialised counselling from a psychiatrist.When the judges interacted with the girl, she said she wanted to live with her mother in the Andamans. ""However, from the confidential report, we are of the view that there would not be a conducive atmosphere for the minor girl to safely reside in the Andamans. Since the girl said that she does not want to live with her father, the only alternative left to us is to direct her to be put in a safety home,"" the court said.The court then directed police to ensure that the girl is safely admitted to Govt Children's Home for Girls, Kellys, Chennai, by Aug 12. ""During her stay there, the petitioner shall accompany his minor daughter and produce her before Dr Venkat, psychiatrist attached to the Institute of Mental Health, Ayanavaram Road, Kilpauk, by Aug 13 and on any other subsequent dates, as specified by the specialist,"" the bench said.""We request Dr Venkat, psychiatrist, to submit an interim report on his evaluation in a sealed cover. The psychiatrist is also at liberty to counsel the father, who has not been living with his daughter for a very long time.It is made clear that the cost of medical fees and other expenses of the minor girl and the petitioner shall be borne by the petitioner.During the stay of the girl at the govt home, her mother/grandmother are at liberty to visit her during the permissible hours,"" the court added and adjourned the hearing to Aug 26.","14-year-old girl tried to escape from police by jumping from the court's first floor on Tuesday.

'Heroes out of traitors'



Malviya shares Indira Gandhi's 'message' on Savarkar's death



What was oil ministry's post



A social media post by the oil ministry marking Independence Day triggered strong reactions from the opposition, with Congress party accusing the PM Modi government of ""distorting history"" and glorifying “traitors” by placing VD Savarkar above Mahatma Gandhi Taking potshots at the petroleum ministry, Pawan Khera suggested them to serve ""cheap oil instead of cheap comedy"".Bharatiya Janata Party leader Amit Malviya slammed the grand old party for their criticism of Savarkar as he recalled former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s message on the death of the freedom fighter, highlighting her words of praise for him.Party general secretary K C Venugopal posted on X, “Every Independence Day, the Modi-led BJP makes it a point to distort history and make heroes out of traitors.”“This Orwellian image, elevating a British mercy petitioner like Savarkar over Gandhi ji - the undisputed Mahatma who got us freedom, and completely eliminating Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel ji, shows their contempt for our freedom fighters.”“What else can one except from those whose forefathers collaborated with the British to sow the seeds of division and hatred that haunts us to this very day?” the Congress leader further added.Congress media and publicity department head Pawan Khera also took aim at the government, posting in Hindi, “While mixing ethanol in petrol, now you've started mixing impurities even in freedom fighters. Those who couldn't become great in history, you're making them big on posters.”“The country is asking you for cheaper oil, not cheap comedy,” he further mocked the organisation.BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh hit back replying to Khera’s post, “Sick brigade to the core... Veer Savarkar lived and died for the country.”Congress whip in the Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore wrote on X, “No matter how hard you try, Mr Modi, you can’t push Mahatma, Netaji & Bhagat Singh below Mafiveer. Don't disgrace the martyrs who fought and died for freedom by glorifying those who begged the British with apology letters.”CPI(M) MP John Brittas also criticised the ministry’s post, saying, “The deliberate elevation of VD Savarkar over Mahatma Gandhi is not a coincidence but a calculated act. The government’s actions undermine the nation's commitment to its secular Constitution. It is pertinent to note that Savarkar was an accused in Gandhi’s assassination, though acquitted due to insufficient evidence.“However, the Kapur Commission highlighted circumstantial evidence implicating Savarkar. Those who uphold the Constitution should unequivocally condemn this mockery of justice and secular values,” he further added.Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, joined the criticism row, writing on X, “Shame on the Patroleum And Natural Gas Ministry for placing the traitor and murderer Savarkar above true patriots and martyrs. That to with money of the exchequer.”Amid the opposition’s criticism, BJP leader Amit Malviya recalled former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s message on the death of Veer Savarkar, highlighting her words of praise for him.She said as per the letter shared by Malviya, “Veer Savarkar’s name has been a byword for daring and patriotism. He was cast in the mould of a classical revolutionary, and countless people drew inspiration from him. Death removes from our midst a great figure of contemporary India.”""Malviya remarked that in their opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress has now disowned both Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi,"" he further added.The TOI couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the letter.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas shared a picture on X featuring Savarkar alongside Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh, with the caption, “Freedom was their gift, shaping the future is our mission”.The ministry’s message read “As we celebrate our nation’s independence, let’s remember — liberty thrives when we nurture it every day, through unity, empathy, and action. Happy Independence Day.”","The oil ministry posted a picture of Veer Savarkar alongside the caption, “Freedom was their gift, shaping the future is our mission’” Congress party accused the PM Modi government of ""distorting history"" and glorifying “traitors” by placing VD Savarksar above Mahatma Gandhi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123324235,imgsize-763719,width-400,resizemode-4/123324235.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Nearly half a century after New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) came into existence, Supreme Court on Wednesday asked UP government to consider replacing it with a metropolitan council for people-centric governance.The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority, finding, among other things, decision-making centralised in the hands of a few officers.Accepting SIT's recommendations, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered: ""In order to infuse transparency and fairness as well as a citizen-centric approach in the day-to-day functioning of Noida, we direct UP chief secretary to place the recommendation... before the council of ministers for an appropriate decision.""Till that decision is taken, the bench directed the chief secretary to post a chief vigilance officer, who should be an IPS officer or an officer on deputation from CAG, in Noida for a financial audit.According to SIT, Noida officers were involved in 20 cases of excess payment of compensation to landowners. Led by IPS officer SB Shiradkar, SIT also concluded that Noida's land allotment policies favour builders, and there was a lack of transparency and fairness in the development authority's overall functioning.It sought an inquiry into assets of officers and their relatives for a proper look at who benefited from excess compensation that Noida paid out.Commenting on the functioning of Noida, SIT said discretionary powers exercised by its officers in allotment of land is such that very soon, there will be no land available in Delhi's neighbouring city for future development purposes. It also flagged the lack of process to garner public view and conduct environment impact assessments for projects in Noida. SIT said residents often complain of delay and inadequate resolution of grievances, as Noida Authority acts reactively rather than proactively.The Justice Kant-led bench directed the chief secretary to set up a citizen advisory board for Noida in four weeks and banned giving effect to any project in Noida without environmental impact assessment and clearance from SC's green bench.In the 20 cases where excess compensation was paid to landowners because of alleged collusion of Noida officials who were identified by SIT, the bench constituted another SIT to conduct a probe into each of these officers and register FIRs on detection of a cognisable offence. It asked the authority to grant sanction for prosecution against delinquent officials within four weeks of SIT seeking it.""The SIT headed by a police officer not below the rank of commissioner of police will register preliminary enquiries (PEs) and proceed to inquire into the illustratively highlighted points (in the previous SIT report) and involve experts from forensic account department as well as economic offences wing. If the SIT, after preliminary enquiry, finds commission of cognizable offence, it would register FIRs,"" the bench said.The court asked this SIT to submit a probe status report but clarified that excess compensation paid to landowners would not be recovered.","The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday used the pulpit of Red Fort to lavish praise on RSS, saying that the Sangh's contribution to the nation marks a ""proud and golden chapter"".Speaking about the contributions of individuals and organisations to nation-building in his Independence Day address, he said: ""Today, with great pride, I wish to mention one such institution. One hundred years ago, RSS was founded. These 100 years of service to the nation constitute a proud and golden chapter. With the resolve of nation-building through character-building, with the aim of serving Maa Bharati, the swayamsevaks have, for a century, dedicated their lives to the welfare of the motherland. ""The remarks of the PM, himself a swayamsevak, eulogising the Sangh when it is seen as enjoying unprecedented influence, can only add zing to its ongoing centenary celebrations.PM also praised Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, the founder of Bhartiya Jan Sangh, as BJP was known in its original incarnation, who died in jail after being imprisoned for campaigning against Special Status for J&K.""The removal of the wall of Article 370 and the realisation of the mantra of 'One Nation, One Constitution' have been our true tribute to him,"" said Modi.Although Sangh was invited to be a part of the Republic Day parade in 1963, this was, perhaps, the first instance of praise for the organisation which has defied bans, controversies and intense opposition from influential political and academic quarters to become one of the country's major influences and a challenge to the Nehruvian/ ""liberal"" version of nationalism and secularism.Interestingly, the high praise comes amid persisting speculation about a strain in Sangh's equations with BJP.Modi went the full distance in expressing his veneration for the organisation. ""Today, from the ramparts of Red Fort, I salute all the swayamsevaks who have contributed to this century-long journey of national service, and the nation takes pride in the grand and dedicated journey of RSS, which will continue to inspire us,"" he said.","PM Narendra Modi used the pulpit of Red Fort to lavish praise on RSS.

NEW DELHI: Announcing the launch of an ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra’ just three months after cross-border military hostilities with Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said all important places in India, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035.This indigenously-developed national air and missile defence shield, which will also be integrated with potent counter-offensive weapons, will progressively be expanded, strengthened and modernised with “great intensity” in the coming 10 years, with a system in place to work out strategies to cater for futuristic warfare needs.“Every citizen of the country should feel safe. Whatever technology comes to attack us, our technology should prove to be better than that,” the PM said, adding that the country will move forward towards developing the “powerful weapon system for targeted precise action” like Lord Krishna’s Sudarshan Chakra in the battle of Mahabharata.This announcement comes soon after Pakistan Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir was reported to have recklessly threatened to destroy any dam India builds to impede water flow to his country, while also warning of a nuclear Armageddon.While Modi did not spell out any details, the plan to erect a defence shield, akin to Israel’s `Iron Dome’ (which only has to protect a very small country) and the proposed `Golden Dome’ of the US, will take a lot of doing along with huge funding.It will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around identified locations, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, robust command and control posts, reliable land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles and other weapons. This will, of course, also require effective use of space-based assets for early-warning and tracking threats, if not for actual warfare.The PM’s remarks that Mission Sudarshan Chakra will not only neutralise the enemy’s attack, but will also hit back at the adversary “many times more”, points at the impending expansion of India’s conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles. These new missiles will include the induction of the new 500-km range quasi-ballistic missile Pralay and the 1,000-km range subsonic long-range land-attack cruise missile. The increase in strike range of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from 450-km to 800-km is also on the anvil.The building blocks for the robust air and missile defence shield are already in place. India’s existing integrated multi-layered air defence network, with a mix of Indian and foreign surface-to-air missile systems, had thwarted waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles during Operation Sindoor from May 7-10.Last week, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh had also declared that the IAF’s Russian-origin S-400 air defence system had shot down at least five Pakistani fighters and a large special mission aircraft, the last at a distance of 300-km -- during the hostilities.Officials say the PM’s new announcement is connected to the ongoing development of the indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system, being developed by DRDO under the ambitious Project Kusha, which will have interceptor missiles to hit hostile targets at 150-km, 250-km and 350-km ranges. Phase-1 of this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29, as was first reported by TOI.There could also now be a green signal for the operational deployment of Phase-1 of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, India had also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","All important places in India, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035. “Every citizen of the country should feel safe. Whatever technology comes to attack us, our technology should prove to be better than that,” the PM said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123326790,imgsize-76792,width-400,resizemode-4/123326790.jpg"

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said the stray dog issue in Delhi-NCR should be addressed through measures to regulate their population, rather than confining them to shelters - an approach that echoes the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules mandated under law. Bhagwat's comments come amid renewed debate over the Supreme Court's Aug 11 order directing Delhi-NCR authorities to permanently relocate all strays to shelters.""All animals have the right to live. The problem can be solved only by regulating the population of street dogs, but it cannot be resolved by putting them in shelters,"" said Bhagwat, a veterinary science graduate, while addressing a religious congregation at Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium in Cuttack Thursday. He added, ""Sheltering all street dogs is not a practical solution. The only effective way is to implement sterilisation and vaccination, as already prescribed in law. ""He referred to a cultural practice involving cattle rearing, saying that while milking a cow, some milk is taken for human use and the rest is left for the calf.

PM Modi's Stern Warning to Pakistan After Nuclear Threat, Refuses To Resume Indus Waters Treaty

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday announced plans for a grand celebration of the second birth centenary of renowned 19th century social reformer Jyotiba Phule, in what can be seen as an important gesture to OBCs who revere the anti-caste activist, who also championed women's education.""In the near future, we will be marking the 200th birth anniversary of the great social reformer Jyotiba Phule. We are going to begin the celebrations for this anniversary. Phule's principles and the mantra ""priority to the backward"" are an inspiration for us,"" said Modi. The proposed celebrations mark the elevation of Phule, who was born into Mali caste, to the national pantheon. BJP included Phule and his wife Savitribai, known for her 'passionate and tireless' advocacy for women's education, among its gallery of icons long ago. But Modi's plans for his bicentenary turn the embrace into a warm hug.Modi said his govt is working to implement Phule's mantra. ""By giving priority to the backward, we want to reach the heights of transformation. We want to put in our utmost effort for this. Through transparent policies, we wish to make ""priority to backward"" a reality on the ground, bringing it into the lives of every backward person"".The remarks were seen from multiple prisms, including the impending decision on vice president, choice of the new BJP chief, and Bihar polls where OBCs will play the decisive role.Phule, for long, has been a major influence on the OBCs in Bihar, with many among the intermediate castes of Kushwahas and Koeris, who, like Malis, are engaged in horticulture, regarding him as one of their own.The PM also spoke about Dalits and other deprived sections while stressing the need for govt to be proactive about improving lives. ""Whether they are Dalits, the oppressed, the exploited, or the deprived, govt should be proactively positive for them, govt should be pro-people,"" he said.Modi said some people suffer from the misperception that his govt was implementing schemes for welfare of the deprived sections the same way as its predecessors. ""We are implementing schemes on the ground. We emphasise saturation because if there is any true execution of social justice, it is in saturation where no eligible person is left out.""Phule's bicentenary celebrations would mark the co-option by BJP of a second legendary social reformer from Maharashtra, after B R Ambedkar was formally inducted into its 'Hall of Inspirations'. The practice of adopting even those who had once seemed incompatible with the party's original ethos has gone hand-in-hand with the expansion of its base beyond the core. It gathered momentum under Modi who, as PM, moved vigorously to identify the party with Ambedkar's legacy.","PM Narendra Modi announced plans for a grand celebration of the second birth centenary of renowned 19th century social reformer Jyotiba Phule.

""Her journey from a small village in Odisha to Rashtrapati Bhavan is a testament to how far we have travelled. And yet, we must remember that the work of building a just, equal, and inclusive India is far from complete,"" he said after hoisting the tricolour at SC.He said judges of the constitutional courts have the responsibility to promote, protect, imbibe, and defend the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. He reiterated the judges of constitutional courts, HCs and SC, are co-equals and must bear the responsibility of giving ""a broader, more purposive interpretation to the values of the Constitution"". Only when the rights of the marginalised are protected will Mahatma Gandhi's Swaraj be real and Ambedkar's idea of democracy be complete, the CJI said.Hours after PM mentioned the contributions of Jyotirao and Savitribai Phule, CJI Gavai said, ""From the hills of today's Jharkhand, where the Santhals lit the first flames of rebellion, to the forests of Chota Nagpur where Birsa Munda dreamed of dignity, from the humble school in Pune where Jyotirao and Savitribai Phule opened the doors of learning to the excluded, to the renunciation of a knighthood by Tagore in protest against injustice, from crafting of our Constitution by Babasaheb Ambedkar, to the moral compass of Mahatma Gandhi, our freedom was forged not in one place, nor by one people, but by courage of many, united by one dream of equal India.

SRINAGAR: Chief minister Omar Abdullah decried Friday the practice of tying terror attacks to J&K’s political fate and asserted that Pakistan should not be allowed to influence it through terrorism, a day after Supreme Court observed that “incidents like Pahalgam” must be considered when deciding on statehood.“Will the killers of Pahalgam and their masters in the neighbouring country decide whether we will be a state?” Omar said in his Independence Day speech, his first since taking office last Oct and the first by a CM since Article 370’s abrogation and J&K’s conversion into a Union territory Aug 2019.Speaking at Srinagar’s Bakshi Stadium, Omar termed SC’s reference to Pahalgam “unfortunate” and asked: “What kind of justice is it? Every time we are close to statehood, they will do something to sabotage it. Is this fair? Why are we being punished for a crime in which we had no role?” He pointed out that “J&K’s residents from Kathua to Kupwara” had protested the Pahalgam massacre of April 22 in which 26 people, mostly tourists, were gunned down.The CM announced a signature campaign across all 90 constituencies of J&K in the next eight weeks with the aim of submitting signatures to Supreme Court in support of restoring statehood and to take “people’s voice directly to Delhi”.The top court on Thursday gave Centre eight weeks to respond to petitions seeking statehood. “Me and my colleagues will use these eight weeks to go to each constituency,” Omar said.In his speech steeped in lament, the CM cited reports in various quarters about an “announcement this Independence Day from Delhi” -- an allusion to restoration of statehood. “I had hoped that in some corner of today’s (PM Narendra Modi’s) speech, there would be an announcement for J&K. We were told the papers are ready and it’s only a matter of time. But nothing happened.”Expressing his anguish further, Omar said he wished no one became the CM of a Union Territory with an assembly -- like J&K --comparing the National Conference (NC) govt he leads to “a horse asked to run with two front legs tied”. “It has nothing except pain and anxieties. I have been chief minister of the state and now of the UT. The system of dual governance is not for success but for instilling defeat.”The Omar-led govt does not control key departments such as home, which is vested with Centre-appointed lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha.Omar said he had never imagined before taking office that his cabinet’s decisions “could be altered or thrown into the dustbin”, remarks seen as an allusion to the LG’s overriding powers. “I am accountable to the assembly and assembly members to the people. But the bureaucracy in the present system is not answerable to the elected representatives.”","Omar Abdullah decries practice of tying terror attacks to J&K’s political fate.

KISHTWAR: The death toll in the cloudburst-triggered flash flood that devastated Chishoti in J&K's Kishtwar district rose to at least 60 on Friday as rescue workers dug out more bodies from the debris of a pilgrim campsite along the Machail Mata trail that bore the brunt of the calamity. Dozens are still reported missing, raising the possibility of casualties spiking as the hours tick by.Uprooted trees, boulders the size of houses and mounds of sludge sat where rows of tents and food stalls had been set up to cater to pilgrims either making their way to the ancient Machail Mata temple – 8.5km from the site – or making a stopover on their way back.Remnants of a wooden bridge, a rucksack, shoes entangled in the branches of uprooted pines and cars half buried under the rubble spoke of the gale force with which the sudden flooding occurred. Many of the victims were pilgrims having lunch at the langar (community kitchen) there.CM Omar Abdullah, who cancelled his ""At Home"" tea party scheduled for Independence Day after the disaster, reached Kishtwar on Friday to take stock. He told reporters that besides the confirmed deaths and those still missing, over 100 people were injured in the disaster.Officials said 167 survivors had been rescued till late Friday, while 69 other people believed to have been there at the time of the cloudburst were still to be found.Witnesses said they heard what sounded like a blast, followed by a ferocious burst of water and boulders and logs tearing through the pilgrims' campsite and the vicinity.""Within two minutes of the cloudburst, we were trapped in water up to our knees,"" said Suresh Mehra, who was on the Machail Mata pilgrimage with five relatives.

Rumors about Travis Hunter’s divorce have taken over social media feeds



Fans are calling out the obsession, labeling it ‘weird’ and ‘invasive’



“Y’all are way too invested in someone else’s marriage,”

“Why does this even matter to you?”

When did we, as a collective, decide that an athlete’s alleged marriage drama was worth a nationwide magnifying glass? That’s the question fans are now asking as rumors about Colorado football star Travis Hunter’s supposed divorce keep popping up online. While the internet thrives on a little gossip, many are calling out just how creepy the obsession has gotten and they’re not wrong.The talk started with a few cryptic posts and quickly turned into a full-blown internet frenzy. Multiple accounts began hinting that Hunter and his wife might be calling it quits, with screenshots and speculation flying faster than a 40-yard dash but here’s the thing, there’s been no official confirmation from either Hunter or his wife. This hasn’t stopped gossip pages from turning every comment, every photo, and every absence from Instagram into “proof” of a split.Not everyone’s here for the drama. In fact, a growing number of fans have started pushing back, saying the whole thing feels uncomfortably personal.one fan wrote, while another bluntly asked,Others pointed out the double standard when regular people get divorced, nobody cares, but when it’s a celebrity athlete, suddenly everyone’s a private investigator.Sure, the public has always been curious about celebrity breakups. From reality TV stars to A-list actors, messy splits tend to get clicks. But with Hunter, a 21-year-old still building his career, fans say the narrative feels uncomfortably invasive especially when it’s based on nothing confirmed. The constant picking apart of his personal life is leaving some wondering if sports fans are crossing the line from curiosity into obsession.Hunter is coming off an explosive season at Colorado and has already cemented himself as one of college football’s most electrifying players. Yet, instead of hyping up his on-field performance, parts of the internet are deep-diving into his personal relationships. In the end, it’s a reminder that athletes are still people and no matter how famous they are, their relationships deserve the same respect and privacy as anyone else’s.Also read - Travis Hunter injury update: Jaguars may sit rookie star for preseason Game 2","Rumors about Travis Hunter’s divorce have taken over social media feeds.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony.","Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin.

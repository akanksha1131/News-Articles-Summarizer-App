NEW DELHI: Fresh satellite images released on Thursday revealed the scale of destruction caused after Indian Army carried out precision strikes at 9 terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, under 'Operation Sindoor'.The comparative satellite images, released by Maxar Technologies, showed substantial structural damage across critical locations, specifically targeting the Jamia Mosque in Bahawalpur and within Muridke city in Pakistan.The complex, spread across 82 acres, was the 'alma mater' and the most important training centre of LeT located in Nangal Sahdan, Muridke, Sheikhupura, Punjab, Pakistan.Similarly, Jamia Mosque in Bahawalpur indicates evident destruction, with imagery analysis between pre-strike conditions and subsequent post-strike visuals.Markaz Subhan Allah was located at NH-5 (Karachi-Torkham Highway) on the outskirts of Bahawalpur at Karachi Mor in Bahawalpur district of Pakistan's Punjab province. This was the main centre of Jaish-e-Mohammed for training and indoctrination of youth which is spread over a 15-acre area.The Indian Army conducted targeted strikes, eliminating nine terrorist bases belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen during 'Operation Sindoor' across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.The Indian Air Force executed precise attacks on four sites within Pakistan's borders, whilst five locations were targeted in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The Centre affirmed that the operation was ""focused, measured and non-escalatory"" and deliberately steered clear of Pakistani military installations.The tri-services 'Operation Sindoor', conducted jointly by the Army, Navy, and the Air Force, was carried out from Indian soil. The Defence Ministry said Operation Sindoor was “focused, measured and non-escalatory” and avoided any Pakistani military facilities.The government said that it exercised its right to neutralise terrorists and their infrastructure following the Phalgam terror attack in Jammu in Kashmir which claimed 26 lives.During the press briefing, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Pahalgam terrorist attack has exposed the links of Pakistan with terrorists.""As you all know, on April 22, Pakistani and Pakistan-trained terrorist, associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, launched a barbaric attack on tourists in Pahalgam. 25 Indians, and one Nepali citizen were cowardly murdered. This is the most serious incident since 2008 Mumbai attack considering that fact the civilians were attacked,"" Misri said.","Fresh satellite images released on Thursday revealed the scale of destruction caused after Indian Army carried out precision strikes at 9 terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Two women armed forces officers helmed the military side of India's official briefing. One, Colonel Sofiya Qureshi , is a Muslim, the other, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh , a Hindu.

"India on high alert on land, air & sea",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-on-high-alert-on-land-air-sea/articleshow/120976031.cms,"A view of the India Gate during a blackout as part of the nationwide drill, ""Operation Abhyaas"", in New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: With a retaliation by Pakistan being considered likely, India has shored up its defences across the land, air and sea domains. The multi-layered air defence network is fully activated, several frontline warships are deployed in the Arabian Sea, and infantry units along the frontier are fully stocked and prepared to deal with any contingency.Amid combat air patrols being flown by IAF fighter jets, even the tri-Service Strategic Forces Command, which handles the country's nuclear arsenal, has been put on a high alert as a measure of abundant precaution.""India has demonstrated considerable restraint in its response. However, it must be said that Indian armed forces are fully prepared to respond to Pakistani misadventures, if any, that will escalate the situation,"" warned Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, a helicopter pilot, at the briefing by foreign secretary Vikram Misri.The feeling in military-diplomatic circles here, however, is that Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir, who just a few days ago warned that any Indian ""military misadventure"" would be met with a ""swift and notched-up response"", has no option but to militarily respond to rally everyone around him in his beleaguered country. ""There will be great pressure on him to authorise some kind of a response,"" a senior officer said.Pakistan had managed to surprise India with its ' Operation Swift Retort ' a day after the IAF conducted the Balakot pre-dawn air strikes on Feb 26, 2019, in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed earlier that month.""Lessons have been learnt. It will not be so easy this time. The armed forces have been preparing for the last 15 days and will not let their guard down,"" another officer said, while acknowledging that a large country like India simply cannot make its airspace totally impregnable.The armed forces, on their part, have inducted several new weapon systems since Balakot in 2019. The Russian-origin S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, fighters, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, for instance, are now part of the IAF's integrated air command and control system (IACCS).At the other end of the spectrum, there are the older Igla-1M air defence systems and the newer shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles with an interception range of up to 6km.In between, there are the Israeli-origin Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile systems (70-km range), the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems (25-km) and the Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15-km).Many of these systems are plugged into the fully-automated IACCS network that combines a wide array of sensors and weapons. IACCS has been progressively expanded over the years to integrate the wide array of military radars with civilian radars. Apart from ground-based radars, the existing Netra and Phalcon airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft are also part of this network.","India has shored up its defences across the land, air and sea domains.

Message to world: Strikes were in line with UNSC call to punish terrorists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/message-to-world-strikes-were-in-line-with-unsc-call-to-punish-terrorists/articleshow/120976295.cms,"Message to world: Strikes were in line with UNSC call to punish terrorists

NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor was in line with the UNSC statement last month underlining the need to bring the perpetrators and the backers of the Pahalgam attack - which was marked by extreme barbarity - to justice and intended to deter more such planned attacks on Indian soil by Pakistan-based terrorist modules , the govt said in a message to the international community.Describing India's military strikes as non-escalatory, responsible, measured and proportionate, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said there was clear evidence to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack, including communication nodes of terrorists ""in and to Pakistan"".According to Misri, The Resistance Front (TRF), which claimed responsibility for Pahalgam, was nothing but a front for UN-proscribed Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and India's intelligence has developed an accurate picture of the planners and backers of this team.""India exercised its right to respond and pre-empt, as well as deter more such cross-border attacks. India's actions focused on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists likely to be sent across to India,"" said Misri, briefing the media about India's move to defang Pakistan's terror factory with military strikes on LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) headquarters.Also read: How India-wide civil defence exercise unfolded Misri said even after two weeks of the attack, there was no demonstrable step by Pakistan against its terrorist infrastructure on its territory or in POK. ""Our intelligence monitoring of Pakistan-based terrorist modules indicated that further attacks against India were impending. There was thus a compulsion both to deter and to pre-empt,"" he said.Recalling that TRF had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack, Misri said India twice last year brought out its role before a UN committee as a cover for Pakistan-based terrorist groups. ""Earlier too, in Dec 2023, India had informed the monitoring team (1267 Sanctions Committee) about LeT and JeM operating through small terror groups such as TRF. Pakistan's pressure to remove references to TRF in the April 25 UN Security Council Press Statement is notable in this regard,"" said Misri. As reported by TOI on April 27, Pakistan had worked with China to water down that statement.Investigations into Pahalgam brought out the communication nodes of terrorists in and to Pakistan, Misri said.""The claims made by TRF and their reposting by known social media handles of LeT speak for themselves. Identification of the attackers, based on eyewitness accounts, as well as other information available to law enforcement agencies, has also progressed,"" said Misri, adding that the motive behind the Pahalgam attack was to undermine the normalcy and tourism returning to Kashmir Valley. ""The calculation, presumably, was that harming growth and development in the Union territory would help keep it backward and create fertile ground for continued cross-border terrorism from Pakistan,"" he said.Misri also said the manner of the Pahalgam attack was driven by an objective of provoking communal discord, both in J&K and the rest of India. ""It is to the credit of govt and the people of India that these designs were foiled,"" he said.Govt also said the features of the Pahalgam attack were in keeping with Pakistan's long track record of perpetrating cross-border terror in India, while underscoring Pakistan's duplicity in its handling of terrorism under pressure from the international community. Misri recalled how Pakistan had misled the FATF to get off its grey list and the Mumbai attacks accused Sajid Mir case in which the accused was declared dead, and then, in response to international pressure, brought back to life, found alive and arrested.""Pakistan also has a well-deserved reputation as a haven for terrorists from around the world, with internationally proscribed terrorists enjoying impunity there. In addition, Pakistan has been known to wilfully mislead the world and international forums,such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), on this issue,"" said the official.","Operation Sindoor was in line with the UNSC statement last month underlining the need to bring the perpetrators and the backers of the Pahalgam attack to justice.

Strikes steel PM Modi's iron man credentials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/strikes-steel-pm-modis-iron-man-credentials/articleshow/120975650.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two days after the Pahalgam terror attack , Narendra Modi gave a speech in Madhubani, Bihar. He vowed to ""identify, track and punish every terrorist and his backer"". In a speech given what turned out to be just hours before Operation Sindoor was launched, he struck a very different note. He touched upon Pakistan's perfidy, but limited himself to talking about pausing the Indus Waters Treaty That's Modi for you. Little did anyone know that before coming to Tuesday's event organised by a TV network, he had greenlighted the operation. With hindsight, his decision to record his speech for the Global Conference on Space Exploration on Wednesday morning showed he had already decided on the date for the retaliation.It's easy to say now for everyone that a PM who greenlighted surgical strikes after Uri and the bombing of Balakot terror camp after Pulwama was always going to give an answer to Pahalgam. But in the two weeks between Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor, there were many, including opposition leaders, who questioned whether he would okay a kinetic response. More so because pretty much every world leader of any consequence was advising 'restraint'.But not for the first time, Modi upended several people's assumptions. This is the third time he's called Pakistan's nuclear bluff, and the third time he's shown that the earlier Indian govt thinking, summed up in the euphemism 'strategic restraint', was never going to constrain his decisions.Modi was undeterred by pundits' concerns that a desperate Pak army chief, Gen Asim Munir, the maulvi in fatigues, could go to any extent to counter a punitive strike. He also proved wrong those who had reckoned that with the Indian armed forces already stretched thin since the Galwan clash with Chinese forces, and given the fear of China's communist bosses coming to the aid of their all-weather ally Pakistan, he would rein in his natural instinct to hit back harder.The precision strikes, while exposing Pakistan's nuclear blackmail for what it is, plain blackmail, helped him fully regain the 'jo kaha so kiya' plank and ' tough on national security ' credentials.The Pahalgam attack, though an aberration considering the successful tackling of terror both within J&K and outside it, had cast a shadow on those credentials. Daily taunts from opposition leaders had demonstrated their willingness to target what they saw as a chink in Modi's armour. The absence of a decisive Indian response would have allowed opposition leaders to take that rhetoric further. The anti-BJP political narrative would have been centered around what the opposition would have termed as Modi's inability to live up to his own belief that India must cross the 'red line' in response to a Pak-sponsored terror outrage.The nine precision strikes have washed away all doubt and with it, the opposition's story. Modi has again ensured that BJP retains the upper hand in security matters. The decision to share videos of the successful strikes involving 'niche' munitions was astute and left little room for quibble.More significantly, Modi also appears to have prepared the country for the longer haul vis-a-vis security threats, boosting its risk appetite: something that was evident in the manner in which people shrugged off Pakistan's claims of losses for IAF and, also, in the way stock markets took the risk of escalation in their stride.This is vital. The task of making India's economy stronger - itself a vital national security advantage - won't be any less urgent even after massively raising Pakistan's cost of terror sponsorship. Modi will helm that job as a PM with even bigger political capital.","Two days after the Pahalgam terror attack, Narendra Modi gave a speech in Madhubani, Bihar.

NEW DELHI: It is rare for PM Narendra Modi to send recorded messages. Equipped with impressive oratorical skills, he prefers to go ""live"". Yet, his decision to record his message for the Global Conference on Space Exploration on Wednesday, which had promised to be a normal day, suggests he had settled on May 6-7 as the date to avenge the mass killings of tourists in J&K's Pahalgam.The address, which was recorded on Tuesday, was played on Wednesday hours after India struck multiple targets in Pakistan and POK, and when the govt and the defence brass were reviewing the success and making preparations for possible retaliation by Pakistan.While recording the speech, Modi dropped no hint of the impending strike. ""India's space journey is not about racing others. It is about reaching higher together. Together, we share a common goal to explore space for the good of humanity,"" the PM said calmly, even when his mind may have been occupied with plans presented to him by the leaders of the armed forces.The PM also spoke about India's strides in the space sector, from launching a small rocket in 1963 to becoming the first nation to land near the south pole of the Moon. ""Our rockets carry more than payloads. They carry the dreams of 1.4 billion Indians. India's achievements are significant scientific milestones.

India will retaliate resolutely if Pakistan escalates: Doval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-strike-india-mounts-fresh-diplomatic-offensive/articleshow/120976551.cms,"NSA Ajit Doval (Pic credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Almost immediately after Indian forces pounded terrorist camps in Pakistan and PoK to rubble, NSA Ajit Doval reached out to his counterparts from across the world, including the US, UK, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Japan to brief them about India’s non-escalatory and restrained response. According to government sources, he briefed them about the method of execution of the military strikes, while stressing that India had no intention to escalate but was prepared to retaliate “resolutely” if Pakistan chooses to respond militarily.Doval also spoke to his counterparts from Russia, France and China. The NSA explained to his counterparts that India’s action was precise and focused, and no civilian, military or economic targets were hit. Most countries are said to have been supportive of India’s “zero tolerance” policy towards the terrorism, even as they urged both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and de-escalate.US secretary of state and NSA Marco Rubio urged both sides to keep lines of communication open and avoid escalation. Both Japan and China called for restraint, while condemning terrorism. China, however, described the military strikes as regrettable.Separately, foreign minister S Jaishankar had a telecon with his counterparts from Germany and France, appreciating their solidarity with India and support for zero-tolerance towards terrorism. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri also briefed envoys of 13 countries, all UNSC member-states including China, and raised 4 issues with them. These included the current escalation by the Pakistani side including at the LoC, its shielding of LeT-backed TRF, targeted Indian response and the barbaric way tourists in Pahalgam were killed. He’s also learnt to have spoken about cross-border linkages of the terrorists including their communication nodes in and to Pakistan.Misri too made it clear that if Pakistan responds, India will respond too. Responding to a question from one of the ambassadors, the foreign secretary said that the onus of de-escalation was on Pakistan as India had only responded to a terrorist attack. Asked if India had achieved its objective, Misri pointed to the fact that India had hit 9 terror camps. The UK asked about the targeting of civilians in a mosque, to which Misri said the structure comprised a complex that included a terror camp. The Indian mission in the UN, sources said, is also reaching out to UNSC members in New York.Important partners like Russia and Japan strongly condemned terrorism but also urged India and Pakistan to avoid any escalation. Japanese foreign minister Takeshi Iwaya spoke to Jaishankar and said that “fair investigation and punishment” of offenders of this terrorist attack are important.Iwaya also stated that Japan is deeply concerned that the recent series of events could lead to further reprisals and escalate into a full-scale military conflict, while urging both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and stabilize the situation through dialogue for peace and stability in South Asia. Russia again called upon both countries to resolve their agreements in line with the 1972 Simla Agreement and the 1999 Lahore Declaration. France also sought restraint and de-escalation.","NSA Ajit Doval reached out to his counterparts from across the world to brief them about India’s non-escalatory and restrained response.

BENGALURU: SkyStriker suicide drones designed to locate, acquire and strike operator-designated targets with a warhead installed in the fuselage were part of Operation Sindoor early Wednesday, vindicating the Indian Army's decision to add these unmanned aerial vehicles - "" loitering munitions "" in military parlance - to its arsenal post-Balakot.Sources confirmed to TOI that an unspecified number of these suicide drones were manufactured in an industrial estate in western Bengaluru as part of a joint venture involving Bengaluru-headquartered Alpha Design and Israel's Elbit Security Systems. The Army had placed an emergency procurement order in 2021 for 100-odd SkyStrikers.With a range of 100km, each suicide drone is an autonomous system carrying a 5kg or 10kg warhead. Its electric propulsion offers a minimal acoustic signature, allowing covert operations at low altitude.Alpha Design's CMD, Colonel (retd) HS Shankar, declined to comment on reports about SkyStrikers playing a role in Operation Sindoor, targeting terrorist infrastructure at several locations in Pakistan. ""Such queries must only be referred to the govt authorities,"" he added.SkyStriker is touted as a cost-effective loitering munition while being capable of long-range precision strikes. The drone improves performance, situational awareness and survivability by providing direct-fire aerial-precision capabilities to manoeuvrable troops and special forces.Elbit, in a description of the drone, says the SkyStriker flies like a UAS (unmanned aircraft system) and strikes like a missile. ""As a silent, invisible, and surprise attacker, SkyStriker delivers the utmost in precision and reliability, providing a critical advantage in the modern battlefield.""While seek-and-destroy missions remain central to military strategy, but newer technologies like loitering munitions have transformed sensor-to-shooter operations.","Bengaluru-made ‘suicide drones’ make debut with Operation Sindoor.

""They have attained a higher calling and have now becomes the guests of Allah. I feel no disappointment. In fact, my heart keeps wishing I had joined this joyful group of 14 pilgrims. Their departure was destined, yet it was not God who killed them,"" the notorious terrorist-in-chief said even as he invited the public to attend the funeral prayers scheduled for 4pm on Wednesday.The statement was in keeping with the ruthless resolve of the terrorist who arrived in India in the 1990s as a member of Harkatul Mujahideen to wage jihad in Jammu & Kashmir. He was arrested but had to be released as part of the swap of passengers of Indian Airlines plane IC-814, which was hijacked by his younger brother Abdul Rauf Azhar and others.The imprisonment did not dampen his zeal for jihad. He broke away from HuM to launch Jaish-e-Muhammed (Army of the Prophet) and soon earned the backing of ISI which was impressed by his fanatic fervour.Also read: Amit Shah tells border states to stay on alert and secure vulnerable points Azhar, the 56-year-old terror mastermind sanctioned by the UN Security Council as a global terrorist, has been linked to several high-profile attacks in India, including the 2001 attack on Parliament , the 2016 assaults on the Pathankot airbase and on the Indian embassy in Kabul and the suicide bombing of a CRPF convoy in 2019, which was the trigger for IAF raids on another Jaish seminary in Balakot. For years, Pakistan pretended to be unaware of Azhar's whereabouts despite robust evidence of the terrorist's presence on its territory.Getting him on the global terrorist list was a challenge. India tried to get Azhar designated as a global terrorist under the UN Sanctions Committee for years, only to to run into roadblocks raised by Pakistan's all-weather ally China who was promised that being on the right side of terrorists would help ensure the safety of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.Azhar's core group, including brother Abdul Rauf and other senior functionaries like Azhar's brother-in-law Yusuf Azhar have been operating out of Markaz Subhan Allah.

Notorious nine: Why India hit them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/notorious-nine-why-india-hit-them/articleshow/120977456.cms,"A dozen terror strikes, including Pulwama, plotted at Bahawalpur

NEW DELHI: Of the nine targets struck by India early Wednesday, Lashkar-e-Taiba 's base in Muridke and Jaish-e-Muhammed's Markaz Subhan Allah in Bahawalpur were the most important. Unabashed protection of Pakistan's army and ISI was the reason Muridke and Bahawalpur thrived as terror sanctuaries with seeming impunity for decades.Located in Pakistan's Punjab province, the very base of the country's military-intelligence complex, the two seminaries, inspired by hardline versions of Ahl-e-Hadith and Deoband schools of thought, seemed impregnable. Until Tuesday when the Indian Army and IAF hit them with precision strikes.The Markaz, sprawling over 15 acres, has been JeM's primary hub for training and indoctrination of jihadis. It was where Maulana Masood Azhar, after sliding under the radar for nearly two years following international pressure on ISI, resurfaced on Nov 30, 2024. In his speech to JeM members, he reiterated his unrelenting hostility towards India, vowing revenge for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya at the site of Babri Masjid.His comeback event was attended by key figures, including younger brother Maulana Talha Saif and son Mohammad Abdullah Bin Masood.India had dealt the first major blow to a terror seminary in 2019, when it attacked Jaish camps in Balakot - regarded as the ""first launchpad for jihad"" by Syed Ahmed Barelvi - to avenge the killing of 40 CRPF troopers in Pulwama. The fear generated by India's air strikes then appeared to have worn thin, encouraging Jaish to resume its terror campaign. LeT, though chastened for a while after a mysterious terror attack near the residence of its founder Hafiz Saeed , had also stepped up its attacks.Located on NH-5 (Karachi-Torkham Highway) in Bahawalpur (Punjab province), the Markaz served as the operational headquarters of JeM. Over a dozen significant terror strikes, including the 2019 Pulwama attack, were planned here. The perpetrators of the Pulwama attack had even trained at this facility which has been home to over 600 cadres and hosted regular training sessions for JeM members. The intelligence dossier shared with various foreign govts said the Markaz was constructed with the support of Pakistan's provincial and federal govts, supplemented by funds raised by JeM. The complex boasts modern facilities, including a gymnasium and swimming pool for underwater training to terrorists besides a stable.Muridke's Markaz Taiba, LeT's main training hub, was no less important as a strategic objective. Located in Nangal Sahdan, the 82-acre complex houses a madrassa, a market, residential quarters for operatives, sports facilities, a fish farm and fields, making it a self-sustaining terror training facility. Al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden had contributed Pakistani Rs 10 million for construction of a mosque and a guest house within the Markaz Taiba complex.The complex served as a multipurpose facility for LeT, offering training in arms and physical combat, as well as 'dawah' and indoctrination programmes for terrorists from Pakistan and abroad. The perpetrators of the 26/11 attack, including Ajmal Kasab, were imparted 'Daura-e-Ribat' (training in collecting intelligence) at this facility which was even visited by David Coleman Headley. Annually, around 1,000 students enrol in various courses. The facility also hosted periodic training sessions for LeT's top leadership.Another big name on India's target list was JeM's Syedna Bilal Markaz in Muzaffarabad in POK. This facility was used as a transit camp for JeM terrorists before they were launched into J&K. At any point of time, 50-100 cadres resided in this facility. Specialised training was provided by Pakistan's Special Service Group, an elite wing to which former dictator Pervez Musharraf belonged. JeM's operational commander and head of PKK Mufti Asghar Khan Kashmiri is in-charge of the facility that also operates as the base for digging of cross-border tunnels for infiltration of terrorists.Among other targets hit by India, Sarjal and Tehra Kalan served as JeM's primary launchpad in Pakistan's Punjab, operating from inside a primary health centre and facilitating cross-border tunnel digging and drone operations for arms and narcotics smuggling. Mehmoona Joya, a Hizbul Mujahideen facility in Sialkot, was also concealed inside a health unit. It provided weapons training, besides coordinating terrorist infiltration into Jammu under Irfan Tanda.Additionally, an LeT camp in Barnala (PoK), Markaz Ahle Hadith, with a capacity for 100-150 cadres, was reduced to ashes. JeM's Markaz Abbas in Kotli, headed by NIA-wanted Qari Zarar, planned terror strikes and coordinated infiltration into Poonch and Rajouri sectors. Hizbul Mujahideen's Markaz Raheel Shahid in Kotli trained terrorists in Border Action Team operations and sniping attacks.","Of the nine targets struck by India early Wednesday, Lashkar-e-Taiba's base in Muridke and Jaish's Markaz Subhan Allah in Bahawalpur were the most important. The Markaz, sprawling over 15 acres, has been JeM's primary hub for training and indoctrination of jihadis.

""We were discussing the meaning of names in the class, and my name is Vyomika, Vyom means sky, and a girl shouted, 'You are Vyomika, which means you own the sky'.

I cleared the pilot course in the academy, was awarded the wings, and became a helicopter pilot. After that, I never looked back. It was a rollercoaster experience, especially as being a helicopter pilot I would take on a variety of roles. I've flown from sea level to heights of 18,000 feet,"" she added.""I have done a lot of casualty evacuation and made decisions of leaving one person and taking another and then coming back the next day while negotiating with the weather,"" said Wg Cdr Singh.","Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, ""daughter of the sky"" as her name means, stood tall at a high-profile briefing to national and international media from New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday asked states and Union Territories bordering Pakistan and Nepal to be on high alert and bolster security at all vulnerable points, particularly vital installations, to beat any exigency including armed retaliation by Pakistan.At a security review held via video-conferencing with lieutenant governors and chief ministers of border states/UTs like J&K, Ladakh, UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and West Bengal and a representative of Sikkim govt - where the home secretary, Intelligence Bureau chief and DGs of Border Security Force ( BSF ) and Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ) were also present - Shah called for seamless coordination among the local administration, armed forces and the central paramilitary forces.Shah's exhortation followed an assessment by the security establishment that Pakistan, hamstrung by India's decision to focus the precision strikes exclusively on terror camps while ensuring that no civilian and military targets were hit, could target crucial installations. ""We don't run terror camps... our installations such as dams, refineries, power plants, particularly those on the western border, could be targeted,"" a source said.Many of these installations are protected by CISF, which has already reviewed and upgraded their security plan. Shah asked the LGs/chief ministers to keep the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), civil defence, Home Guards, NCC etc on standby to deal with any situation. He said efforts should be made to ensure public participation in Wednesday's mock drill through citizens and non-government organisations.Shah asked states/UTs to keep strict vigil on anti-national propaganda by unwanted elements on social and other media platforms and sought prompt action against them in coordination with central agencies. He said every effort should be made to maintain seamless communication and strengthen security of vulnerable points. Shah cautioned states and UTs to make sure there was no fear-mongering among the public and that rumours were kept in check by timely dissemination of information and spreading awareness.Meanwhile, Pakistani forces on Wednesday resorted to heavy shelling in sectors like Poonch and Uri, which was strongly retaliated by Indian forces. There are reports of casualties on both sides, though an official confirmation is awaited. Sources in BSF, which guards the international border and parts of the LoC in J&K with the Army, said the leaves of BSF personnel deployed on the western border has been cancelled. ""As the personnel rejoin duty on the IB/LoC, the force deployment levels will be enhanced by almost 25%. All our resources, including surveillance equipment, have been pulled together and deployed across J&K, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat borders,"" an officer told TOI.","Home minister Amit Shah asked states and Union Territories bordering Pakistan and Nepal to be on high alert.

The party has been trying hard to live down the post Balakot faux pas by its leaders.Sources said the hope now is that congress focus in the all party meeting on Thursday will help in further solidifying its positioning post Pahalgam.","The CWC statement after the Pahalgam attack on April 22 had extended full support to the government to take decisive action against Pakistan.

Armed forces scripted history: Defence minister









NEW DELHI: It was a cold, calculated, carefully calibrated retribution after keeping Pakistan on edge for 15 days since the Pahalgam terror massacre. In the early hours of Wednesday, India carried out precision strikes on nine terror hubs in Pakistan and POK to ""successfully destroy them"" in a synchronised operation by the IAF and Army.Under the tellingly named Operation Sindoor , a strike package of Rafale, Mirage-2000 and Sukhoi-30MKI fighters fired a salvo of long-range missiles and 'smart' glide bombs without crossing the Line of Control (LoC) or international boundary (IB) in J&K after taking off from different bases in the hinterland. AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) aircraft served as the 'eyes and ears' of the supersonic jets for the mission.Simultaneously, Army units launched loitering munitions or Kamikaze drones for long-range airstrikes and fired 'smart' extended range artillery shells to hammer specific targets based on hard and credible intelligence.It's difficult to correctly assess the number of terrorists killed on the ground during Operation Sindoor, but intelligence estimates said the toll could be in the range of 70 to 100. ""It would have been quite high at the two nerve centres in Muridke and Bahawalpur,"" a source said.The high-tempo blitz, from 1.04am to 1.30am, targeted four terror camps in Pakistan and five in Pak-occupied Kashmir. The Army took on seven camps that were relatively closer, while IAF handled the other two, sources told TOI.The targets ranged from Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad in the north, around 30km from the LoC, to Markaz Taiba in Muridke (Lashkar-e-Taiba HQ) about 25km from the IB, and Markaz Subhan Allah at Bahawalpur (Jaish-e-Muhammed HQ), around 100km away, in the south.""India exercised its right to respond and pre-empt as well as deter more such cross-border attacks. These actions were measured, non-escalatory, proportionate, and responsible,"" foreign secretary Vikram Misri said. ""They focused on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists likely to be sent across to India,"" he added, flanked by Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh at a briefing.Video footage was released to underline the strategic and operational success of Operation Sindoor.The absence of such evidence during the air strikes on the JeM terror facility at Balakot in Feb 2019 had led some quarters to doubt the claims at that time.Wing Commander Singh said the strikes on the nine terror camps were undertaken through “precision capability using niche technology, with careful selection of warheads” that ensured no collateral damage. “The point of impact in each target was a specific building or a group of buildings. All the targets were neutralised with clinical efficiency… No military establishments were targeted,” she said.Col Qureshi, in turn, added, “The target locations (nine of the 21 identified camps) were selected to avoid damage to civilian infrastructures and loss of any civilian lives. This was done with due diligence.”Speaking at a function later in the day, defence minister Rajnath Singh said India through Operation Sindoor had used its “right to respond” to the dastardly attack on its soil at Pahalgam. “The armed forces scripted history by acting with precision, precaution and compassion to destroy the camps used to train terrorists in Pakistan and POK. The action was carried out very thoughtfully and in a measured manner. It was limited only to the camps and other infrastructure used for training terrorists, with the aim of breaking their morale,” he said.","The strike package of Rafale, Mirage-2000 and Sukhoi-30MKI fighters fired a salvo of long-range missiles and'smart' glide bombs. AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) aircraft served as the 'eyes and ears' of the supersonic jets for the mission.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120978152,imgsize-1360101,width-400,resizemode-4/A-damaged-portion-of-Bilal-Mosque-is-seen-after-it-was-hit-by-an-Indian-strike-in-Muzaffarabad-on-Wednesday-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The civil defence drill on Wednesday - held as per directions of the office of DG, Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards, which comes under the home ministry - received an overwhelming response, with its scope expanding from the earmarked 244 civil defence (CD) districts/towns to nearly 350 districts, and nearly 15 lakh stakeholders including civil administration staff, volunteers, auxiliary forces, NDRF and state/UT police, besides the general public, coming together to test and enforce safety measures like blackouts, air-raid sirens and evacuation amid a simulated warlike setting.A home ministry source said the drill successfully saw the enforcement of blackouts, with people voluntarily putting their lights out or 'blackening' their windows with cloth or paper upon activation of the sirens. ""Reports from Bihar said people stopped their cars on NH-31 and switched off headlights to enforce the blackout,"" an officer said. ""There was total blackout in all areas where the drill was undertaken,"" the officer added, citing videos received from across the country.The original plan was to conduct the civil defence drill in 244 CD districts. However, the coverage was voluntarily expanded by states, with UP, for one, conducting the drill across all its 85 districts. ""What was most heartening is the public enthusiasm to join in the drill. In fact, many members of the public have offered to become civil defence volunteers,"" an officer said and added that state/UT chief secretaries were asked to hire them.There were some gaps that were identified in the civil defence set-up in certain parts; for instance, the air siren could not be sounded in many places. ""This may be as it has been long since the 1971 war, when the sirens were last used. Also, the districts and cities have expanded,"" said an officer, adding that these districts will be mapped and emergency provisions invoked for purchasing the necessary equipment.""We have identified the gaps in the civil defence set-up, thanks to Wednesday's drills,"" said the officer. For instance, a source said, at Delhi airport, which has both civilian and military operations, the coordination could have been better with more participation of senior people. This is crucial as military targets are seen as more prone to being targeted in a hostile aerial action. This will be corrected as part of follow-up action, it was learnt.As regards the civil defence exercise on the western border, particularly as it came hours after Indian forces hit terror targets in PoK and Pakistan, sources said the situation had anyway changed to a real emergency scenario there, particularly with heavy shelling in some border areas.","Nearly 15 lakh stakeholders including civil administration staff, volunteers, auxiliary forces, NDRF and state/UT police, besides the general public, came together to test and enforce safety measures.

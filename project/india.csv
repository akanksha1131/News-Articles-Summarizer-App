'I will not contest Bihar polls': Prashant Kishor says NDA in 'complete chaos'; claims Nitish Kumar won't return as CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-will-not-contest-bihar-polls-prashant-kishor-says-nda-in-complete-chaos-claims-nitish-wont-return-as-cm/articleshow/124567044.cms,"Prashant Kishor (PTI file photo)

NEW DELHI: ‘I will not contest Bihar assembly polls,’ Prashant Kishor has declared, ahead of the high-octane elections in the state. The Jan Suraaj founder said the decision was taken by his fledgling political startup for the “greater good.”The poll strategist-turned-politician confirmed this in an exclusive interview with PTI.Speculation had been rife that Kishor would contest elections, and possibly take on RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav in his stronghold of Raghopur. With the release of Jan Suraaj’s second list of 65 candidates on Monday, it was clear that Kishor’s name was absent. Instead, the party has fielded political activist Chanchal Singh against Tejashwi.Meanwhile, Tejashwi is all set to file his nomination papers from Raghopur on Wednesday, even as seat-sharing issues within the INDIA bloc remain unresolved.“The party has decided that I should not contest the assembly polls. And therefore, the party has announced another candidate from Raghopur, against Tejashwi Yadav. It was a decision we took in the larger interest of the party. If I were to contest, it would have distracted me from the necessary organisational work,” Kishor said.Despite sitting out, Kishor remains bullish about his party’s prospects. “I can say with certainty that we will be either win handsomely or receive a drubbing. I have been stating on record that I expect a tally of either fewer than 10 seats or more than 150 seats. There is no possibility of anything in between,” he said.He also set a benchmark for success: “A tally less than 150, even if it is 120 or 130, shall be a defeat for me. If we do well, we will have the mandate to transform Bihar and make it count among the 10 most advanced states of the country. If we do not do well enough, it would mean the people have not shown enough confidence in us, and we must continue to carry on with our politics of the street and society (samaj aur sadak ki rajneeti). ”Kishor, who recently predicted that JD(U) would struggle to win even “25 seats” in the 243-member assembly, said the outlook for chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s party has only worsened.“The NDA is definitely on its way out and Nitish Kumar will not return as chief minister,” asserted Kishor, who has closely worked with the JD(U) supremo, both as a poll analyst and, briefly, as a party colleague.“You do not need to be a psephologist to fathom what is in store for the JD(U). In the last assembly polls, Chirag Paswan staged a revolt just a few days ahead of the announcement of elections and fielded candidates, many of whom were inconsequential, against nominees of Kumar's party, causing its tally to crash to 43,” Kishor recalled.He added that there is “complete chaos” in the NDA, with uncertainty over which seats the BJP will contest and where the JD(U) plans to field its candidates.Kishor added, “If Jan Suraaj Party wins the Bihar polls, it will have a nationwide impact. The compass of national politics will point in a different direction.”The Bihar assembly elections will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11, with counting scheduled for November 14.","Prashant Kishor says he will not contest Bihar assembly polls.

Agreeing with the step taken by Nitish Kumar , I am fielding my candidates in two seats. The list is ready,"" Manjhi said.HAM has already announced its candidates for six seats, among whom four are sitting MLAs.This comes as a challenge to Chirag Paswan's LJP, which has been allocated 29 seats. Before the seat-sharing deal was finalised, HAM was demanding at least 15 seats. Meanwhile, Kushwaha is reportedly upset over the Mahua assembly seat, which was initially promised to him but is now being discussed for the LJP (Ram Vilas) quota.On Wednesday, Kushwaha was summoned to Delhi by the BJP top brass to avert the last-minute crisis.""I am going to Delhi. Some pondering needs to be done on the decisions that are being made in the NDA. I am going to Delhi to hold talks on the same. I'm hopeful that everything will be fine,"" Kushwaha said.Amid intense speculation that the NDA seat-sharing deal has left him infuriated, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also gave away JD(U) tickets, bypassing the party's earlier practice of announcing the names of candidates at a press conference, news agency PTI reported.It was not immediately known how many JD(U) candidates were given tickets during the day, as the CM's residence kept bustling with activity, with aspirants turning up after receiving a call from the party chief.In the meantime, rumours spread like wildfire that Nitish, who is known to dump allies and forge new coalitions at will, was angry that his party was not given the lion's share in the deal struck in Delhi on Sunday.Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan took a dig at the NDA, terming it ""Naiya Doobegi Abki Baar.""RJD leader Mrityunjay Tiwari said that BJP's intention is to ""finish all regional parties.""""We are saying this since the beginning that BJP's intention is to finish all regional parties... Now, conflicts have started to emerge within BJP as well,"" Tiwari said.""Everything is fine in the Mahagathbandhan, there are no ifs or buts, no conflicts. The Mahagathbandhan is united and is fighting the elections strongly. With immense public support and the blessings of the people, a Tejashwi government is going to be formed in Bihar. This is the farewell of the NDA... Upendra Kushwaha has also said that something is not right somewhere, Jitan Ram Manjhi is upset, Nitish Kumar is upset. .. NDA now stands for 'Naiya Doobegi Abki Baar'... Now, Bihar wants a Tejashwi government,"" he added.Earlier on Sunday, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) announced seat-sharing arrangements for the upcoming Bihar elections , with the BJP and JD(U) to contest on 101 seats each, the LJP (Ram Vilas) on 29 seats, the Rashtriya Lok Morcha on six seats, and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) on six seats.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal (United) [JD(U)], Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), and Rashtriya Lok Morcha.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share.

Fare Play

When 30 Becomes 15

Collective Survival Strategy

It was 2014. End-October. I was in Delhi — where I work — but needed to go back home to Bihar for the Chhath Puja. I called up a cousin, who teaches at Delhi University, hoping he could help get my waitlisted railway ticket confirmed. I still remember what he told me laughingly: “Every Bihari wants to get the hell out of the state, and now everyone’s trying to go back!” Broad generalities dispensed with, his tone turned sombre. “It’s difficult to reach Bihar, and even if you do, it will be a one-way ticket. How will you return?” My cousin, I realised, could never become a motivational speaker.Word about my unconfirmed ticket had spread in our office. I must have told someone, and then he or she must have told someone else, and so on. I think everybody feels a little better when someone else is down. Schadenfreude, pure and simple.After a miserable day at work, I headed to the Press Club. Alcohol might do you harm, but very few things come close when you are trying to drown your sorrows. You are probably thinking what a stupid thing I did, but you are wrong.I couldn’t have made a better decision. I was at the right place at the right time. A senior colleague, by now much mellowed by the effects of alcohol and having ascended a moral plane where schadenfreude had no place, spotted me and took me over to another senior journalist who could get any railway ticket confirmed. Long live the special quota.Bihar, I said, here I come.I did get on the train. I had a confirmed berth. But… Hello, what was this? A human ocean? I had seen crowds, but this was something else. Sardines, packed inside cans, probably have more space for themselves.I somehow survived, and when morning dawned, and the train chugged into Bihar, I felt... happy, maybe? After all, I was home. I had made the journey I wanted to make. But I also knew that I would never make this journey ever again.My cousin, the Delhi prof, had been partly right. There were no available tickets on the regular trains. But being an eternal pessimist, he had not budgeted for the number of special trains the Railways runs during Chhath and other festivals.I managed to get a confirmed ticket on one such train. It would leave from Patna at 8.30pm. I was in Muzaffarpur, my hometown. Strangely, on the day I was to leave, my parents insisted I leave home at 11am. “But Patna is barely 70km from here!” I argued, uncertain if my parents were showing early signs of senility or if they were truly fed up with my company.But it turned out they were approaching the 70km journey from a rooted Bihari perspective. A distance that one could reasonably expect to cover in no more than one and a half hours could often take much, much longer in Bihar. “We are speaking from experience,” my mother said.Banished with tiffin and a lecture, I set out. Within an hour I was marooned near Hajipur, facing the Mahatma Gandhi Setu — the bridge over the river Ganges that connects Hajipur in the north to Patna in the south. You hear of monster traffic jams in Delhi and Gurgaon, but this was a whole new level.I did catch the train, which — surprise, surprise — was on time, but it involved a sprint in the end, and a timely leap into the compartment as the train was gently pulling out of Patna Junction. So, net net: about 70km in nine and a half hours. Now do the maths.Once seated — unlike the train to Bihar, this had a limited number of humans on board — I dialled my mother. “You were lucky,” my mother said. “Your father’s uncle’s son-in-law once got stuck on that bridge in peak summer, AC gone, ended up admitted to a Patna hospital. His ailing father-in-law had to leave home to visit him there.”Good lord! I had been lucky indeed.Next time, I thought, I’d book a plane. Unfortunately, so did every other Bihari with a credit card, and the fares during Chhath shot up like Diwali rockets. On one visit, I landed in Patna, where an uncle picked me up from the airport and dropped me at a bus stand. I wasn’t expecting a bus like this. A gleaming, low-floor, air-conditioned govt bus to Muzaffarpur. Wow! It felt like a hallucination crafted by a particularly optimistic urban planner. I took the last seat.Seated next to me were a couple from Delhi. The conductor arrived. “Muzaffarpur,” I said. He quoted something like Rs 200. And then he winked. “For you, I will make it Rs 150.” Sure! Maybe some discount scheme. I didn’t think too much about it, just handed over Rs 150. But there was no ticket forthcoming. And then the penny dropped.The Delhi couple beside me were giving me the dagger look. And then the man took out Rs 400, and, pointedly, told the conductor: “Give us tickets, we’ll pay Rs 200 each.” The conductor looked personally betrayed. “Look at this man,” he told the bus, “insisting on paying extra.”A murmur rose — passengers, it turned out, are fiercely united against the principle of receipts. The wife asked me: “Would you do this on a DTC bus in Delhi?” The husband added, “This is why nothing works — the passengers and the staff.” Backed into a corner, the conductor printed their tickets. I felt like I needed a place to hide, something like a dark, mossy cave where no light ever entered.After half an hour, still feeling raw inside, I finally plucked up courage, and whispered to the couple: “You did the right thing, Sirji. I feel terrible.” They smiled, magnanimous in victory.On another trip, last year, I bypassed the bridge altogether and flew into Darbhanga. Outside the airport, I got on a bus to Muzaffarpur and sat beside the driver. On board were the driver, conductor, and cleaner, plus about 30 passengers. We soon pulled into a petrol pump, where a man climbed aboard to count heads. “Thirty,” he declared. The conductor laughed. “Fifteen, boss. Try again.” The man looked unconvinced until a small parcel of persuasion slid into his pocket. He cleared his throat: “Fifteen.”I, the suburban moralist, couldn’t help myself. “Won’t the owner find out?” The conductor shrugged. “He owns 200 buses. He’s not an idiot.” Pause. “This is expected. Our salaries haven’t changed in years. I’m not thinking only of me — the driver and the cleaner have families too.” He said it without malice or secrecy, someone merely stating undisputable facts like how the sun rises in the east. Strangely enough, I managed to see things from his point of view.Back in Muzaffarpur, a journalist friend offered the tidy thesis. “Bihar runs differently,” he said. “For generations, the state never really showed up. Colonial hangovers, feudal leftovers, thin institutions. People learned to get by without the system, so now the system gets by without the people. Autopilot.”I’ve replayed those trips while planning every subsequent Chhath. There’s the train that turned into a human aquarium, the endless bridge, the AC bus that looked like a mirage, the conductor’s discount that wasn’t a kindness so much as a custom, the auditor whose arithmetic improved with a little encouragement, and the conductor’s calm defence of cheating. None of this is heroic, but it also doesn’t feel villainous. It feels like a collective survival strategy.And each year I find myself plotting the same pilgrimage — rail versus road versus sky — telling myself I’ll do it better this time, knowing fully well that I most likely won’t.","Every Chhath Puja, returning home to Bihar turns into an adventure. trains bursting with passengers, traffic jams that defy physics, and conductors who redefine honesty.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid’s statement that Pakistan spy agency ISI had planned attacks in Kerman in Iran and Moscow’s Crocus City Hall in 2024 has validated the findings by Indian intelligence agencies that ISI and the Pakistan military were running IS-Khorasan modules from Af-Pak border areas.The two attacks, which happened in a span of three months, were claimed by the IS in Khorasan Province. Iran’s probe had revealed that the main accused Abdollah Tajiki had entered Iran two weeks before the attack by crossing the southeast border (that is Pakistan).US had called the attack in Moscow as “IS-K’s first successful attack in Russia”, though Moscow had accused “the special services of an unfriendly state” for the blast — seen as a reference to Ukraine.“Both operations — originally claimed by the Islamic State — were coordinated on Pakistani soil and IS-K’s leadership is based in Pakistan,” Mujahid claimed during a press briefing on Oct 12. The Taliban administration’s spokesman also implicated the ISI in fomenting unrest in Afghanistan, alleging that certain elements within Pakistan’s military establishment were averse to peace in the region.The Taliban’s claims corroborates the assessment of the Indian agencies that IS-K’s recruiters brainwashing Indian youths were actually being controlled by ISI. Several IS-inspired modules busted in Delhi, Ranchi and other places were being handled by ISI operatives with the internet protocol analysis pointing to locations deep inside Pakistan. “A particular group within the Pakistani army is turning a blind eye to IS activities,” Mujahid alleged. He accused Pakistan of allowing IS-K to operate from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, planning attacks on Afghan soil.","Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistan spy agency ISI had planned attacks in Kerman in Iran and Moscow’s Crocus City Hall in 2024.

New Delhi: Refuting allegations made by activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife against his detention under National Security Act, the Ladakh administration told Supreme Court that due process of law was followed, including informing him about grounds of arrest, and he was also allowed to meet his relatives in jail. It also informed the court that he was not being kept in solitary detention as alleged, and was medically fit.In an affidavit filed in SC, Leh district magistrate Romil Singh Donk said Wangchuk was getting legal assistance and advice in jail in preparing his representation before the advisory board against his detention.“At the outset, the answering respondent denies the baseless allegations made in the petition which suggest that Sonam Wangchuk has been detained illegally and that he is being treated improperly in the course of such detention. In this regard, it is submitted that he has been lawfully detained under a lawful authority by way of an order under Section 3(2) of NSA,” the affidavit said.“The order of detention came to be passed by me (DM) after duly considering the material placed before me, as mandated under law, and after arriving at a subjective satisfaction on the circumstances that prevailed within the local limits of the jurisdiction where he had been indulging in activities prejudicial to the security of the State, maintenance of public order and services essential to the community as mentioned in the grounds of detention,” it said.He said that the activist was “categorically informed both of the factum of his detention under the Act as well as the factum of his transfer to the Jodhpur central jail. The said factum was also immediately communicated telephonically to his wife Geetanjali Angmo through SHO, Leh police station”.The Jodhpur jail administration also filed an affidavit, saying Wangchuk had met his lawyer of choice as well as his brother and wife. “It is specifically stated that the detenue is not in solitary confinement as he is entitled to all rights available to the detenues (which are not available to persons in solitary confinement) as per Rajasthan Prison Rules,” it said.“It is imperative to note that the detenue in addition to being in completely normal health is also consuming a normal diet, and regularly consuming morning tea, breakfast, evening tea and dinner every day since his detention,” the affidavit said.","The Ladakh administration told Supreme Court that due process of law was followed, including informing him about grounds of arrest.

HC rules out giving more time to vacate Signature View apts

New Delhi: Supreme Court Tuesday ask ed ED whether its probe into the money laundering aspect of alleged massive corruption in liquor sale by Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) amounted to interference in the state’s affairs and federal structure of governance, leading the agency to assert that under the anti-money laundering law it is obligated to investigate cases anywhere once an FIR is registered.“What happens to the federal structure? Law & order are a state subject. Would ED investigations into FIRs lodged by state police not amount to encroaching upon police probe? Can ED go and investigate any crime relating to corruption in any state for inquiring into the money laundering aspect,” asked a bench of CJI B R Gavai & Justice K Vinod Chandran.New Delhi: A last-ditch effort by a few residents of Signature View Apartments to extend the timeline to vacate the towers failed before Delhi High Court on Tuesday as it said, “We will not put our seal at your risk.”A bench of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedella pointed out that even the Supreme Court had highlighted that the buildings were in a dilapidated state. “In view of the order of the Supreme Court dated Oct 10, we are not inclined to grant any time extension,” the bench observed, dismissing the fresh plea filed by nine residents who had invoked the “mercy” jurisdiction of the court to seek a grace period.“If we extend time for you, we have to extend for all. This is a well-reasoned order; you challenged it, nothing was done. You are, in fact, under contempt. We will not put our seal at your risk; what if something happens to you tomorrow?” the bench orally observed. However, it suggested that the petitioners, several of them advocates, approach senior advocate Sanjay Jain, representing Delhi Development Authority, and left it to the agency’s discretion.Jain maintained that there was no sc ope for relief since SC itself had made observations. “The apex court said how can we take any responsibility on us if an untoward incident happens. No one can take any risk, given the fact the buildings are dilapidated,” he submitted.The high court, however, reminded Jain that the residents were “in this state” because of his client. “Let’s not forget that. People buy these flats with their hard-earned money and what do they end up with? The same issue is with other agencies, such as NBCC, pending before us,” it pointed out. In March, DDA issued a tender to demolish and reconstruct Signature View Apartments after Delhi High Court first cleared its proposal.

"Small is strong in Bihar, as spoilsport or as kingmaker",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/small-is-strong-in-bihar-as-spoilsport-or-as-kingmaker/articleshow/124564721.cms,"New Delhi: Humbling memories of the last assembly elections serve as a cautionary tale for major parties in the two rival alliances in Bihar as they seek to accommodate demands of their smaller allies in a state with a polarised electoral battlefield where they can either play a spoilsport or multiply gains of their big brothers.BJP and JDU senior netas were huddled in Patna Tuesday to decide on which of their partners will contest on some of the seats after Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) made its claim over a few constituencies seen by the CM Nitish Kumar-led party as its backyard.LJP had drilled home the point about its disproportionately disruptive influence when it walked out of NDA to contest on its own in 2020 after its seat-share demand was snubbed by its bigger partners, especially JDU. Paswan’s party contested on 135 seats and could win only one but ensured the defeat of JDU, its primary target, in over two dozen seats, taking a heavy toll on Nitish’s political weight.For more than a decade, it was Nitish who held the balance, ensuring NDA’s electoral dominance in back to back assembly polls in 2005 and 2010, and then romping home along with RJD in 2015 before LJP struck a serious blow to its standing five years later.With both alliances enjoying a strong and committed vote bank populated by voters mostly along caste lines, a party like LJP with solid backing of over 5% Paswans can break the numerical stalemate involving big players.Newbies like Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM can do the same in the region of his influence over votes of Mushhars, less than 3% and the poorest among SCs, and Mukesh Sahani-led Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) hopes to wield a similar influence by appealing to a group of castes, traditionally boatmen and fishermen.Unhappy with RJD, VIP had jumped to NDA’s side in 2020, when less than 15,000 votes separated the two alliances. NDA won 125 seats against opposition’s 110 but had a merely .03% higher vote share. Hurt in 2020, JDU and BJP are now treading cautiously as LJP drives a hard bargain. Things are, if anything, more complicated in ‘Mahagathbandhan’ — RJD-Congress-Left-VIP bloc.While NDA has managed a division of the number of seats among its constituents, a consensus has so far eluded the rival alliance, with the Congress driving a hard bargain on not only the number of seats it will contest but also choice of its seats.Several RJD members are unhappy with Congress for not endorsing its de facto head and former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face of the alliance but electoral compulsions have ensured that their party cannot brush aside the claims of Congress after playing a second fiddle to its functionary Rahul Gandhi during his ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Aug-Sept. Congress coupled with the Left, especially CPI-ML, and VIP can bring incremental votes to RJD, which has long enjoyed the solid support of the state’s two biggest voting blocs in Muslims and Yadavs but failed to draw enough support from other communities to ride a winning combination.As Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party emerges as another potential disruptor in the polls scheduled for Nov 6 and 11, lead partners in both alliances try hard to protect their flanks even if it costs them a few extra seats.",BJP and JDU senior netas huddled in Patna Tuesday to decide on which of their partners will contest on some of the seats.

Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur Sent On Forced Leave After Outrage Over IPS Officer Suicide Case

NEW DELHI: A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration and Haryana government 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.Kapur is among the officers named by Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, for allegedly abetting her husband’s suicide.The committee made this demand during a mahapanchayat in Chandigarh on Sunday. Heavy police were deployed around the venue.“The Haryana DGP and former Rohtak SP should be arrested. The DGP must be removed from his post. We have given 48 hours, after which we will decide the next course of action,” a committee spokesperson told reporters, as quoted by news agency PTI.Six days have passed since Kumar, who was last posted as IG at the Police Training Centre in Rohtak’s Sunaria, died. His post-mortem and cremation have not been conducted, as the family is refusing consent until their demands are met.The mahapanchayat saw tension when former Haryana MP Raj Kumar Saini reportedly made a controversial remark, sparking anger among attendees. Calm was restored after organisers intervened.A message from Kumar’s family was read, appealing for support in their pursuit of justice. Committee members also demanded a judicial probe into the case, said Gurmail Singh, a committee member. “The family and dalit community fear that if the last rites are conducted, the government may not take action against the accused,” said Karamvir, a committee member. He also questioned the work done by the Special Investigation Team set up by Chandigarh police.Fifty-two-year-old Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7.

He cited Beijing’s export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are used in smartphones, electric vehicles, and military hardware.The new US tariffs, along with export controls on ""any and all critical software,"" are set to take effect from November 1. Trump described Beijing’s actions as ""extraordinarily aggressive"" and said, ""There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'.""Currently, Chinese goods face 30% US tariffs, while Beijing’s retaliatory duties stand at 10%.The announcement sent Wall Street into a tailspin, with the Nasdaq dropping more than three percent.Investors were already cautious after a recent surge in tech stocks had raised fears of a market bubble.The latest tensions came after months of fragile peace between the two economic giants, who had been negotiating a full trade deal following Trump’s tariff announcements in April. That earlier round had led to escalating tit-for-tat levies.Meanwhile, Trump’s Sunday comments gave a small boost to US futures, which rose more than one percent.Gold, often seen as a safe-haven during uncertainty, continued to climb, hitting a new record of $4,060.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-demerger-what-does-it-mean-for-investors-why-did-the-share-price-drop-40-explained/articleshow/124544495.cms,"The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. (AI image)

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur, in the eye of a storm following the suicide of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, was on Monday sent on leave.Rajiv Jaitly, media adviser to Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini, confirmed the development but the official order was yet to be released till the filing of this report.The decision came past midnight —a few hours after a mega celebration in Sonipat on Friday to mark a year of the Saini govt was put on hold in view of the deepening tensions over Puran Kumar’s death. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to address the ‘Jan Vishwas-Jan Vikas’ rally.Pressure was mounting on govt to take action against Kapur, as Puran Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, had refused to allow autopsy or cremation until the DGP was removed. The stalemate dragged on for nearly a week.Dalit groups were piling on the pressure and a ‘mahapanchayat’ set up for justice to the family had handed an ultimatum of 48 hours, which expires on Tuesday.The top brass of Haryana govt, including chief principal secretary to CM Rajesh Khullar, held meetings with the family but the deadlock persisted. IPS officer Narendra Bijarniya, who too was named in Puran Kumar’s suicide was removed as Rohtak SP but Amneet stuck to her demand for action against the Haryana DGP.After a series of meetings on Monday that stretched till midnight, it was decided to send Kapur on leave.The aftershocks were felt on another front — govt’s plan to celebrate the first anniversary of the Saini govt.Protests by Dalit groups and growing support of opposition parties for the grieving family were casting long shadows on the event.According to sources, the decision to postpone it was taken after CM Nayab Singh Saini and chief secretary Anurag Rastogi chaired a meeting to review arrangements at the Sonipat venue.After a series of meetings on Monday that stretched till midnight, it was decided to send Kapur on leave. The aftershocks were felt on another front — govt’s plan to celebrate the first anniversary of the Saini govt.Protests by Dalit groups and growing support of opposition parties for the grieving family were casting long shadows on the event.According to sources, the decision to postpone it was taken after CM Nayab Singh Saini and chief secretary Anurag Rastogi chaired a meeting to review arrangements at the Sonipat venue.After the meeting, the CM set off for New Delhi by road where he would have stayed for the night and met dignitaries the next day. He was also due to attend a programme in Nuh on Tuesday.Chandigarh Police, continuing their investigation, have served a notice to IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, widow of the deceased, asking her to submit her late husband’s laptop to the Special Investigation Team (SIT).The laptop is reportedly where Kumar had drafted his suicide note, which remains saved in the device’s drafts.Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is due to visit the family on Tuesday. So will Union minister from Bihar, Chirag Paswan.Politicians from across the country are making a beeline to visit the Kumar household in Chandigarh to console the grieving family.Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale and Telangana deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka met the deceased officer’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, in the morning.After meeting the family, Athawale said he has assured them of all support and that the entire country’s SC community is awaiting action against the officers responsible for Kumar’s suicide. Later, Athawale also met Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and discussed the case. Both Athawale and Paswan are allies of ruling BJP.The Telangana deputy CM criticised Haryana govt for ‘inaction’ in the case. Puran Kumar was a native of Telangana.“In his dying declaration, the deceased named Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and SP Narendra Bijarnia, accusing them of humiliation and harassment leading to his suicide. As per law, a suicide note is treated as a dying declaration, warranting strict action. However, Haryana authorities have failed to act, which is both pathetic and inhuman. I demand that Haryana and Centre take immediate action against both officers,” Vikramarka said.K Raju, AICC in charge of Jharkhand Congress, alleged that authorities are not complying with the constitutional provision that provides for equality before law. “Action against senior officers responsible for driving the IPS officer to suicide is not being taken as they are high ranking officers. Delay in action is lowering the morale of the educated Dalit youth of the country,” he said.Punjab ministers Harbhajan Singh, Harpal Singh Cheema, Mohinder Bhagat and Dr Ravjot Singh visited the family, along with former Lok Sabha MP Prem Singh Chandumajra. Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) president Abhay Chautala also consoled the family.The Sarva Khap Maha Panchayat has also announced support to the deceased IPS officer’s family. Pawanjeet Bhanwala, spokesperson for Sarv Jatiya Sarv Khap Mahapanchayat and Jat Mahasabha, said that a meeting of Sarv Khap will be held on Tuesday at Narwana in Jind district.","Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur, in the eye of a storm following the suicide of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, was on Monday sent on leave.

NEW DELHI: A delegation of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who left their homeland over the decades in the face of persecution and took refuge in India met Taliban foreign affairs minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy on Monday and requested that the current regime in Afghanistan facilitate a joint delegation of prominent Hindus and Sikhs leaders from India for the restoration and maintenance of historical gurdwaras and temples located there.The delegation is learnt to have also sought easing of requirements for Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who are now Indian nationals so that they can visit like before without having to apply for a visa, as many would want to go back for business if the regime there ensures safety for minorities.They also sought that the Afghanistan government (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) must consider appointing and engaging Afghan national Hindus or Sikhs in their mission in India too, as this will strengthen the bilateral relations.“As during the previous regime, minorities were given representation in the government and considering the same, at least two persons - one each from the Hindu and Sikh community should be appointed to high-ranking positions in the government,” the delegation conveyed as per a statement issued after the meeting. They also sought restoration of property rights and estate of minorities which were grabbed during the previous regime.The delegation, led by Afghan Minorities Council in coordination with the Indian World Forum, comprised around 30 prominent Hindus and Sikh members of the community who came to India over the decades and many of them now hold Indian citizenship.Indian World Forum President Puneet Chandhok said, “we hope that the present regime will ensure foolproof rights of minorities living there.”After the meeting, Guljeet Singh, a prominent voice from the community, told TOI that “The foreign minister assured us that he will take up all our concerns back home.” Singh said that there are about 5,000 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Delhi.

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sameer Bajpai asked Ibrahim to file an application to that effect and said the request would be allowed.Imam had sought interim bail from October 15 to 29 to contest elections from the Bahadurganj assembly seat as an independent candidate. In his plea, he described himself as a “political prisoner and a student activist.” It was submitted that “He [Imam] is willing to contest elections from his home state Bihar which is scheduled to take place from in 2 phases from 10.10.2025 to 16.11.2025.”Sharjeel Imam, a resident of Jehanabad district in Bihar, has been in custody since January 2020. He was booked in several cases linked to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).While he was granted bail in some of those cases, he remains incarcerated in connection with the 2020 Delhi riots conspiracy case, in which the Delhi Police has invoked the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).On September 2, the Delhi high court rejected his regular bail plea in the riots conspiracy case. His appeal against that order is pending before the Supreme Court.Earlier, Imam had also moved a plea seeking 14-day interim bail from November 15 to 29 to file his nomination and campaign in Bihar. The plea said he wanted to contest from the Bahadurganj assembly seat as an independent candidate. It stated, “That since the applicant is a political prisoner and a student activist, he is willing to contest elections from his home state, Bihar.”The plea further said, “There is no one to take care of and make arrangements for his nomination and campaign for the elections, except his younger brother, who is also currently looking after his ailing mother and providing for his family.” It also referred to the September 2024 order of the Patiala House district court, which had granted interim bail to Engineer Abdul Rashid to campaign in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections.(With inputs from PTI and Bar and Bench)",JNU scholar and student activist Sharjeel Imam on Tuesday withdrew his plea before a Karkardooma court seeking interim bail.

NEW DELHI: Keeping up the attack on the veracity of Sunjay Kapur’s will, his children from actor Karisma Kapoor told the Delhi high court on Tuesday that the document uses a “feminine pronoun” to describe him.The counsel appearing for Samaira and Kiaan Raj made the submission before Justice Jyoti Singh during the hearing of their plea challenging their father’s purported will regarding his assets, reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said a fundamental question is if the will was signed by Sunjay or by a woman in the declaration clause.“The author of the clause could not have been Sunjay Kapur. Clauses in question are not the handiwork or the design of the testator Sunjay Kapur. The female form of testator is used... Testator is now a ‘she’. This is an absurdity. It shows the audacity which people have to present something like this in court. In short, Sunjay Kapur signed this will as a woman?” he said. The only explanation is that it was drafted by a woman, he said.“Unless Sunjay, with an unsound mind incapable of reading... (He) could have never signed this. It is replete with feminine pronouns. It says her last will, her witness, and her presence. The feminine pronoun is used in the most crucial parts to describe him. When you get ‘she’ and ‘her’ in four places, it is incredulous that Sunjay, with all his knowledge, could have drafted this,” the counsel said.He highlighted that the children’s stepmother, Priya Kapur, who is the beneficiary, is silent on who prepared the will. “What is so secretive about it that you don’t want to give it to the beneficiaries? Our case is very clear, that this is not the testator’s will, here we have a fundamental question if the will was signed by the testator or by a woman in the declaration clause,” he added, also questioning why the will was not registered.“If Sunjay Kapur really intended to bequeath all personal assets solely to his wife, what would a man do? He would have registered the will so no one can contest it. But it is not registered,” he said.HC will resume hearing the matter on Wednesday. Last month it had asked Priya Kapur to to give a list of his assets to the court.","Samaira and Kiaan Raj made the submission before Justice Jyoti Singh.

NEW DELHI: Since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) announced its seat-sharing for the upcoming Bihar elections, the regional party alliances seem to be sending mixed signals.While Lok Janshakti Party's (LJP) Chirag Paswan and Rashtriya Lok Morcha's Upendra Kushwaha said all is well, hinting at a smooth alliance, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) Jitan Ram Manjhi’s latest post raised a few eyebrows again, after he said that the seat-sharing had ""weakened"" the morale of the workers.The mood swings began over NDA's seat-sharing arrangement which gave LJP(RV) 29 seats, HAM and RLM on six seats each. Meanwhile, BJP JD(U) got an equal share of 101 seats each.However, leaders of Bihar’s ruling NDA said that seat-sharing arrangements within the coalition have been amicably resolved, with discussions on which party will contest specific seats now entering the final stages.HAM chief Manjhi has not shied away from expressing his dissatisfaction repeatedly, with recently saying that the seat-sharing had ""weakened"" the morale of the workers and left them with ""deep dissatisfaction.""""It is true that we have secured fewer seats, the morale of our workers is weakened, and there is deep dissatisfaction among the workers, which I can only assure them will be compensated for in the future,"" he said in a post on X on Tuesday.However, he expressed confidence in NDA's victory in Bihar saying: But this does not mean that we should push Bihar towards lawlessness. It does not mean that we should rob the people of Bihar of their peaceful nights and their daytime tranquillity.For Bihar, for the people of Bihar, for the pride and honour of Biharis… We are all ready… The NDA will triumph, and Bihar’s honour will endure… 'Victory to Modi, Destined for Nitish',"" he said.Earlier, he had warned of ""repercussions"" in NDA saying, ""What the high command decided, we accept, but by giving six seats, they have undervalued us, it may have repercussions in NDA.""Manjhi had demanded 15 seats for his party.Both Chirag Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha said that the issue of seat allocation among NDA parties had been resolved through ""amicable discussions.""""The issue of seat allocation among NDA parties has been resolved through amicable discussions.

‘Country will be free of Naxalism by 2026,’ Amit Shah, calls on Maoists to give up arms

NEW DELHI: The surrender by CPI(Maoist) politburo member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu along with senior and mid-level cadres is being seen as a sign of a vertical split in the Naxal outfit already grappling with an erosion in its leadership and armed strength as well as a rapidly-shrinking arc of influence.The split was evident when Sonu took the initiative to announce on behalf of the CPI(Maoist) central committee, a willingness of armed cadres to lay down weapons and explore the prospects of peace talks with the Centre; only to be disowned by the Telangana state committee, central committee and a section of Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC).In statements issued subsequently, the latter labelled Sonu’s view in favour of a temporary ceasefire and peace talks as his “individual opinion’ and not the collective view of the CPI(Maoist) leadership. They even described him as a traitor who was not authorised by the outfit to issue a statement under the generic nom de guerre ‘Abhay’ used by its spokesperson.A senior Chhattisgarh govt official told TOI, “The split in Maoist ranks became obvious when the north and west sub-zonal bureau of DKSZC supported Sonu’s stand on denouncing violent extremism and joining the mainstream. However, the south sub-zonal bureau of DKSZC and Telangana state committee opposed it; the main leaders in this camp are Thippiri Tirupathi alias Dev ji, believed to have stepped in as CPI (Maoist) general secretary following the neutralisation of Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju earlier this year, Chandranna and Hidma etc.The stand of Odisha state committee and Jharkhand faction is not clear on this issue, though”.The fissures in CPI(Maoist) top leadership —also fuelled by an apparent succession tussle between Devji and Sonu — may have come at an opportune time for the anti-Naxal forces as they move closer to the target of eliminating armed Left-wing extremism (LWE) from the country by March 31, 2026. Following Sonu’s surrender, the politburo’s strength is down to just three — comprising general secy Dev ji, his aged predecessor Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy and Misir Besra, a rare Jharkhand representative in the CPI(Maoist) apex body where the Telugu-speaking ideologues have always held sway.“The end of violent Naxalism is near. The intensified counter-operations by Chhattisgarh police and the Central forces in the core Naxal area across Abujmarh region have jolted the Maoist leadership and cadres, leaving them with only two options — surrender and join the mainstream or face elimination,” Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai told TOI on Tuesday.The surrender by Sonu, which follows months after his sister in law and central committee member Sujata joined the mainstream, also shows that pragmatism may be replacing ideological affinity.Home minister Amit Shah has already ruled out any ceasefire with the Maoists.","The surrender by CPI(Maoist) politburo member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu along with senior and mid-level cadres is being seen as a sign of a vertical split in the Naxal outfit.

Poll Do you feel that government job opportunities are now more accessible to youth from ordinary families? Yes, very much so No, not really

DEHRADUN: Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday said 26,500 youth have secured government jobs in Uttarakhand over the past four years, which is more than double the total under previous administrations.Dhami made the remarks while distributing appointment letters to 1,456 newly selected candidates, including 109 review officers and assistant review officers selected through the State Public Service Commission, and 1,347 assistant teachers (LT) selected through the Uttarakhand Subordinate Services Selection Commission.He said that during earlier regimes, recruitment processes were riddled with corruption, rigging and bribery, and the cheating mafia flourished.Strict anti-cheating laws brought in by his government have made the system transparent, enabling deserving candidates to secure multiple posts on merit, he said.""These are not just statistics; they are direct evidence. The number of jobs we have given in four years is more than double the total provided by previous governments since the state's creation,"" Dhami said.He claimed the opposition is not happy because children of ordinary families are now securing government jobs purely on merit.""Some of our opposition colleagues are quick to criticise us on every issue. They create false debates because they have no truth to tell. There is no issue at all,"" he said.Dhami also referred to a recent incident in Haridwar, where a candidate allegedly sent 12 questions to his sister through a mobile phone from an exam centre, saying it was wrongly portrayed as a paper leak to mislead the youth.After he agreed to a CBI probe on students' demand, the same people accused him of giving in, he said.The chief minister reaffirmed that his government is committed to protecting the future of the youth and will not allow any conspiracy to succeed.Last month, three pages of a question paper were leaked during the Uttarakhand Subordinate Services Selection Commission's graduate-level exam, sparking protests. The exam was later cancelled and a CBI probe ordered.","Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said 26,500 youth have secured government jobs in Uttarakhand over the past four years.

Poll Do you believe Trump's remarks could impact India-US relations? Yes, it could create tension. No, relations will remain strong.

NEW DELHI: With US President Donald Trump calling Pakistani general Asim Munir “my favourite Field Marshal” at a summit of world leaders in Egypt, Congress on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clarify what kind of friendship he shares with the American leader who lauds a Pakistani, one who is a “killer of Indians”.The party demanded that PM Modi clear the air on Trump’s objectionable remarks.Congress MP Manickam Tagore said Munir has overseen terror plots and cross-border attacks against India.“Under Modi’s watch, the world is not standing with India, it’s now praising those who target India. This is not diplomacy, this is disaster.”AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh said Trump and PM Modi call each other “good friends”, but their friendship is strange considering Trump had hosted Munir for lunch at the White House in June and then met him again in September.“This was the Field Marshal whose inflammatory and communally poisonous remarks provided the backdrop to the Pahalgam terror attacks orchestrated by Pakistan on April 22, 2025. Now in Egypt, Trump called Munir 'my favourite Field Marshal' and gave a special place to the PM of Pakistan. What kind of signal is President Trump sending to India, in spite of Modi's desperate attempts to ingratiate himself with the US President?” he asked.Tagore said, “Where is the ‘strong leader’ who claimed he would isolate Pakistan internationally? When India’s enemies are being endorsed and our PM remains silent, it’s clear that Modi’s foreign policy has collapsed.”","US President Donald Trump called Pakistani general Asim Munir “my favourite Field Marshal” at a summit of world leaders in Egypt.

Bihar elections 2025: How BJP is balancing anti-incumbency with caste outreach in its first candidate list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-2025-how-bjp-is-balancing-anti-incumbency-with-caste-outreach-in-its-first-candidate-list/articleshow/124556654.cms,"BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls

How BJP chose candidates

NEW DELHI: The anti-incumbency wave against several sitting MLAs seems to have played a major role as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shortlisted 71 candidates out of its 101 allotted seats for the upcoming Bihar elections.In Patna alone, the BJP replaced three out of six sitting MLAs and gave a chance to fresh faces. The list came as a surprise to many, as some veterans were missing while several unexpected names appeared.For instance, former cabinet minister and Bihar assembly speaker Nand Kishore Yadav’s name was missing from the Patna Sahib seat. Similarly, many-time MLA Arun Kumar Sinha was dropped from the Kumhrar seat in Patna.""I stand with the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The party has given me a lot, and I have no complaints. I welcome and congratulate the new generation. The people of the Patna Sahib Assembly constituency have elected me seven times in a row. I will never forget the affection and love they have shown me as a BJP candidate. My heartfelt gratitude to everyone,"" Nand Kishore Yadav said after the BJP released its list.Additionally, former Union minister Ram Kripal Yadav, who lost to RJD’s Misa Bharti from the Patliputra constituency in last year’s Lok Sabha elections, has been fielded from Danapur.However, of the 71, a majority, around 50 names, are repeat candidates who contested in the 2020 elections, including Awadhesh Singh from Hajipur, Sanjay Saraogi from Darbhanga), Rana Randhir Singh from Madhuban, and Pawan Jaiswal from Dhaka.The list of candidates also includes nine women, including shooter Shreyasi Singh, who made her debut from Jamui five years ago.In its first list, the BJP seems to strike a balance between social justice and political strategy. The list includes 20 candidates from Other Backward Classes (OBCs) - four Yadavs, eight Vaishyas, one Dangi, four Kushwahas, and three Kurmis.Additionally, 11 candidates from Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) and six from Scheduled Caste (SC)-reserved seats are also fielded in the first phase of the elections.A fair representation has also been given to upper-caste groups, with candidates from Bhumihar, Brahmin, Rajput, and Kayastha backgrounds. Among the upper castes, 15 Rajputs, 11 Bhumihars, seven Brahmins and one Kayastha have been included in the first list.Fresh candidates have been fielded in Purnea, Kishanganj, Rajnagar (SC), and Narpatganj, reflecting a mix of youth representation and caste-balance considerations.Meanwhile, prominent names in the list include deputy chief ministers Vijay Kumar Sinha (Lakhisarai) and Samrat Choudhary (Tarapur), along with Mangal Pandey (Siwan), Tarkishore Prasad (Katihar), Prem Kumar (Gaya Town), and Shreyasi Singh (Jamui).The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases - on November 6 and November 11 - with counting scheduled for November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, compared to 7.89 crore as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, bringing the total number of electors in the August 1, 2025 draft to 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with 15.7% of the vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","BJP shortlisted 71 candidates out of 101 allotted seats for Bihar elections.

NEW DELHI: Building momentum for a desired outcome at the upcoming UN climate summit, India, at a preparatory meet in Brasilia, has emphasised that the 30th session of the annual conference (COP30) next month must reaffirm faith in “multilateralism, equity and collective resolve” to deliver real, measurable action for people and the planet.“Dialogue is important but action is imperative,” said environment minister Bhupender Yadav while articulating the country’s stand at the two-day pre-COP, concluded on Tuesday.His remarks assume significance, specifically in the context of developed countries’ unfulfilled promises of mobilising adequate finance for helping their developing counterparts implement climate action pledges under the Paris Agreement.“We must now focus on implementing ambitious climate measures and, above all, addressing the most pressing challenge: the urgent lack of resources for developing countries to deliver adaptation and mitigation,” said Yadav while addressing a session on the Global Stock Take (GST).GST is a five-year process to assess the world’s collective progress toward the goals of the agreement.COP30 will be held in Belém, Brazil, from Nov 10 to 21 in the shadow of the tariff tussle with the US, a country which has already withdrawn from the Paris Agreement.“As we mark a decade since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, COP30 must send a resolute political message that multilateralism remains the cornerstone of global climate action,” said the minister.Setting the tone for the UN climate summit, he also underlined the importance of adaptation to face the challenge of climate change and appealed to nations to focus on implementation of all actions that had been pledged by them as part of the global deal.“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives... COP30 should be the COP of adaptation,” said Yadav.The two-day pre-COP brought together ministers, senior negotiators and observers to narrow differences on politically sensitive topics and build consensus ahead of the annual summit in Belém.","COP30 will be held in Belém, Brazil, from Nov 10 to 21 in the shadow of the tariff tussle with the US.

Player Metrics and Team Fit

Player Age Contract Status 2025 WAR Team Need Fit Kyle Schwarber 32 Free Agent 3.6 Power DH Jarren Duran 28 Team Control (through 2028) 2.7 Speed / Defensive outfielder

Who Wins the Deal?

Theare once again linked to a potential reunion with Kyle Schwarber, one of the most powerful hitters in baseball and a former Fenway Park favorite. With the Philadelphia Phillies exiting the NLDS and Schwarber heading into free agency, the timing seems right for both sides to explore a comeback. Yet, the move comes with important considerations surrounding roster balance, defense, and the team’s long-term payroll structure.At 32 years old, Kyle Schwarber delivered one of the best seasons of his career, leading the National League in both home runs and RBIs while earning his second All-Star nod. His offensive numbers reaffirmed his reputation as one of baseball’s premier power bats.Technically, the Boston Red Sox wouldn’t need to trade for Schwarber - he’s now a free agent after completing his four-year, $79 million contract with Philadelphia. However, a sign-and-trade scenario could emerge if the Phillies seek to gain value rather than let him walk for nothing.A hypothetical trade could look like this:• Boston Red Sox receive: Kyle Schwarber (DH)• Philadelphia Phillies receive: Jarren Duran (OF) and a mid-tier pitching prospect such as Wikelman GonzalezThis framework would allow Boston to move an excess outfielder while gaining the middle-order slugger the lineup has lacked since Rafael Devers’ departure.For Philadelphia, Duran’s athleticism and defensive range would fill a major need in their outfield, offering youth and control through 2028.1. Elite Power Addition: The Boston Red Sox finished 18th in MLB in home runs (176), well below playoff-caliber teams. Schwarber’s 50-plus homer potential would immediately fix that deficiency.2. Clubhouse and Fan Familiarity: During his 2021 stint with Boston, Schwarber quickly became a fan favorite. His leadership and postseason experience could stabilize a young roster headlined by Roman Anthony and Ceddanne Rafaela.3. Perfect Fenway Fit: Schwarber’s pull-heavy swing from the left side matches perfectly with Fenway Park’s short right-field porch, reminiscent of how David Ortiz thrived in the designated hitter role.1. Luxury Tax Flexibility: Schwarber’s next deal is expected to command between $25 and $35 million per year. The Phillies already have major financial commitments to Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, and Zack Wheeler, so shedding that salary would bring relief.2. Improved Defensive Balance: Duran brings elite speed and defensive versatility - qualities the Phillies currently lack outside of Brandon Marsh.3. Future-Proofing the Roster: Acquiring controllable players would help Philadelphia stay competitive while avoiding the payroll crunch looming in future seasons.In 2025, Boston ranked 23rd in slugging percentage (.398), while Philadelphia finished top five (.448). Adding Schwarber’s production would likely boost Boston’s team OPS by around 20 points - enough to elevate the offense closer to league leaders.From an immediate standpoint, Boston clearly benefits more by acquiring one of baseball’s most dangerous power hitters. Kyle Schwarber’s bat alone could add several wins to the Boston Red Sox offense, potentially improving their team WAR by approximately +4.0 in 2026 projections.For the Phillies, the benefits lie in long-term strategy - saving roughly $30 million annually while replenishing their roster with younger, cost-controlled assets. Although losing Schwarber’s production would sting, the move would give them financial breathing room and lineup balance.If the deal materializes, the Boston Red Sox emerge as short-term winners, gaining the kind of middle-order thunder that has been missing in their lineup.

Jack Roslovic’s missed opportunity with the Oilers





A new start and a second chance





When Jack Roslovic signed a one-year deal with the Edmonton Oilers during their season opener against the Calgary Flames, it caught many by surprise. The skilled forward had spent the entire summer as a free agent, waiting for the right opportunity. But what shocked fans even more was the revelation that Roslovic had reportedly turned down a much larger offer from the same team months earlier—one that could have secured his financial future.According to NHL insider David Pagnotta on Hello Hockey, Jack Roslovic had a three-year offer worth around $3 million annually from the Oilers earlier in the off-season. “He had I think a 3-year offer on the table in the summer… from the Oilers, worth considerably more; I think it was in the $3m range; he thought he was getting a better deal somewhere else,” Pagnotta revealed.That decision, as it turns out, didn’t go as planned. Roslovic bet on himself, hoping for a more lucrative deal from another franchise. Instead, he found himself unsigned deep into the off-season, watching the market dry up. By the time the Oilers circled back, the terms were no longer the same. What could have been a $9 million contract turned into a one-year prove-it deal.Roslovic, a former first-round pick with over 500 NHL games under his belt, eventually changed agents to Justin Duberman and reopened talks with Edmonton.This time, the Oilers needed depth and even-strength production—needs identified by GM Stan Bowman, who saw Roslovic as a low-risk, high-reward addition.“It’s the fourth signing for the busy Bowman this week,” reports noted, following extensions for Connor McDavid , Jake Walman, and Mattias Ekholm. Roslovic’s deal, however, feels different—it’s a test drive, not a commitment.For the 27-year-old forward, this season will be about redemption. If he can rediscover his scoring touch alongside Edmonton’s elite core, he could still cash in big next summer. But for now, it’s hard to view this off-season as anything other than a missed opportunity—a reminder of how quickly fortunes can shift in the NHL.Also Read: Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch delivers brutally honest take on Stuart Skinner after shocking Game 1 overtime loss","Jack Roslovic signed a one-year deal with the Edmonton Oilers during their season opener against the Calgary Flames.

The Kansas City Chiefs secured a 30-17 win over the Detroit Lions at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday, but the victory was overshadowed by a frightening moment involving star tight end Travis Kelce. During the game, Kelce took a brutal fall after a tackle by Lions cornerback Rock Ya-Sin, landing directly on his head and causing immediate concern for his safety. The incident sparked widespread alarm from fans and analysts alike, with many questioning why Kelce wasn’t assessed for a concussion or head injury.The pivotal moment came when Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes connected with Kelce on a beautiful pass, allowing the tight end to charge toward the end zone. As he was pursued by Ya-Sin, the Lions defender brought him down with a hard hit. Kelce flipped upside down in the air and crashed awkwardly on his head, a fall that left many fans holding their breath.Despite the severity of the landing, there was no immediate evaluation of Kelce’s condition on the field, which raised eyebrows on social media. Fans took to X (formerly Twitter) to express their concerns, with one user commenting, “Not sure a player can bounce on his head and not get checked.Perception is that they didn't want to take Kelce off the field in that spot. Is that fair? Probably not, but it is the perception. .” Another tweeted, “Travis Kelce had a great game tonight but sweet Jesus this play had my heart in my throat, this was scary! Hope they investigate Travis Kelce landing on top of his head with his entire body weight and wasn't evaluated at all.” A third comment read, ""Travis Kelce landed on his head and Andy Reid had to tap his helmet to see if he was good. The league might test him in my opinion.""Despite the scary moment, Kelce played through the rest of the game and did not mention the fall in his postgame interview. Instead, he focused on the team’s performance against a tough Lions squad. Kelce expressed pride in how the Chiefs handled the game, stating, “This Lions team is tough, but we were fired up to experience this challenge.” He continued, “I can’t tell you how proud I am of these guys for finding a way to get it done,” and emphasized that when the Chiefs play with “feel and fire,” they are “a tough team to beat. ”While the Chiefs demonstrated their offensive strength throughout the game, Kelce’s well-being remains a key topic of conversation. Given the nature of his fall, questions linger over why he wasn’t more closely monitored by the medical staff, especially considering the increasing focus on player safety in the NFL.","The Kansas City Chiefs secured a 30-17 win over the Detroit Lions on Sunday.

The preseason clash between theon October 14, 2025, will be heavily influenced by the injury situations of both teams. Player availability become a defining factor, shaping the matchups, strategies, and fan expectations leading up to tip-off.The Oklahoma City Thunder enter this preseason contest with a long list of injuries that significantly impacted their depth and rhythm. Key contributors Nikola Topic, Kenrich Williams, and Thomas Sorber are ruled out entirely, forcing the coaching staff to rely on younger and less experienced players.Adding to the challenge, several of Oklahoma City’s most important stars are listed as day-to-day. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams, and Chet Holmgren - core pieces of the Thunder’s lineup - has been limited in recent practices due to lingering injuries, making their status uncertain until game day. Other rotational players, including Jaylin Williams and Isaiah Joe, are also facing short-term injury designations that further complicate lineup decisions.Among the most concerning updates is Jalen Williams’ ongoing recovery from a wrist injury, specifically a torn scapholunate ligament. He had played through the pain late last season before opting for offseason surgery. His rehabilitation had been gradual, with limited contact drills as he worked toward full strength ahead of the regular season.If cleared to play, the expected Thunder starting five will feature Gilgeous-Alexander , Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren, and Isaiah Hartenstein. However, with multiple players nursing injuries, there is substantial uncertainty about whether this lineup will materialize. The question marks surrounding Oklahoma City’s health loom large, affecting both their preparation and confidence before facing Milwaukee.In contrast, the Milwaukee Bucks enter the game in considerably better health. Their only reported injury is to veteran guard Gary Harris, who is listed as day-to-day. His absence is considered minor and unlikely to disrupt the team’s overall chemistry or rotation.This leaves the Milwaukee Bucks with a major advantage in depth and lineup stability. Their predicted starters - Kevin Porter Jr., Gary Trent, Kyle Kuzma, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Myles Turner - represent a balanced and potent unit. With most of their roster available, Milwaukee look to maintain its strong preseason form and head into the regular season with momentum.Heading into this matchup, the Bucks carry an undefeated 3-0 record in the preseason, having defeated the Miami Heat, Detroit Pistons, and Chicago Bulls. Their cohesion and depth have been key factors in those victories. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder experience a mixed preseason at 2-2, struggling to find rhythm amid frequent lineup changes and limited minutes for their star players.Milwaukee’s overall health gives them a clear edge, both on paper and in preparation. The Thunder’s reliance on backup and developing players due to injuries disrupted their chemistry, forcing adjustments that weakened their offensive and defensive structure. As a result, the game narrative centers around whether Oklahoma City’s young roster can overcome adversity against a full-strength Bucks squad.For fans and analysts, this game serves as more than just a preseason tune-up - it is also a test of resilience and roster depth. The Bucks, led by Antetokounmpo and Kuzma, seek to close out their preseason with an unblemished record, while the Thunder aim to compete despite their injury setbacks.Ultimately, the injuries dictate much of the pregame buzz. Milwaukee’s minimal health issues give them a decisive advantage in both experience and energy, while Oklahoma City face the uphill task of fielding a competitive lineup amid uncertainty.Also read: Chet Holmgren Playing Tonight Against the Milwaukee Bucks?

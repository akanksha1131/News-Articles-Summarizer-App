Nepal medic killed in Pahalgam didn’t get time to say he was a foreigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-medic-killed-in-pahalgam-didnt-get-time-to-say-he-was-a-foreigner/articleshow/120592414.cms,"Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: After travelling across three states and an international border, the body of Sudeep Neupane , 27, the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, reached his home in Kalikanagar, a neighbourhood in Butwal, western Nepal, draped in the national flag.He was cremated at Triveni Ghat around noon, with hundreds, including local govt officials, gathered for the last rites. Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India.Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep’s home, the neighbourhood had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when a group of men with guns approached. Witnesses later said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot. “He didn’t get the chance to say he was a foreigner,” said Tejulal Neupane , his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. “He had nothing to do with anything.”His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries. His body was airlifted from Srinagar to New Delhi on Wednesday evening, then flown to Lucknow later that night. From there, it was driven overland to Sunauli before crossing into Nepal. A district magistrate from Uttar Pradesh accompanied the body as far as the border. At Sunauli, it was received by Dadhiram Neupane, Sudeep’s uncle and the ward chairperson of Butwal-14. A police escort led the final leg to Kalikanagar. Butwal mayor Khelraj Pandey, Rupandehi chief district officer Basudev Ghimire , and police chief Ranjit Singh Rathore joined the procession.Sudeep lived in Kalikanagar for most of his life. After his parents, Dhruv Neupane and Reema Pandey, separated, he stayed behind to support his mother. His sister moved to Pokhara after marriage, but Sudeep remained, managing the household finances, arranging care, and eventually becoming its only earning member. He held a public health degree from Dharan and was pursuing further studies in Kathmandu while working part-time on an oral health campaign in rural Nepal.The job did not pay much, but it was steady, and he had grown invested in the work. “He wasn’t just showing up,” said Amrit Bhusal, who runs Modern Samaj Dental, the clinic that had employed him for nearly a year. “He was doing follow-ups. He was tracking cases. He was committed in a way that was unusual.”In Pyuthan, Bhairahawa, and along the outer districts of Rupandehi, his visits became routine. He carried a clipboard and often walked between health posts on foot. When he spoke about public health, his colleagues said, it was in practical terms — transport access, dental hygiene, vaccine follow-up — not in abstract declarations.At home, he was quiet. Neighbours described him as careful and unobtrusive. Rajendra Kumar Acharya, who lives two houses down, remembered a brief conversation before the trip. “He told us he was going to Kashmir. He seemed happy to be taking a break. That’s all.” His 89-year-old grandfather, Khemananda Neupane, learned of the death indirectly. “My wife stopped my prayers,” he said. “She told me something had happened. I didn’t understand at first.”His father, Dhruv Neupane, a teacher at Bhawanipur High School in Butwal-18, was returning from a teachers’ protest in Kathmandu when his phone began to ring. “No one would say it outright,” he said. “Only when I arrived home did I understand what they had been trying to tell me. It doesn’t matter where I live. He was my child.”","Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

Pakistan 'Trained' 2 J&K Locals For Pahalgam Attack, 3 Terrorists Came From Across Border | Report

A man allegedly carrying a cake was spotted entering the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi on Thursday, shortly after India served a persona non grata notice to Pakistani military diplomats in the wake of Pahalgam terror attack.A video doing round on social media, showed the individual being confronted by reporters who questioned the nature of celebrations, refused to comment and hurried past media personnel.Meanwhile, Delhi police removed barricades placed near the Pakistan High Commission.This comes after India noted evidence of cross-border linkages in the attack and said the attack came “in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.”As part of its response, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari with immediate effect, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.Additionally, the overall strength of both countries’ diplomatic missions will be capped at 30 personnel by May 1, down from 55. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy outfit of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba , has claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack , in which most of the victims were civilians. Asif said Thursday’s National Security Committee meeting reflects the gravity of the moment, noting that such sessions are held “when issues related to national security are to be discussed.”India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 28 tourists were killed and many others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran meadow, a scenic area approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, popular among tourists for its natural beauty and serene environment.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army's fatigue uniform targeted their victims based on religion. The assailants reportedly asked individuals to identify themselves by name and recite Islamic verses before opening fire at point-blank range.The attack occurred around 1:30 pm as tourists relaxed in the picturesque meadow, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.","A man allegedly carrying a cake was spotted entering the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi on Thursday.

The resolution termed the brutal killings an “assault on Kashmiriyat and the idea of India”While expressing shock and grief over the loss of 26 innocent lives in the terror attack , the resolution also hailed the “supreme sacrifice” of pony guide Syed Adil Hussain Shah, and lauded the Kashmiri people for their “extraordinary display of moral and material support to all the tourists” across the Valley.The resolution called upon all sections of society across the country to maintain peace and not give in to provocations, while urging govts of other states and UTs to ensure Kashmiris residing or travelling there were “safeguarded against any form of harassment, discrimination, or intimidation”.At the outset, a two-minute silence was observed by all the participants to pay tributes to the victims.Reading out the resolution at a press conference after the all-party meeting, Omar said: “We unequivocally condemn in the strongest possible terms the heinous, inhumane attack in Pahalgam that targeted and killed innocent civilians. Such cowardly acts of brutality against peaceful citizens have no place in society and are a direct assault on the values of Kashmiriyat and the idea of India, which have long been a symbol of unity, peace and harmony in the region.”“We stand unwavering in our commitment to support all efforts in bringing these perpetrators to justice. In doing so, we affirm that no act of terror can ever weaken our resolve or extinguish our indomitable spirit,” the resolution said.Extending condolences to the families that have suffered loss, the resolution also saluted the “valour and selflessness” of the slain pony guide. “He is a true face of Kashmiriyat and Kashmir hospitality,” Omar said.The Kashmiri people’s “resolute unity in condemning the recent attack” and the spontaneous, peaceful demonstrations across J&K exemplified their “unwavering commitment to peace, communal harmony and the rule of law”, and reaffirmed their “collective resolve to foster mutual respect, uphold constitutional values, and work collaboratively for the prosperity and stability of J&K”, the resolution further stated.",An all-party meeting convened by Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Pahalgam massacre adopted a resolution condemning the barbaric act.

Scared tourists found sanctuary in Kashmiri homes that opened their doors to strangers in the aftermath of Tuesday's terror attack in Pahalgam, Over the next three days, many would become friends for life.Rupali Patil , a Pune resident holidaying in Pahalgam, said she was afraid to step out of her hotel room after hearing of the massacre.""Amid the chaos and confusion, I and many others found comfort in the homes of Kashmiris who took the responsibility of keeping us safe. Some of them travelled to get members of our group who were elsewhere back safely,"" she said.Ramdas Khopde, also from Maharashtra, was offered shelter by Adill Malik, of Sopore. “We were looking for safe accommodation when we met this Kashmiri family who not only took us in at a difficult time but refused to take money,” he said.The Maliks said they wanted to send out “a positive message to the world” at a time of crisis in J&K. “What happened in Pahalgam was a cowardly attack, but we want to say that our humanity is stronger than the hate in the hearts of those terrorists,” Adill told TOI over phone from Sopore. “Scores of Kashmiri families have lost their tourism business for the entire season. But at this moment, our priority is safety of all tourists. We won’t let any tourist suffer,” he said.Taxi driver and tourist guide Adil Shaikh, who has been hosting another group of tourists from Maharashtra in his home near Srinagar, said Kashmir’s famed hospitality had been put to the test by terrorists who had nothing to do with the region’s culture and traditions.Most tourists in Srinagar have flights scheduled for this weekend.

'Uncontested polls now rare': EC urges SC to junk NGO plea

NEW DELHI: Election Commission and the Centre Thursday told Supreme Court that SC's 2013 mandate to provide the option of NOTA to voters had turned out to be a ""failed idea"" and that it was preposterous for a PIL to insist on conducting polls even in the rare instance of there being only a single candidate in the fray to know whether she/he secures more votes than NOTA.Appearing for EC, advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told SC, ""NOTA... never impacted any election as a minuscule of voters exercised this option. Every winning candidate got far higher votes than NOTA.""Attorney general R Venkataramani, with additional solicitor general S D Sanjay, said govt concurred with EC.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said, ""Can the Union govt and EC deliberate on prescribing a minimum vote percentage benchmark for winning candidates?""Govt may think of constituting an expert body comprising parliamentarians and domain experts to discuss this issue. Since our Constitution provides for a democracy by majority, is it not desirable that the winning candi-date secures a threshold vote percentage, which would be fixed by Parliament,"" the bench said.Venkataramani said this issue was deliberated upon at length by EC which gave a report on 'one nation one poll'. The recommendations were debated by parliamentarians and there were divergent views, he said.Justice Kant said this may be a hypothetical issue - a single candidate in the fray may secure less votes than Nota in case an election was held instead of declaring that candidate elected unopposed.In its affidavit, EC said a candidate getting elected unopposed from a Lok Sabha constituency was very rare. Since 1991, there was only a single such instance of a candidate getting elected to Lok Sabha unopposed, Dwivedi said. ""Since 1971 till today, that is in the last 54 years, there have been six uncontested elections in total. In the 20 general elections since 1951, there have been only nine uncontested elections,"" he added.Responding to the PIL by NGO 'Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy' seeking conduct of election even when there was only a single candidate in the fray, EC said, ""With the evolution of democracy, a greater number of political parties are contesting elections and, hence, the number of candidates also increases automatically, and voters have become more aware and eager to exercise their right to vote.""The chance of the election being uncontested has become a rarity which is proven from statistical data and, hence, in such a scenario, SC ought not to entertain the present petition.""Nota option is there only when there is an election, EC said, adding, ""Hence, treating Nota as a mandatorily contesting candidate in all direct uncontested elections does not find place in the statute and the same would require legislative amendments in the provisions of Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961.""","Election Commission and the Centre told Supreme Court that SC's 2013 mandate to provide the option of NOTA to voters had turned out to be a ""failed idea"" The bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said, ""Can the Union govt and EC deliberate on prescribing a minimum vote percentage benchmark for winning candidates?""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120600709,imgsize-973025,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-88.jpg"
"Pak says diverting Indus water 'act of war', suspends Simla pact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pak-says-diverting-indus-water-act-of-war-suspends-simla-pact/articleshow/120600607.cms,"Unilateral, unjust & motivated: Pak on India's moves



ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Pakistan unleashed a barrage of counter-retaliatory measures against India Thursday, declaring any move to disrupt water flows under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) an act of war, suspending the 1972 Simla Agreement , and severing all trade, travel and diplomatic ties - including closure of airspace for Indian flights.Pakistan said it will respond to any attempt to divert water with ""full force across the complete spectrum of national power"".This is serious escalation coming from a country that has long maintained red lines about use of its nuclear arsenal, one of which has been the economic strangling of Pakistan. The chief of the strategic plans division of Pakistan army had in 2002 told a European agency that economic strangling included a naval blockade and ""the stopping of the waters of the Indus river"". While there was no official response from Indian authorities to Pakistan's threat, government sources said Pakistan should first unleash ""full force"" against cross-border terrorism .Pakistan maintains the IWT co-signed by the World Bank doesn't allow either country to unilaterally suspend the agreement. As the lower riparian state, Pakistan has concerns about the flow of water from the river system in India but its threat to use full force is likely to exacerbate the already tense situation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.The drastic steps, announced after an emergency National Security Committee (NSC) meeting chaired by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, are in response to India's actions following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam. NSC declared India's IWT suspension ""illegal,"" emphasising the 1960 treaty's inviolability as a World Bank-brokered pact governing six Indus Basin rivers critical for Pakistan's 240 million people. ""Any attempt to stop or divert water flows will be an act of war,"" NSC warned, signalling zero tolerance for disruptions to Pakistan's agricultural lifeline.India, attributing the Pahalgam attack to Pakistan-based terror group The Resistance Front, a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, suspended the IWT, closed the Wagah-Attari border, revoked Saarc visa exemptions for Pakistanis, expelled Pakistani military advisers, and slashed Pakistan's High Commission staff in New Delhi to 30. Pakistan, denying involvement and condemning the attack, mirrored and escalated these measures, framing India's moves as ""unilateral, unjust and politically motivated.""Pakistan closed the Wagah border to all Indian transit, effective immediately, with an April 30 deadline for valid crossings, mirroring India's Attari-Wagah closure. All trade with India, including via third countries, was suspended, devastating cross-border commerce.Airspace was barred to Indian-owned or operated airlines. Saarc visa exemptions for Indians were revoked, except for Sikh pilgrims, with Indian nationals given 48 hours to leave. Indian defence advisers were declared persona non grata, ordered out by April 30, and their posts annulled. The Indian High Commission in Islamabad was capped at 30 staff, matching India's restrictions.The IWT's suspension is the crisis's most alarming flashpoint. Resilient through three wars, the treaty ensures equitable water sharing, with India controlling three eastern rivers and Pakistan the western three. India's move, experts say, risks catastrophic consequences for Pakistan's agriculture-dependent economy. Pakistan's ""act of war"" rhetoric, while partly posturing, reflects the issue's existential stakes.The collapse of the Simla Agreement and diplomatic channels heightens LoC tensions, where skirmishes could spiral without communication. Mutual airspace and trade bans exacerbate economic strain, particularly for traders reliant on Wagah. The crisis also undermines regional cooperation, with Saarc's already fragile framework further eroded by visa restrictions.","Pakistan declares any move to disrupt water flows under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) is an act of war.

Massive anti-Naxal op targets 'core' stronghold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/massive-anti-naxal-op-targets-core-stronghold/articleshow/120600281.cms,"In a first, IAF choppers deployed to airdrop forces deep into forested areas

NEW DELHI: In what could be a decisive battle against Left-wing extremism ahead of the March 2026 deadline to eliminate the scourge, nearly 5,000 security personnel are closing in on the 'core' area of CPI (Maoist) spanning the tri-junction of Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Maharashtra, having ""surrounded"" 300 Naxalites, including top leaders belonging to the dreaded People's Liberation Guerrilla Army and Battalion No. 1.Sources in Chhattisgarh govt said the ""largest ever"" anti-Naxal operation along the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border has been on since Wednesday, with five Naxalites killed so far, three bodies recovered, and several Naxal hideouts busted.The ""decisive"" joint operation is being undertaken by multiple elite units.These include CRPF and its elite CoBRA battalion, Chhattisgarh's District Reserve Guard (DRG), Special Task Force (STF), Bastar Fighters, Maharashtra's C-60 Commandos, and Andhra Pradesh's Greyhounds, based on intelligence inputs pointing to the presence of several top commanders - including Hidma, responsible for several big Naxal attacks in the Abujmarh region; Deva; and Damodar - in the area along with over 150 hardcore Naxals from the PLGA and Battalion No. 1. Senior officers, including CRPF DG G P Singh, are at the site to oversee the operation.For the first time, Indian Air Force helicopters have been deployed to strategically air-drop forces deep into forested areas, marking a significant shift in counter-insurgency tactics. ""The primary objective is to capture or neutralise top Naxal functionaries such as Hidma, responsible for several deadly Maoist attacks in Abujmarh rgion; Deva, and Damodar,"" said a senior police officer.Hidma is regarded as the mastermind behind Naxal operations in South Bastar and is wanted for multiple deadly attacks. Deva, another senior commander, is also a key figure in Naxal hierarchy. Reports suggest Damodar and other top insurgents may also be present in the region. Capturing or eliminating these leaders is seen as crucial to dismantling the Naxal command structure.A CRPF source said the joint operation to crush the last Maoist bastion is carefully timed ahead of start of monsoon season, when the deep forests usually become inaccessible. ""This will ensure Maoists are eliminated well within the March 2026 deadline,"" said an officer.The joint operation focuses on freeing the dense forest regions of Venkatapuram mandal's Veerabhadram, Tadapala, Nichhenna, Wajedu mandal, and Morumuru from the hold of Naxals. Thanks to sustained counter-Naxal operations over the past few years, forces like CRPF, in coordination with the state police concerned, have been moving deeper into what were once 'core' Naxal areas and setting up forward operating bases.The officer shared that over 5,000 security personnel are involved in the extensive operation, ""which has reportedly surrounded over 300 Naxalites"". Intermittent exchange of fire continues, and forces are working on encircling the remaining Left-wing extremists. ""Intelligence suggests that senior Naxal commanders from Battalion No. 1 have been surrounded, raising hopes of major breakthroughs,"" said a senior officer of the Chhattisgarh police.Security forces have cordoned off the entire area and are advancing deeper into the jungle to exert pressure on Naxals, said an officer.","Nearly 5,000 security personnel are closing in on the 'core' area of CPI (Maoist) spanning the tri-junction of Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Maharashtra.

JAISALMER: Radha Bheel, a 27-year-old Pakistani national living near Jaisalmer, is faced with the prospect of being separated from her toddler son just days after their emotional reunion. And the cause of her despair is India's decision to revoke Pakistani visas with immediate effect in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, with all Pakistani nationals ordered to return to their country by April 27.Radha's plight is shared by many Pakistani Hindu families in Rajasthan who are on short term visas (STVs). In Jaisalmer alone, a pall of gloom has descended over 1,200 Pakistani citizens on STVs.As for those on long term visas (LTVs), ASP (CID) Narpat Singh, who's also the Foreign Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), said his office is awaiting orders from home ministry and assured that long-term visa holders need not be concerned for now.Radha, her husband Raju Ram (30), and their two daughters, aged 8 and 7, arrived in India on an LTV in Feb 2023. However, the couple's son, Ghanshyam, who was then less than two months old, was denied a visa, as were Raju Ram's parents. It took two years for Ghanshyam and his grandparents to finally arrive in India on an STV on April 6.""I waited for two years to hold my baby but will have to bear parting with him once again,"" she told TOI, tears streaming down her face.In Jaisalmer, Dilip Singh Sodha, a refugee who fled Pakistan to escape religious persecution, said, ""You may as well shoot us here.

While filming a family member enjoying the ride, they inadvertently captured chilling footage of terrorists gunning down innocent people.Nihal, his cousins and the mother of one of the cousins reached the valley around 2.20pm and immediately went for the zip-lining ride. ""I was waiting at the starting point and focusing on my cousin who went on the zip-line before me. It was when she reached middle of ride that I heard a gunshot.

It was then that I realised that something was seriously wrong,"" said Nihal.He said his cousin and her mother, by then at the other end of the zip-line, fled along with other people as gunshots shattered the serenity of the beautiful meadow.Nihal said a local woman told him to escape fast, and he, along with his other cousin, climbed over a fence and ran down the slopes. On reaching a safe spot downhill, he came to know that a local Kashmiri resident had provided shelter to his cousin and her mother in his house. He then travelled around 2km to reach them.But it was only later when Nihal examined the video that he noticed chilling images of a terrorist shooting tourists in the background. A man in white dress was gunned down by a terrorist, with the clip recording sounds of repeated gunfire. The time the video logged was 2.25pm.","Nihal, his cousins and the mother of one of the cousins went for the zip-lining ride.

Five key decisions taken at CSS meet

The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism .

. The integrated checkpost Attari will be closed with immediate effect. Those who have crossed over with valid endorsements may return through that route before 1st May 2025.

Pakistani nationals will not be permitted to travel to India under the SAARC visa Exemption scheme. Any SPES visas issued in the past to Pakistani nationals are deemed cancelled. Any Pakistani national currently in India under SPES visa has 48 hours to leave India.

The Defence, Military, Naval, and Air Advisors in the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi are declared persona non grata. They have a week to leave India.

India will be withdrawing its own Defence, Navy and Air advisors from the Indian high commission in Islamabad. These posts in the respective High Commissions are deemed annulled.

How will Indus Water Treaty suspension impact Pakistan?

The Indus River network, comprising the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, serves as Pakistan's principal water resource, supporting a population of tens of millions.

Pakistan relies substantially on this water supply for irrigation, farming and potable water. The agricultural sector contributes 23% to Pakistan's national income and supports 68% of its rural inhabitants.

The Indus basin supplies 154.3 million acre-feet of water yearly, which is vital for irrigating extensive agricultural areas and ensuring food security.

Any interruption to water flow would significantly impact Pakistan's agricultural sector, a crucial component of its economy and rural livelihoods.

Reduced water availability will likely lead to lower crop yields, food shortages, and economic instability in rural areas dependent on farming.

Pakistan already faces critical water management issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity.

The country’s water storage capacity is low, with major dams like Mangla and Tarbela having a combined live storage of only about 14.4 MAF, which is just 10% of Pakistan’s annual water share under the treaty.

The suspension exacerbates these vulnerabilities by cutting off a guaranteed water supply, leaving Pakistan with fewer options to manage its water needs.

How closing Attari border will impact trade?

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack , the central government on Wednesday suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan — one of five key decisions taken at the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""The CCS reviewed the overall security situation and directed all forces to maintain high vigil. It resolved that perpetrators of this attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account. As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror or conspired to make them possible,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misry.Attari, located just 28 kilometres from Amritsar, is India’s first Land Port and the only permitted land route for trade with Pakistan. Spread across 120 acres and directly connected to national highway-I, the check post has played a crucial role in cross-border trade, particularly in imports from Afghanistan.The Attari-Wagah corridor has witnessed fluctuating figures in trade and passenger movement over the years. In 2023-24, the land port recorded trade worth Rs 3,886.53 crore with 6,871 cargo movements and 71,563 passenger crossings.The Attari Land Port has long served as a critical trade conduit between India and Pakistan, handling a variety of goods. Key Indian exports through the route include soybean, chicken feed, vegetables, red chilies, plastic dana, and plastic yarn. On the other side, imports from Pakistan and beyond have largely comprised dry fruits, dry dates, gypsum, cement, glass, rock salt, and various herbs.The closure of the port is expected to significantly impact the movement of these goods, particularly affecting small traders and manufacturers who rely on this cross-border exchange. However, volumes have generally declined since 2018-19, reflecting ongoing tensions and disruptions.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh had assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.",The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.

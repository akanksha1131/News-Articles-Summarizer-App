CJI recalls HC judge who'd do everything except decide cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-recalls-hc-judge-whod-do-everything-except-decide-cases/articleshow/123842098.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ten-day long educative debate before a five-judge Supreme Court bench on the Presidential Reference seeking the apex court's opinion on the judiciary's power to fix timelines for the President and governors as well as grant 'deemed assent' to pending bills was a serious affair but was not shorn of humour.When a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar broke for a discussion, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was going full steam, said, ""I wish I had taken some classes on lip reading. When judges discuss something among themselves when we are arguing, we become apprehensive.""CJI Gavai said, ""We were not discussing something that was argued during the last three weeks. It is not like a colleague of ours in Bombay HC, who used to draw sketches during long arguments. He used to paint and do carpentry and what not, except deciding cases.""When Mehta was jumping from paragraph to paragraph of his rejoinder and skipping many in between while speed-reading with explanations to meet the deadline for concluding his arguments, the CJI said, ""I became an SC judge in 2019. Even after six years, I am unable to keep pace with Delhi lawyers, who read the first sentence and then the tenth one before moving on to some other sentence.""""Four of us on the bench, except for Justice Narasimha, find it difficult to match the speed of SC lawyers. Sometimes we feel lost. We will read the entire written submissions which run into more than 5,000 pages including the annexures,"" he said.Justice Narasimha, who was practising in SC prior to his elevation as a judge, said, ""This is a message for the next generation lawyers, who should not adopt this practice of skip reading.""The AG cited a Greek mythological concept - Procrustean Bed - to persuade SC not to create space for states to seek amendment of the Constitution, the sole prerogative of Parliament, through judicial verdicts.Procrustes was a Greek mythological giant who tied travellers to an iron bed. If their legs protruded out, he used to cut them to fit them to the size of the bed. If it fell short, he used to stretch them. The terminology Procrustean Bed is used to explain a phenomenon when a provision is moulded as per the demand of a situation.Mehta said if timelines are fixed for governors, who are there to protect the Constitution and prevent unconstitutional acts of govt, it would result in self-destruction and counterproductive. Governors exercise the discretion of withholding assent only in rare situations and history tells us that more than 94% of bills were assented to and the assent was withheld only to 20 out of over 17,000 bills in the last 55 years.","Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, ""I wish I had taken some classes on lip reading"" Chief Justice B R Gavai: ""I became an SC judge in 2019.

Amit Shah: Link passports to fast-track immigration plan at time of issue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shah-link-passports-to-fast-track-immigration-plan-at-time-of-issue/articleshow/123841898.cms,"India Declares NEW War, New immigration Law Rocks Parliament | Watch

New Delhi: Launching the 'fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme' (FTI-TTP), which enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates, at five more international airports in the country, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday suggested that its coverage be maximised by enabling resident Indians and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) to sign up for FTI-TTP at the state of issuing of passports or OCI cards itself.With the inclusion of Lucknow, Amritsar, Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruchirappalli and Kozhikode international airports, the number of airports covered under the programme has risen to 13.First launched at the Delhi international airport in June 2022, the programme added seven more airports - covering Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad - in Jan this year. Shah said the facility will be available at the upcoming Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports as well.Addressing the FTI-TTP inauguration event at the five airports through video-conference, the home minister said around 3 lakh persons had registered under the programme and over 2.6 lakh travellers, both inbound and outbound, had availed of it, enabling them to clear immigration in 30 seconds, with no long queues or manual checks.""The next phase of the effort to enhance passenger convenience by integrating PM Narendra Modi's vision of 'speed, scale, and scope' into the FTI-TTP is starting from today,"" he said, adding the programme also introduces foreign travellers to the positive changes taking place in India.Drawing attention to the 60% increase in international passenger traffic over the past 11 years of the Modi govt - from 5 crore in 2014 to 8.1 crore in 2024 - the home minister said the figure of 2.6 lakh who have availed of the FTI-TTP facility is too small, leaving tremendous scope to maximise its coverage.Shah said everyone who has availed of the programme has voiced appreciation. ""Our goal should be to ensure that every Indian citizen and every OCI cardholder takes advantage of this facility,"" he added.""To achieve this, I request that when issuing passports and OCI cards, we can also conduct this registration (under FTI-TTP), so that people don't have to come twice for fingerprinting or document verification. Whenever they travel, they can simply use their passport. I think we must further explore the technological possibilities to maximize the number of people who can take advantage of this programme.""",FTI-TTP enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates.

"Govt bulldozing bills, says Congress, but is mum on JPC participation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-bulldozing-bills-says-congress-but-is-mum-on-jpc-participation/articleshow/123841802.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chiming with the arguments of Trinamool Congress and others for boycott of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the bill on dismissal of jailed ministers and chief ministers, Congress accused the governing BJP of using parliamentary committees to bulldoze legislations without giving any space to arguments of opposition parties. It lamented that govt is ""having its way and say both"", which is not acceptable in a democracy like India.Congress breaking of silence on the JPC after the boycott announced by TMC, Samajwadi Party, Sena UBT and AAP suggests that the largest INDIA bloc player may be veering towards the view of its allies, even as it has not announced a decision on whether it will participate in the crucial panel. Amid uncertainty, Parliament has not notified the committee despite a passage of nearly 20 days.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal told TOI, ""In a parliamentary democracy, opposition can also put forward its views in committees. But look at the way waqf bill was passed in the JPC. In these committees, opposition parties are not being allowed to raise issues. It may be an extreme characterisation by me. But the fact is that the govt side is bulldozing bills. In a healthy democracy, it is not so.""The argument echoes the TMC-led 'boycott bloc', which recently announced it will not join the JPC because such panels have become a BJP ""stunt"" to use its majority to force bills.Congress has not yet given its view on the JPC, even though there has been an internal opinion that the party should join the panel.Buttressing his charge against BJP, Venugopal said the Modi govt did not allow a discussion on special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar in the recent Monsoon session of Parliament, despite over 240 MPs demanding it.""Even the 130th constitutional amendment bill presented by the home minister was passed amid din. Do you expect this in a democracy like India? Regrettably, it is not the old era where Parliament discussed all the issues. However, we feel there should be a consensus among all opposition parties on the JPC. We will discuss it with INDIA bloc members and appropriate decisions will be taken,"" he said.It is to be seen if TMC, SP, Sena UBT and AAP can be persuaded to rescind their decision to boycott. Else, it may mean that Congress would also join them. DMK, NCP, CPM are said to be waiting for Congress to take a call. TMC started the push for boycott after the bill was tabled in Lok Sabha, but Congress and some allies were confident that their view of joining the panel would prevail. But since then, the 'boycott bloc' has grown. This seems to have nudged Congress too.","Congress accuses the governing BJP of using parliamentary committees to bulldoze legislations.

ICSSR's research call on family system echoes Sangh concern,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/icssrs-research-call-on-family-system-echoes-sangh-concern/articleshow/123841616.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India's family structures are facing pressure from urbanisation, migration and changing lifestyles, the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) has called for major research on 'kutumb vyavastha' - the traditional Indian family system, in an initiative which reflects Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 's concern about the protection of traditional family values.Under the scheme ""Family and Family System in India"" which it will launch on Friday, 150 projects will be granted financial support of a maximum of Rs 30 lakh each, with a total allocated budget of Rs 11.25 crore.The move comes as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) prepares to mark its centenary in 2025-26 by giving a fillip to its 'Panch Parivartan' agenda, which highlights five areas of change: family values, social harmony, eco-friendly living, self-reliance and civic duties. ""The joint family system (kutumb vyavastha) is not just a living arrangement. It is an ecosystem of emotional bonds, economic support, intergenerational care and value transmission,"" said Dhananjay Singh, member secretary, ICSSR.He added that the family has always been ""the first physical and psychological space of socialisation, ethical experience and community interdependence"".The ICSSR has invited studies from sociology, anthropology, law, psychology and culture scholars for the purpose.Researchers are expected to look at 19 themes, such as 'Kutumb Prabodhan' (family awakening), the role of women in keeping cultural values alive, inter-generational value transmission, and the strain on caregiving in today's fast-paced, globalised and highly competitive world. Topics such as technology's effect on families, the balance between nuclear and joint households, migration-linked disruptions, generational conflicts, rising concerns around loneliness and social isolation, ageing populations and mental health challenges will also be part of the wide-ranging agenda.By stressing the family as the first space for ethical learning and community bonding, the initiative ties in with RSS's view that ""harmonious families create harmonious communities"".For the Sangh, its centenary is not just a symbolic milestone but a chance to spread this idea widely as part of its larger social outreach.Singh said that while modern work culture and urban life have weakened some traditions, Indian families remain ""deeply rooted in emotions, care, devotion and sacrifice"". The ICSSR, he said, aims to generate studies that both capture these changes and revive indigenous knowledge, making family systems central to India's social and cultural future. The scale of funding - higher than in many recent ICSSR thematic calls - signals that family and community studies are now being treated as a national research priority.","Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) has called for major research on 'kutumb vyavastha' - the traditional Indian family system. 150 projects will be granted financial support of a maximum of Rs 30 lakh each, with a total allocated budget of Rs 11.25 crore.

Asia Cup press conference: Suryakumar Yadav on playing Pakistan, Sanju Samson, India Playing XI

Poll Who was the standout performer for India against UAE? Kuldeep Yadav Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: In a rare incident during the Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and UAE at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday, UAE batter Junaid Siddique was initially given out after a sharp direct throw from India’s wicketkeeper Sanju Samson found him short of the crease. However, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav chose to withdraw the appeal when Siddique pointed out that bowler Shivam Dube’s towel had slipped from his waistband during the run-up.The unusual moment came in the 13th over when Siddique attempted a wild swing at Dube’s short-pitched delivery. Replays from the third umpire confirmed that his foot was outside the crease, and the “OUT” signal was flashed on the big screen before India opted to overturn the appeal.The gesture did not impact the match result, as UAE were bundled out for just 57 runs soon after.Kuldeep Yadav, returning to white-ball action after warming the bench during India’s five-Test tour of England, was the star with the ball. The left-arm spinner demolished the UAE batting order with sensational figures of 4 for 7 in just 2.1 overs.Jasprit Bumrah set the tone for India’s dominance, removing Kerala-born opener Alishan Sharafu with a pinpoint yorker.Sharafu had top-scored for UAE with 22 off 17 balls, including three fours and a six, before Bumrah’s lethal delivery ended his innings. Once Sharafu departed, the UAE batting line-up collapsed swiftly, with wickets tumbling in quick succession.Chasing a modest target of 58, India cruised to a 9-wicket win, starting their Asia Cup 2025 campaign in emphatic fashion.India will next face arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday in Dubai, a contest already billed as the marquee clash of the group stage.","India beat UAE by nine wickets in their Asia Cup 2025 opener.

Balen's message for Nepali youth





With Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stepping down amid the deadly student-led “GenZ protests,” attention has shifted to Kathmandu’s young mayor, Balendra Shah, as online campaigns promote him as the Himalayan nation’s next leader.Popularly known as “Balen,” the 35-year-old is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022. He won as an independent candidate, becoming the first to hold the post without party backing.An engineer by training, Balen holds a degree in civil engineering and has an India connection - he pursued structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in Karnataka. Before entering politics, he was active in Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using his music to highlight corruption and inequality.In June 2023, he drew national attention by banning the screening of Indian films in Kathmandu over a dialogue in the movie Adipurush.In a Facebook post, Shah on Tuesday appealed to protesters to exercise restraint, noting that their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and other ministers has already been met.He cautioned against further damage to public and private property, saying, “The loss of the country’s wealth is, in reality, a loss of our own property. It is now essential that we all act with restraint.”Shah’s appeal comes as nationwide “GenZ” protests intensify, with young demonstrators demanding accountability over corruption, restrictions on freedoms and police violence.

Utah Valley University locked down







Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at Utah Valley University on Thursday.Kirk was addressing students under a tent decorated with slogans reading “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong” when a single gunshot was fired, striking him in the neck.Disturbing video footage from the scene shows him clutching his wound as students screamed and fled the area.Trump confirmed Kirk’s death shortly after the incident and announced that American flags would be flown at half-mast until Sunday as a mark of respect.Authorities have not yet released details on the shooter or the motive behind the attack.FBI Director Kash Patel said that the suspect, who was detained, has been released after interrogation.He had announced the arrest of a person from the scene, praising law enforcement’s quick action. “The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,” Patel had written on X.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said officials believe only one “person involved” in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. “No information suggests a second person,” he stated Wednesday.However, investigators are still seeking anyone with more details. A person of interest is currently in custody and being interviewed, according to the governor.President Trump, who counted Kirk as a key political ally, paid tribute to him both on Truth Social and in an interview with the New York Post.“No one understood or had the heart of the youth in the United States better than Charlie,” Trump wrote online. “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me.”Trump ordered American flags flown at half-mast until Sunday evening after the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk. On Truth Social, @Trump shared that the ""Legendary"" debater had been killed, expressing condolences to his wife Erika and young family. He has been closely monitoring the situation as it develops and acknowledged Kirk's impactful legacy.Trump described Kirk as “a very, very good friend” and “a tremendous person,” urging supporters: “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk.”Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who was present at the event, said Kirk had just taken a question from the audience when the shot rang out.“As soon as I saw Charlie go back, you realise that it was a shot,” Chaffetz told Fox News. “It wasn’t as if there was a whole bunch of gunfire. It was one shot.”He added that security at the event appeared light, with only a small police presence.Videos posted to social media show panic erupting as the shot was fired. Students screamed, ducked for cover, and rushed across a nearby fountain to escape the courtyard.Some in the crowd attempted to rush to Kirk’s aid as security hustled him away. A woman in a red “MAGA” hat was seen in tears, while others were filmed praying near the scene.Images circulating online showed an older white man being led away by police, with one officer reportedly heard saying, “He said he shot him, but I don’t know.”However, law enforcement later clarified that this individual was not the suspect. Confusion remains over whether the gunman fled the campus or is still in hiding.Politicians from across the spectrum denounced the shooting. Vice President JD Vance wrote: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said disputes should be resolved “through debate, not violence.”Democratic leaders also expressed support. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the attack “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible,” while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.”UVU, Utah’s largest public university with nearly 47,000 students, was closed after the attack. Administrators confirmed the campus would remain under tight security while the search for the shooter continued.The event had already been controversial: a petition calling on the university to bar Kirk from speaking attracted nearly 1,000 signatures. Officials defended the appearance as an exercise in free speech and debate.","Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at Utah Valley University on Thursday.

2025 QV9 flyby highlights how asteroids move near Earth

Space enthusiasts and astronomers worldwide are keeping a close watch on the skies as NASA confirms the approach of a massive asteroid. Known as asteroid 2025 QV9, this celestial object, discovered only recently, measures roughly the size of a large passenger airplane and is set to make a remarkably close flyby of Earth on September 10. Traveling at incredible speeds through the vast emptiness of space, the asteroid’s highly anticipated passage has captured the attention of scientists, researchers, and curious space watchers alike. Despite its significant size and high velocity, experts emphasize that 2025 QV9 poses no immediate danger to our planet, remaining well outside the official threshold for potentially hazardous objects. Its upcoming flyby serves as a vivid and striking reminder of the importance of near-Earth object monitoring programs and the constant global vigilance required to track potential asteroid threats in the future.Asteroid 2025 QV9 measures approximately 100 feet (30 meters) wide and travels at a staggering speed of 10,319 miles per hour. Its closest approach will be about 1,250,000 miles from Earth—roughly five times the distance to the Moon according to NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).Although that distance might sound safe, space agencies consider it relatively close in astronomical terms. 2025 QV9 belongs to the Aten asteroid group, a category of near-Earth objects that frequently cross our planet’s orbit.These asteroids are of particular interest due to their potential to interact with Earth in the long term.NASA classifies an asteroid as hazardous if it comes within 7.4 million kilometers (4.6 million miles) and is wider than 85 meters (279 feet). While 2025 QV9 exceeds the width threshold, it remains well outside the danger zone for its upcoming flyby. Nonetheless, small orbital changes over time make continuous monitoring essential.Even asteroids that are harmless today are closely watched by scientists and space agencies worldwide. A minor deviation in an asteroid’s trajectory could transform a safe flyby into a potential threat decades down the line, posing risks to Earth and nearby satellites. Continuous observation allows astronomers to refine their impact prediction models, plan mitigation strategies if needed, and coordinate international response efforts.Asteroid monitoring also contributes to broader scientific knowledge, including the study of asteroid composition, orbital dynamics, collision probabilities, and the mechanics of solar system objects. Understanding these factors helps scientists anticipate future near-Earth object (NEO) encounters more accurately and develop protective technologies.Agencies like NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) are at the forefront of asteroid tracking. India’s space program is also ramping up its efforts. ISRO Chairman S. Somanath recently shared plans to study larger asteroids, including the notable Apophis, which is set to make a close approach in 2029. India aims to collaborate on international missions and may even send spacecraft to land on asteroids in the near future.These collaborations ensure that nations can share data, resources, and expertise to protect Earth from potential asteroid threats while advancing planetary science.The approach of asteroid 2025 QV9 highlights the hidden dynamics of our solar system. Even seemingly calm skies can host objects moving at incredible speeds, silently passing by. For astronomers and enthusiasts alike, such events provide a rare opportunity to observe near-Earth objects and study their behavior.Tonight, stargazers will watch the silent passage of 2025 QV9, a reminder of the importance of continuous asteroid tracking. While the asteroid poses no immediate danger, its flyby emphasises the need for vigilance in monitoring the countless space rocks that share our cosmic neighborhood.","Asteroid 2025 QV9 measures approximately 100 feet (30 meters) wide and travels at a staggering speed of 10,319 miles per hour.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday slammed the Congress over an AI-generated video featuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his late mother Heeraben, accusing the party of taking a vow to “repeatedly insult” her. The clip was posted by the Bihar unit of the Congress.“The Congress has sworn to repeatedly insult the late mother of PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji. When they found nothing, they showed his mother in a fake video, making her say words that are a complete insult to her,” the Bihar BJP posted on X, alleging that such videos were being circulated at the behest of “arrogant” and “anarchic” Rahul Gandhi.The clip, shared on Wednesday, begins with an AI version of PM Modi going to sleep after declaring that the day’s “vote chori” (vote theft) is done. He then dreams of his mother, and the AI version of Heeraben appears.“First you forced me to stand in long queues during demonetisation and made a reel of washing my feet. Now you are doing politics in Bihar in my name. You are getting banners of my ‘insult’ printed. You are again doing drama in Bihar. How low will you stoop?” she asks, before “PM Modi” hurriedly wakes up.Gandhi has repeatedly accused the Election Commission of indulging in “vote chori” to benefit the BJP — a charge the poll body has firmly denied.This comes days after the prime minister was abused during a Congress-RJD rally in the poll-bound state, with his mother being mentioned. He hit back soon after, calling the remarks an insult not only to him but to “every mother, sister, and daughter of the country,” adding that the people of Bihar shared his anguish.Heeraben Modi passed away in December 2022 at the age of 99.","The clip was posted by the Bihar unit of the Congress.

First launched at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here in June 2022, the program had added seven more airports — covering Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad — in January this year. Shah said the facility will be available at the upcoming Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports as well.Addressing the FTI-TTP inauguration event at five airports through video-conference, Shah said around 3 lakh persons had registered under the program and over 2.6 lakh travellers, both inbound and outbound, had availed of it, enabling them to clear immigration in as little as 30 seconds and with no long queues or manual checks.“The next phase of the effort to enhance passenger convenience by integrating Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji’s vision of ‘speed, scale, and scope’ into the FTI-TTP is starting from today,” he said, adding that the program introduces foreign travellers to the positive changes taking place in India.Drawing attention to the 60% increase in international passenger traffic over the past 11 years of Modi govt — from a little over 5 crore in 2014 to 8.1 crore in 2024 — Shah said the figure of 2.6 lakh who have availed of the FTI-TTP facility is too small, leaving tremendous scope to maximise its coverage. Stating that everyone who has availed of the program has voiced appreciation, the home minister said “our goal should be to ensure that every Indian citizen and every OCI cardholder takes advantage of this facility”.“To achieve this, I request that when issuing passports and OCI cards, we can also conduct this registration (under FTI-TTP), so that people don’t have to come twice for fingerprinting or document verification. Whenever they travel, they can simply use their passport. I think we must further explore the technological possibilities to maximize the number of people who can take advantage of this program,” he added.",FTI-TTP enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday expressed concern over the victory of the Jamaat-e-Islami’s student wing in the Dhaka University (DU) student union polls, questioning whether India may soon have to deal with a Jamaat-led government in Bangladesh.“This may have registered as barely a blip on most Indian minds, but it is a worrying portent of things to come,” the former diplomat wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of a news report on the win.Tharoor noted that voters were increasingly turning to the Jamaat-e-Islami not out of religious zeal but because they saw the party as untainted by the corruption and misgovernance associated with the two traditional rivals — the now-banned Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). “How will this play out in the February 2026 general elections? Will New Delhi be dealing with a Jamaat majority next door?” he asked.According to Bangladeshi news outlet Prothom Alo, candidates backed by Islami Chhatra Shibir, contesting under the banner of the Oikkoboddho Shikkharthi Jote (United Students’ Alliance), won nine of the 15 key posts, including vice president (VP), general secretary (GS) and assistant general secretary (AGS).For the VP post, Abu Shadik Kayem secured 14,042 votes, defeating his closest rival — BNP student wing leader Abidul Islam Khan — who polled 5,708 votes.The report noted that during the Awami League’s 15-year rule, Shibir could not operate openly on the Dhaka University campus, with its suspected activists often facing assaults in residential halls.But following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led government in August 2024 after a student-led movement, the Shibir resurfaced publicly.

NEW DELHI: Barely weeks after govt increased renewal charges of older vehicles, the road transport ministry has proposed a steep hike in fitness test fee of private vehicles over 20 years and higher for medium and heavy commercial vehicles which are more than 15 years old.While owners of 20-year-old cars would have to cough up Rs 2,600 for the test, for trucks and buses, it would cost Rs 25,000.TOI has learnt that the intent behind this move is to disincentivise people to hold on to their old vehicles. Sources said the govt is also considering having proper fitness tests for private vehicles once they attain 15 years. Currently, RTOs give fitness certificates by just taking a look at the condition of private vehicles rather than putting them through tests.Sources said the ministry is looking into the option of whether mandatory automated technical tests should be rolled out in a staggered manner, such as starting with cars.As per the draft norm published by the ministry, there is a proposal to introduce separate fee slabs for commercial vehicles that are over 10, 13, 15 and 20 years. At present, the testing fee for commercial vehicles above 20 years is the same as that for 15-year-old vehicles.It has proposed to double the testing fee for certification of fitness for vehicles that are more than 20 years old.Under the Motor Vehicle Rules, fitness test for commercial vehicles is mandatory every two years up to eight years and annually thereafter. In case of private vehicles this test is required at the time of registration renewal, which is after 15 years, and then every five years. ""We have been urging the govt to change this regime, and fitness test for private vehicles should also be made mandatory after 10 years. Whether it's a private or commercial vehicle, fitness must be the priority. Any unfit vehicle is a risk for all road users,"" said Anil Chhikara, the former deputy transport commissioner of Delhi.","The intent behind this move is to disincentivise people to hold on to their old vehicles.

Gadkari said that at present, an average of 16,830 vehicles are being scrapped monthly, and the private sector has invested Rs 2,700 crore towards this effort.""The steel scrap that we import is 60 lakh tonnes. And apart from this, the very important metals, where there is a shortage and which you have to bring from outside, can also be accessed through scrapping,"" Gadkari said.","Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari asked auto companies to give ""reasonably good"" discounts to consumers if they scrap their old, polluting vehicles.

NEW DELHI: Nearly 66% of live births in 2023 were first-order births - a terminology used to refer to the first born - and just 3.6% accounted for fourth or higher order births, according to the Sample Registration System (SRS) Statistical Report 2023. In terms of spacing of births, it stated, 53.6% of second and higher order births occurred 36 months or more after the previous live birth.Just 1.8% of second and higher-order live births occurred within 10-12 months of the previous live birth.The birth order - related to the chronological sequence of a child's birth within a family, such as first-born, middle child or youngest - and birth interval are seen as a critical information on spacing of children and level of fertility. They are are also important factors for the wellbeing of a mother and her child's development.In 2022 in India, 64% of current live births were first-order births, 23% second-order births, 8.3% third-order births and 4.7% fourth or higher-order births.The data for 2023 showed that 66% of current live births were first-order births, 22.9% second-order births, 7.5% third-order births and 3.6% fourth or higher-order births.Among the bigger states and UTs, Telangana had the highest percentage (82.4) of first-order births, while Kerala the lowest at 47.5%.Kerala had the highest percentage of second and third order births at 34.9% and 13.3%, respectively.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has always stuck to the cardinal constitutional principle of separation of powers, a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai said Thursday, following the Centre's emphasis on the executive, legislature and judiciary sticking to their domains. ""Judicial activism"" should not become ""judicial terrorism"", the CJI said.The bench of CJI Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said, ""We believe in the separation of powers between the executive, legislature and judiciary. However, if one wing ...fails to discharge its duties, Supreme Court as custodians of the Constitution and protector of rights, cannot remain a mute spectator.""This response from SC came after solicitor general Tushar Mehta repeatedly pleaded with bench that SC fixing timelines for the President and governors to act on bills, not specified in Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, would amount to judiciary amending the provisions, a task exclusively reserved for Parliament.Before reserving its opinion on the Presidential Reference which sought SC's opinion on 14 questions relatable to an unprecedented April 8 decision of a two-judge SC bench fixing timelines for the President and governors, the CJI B R Gavai said, ""I am a strong believer in separation of powers.I have been declaring in public that judicial activism should not turn into judicial terrorism.""Interestingly, the bench said it disagreed with an argument of opposition-led states that SC, in its jurisdiction to render opinion to the President under Article 143, cannot reverse the two-judge bench's April 8 judgment, which apart from fixing timelines for the President and governors, had granted deemed assent to 10 bills pending for a long time with the Tamil Nadu governor.The bench said, ""We will answer the President's queries and will declare the law, which will hold the field for future. We will not decide the facts of the case and the correctness of the decision of the two-judge bench. But the interpretation of Articles 200 and 201 by the two-judge bench is a view which is not binding on the five-judge bench.""Mehta said the President is not questioning the correctness of the April 8 judgment and is only seeking opinion of the apex court on the correctness of the law laid down by the two-judge bench on timelines and whether the judiciary can grant deemed assent to bills which is the sole prerogative and discretion of governors and the President.Both attorney general R Venkataramani and Mehta acknowledged that governors cannot sit idle on a bill indefinitely. However, they argued that in certain situations, a governor is entitled to use his discretionary power to withhold assent to a bill if, in his view, it could subvert or undermine the Constitution, erode democracy, have national implications, or trigger a dispute with other states.Venkataramani said the constitutional mechanism under Articles 200 and 201 has worked smoothly for over 75 years in which more than 94% of bills have been assented to by governors or the President. Why would the court disturb the settled mechanism which has worked well because of some stray instances of delay by governors, he asked.The AG argued that if because of certain instances of delay or withholding of assent SC enters the Parliament's domain to snip or add words to these two provisions, it would lead to a 'Procrustean bed' phenomenon (originating from Greek mythology in which a bandit used to force travellers to fit the length of the bed by either amputating their limbs or stretching them), which would encourage states to rush to SC for moulding of constitutional provisions for every small aberration in future.","Supreme Court has always stuck to the cardinal constitutional principle of separation of powers, a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai said.

NEW DELHI: Reminding police personnel that they have to forgo their personal bias relating to religion, race or caste after donning the uniform, Supreme Court on Thursday came down heavily on Maharashtra police for not holding a probe into the statement of an eyewitness in the communal riots in Akola in May 2023, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.The eyewitness, Mohammad Afzal, claimed he could identify one of the assailants who assaulted him and killed an auto driver. Afzal said the driver was killed as he was mistaken for a Muslim.The court sought an SIT to be set up comprising senior police officers of Hindu and Muslim communities.The riot was triggered by an objectionable social media post resulting in the death of one person, Vilas Mahadevrao Gaikwad. The same people had attacked the eyewitness, Mohammad Afzal , who was then 17. Though the police recorded his statement in the hospital, it did not conduct any probe into the allegation that the deceased was murdered under the impression that he belonged to the Muslim community. He alleged that the deceased was killed as he was plying an auto rickshaw of a Muslim, which bore a sticker with the name 'Garib Nawaz'.Taking strong exception to state police inaction, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Satish Chandra Sharma said it was ""total dereliction"" of duty on the part of officials, including superintendent of police of Akola.""Needless to state, when members of the police force don their uniforms, they are required to shed their personal predilections and biases, be they religious, racial, casteist or otherwise. They must be true to the call of duty attached to their office and their uniform with absolute and total integrity. Unfortunately, in the case on hand, this did not happen,"" SC said. It directed the state's home secretary to constitute a special investigation team comprising senior police officers of both Hindu and Muslim communities, to undertake an investigation into allegations made by Afzal by registering an FIR in connection with the assault upon him and take appropriate action. The SIT has been directed to file a probe report in court within three months. It also directed the secretary to initiate appropriate disciplinary action against all erring police officers and take measures to sensitise the force. The court also raised questions on Bombay HC which had disbelieved Afzal's allegation and found fault with his relatives for not trying to lodge a report with police immediately.""Though the affidavits filed by the police inspector of the Old City Police Station, Akola, tried to attribute motives to the appellant and the same was willingly accepted and acted upon by the high court, we are not persuaded to agree at this stage. It was for the police to investigate the truth or otherwise of the specific allegations made by the appellant, a 17-year-old boy, who asserted that he was an eyewitness to the murder of Vilas Mahadevrao Gaikwad and was himself assaulted by the very same assailants. If, in fact, the deceased was really murdered under the impression that he belonged to Muslim community and the assailants were not of that community, that was a fact that had to be ascertained after thorough and proper investigation. When the appellant claimed that he could identify one of the four assailants, that claim also required to be followed up with detailed investigation by ascertaining the location of the person so identified at the relevant time through mobile phone location, call data records, etc,"" the court said.SC said neither the police inspector nor the high court were correct in their assumption and understanding that it was for Afzal or his relatives to pursue the police to take necessary steps in that regard and that the police were not required to take any steps, despite their knowledge of the commission of a cognisable offence. ""What is even more distressing to note is that the appellant made a written complaint to the SP of Akola on June 1, 2023, through his father, but to no avail. .. There is no explanation forthcoming as to whether he even undertook an inquiry to satisfy himself about the truth or otherwise of the information received, as mandated by the provision. This conduct on the part of a superior police officer...is indeed a cause for great concern,"" the court said.The apex court also expressed surprise that a police inspector filed a reply on behalf of the govt in the case. ""It is surprising that, in a matter involving the State, represented by the chief secretary, and its home ministry, wherein a serious issue has been raised before the highest court in the country, no senior official chose to file an affidavit before this court and left it to an inspector of the local police station to do the needful. More so, as serious allegations were made against a superintendent of Police, who was impleaded by name,"" it said.",Supreme Court came down heavily on Maharashtra police for not holding a probe into the statement of an eyewitness in the communal riots in Akola in May 2023.

"Cops lock circuit house gate to stop AAP MP from holding protest in Srinagar, meeting Farooq",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-lock-circuit-house-gate-to-stop-aap-mp-from-holding-protest-in-srinagar-meeting-farooq/articleshow/123837346.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: J&K continues to be on the edge over the detention of AAP legislator from Doda, Mehraj Malik, under the Public Safety Act (PSA). While a low-intensity blast on Thursday morning triggered panic in Jammu’s Doda town, which already remains tense, high drama unfolded in Srinagar when police locked the circuit house gates to prevent AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh from holding a protest against Malik’s detention, and refused to allow NC president Farooq Abdullah to meet him.Singh, who reached Srinagar on Wednesday evening with other AAP functionaries, was scheduled to hold a press conference and a protest at Lal Chowk. However, police locked the gates of the circuit house and barred him and others from stepping out.NC president Farooq Abdullah, who arrived to offer support to Singh, was stopped at the main gate. The AAP MP climbed on a plastic chair and tried to converse with him. Alleging that he had been placed under “house arrest”, Singh said the govt guesthouse had been turned into a “police camp” and the authorities refused to disclose the grounds for confining him inside.Both the leaders argued with security personnel for not allowing them to meet, and lashed out at LG Manoj Sinha, accusing him of abusing his authority. An upset Farooq said “an elected govt is in power in J&K, but the LG has become a king”.The NC leader finally left, bidding Singh “khuda hafiz” from outside the gate. The AAP MP later shared video clips on X and said: “If this is not dictatorship, then what is it?”CM Omar Abdullah, too, termed it “illegal detention” and slammed the “highhandedness” of the LG administration.“They claim everything is fine in J&K; that the atmosphere is good, people are happy, and ‘naya Kashmir’ is emerging. The reality is they do nothing except use force,” he said while talking to reporters. “They have used force against us, invoked wrong laws to arrest Mehraj Malik… And now they have illegally detained a Rajya Sabha member. Under which law? Did they serve any notice to him? This is not good for the democracy of J&K and it sends the wrong message,” Omar added.Earlier, panic gripped locals following the explosion in a house in Dumri-Thukar Mohalla of Doda town, although no injuries were reported, officials said. Two individuals were detained for questioning.Doda remained calm but tense on Thursday and prohibitory orders remained in force for the third consecutive day across the district following protests over the slapping of PSA against Malik.The Doda MLA’s father, Shamas Udin Malik, made a fervent appeal for release of his son and apologised on his behalf for using “unparliamentary” language against deputy commissioner Harvinder Singh, even as he accused the DC of “personal vendetta”. . “I apologise for the words he has used… I have full faith that LG sahib and Modi sahib will definitely do justice with us. We humbly urge the Prime Minister and the LG to release him and reunite our family,” he said.","J&K continues to be on the edge over the detention of AAP legislator from Doda, Mehraj Malik, under the Public Safety Act (PSA) A low-intensity blast on Thursday morning triggered panic in Jammu’s Doda town, which already remains tense.

"Infections from medicine tubes in Indian hospitals high, shows study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infections-from-medicine-tubes-in-indian-hospitals-high-shows-study/articleshow/123609718.cms,"MUMBAI: A seven-year study at 54 private and public hospitals and 200 ICUs in India has found over 8,600 cases of severe bloodstream infections linked to mismanagement of tubes inserted into large veins to deliver medicines and fluids. These are called central lines, with newborns most at risk.About 40% of patients with central line infections died within two weeks. The rate: 8.83 central line infections per 1,000 central line-days, meaning nine infections for every 1,000 days that central lines were used. The study, just out in Lancet, recorded 9,77,052 central line-days. The figures are much higher than reported in the US, where the rate even in 2020 (Covid year) was 0.87 per 1,000.Doctors said newborns are vulnerable to most infections, and when they need central lines in ICUs, the risk increases. The study, titled 'Profile of CLABSI (Central-Line Associated Bloodstream Infection) Infections in Adults', said 87% of Acinetobacter and 78% of Klebsiella infections - the two most common culprits in such cases - were resistant to carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort.One more culprit, Candida auris - a fungal infection known for its drug resistance - was also a frequent cause. These reach central lines through contaminated hands, equipment or medicines, and enter the bloodstream.""There is a haphazard use of third-line antibiotics like carbapenems because they are the most effective to a point that now they are being rendered useless. We have allowed this resistance to develop because of a lack of monitoring mechanism and guidelines,"" said Dr Hemalata Arora, infectious disease expert at Mumbai's Nanavati Hospital. Microbiologist Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, from Pune's BJ Medical College, said most anti-fungals fail before Candida auris and it is most difficult to wipe out of hospital settings: ""Resistance rates to bacterial infections are alarming. Carbapenems have proven to be the safest ones. Eventually, doctors may have to switch to alternative antibiotics for certain infections which could be more toxic.""Conducted between 2017 and 2024, the research was led by Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance Network and coordinated by AIIMS, New Delhi, with funding from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors, all microbiologists from across India, wrote that infection rates peaked in 2020-21, coinciding with Covid, when overwhelmed ICUs, staff shortages and strained infection-control practices likely played a role. Rates fell the following year but rebounded, leading them to conclude that the issue is persistent.Dr Arora said transmission of central line infections are bound to occur but the point is to reduce incidence. ""The rate of infection differs from hospital to hospital. In bigger hospitals, it is 1 or 2 per 1,000 central line days. Smaller hospitals could have 15 to 20, even 30 to 40 per 1,000,"" she said.A paediatrician and infectious disease specialist from Mumbai said, ""In most govt and semi-govt setups, doctors as well as allied staff are overworked due to staff shortage. Very sick patients often require prolonged use of central lines, and for paediatric patients, repeated needle pricks are difficult, so central lines are kept for longer durations. But these central lines are often not managed properly because of inadequate training and understaffing. ""","A seven-year study at 54 private and public hospitals and 200 ICUs in India has found over 8,600 cases of severe bloodstream infections.

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister Shivraj Chouhan Saturday countered US President Donald Trump's description of India as a ""dead economy,"", saying the latest GDP figures showed that ""India is a long live economy"" on the path to becoming developed and self-reliant. Trump's statement was endorsed by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi who, too, had said ""Indian economy is dead"".Besides Chouhan, BJP said the latest data showing India's economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 7.8% in April-June came as the ""hardest slap of reality"" for Rahul. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, ""This is a slap in the face for those who made false statements to defame India, especially the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi who should apologise to the nation.""Govt data released Friday showed that the Indian economy grew by 7.8% in April-June - the highest in five quarters - before the disruptive US tariffs were imposed.Echoing Chouhan, urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar Saturday said at an event that a big country was talking about sanctions and tariff. ""Today there was a jolt to that system when India recorded a 7.8% growth in GDP in the first quarter when people felt that we would be down.If we grow like this, the skeptics will shut their mouths"".GDP growth in the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal was mainly due to good performance by the farm sector.""Those who call it a 'dead economy' should now understand that India is a 'long live economy' which is on the path to realising the dream of a developed and fully self-reliant India,"" Chouhan said in a post on X. ""The sweat of Indian farmers, the hard work of our scientists and 140 crore Indians have demonstrated their capabilities.""BJP's IT cell head Amit Malviya said, ""For the acerbic, delusional, frustrated, and rejected Rahul Gandhi - the same man who declared India a 'dead economy' - the latest GDP numbers are the hardest slap of reality.""""India has just clocked 7.8% GDP growth in Q1 of FY 2025-26, leading the world's major economies,"" Malviya said in a post on X.

'The more pressure is put on India, the more it'll emerge as strong rock'

NEW DELHI: There are no permanent friends or enemies in international relations, only permanent interests, defence minister Rajnath Singh stressed on Saturday, amid the tariff tension with US and the thaw in India-China relations.India will ""never compromise with its fundamental interests and principles"", and will remain steadfast on its policies and self-reliance drive to preserve its strategic autonomy and emerge stronger ""despite any global pressure"", Singh said, in an apparent reference to US President Donald Trump's imposition of 50% tariffs on New Delhi.The minister's remarks, which did not name the US directly, came even as PM Modi reached China on Saturday to attend the SCO summit.PM Modi reached China on Saturday to attend the SCO summit, where he is scheduled to have bilateral meetings with the Chinese and Russian Presidents, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, respectively. ""India does not consider anyone its enemy. But for us, the interests of our people, our farmers, our small traders are paramount. We cannot compromise on our country's welfare at any cost. No matter how much pressure is exerted, India will continue to give the highest priority to the interests of its farmers, small businessmen, shopkeepers, livestock keepers, and common citizens,"" Rajnath Singh said, speaking at the NDTV Defence Summit.""We all study in geography that the more pressure is applied, the stronger the rock becomes. I feel that the more pressure is put on India, the more it will emerge as a strong rock,"" he added. Amid ongoing geopolitical churn and disruption, Singh said ""a kind of protectionism"" has been seen from the ""so-called developed countries"", with ""trade and tariff wars"" becoming increasingly serious. Referring to Edmund Burke's calling the British East India Company as ""a state in the guise of a merchant"", he said the description can be changed to ""a merchant in the guise of a state"" in the current circumstances.Noting that the world and technology is changing rapidly, with new challenges emerging in the form of pandemics, terrorism and regional conflicts, Singh said self-reliance is not just an option or an advantage but a strategic necessity essential for India's survival and progress. ""Today's shifting geopolitics has also made it clear that external dependency in the field of defence is no longer an option for us. In the current situation, self-reliance is essential for both our economy and our security,"" he said.""Under PM Modi's leadership, our govt has always believed that it is only through ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' that we can strengthen our strategic autonomy. This very approach will keep us secure in the times to come and also secure us a leading position among the world's emerging powers,"" he added. Hailing Operation Sindoor as a shining example of India's growing indigenous defence capabilities, he said, ""It may appear to be a story of a war of a few days, of India's victory and Pakistan's defeat, but years of strategic preparation and defence preparedness were behind it. ""","India will remain steadfast on its policies and self-reliance drive to preserve its strategic autonomy, defence minister says.

MV tax only for use in public area: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mv-tax-only-for-use-in-public-area-sc/articleshow/123608381.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has held that the motor vehicles tax, which is imposed for use of public places and infrastructure, cannot be levied if a vehicle does not use the same.""Motor vehicle tax is compensatory in nature. It has a direct nexus with the end use. The rationale for levy of motor vehicle tax is that a person who is using public infrastructure, such as roads, highways etc. has to pay for such usage. Legislature has consciously used the expression 'public place' in Section 3. If a motor vehicle is not used in a 'public place' or not kept for use in a 'public place' then the person concerned is not deriving benefit from the public infrastructure; therefore, he should not be burdened with the motor vehicle tax for such period,"" a bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan said. The bench passed the order while interpreting the Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicle Taxation Act, whose section 3 says govt may from time to time direct that a tax shall be levied on every motor vehicle used or kept for use in a public place in the State.It thereby allowed the plea of a company which had pleaded that it was not liable to pay tax as its vehicles were used in the central dispatch yard premises belonging to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) and were not plying on public roads.The state had taken the stand that actual use or non-use of public roads cannot be a ground for escaping tax liability. The bench said the taxable event under Section 3 arises when a vehicle is used or kept for use in a public place in the State.""Therefore, the tax is on the user or intendment for use of motor vehicle in a 'public place'. Thus, if a vehicle is actually used in a 'public place' or kept in such a way that it is intended to be used in a 'public place' then the tax liability accrues.... Requirement of law is that the motor vehicle should be used or kept for use in a 'public place'. When admittedly the motor vehicles of the appellant were confined for use within the RINL premises which is a closed area then the question of vehicles being used or kept for being used in a 'public place' does not arise,"" it said.The court said the motor vehicles in question were used or kept for use only within the restricted premises of RINL, which was not a public place. ""Therefore, the said vehicles are not liable to be taxed for the period the said vehicles were used or kept for use within the restricted premises of RINL. Argument of the respondent that appellant had not intimated non-use of the motor vehicles in terms of Rule 12A does not carry much persuasion in view of what we have discussed supra. Thus, even in the absence of any intimation in terms of Rule 12A, motor vehicles of the appellant cannot be subjected to motor vehicle tax for the period those were used or kept confined within restricted premises of RINL"".",Justices: Motor vehicle tax is compensatory in nature. It has a direct nexus with the end use. A company had pleaded that it was not liable to pay tax as its vehicles were used in the central dispatch yard premises belonging to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123608382,imgsize-1532675,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"
Travel slump: June sees a dip in number of Indian visitors in US; first decline since 2001,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/travel-slump-june-sees-a-dip-in-number-of-indian-visitors-in-us-first-decline-since-2001/articleshow/123608362.cms,"Indians With Valid US Visas Can Now Easily Travel To Argentina Without Needing Any Additional Visa

NEW DELHI: The desi peak outbound travel month of June saw a decline in the number of Indian visitors to the US in 2025 over the previous year for the first time this Millennium — barring the Covid period. With 2.1 lakh Indians headed to America in June, the number was 8% lower than 2.3 lakh in same month last year, according to data from US commerce dept’s National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO). The provisional figure for this July shows 5.5% fall over same month last year.Overall, the US has been seeing a decline in international visitors — and not just from India — in recent months. NTTO says total non-US resident international visitor volume to the US decreased 6.2% in June 2025 over June 2024; 7% in May; 8% in March; 1.9% in Feb. This Jan saw 4.7% increase over same period last year and April was up 1.3%.India is the fourth largest source market for international visitors for the US. Since the two biggest source markets — Mexico and Canada — share a land border, India is the second biggest overseas source market with the UK being the biggest. “Combined, these top five source markets (with Brazil being the fifth) accounted for 59.4% of total international arrivals” this June, says NTTO.While travel industry biggies here say it is too early to pin the blame for fall in Indian visitor numbers on the stricter visa regime adopted by President Trump in his second presidency which has seen souring of India-US ties, the impact could be more pronounced going ahead if the same continues. The reason: US mostly issues 10-year validity multiple entry visitor and business visas (B1/B2) so people who already have the same can keep travelling. But if new visas get impacted for reasons like long appointment time or stricter issuance norms, then with a time lag the impact will be visible.“We are seeing a very visible impact on student segment this year due to delay in visa issuance even after people securing college admission. Historically, the biggest categories of visitors headed from India to the US have been visiting friends & relatives (VFR), business and students. The US was never a top leisure destination for Indians. That space has been led by Southeast Asia, Middle East and Europe. North America came after that. Right now apart from students we are not seeing a dramatic impact on the other segments but if new visa issuances are affected, they will also be hit with a certain time lag,” said a leading travel agent.With an Indian diaspora of over 50 lakh, the US sees great demand for travel from the India. NTTO data shows since the start of this Millennium, every June had seen a jump from same month in last year till 2025 broke that trend.April was a great month as far as outbound from India is concerned. According to Indian tourism ministry data, 29 lakh Indians travelled abroad this April with the maximum going to the UAE followed by Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Singapore and the US.“But after May and June, travel was severely impacted following the Pehelgam terror attack, closure of Pakistan airspace (which continues for Indian carriers & vice versa) and then the Air India Ahmedabad crash. So every destination, especially in the west, was impacted badly. The drop to the US may not be in isolation as fast as western destinations go,” said another travel biggie.","June saw a decline in the number of Indian visitors to the US in 2025 over the previous year. With 2.1 lakh Indians headed to America in June, the number was 8% lower than 2.3 lakh in same month last year.

Key takeaway for us, that in less than 50 weapons, we were able to achieve conflict elimination... It is very easy to start a war, but not easy enough to end it,"" Air Marshal Tiwari said, armed with videos and satellite imagery to showcase the damage to terror and military infrastructure caused in Pakistan.IAF had deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for the calibrated pinpoint strikes on the Pakistani airbases and radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structures, as reported by TOI earlier.Both the officers said the political directives were clear about undertaking punitive strikes with minimum collateral damage, catering for escalation and creating a deterrence in Pakistan army's mind, and complete operational freedom was given to the armed forces for the same.Lt-Gen Sharma further said that the Pahalgam massacre came soon after Munir, in a ""provocative speech"" on April 16, claimed Kashmir was Pakistan's ""jugular vein"" while invoking the two-nation theory.""This was direct incitement to not only the terrorists but also the Pak army...

Health speculation lingers

Still firing on Truth Social





The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.Dressed in a white polo, black slacks, and his trademark red MAGA cap, Trump appeared relaxed as he left the White House with his grandchildren before heading to the links. The White House press pool confirmed his departure in the presidential motorcade at 8:49 am, providing definitive proof that the 47th President is alive and well.For much of Saturday, Trump was the top trending search on Google and across social media platforms, with phrases like “Is Trump dead?” and “Trump is dead” flooding timelines. The rumors, though baseless, spread rapidly, fueled in part by his recent absence from the public eye and lingering speculation about his health.Trump’s last major appearance was on August 26, when he chaired a televised cabinet meeting. Before that, he was spotted on August 24 golfing in Virginia alongside former MLB pitcher Roger Clemens.Concerns about Trump’s health have persisted for weeks after photos surfaced of him with a large bruise on his right hand and visible swelling around his ankles.The White House did not address the images directly but last month released a letter confirming Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition linked to age and prolonged standing. Doctors have suggested the ankle swelling may be connected to routine aspirin use.Adding fuel to the rumor mill, Vice President JD Vance recently told USA Today that he was “ready to step in” if a “terrible tragedy” struck, though he emphasized that Trump remained in “great health.”Despite skipping public events this weekend, Trump has remained active online. Hours before his golf outing, he posted on Truth Social lashing out at a US appeals court for striking down most of his tariffs, a reminder that, contrary to internet whispers, the President is still very much at the helm.","The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.

On Friday, police received a PCR call around 9.30pm about a quarrel at the temple.To support his family and fund the treatment of his six-year-old differently-abled daughter, Yogendra Singh balanced two jobs, working as a farmer in his native village in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district and as a sewadar at Kalkaji Temple in Delhi.Every few months, he would travel to the city to serve at the temple and earn some money before returning home to tend to his wheat and bajra crops.On Saturday morning, Singh's elder brother, Kaushal Singh, stood tearfully outside the AIIMS Trauma Centre, waiting to collect the body. He recalled how Yogendra worked relentlessly and without complaining driven by the single goal of securing a better future for his children. His daughter, who has problems performing basic tasks with her arm and leg, has been undergoing treatment for over a year, costing the family over Rs 1.5 lakh.Yogendra, the youngest of three brothers, last met his wife, mother and two children when he left home two months ago.

""I was going to Puri in Odisha for work and he asked me to travel safely and take care of myself. He was such a simple man, who never hurt anyone and only ever cared for others,"" he said.Eyewitnesses to the horrible attack on Yogendra at the temple described the scene as ""complete chaos"", with the attackers using sticks to brutally assault the victim while cursing at him.

A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","US federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About





NEW DELHI: A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest Delhi's KN Katju Marg area following a heated argument over a birthday gift for their son.The accused, Yogesh Sehgal, was later arrested in Rohini, where he was detected roaming around with his two sons.On Saturday, around 3.50 pm, police received a PCR call reporting the murder of the caller's mother, Kusum Sinha, 63, and sister, Priya Sehgal, 34, both residents of Rohini.Read also: ‘No gifts from your family’: How a birthday remark sparked Delhi double murder with scissors A police team rushed to the third floor house in Rohini Sector 17, where they found two female bodies lying in a pool of blood. The crime team and forensic experts were summoned to the scene.According to Sinha's son, Megh Sinha, his mother visited Priya's house on Aug 28 to celebrate the birthday of Priya's son, Chirag. Megh alleged that Yogesh killed his mother and sister and fled with the children. Sehgal was arrested and the cops seized his blood-stained clothes and a pair of scissors, the alleged weapon of offence.The murder is attributed to domestic disputes and frequent quarrels.""A dispute erupted between Priya and her unemployed husband, Yogesh, over gifts exchanged between the two families and Kusum stayed at Priya's residence to help resolve the issue,"" said Rajeev Ranjan, DCP (Rohini).When Megh couldn't reach his mother by phone on Saturday, he visited Priya's house and found the flat locked and spied bloodstains near the door. When they broke the lock, they discovered the bodies of Kusum and Priya inside.Megh told the media that when the house was in complete disarray, with belongings scattered all over. When he lifted his mother, he noticed deep injuries on her throat and abdomen, with blood flowing from the wounds. "" I called the police control room. I came to know that Yogesh had gone to the police station and accused Priya and his mother-in-law of beating him,"" Megh claimed.The accused was caught in Rohini with his two children. During interrogation, he revealed that the family was celebrating their youngest son's 15th birthday. He told the cops that his wife made an uncharitable comment about his family not bringing gifts, which triggered his anger. Around 11.30pm, he allegedly stabbed Priya in the neck with a pair of scissors and then attacked his mother-in-law.After committing the crime, Yogesh attempted to clean up the blood. He then locked the door and waited for his sons to return from school. When they arrived, he informed them about the murder and said he would take them somewhere before the police caught up with him. However, he was apprehended before he could execute his plan. According to the investigators, the couple's frequent arguments, coupled with the comment about gifts, seemed to have triggered the violence.","A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest Delhi.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances. The visit follows an almost year-long effort by both sides to narrow down their differences on the contentious border issue and normalise the relationship in the form of steps already taken like resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage for Indians and tourist visas for Chinese nationals.As has been reported earlier, Modi will have a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, the first of his many engagements over the next 2 days. However, among the highlights on the first day will also be a likely meeting with Myanmar’s acting president and military chief Min Aung Hlaing.“Landed in Tianjin, China. Looking forward to deliberations at the SCO Summit and meeting various world leaders,” said Modi in a post on X, after arriving in China.India has had limited high-level contacts with Myanmar since the military took control of state power in 2021 but this will be Modi’s second meeting with the Myanmar leader this year, after their talks on the margins of the BIMSTEC summit in Thailand. Ahead of a planned election in December, as announced by the military, Modi is likely to stress the importance of an early restoration of democracy in the country torn by ethnic violence through inclusive and credible polls and dialogue.Myanmar under its military has struggled to shed its pariah status in the West but continues to maintain strong ties with both China and India. For India, which has a 1600 km land border with Myanmar, it’s imperative to work with the military rulers to deal with the persistent challenge of border insurgency.While Modi is in China for the SCO summit, his most crucial engagement will likely be the meeting with Xi that is expected to cement the recent progress in ties after an almost 5-year-old military standoff. According to sources, the PM will approach the meeting with the intention to take the relationship forward with a long-term and strategic perspective. The meeting will take place at a time India’s relationship with the US is at its lowest ebb in decades. While both sides have not indicated signing of any big-ticket agreement, the leaders are expected to endorse efforts to resume direct air services between the 2 countries.There will be focus on trade and economic cooperation with Modi likely to underline the need for a fair trade partnership and seek a reaffirmation of the Chinese commitment to address India’s needs in critical areas like rare earths, fertilisers and equipment. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi recently assured his counterpart S Jaishankar Beijing will lift curbs on export of some of these items. Modi is also likely to raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in the context of the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack.","PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances.

Donald Trump's immigration crackdown: Chicago mayor signs order blocking police role in raids; vows city won’t 'take orders',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-immigration-crackdown-chicago-mayor-signs-order-blocking-police-role-in-raids-vows-city-wont-take-orders/articleshow/123609517.cms,"File photo: Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge, which could begin within days.The order, issued on Saturday, bars the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement, patrols, traffic stops, checkpoints, or arrest operations.Johnson said the measure was necessary to “guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents amidst the possibility of imminent militarised immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government,” according to news agency AP.When asked whether he would follow instructions from federal agents, Johnson replied, “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”The order also requires Chicago police, including undercover officers, to wear uniforms and prohibits them from covering their faces, contrasting with federal immigration officers, many of whom now wear masks since Trump took office. At the same time, Johnson urged federal officers deployed in Chicago to identify themselves with names, badge numbers and body cameras, Politico reported.Two US officials cited by AP said the immigration crackdown could start as early as September 5 and last for 30 days. The officials said the operation was part of a wider Trump administration strategy to expand federal law enforcement in Democratic-led cities, similar to earlier actions in Los Angeles.At a news conference, Johnson accused Trump of using federal power for political retribution, calling him ‘reckless and out of control.’“He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country”, he added.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday, pointed to Chicago’s recent gun violence and attacked Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”The White House described Johnson’s executive order as a “publicity stunt.” Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was quoted as saying by CNN, “If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticise the President, their communities would be much safer. Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue.”Illinois governor Pritzker also condemned Trump’s plan, accusing the administration of trying to “circumvent our democracy, militarise our cities and end elections,” CNN reported.Vice President JD Vance, however, defended the administration’s approach, saying during a visit to Wisconsin, “Chicago has had a lot of crime problems. Why is it that you have mayors and governors who are angrier about Donald Trump offering to help them than they are about the fact that their own residents are being carjacked and murdered in the streets?”","Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge.

India ‘Laughs’ As Trump SCREAMS ‘Disaster’ At US Court’s Ruling Against Tariffs | ‘No Power To...’

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump ""no longer has plans"" to visit India later this year for the Quad Summit, The New York Times reported on Saturday, detailing how ties between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have ""unravelled"" in recent months.In a report titled The Nobel Prize and a Testy Phone Call: How the Trump-Modi Relationship Unravelled, the NYT, citing people familiar with Trump's schedule, said: ""After telling Mr Modi that he would travel to India later this year for the Quad summit, Mr Trump no longer has plans to visit in the fall.""There was no official comment from either government on the report.India is scheduled to host the Quad Summit later this year. Earlier in January, the Trump administration had hosted the Quad foreign ministers' meeting, a day after Trump took the oath of office for a second term.The article linked the souring ties to Trump's repeated assertions that he had resolved the four-day conflict in May between India and Pakistan -- claims denied by New Delhi.""President Trump's repeated claims about having 'solved' the India-Pakistan war infuriated Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And that was only the beginning,"" it said, adding that PM Modi was ""losing patience"" with Trump.On June 17, PM Modi and Trump spoke for 35 minutes as Trump returned to Washington from the G7 Summit in Canada, which PM Modi also attended.The two were due to meet on the sidelines of the summit in Kananaskis, but Trump left early, prompting PM Modi to speak to him over the phone before his departure.During that call, Trump invited PM Modi to stop over in Washington, but the request was declined as PM Modi had a scheduled visit to Croatia.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri later said in a video message from Kananaskis that PM Modi told Trump ""at no point during the days following Operation Sindoor was there any discussion, at any level, on an India-US trade deal, or any proposal for a mediation by the US between India and Pakistan.""Misri added that talks to end military action were initiated by Pakistan and handled directly through existing channels between the two armed forces.According to the NYT, during the June 17 call, Trump again claimed credit for ending the escalation and noted that Pakistan intended to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize . ""The not-so-subtle implication, according to people familiar with the call, was that Mr Modi should do the same,"" the paper reported.PM Modi, however, ""bristled. He told Mr Trump that US involvement had nothing to do with the recent ceasefire. It had been settled directly between India and Pakistan,"" the report said.""Trump largely brushed off Mr Modi’s comments, but the disagreement — and Mr Modi’s refusal to engage on the Nobel — has played an outsize role in the souring relationship between the two leaders, whose once-close ties go back to Mr Trump’s first term,"" it added.The White House did not acknowledge the call, and Trump made no mention of it online, though he has repeated his claim of halting the conflict ""over 40 times since May 10.""The NYT framed the episode as ""the tale of an American president with his eye on a Nobel Prize, running smack into the immovable third rail of Indian politics: the conflict with Pakistan.""The report also tied Trump's recent tariffs on India -- an additional 25% duty on Russian oil purchases -- to frustrations with Prime Minister Modi. It described the ""colossal penalties on India in particular” as “punishment for not falling in line rather than any kind of cohesive effort to reduce the trade deficit or cut off funding for"" Russia’s war.Richard Rossow, chair on India at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, was quoted as saying: ""If this was a real change in policy in trying to squeeze Russia, Trump could have put his weight behind legislation that would have imposed secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian hydrocarbons. The fact that they have uniquely targeted India says this is about more than just Russia.""The NYT added that Trump, ""frustrated by the tariff negotiations,"" tried reaching out to PM Modi several times, but the Prime Minister Modi ""did not respond to those requests.""","US President Donald Trump ""no longer has plans"" to visit India later this year for the Quad Summit, NYT reports.

We are not the country which has the biggest trade surge with Russia after 2022; I think there are some countries to the South. We are a country where the Americans have said for the last few years that we should do everything to stabilise the world energy market, including buying oil from Russia.

LoC shootout ends decades-long run of ‘human GPS’ terrorist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/loc-shootout-ends-decades-long-run-of-human-gps-terrorist/articleshow/123607511.cms,"SRINAGAR: Bagu Khan knew every trail, every ridge, every hidden path across the LoC. The terrorist guide dubbed “human GPS” was killed in a gunfight with security forces in north Kashmir’s Gurez sector on Aug 28, officials said Saturday.Security officials said Khan had facilitated nearly 100 infiltration attempts over decades, often slipping across the LoC himself. A resident of Bandipora in north Kashmir, he allegedly crossed into PoK in 1995 for arms training and first joined Hizbul Mujahideen. He later shifted between groups but earned his nickname for navigating treacherous mountain passes with uncanny precision.Khan was one of two terrorists gunned down during an alleged infiltration attempt in Naushera Nar of Bandipora. Soldiers spotted suspicious movement along the LoC and challenged the intruders. “They opened fire. Troops responded with counter-fire, neutralising two terrorists,” the Army said. The second slain man is believed to be a Pakistani.Officials said Khan’s death could deal a blow to infiltration networks along the LoC. His mastery of terrain made him indispensable for Pakistan-backed banned groups. “Loss of such an experienced guide can limit the ability of infiltrators to negotiate high-altitude routes and escape detection,” a source said.Official sources estimated 70 Pakistani terrorists are currently active in J&K, aided by guides like Khan to cross rugged terrain — deep gorges, dense forests, mountain caves, and natural hideouts offering ample cover. These highly trained intruders typically move in small groups of three to four, carry sophisticated weapons, including M4 carbines, and use iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery to coordinate and avoid detection. Their capability to exploit terrain and technology remains a serious challenge for security forces.This year, forces have killed 16 terrorists in Kashmir region, including three top Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives linked to the April 22 Pahalgam attack. The trio was shot dead in Srinagar on July 28.In a separate action Saturday, J&K police said they attached immovable property worth lakhs of rupees in Pulwama belonging to Gulzar Ahmad Dar, father of “designated terrorist” Arjumand Gulzar alias Hamza Bhai of banned outfit Al-Badr.Police warned civilians against aiding terrorists. “Police once again appeal to the general public not to provide shelter or support to terrorists, failing which they shall face strict legal action,” the statement read.","Bagu Khan was one of two terrorists gunned down during an alleged infiltration attempt.

Russia Claims Its S-400 Missile System Is Shooting Down Missiles Fired From U.S. Patriot Systems

NEW DELHI: The Press Information Bureau (PIB) on Saturday dismissed as propaganda Pakistan’s claims that India’s S-400 air defence system was ""damaged"" during Operation Sindoor , the counterterror military strikes launched by India after the Pakistan-backed terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam.The PIB Fact Check wing clarified on X: ""Some pro-Pakistan social media handles are circulating claims that India admits its S-400 being damaged by Pakistan.""It added, ""Reports of destruction or any damage to an S-400 system are false & baseless.""Clarifying further, it said the image being circulated with these claims was actually from a Victory Parade held in Russia in May 2010.The clarification followed reports after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, where Lashkar-e-Taiba affiliated terrorists opened fire on civilians, killing 26 people.In retaliation, India carried out Operation Sindoor, striking nine major terror hubs, including Lashkar’s headquarters in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad’s stronghold in Bahawalpur.Pakistan responded with a barrage of drones and missiles, all of which were intercepted and neutralised by India, with the S-400 system playing a central role.India subsequently struck back at Pakistan’s key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan. The exchange of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours finally ended after Pakistan’s DGMO contacted his Indian counterpart to agree on a ceasefire across land, air, and sea.","The PIB Fact Check wing clarified on X: ""Some pro-Pakistan social media handles are circulating claims that India admits its S-400 being damaged by Pakistan"" The image being circulated with these claims was actually from a Victory Parade held in Russia in May 2010.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123603840,imgsize-1154127,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-30.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Vice Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari on Saturday said that fewer than 50 weapons were fired at targeted Pakistani military locations, compelling Islamabad to request the cessation of military hostilities by mid-day of May 10.Recounting the Operation Sindoor , Air Marshal Tiwari, during the NDTV Defence Summit, said that the IAF achieved ""complete domination"" over the Pakistan military through strikes executed following Pakistan's attack on the night of May 9 and 10.""I must tell you that it was a key takeaway for us that in less than 50 weapons, we were able to achieve complete domination. It has not happened before,"" Tiwari said.The senior IAF officer, who played a key role in Operation Sindoor, mentioned that some Pakistani targets ""taken out"" during the mission were not hit even during the 1971 war. ""We made every weapon count and that is a tacit acknowledgement of the capability of our planners and people who executed the missions,"" he added.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan in response to the Pahalgam terror attack . The strikes led to four days of intense clashes, culminating in an agreement to halt military actions on May 10.The Vice Chief of Air Staff further elaborated on the sequence of events related to Operation Sindoor and presented graphic details of India's response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Air Marshal Tiwari stated that India was not inclined to escalate the situation following its strikes on Pakistani terror infrastructure on the early morning of May 7.""We expected a response and still kept it calibrated, and we engaged only military targets. But when the main attack came on the night of May 9-10, that was the time we decided that we needed to go and send the right message. We hit them pan-front,"" he remarked. ""There were targets which were taken out, which were not even taken out during the 1971 war. That is the kind of extent and damage to capability that we had caused to them,"" he said, adding that the IAF limited its strikes to only military targets.The senior IAF officer explained that the purpose behind the strikes was to eliminate Pakistan's capability and convey the ""right message"". He acknowledged that employing long-range vectors to target enemy positions involves risks, but the IAF executed the mission flawlessly.""The precision targeting from this range is very very essential as it is very risky because the longer the vector, you feel that there are more chances of collateral damage."" ""But to the credit of our planners and credit of people who executed the missions, we were able to take out each target precisely. We were able to ensure there was no collateral damage. This is not an easy game,"" he added.""You may have a long-range vector, but the work that goes behind making that vector or that weapon hit a target accurately is actually an effort of the whole team, not only the pilots who fired them. There are a lot of people on the ground who make that happen,"" he noted. Following the strikes on terror infrastructure, India informed Pakistan of its desire not to escalate the situation, clarifying that the strikes targeted terrorist bases.

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The Army is raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

Belgian court rejects Choksi bail petition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/belgian-court-rejects-choksi-bail-petition/articleshow/123608183.cms,"Mehul Choksi

NEW DELHI: A Belgian court is learnt to have rejected the bail plea of fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi ahead of his extradition hearing there. Choksi, who was arrested in Belgium in April this year, had applied for bail on medical grounds last month.Indian law enforcement agencies argued that Choksi was a habitual absconder and was likely to flee to another country if granted bail. The court accepted the argument and denied bond.Choksi is wanted in bank fraud cases worth over Rs 13,900 crore. He has been in a Belgian jail for over four months now. Ahead of his extradition hearing scheduled in mid-Sept, the CBI has provided Belgian prosecutors voluminous evidence of his involvement in economic offences in India and details of his escape from US and Antigua in the past, besides the two open warrants against him. The Global Operations Centre of CBI is monitoring the developments in the case in direct coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies and Interpol channels. It has also hired the services of a local law firm to bolster the case.In Jan 2018, Choksi had fled to the US and then to Antigua, whose citizenship he had obtained a year before. The CBI filed an FIR on complaint of bank fraud and started a probe. In 2021, he vanished from Antigua and surfaced in Dominica while trying to escape to Cuba on a boat. In 2022, five more cases were registered against him. He relocated to Belgium, for the second time, thereafter with his wife Preeti Choksi, who is a Belgian citizen, after securing an 'F Residency Card' there. Granted a residency in Belgium in Nov 2023, Choksi was arrested there on April 11 this year.","Mehul Choksi is wanted in bank fraud cases worth over Rs 13,900 crore.

Bullet Train Diplomacy: Modi’s Shinkansen Ride with Japan PM Signals India’s High-Speed Rail Future

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was greeted with chants of “Modi-san, welcome!” as he arrived in Sendai, Japan, on Saturday during his two-day visit.Large crowds gathered at the city’s semiconductor hub, cheering his name and calling out “Welcome to Japan.” Travelling from Tokyo to Sendai on the Shinkansen bullet train with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, PM Modi later met Indian train drivers undergoing training in Japan.Upon arrival, he interacted with Indian loco pilots undergoing training with Japanese Railways before touring key industrial facilities, including the Tokyo Electron Factory- semiconductor plant and a bullet-train coach manufacturing site.The semiconductor facility in Miyagi Prefecture is being developed by Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) in partnership with SBI Holdings and Japanese firms under the joint venture Japan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (JSMC).Located in the Second Northern Sendai Central Industrial Park in Ohira Village, the plant will produce 12-inch semiconductor wafers, starting with 40-nanometre technology and later expanding to 28 nm and 55 nm nodes.It will primarily serve the automotive electronics sector, which is witnessing rising demand with the growth of electric vehicles and next-generation mobility solutions.Earlier in the day, PM Modi met governors of 16 Japanese prefectures in Tokyo and called for stronger state-prefecture cooperation under the India-Japan special strategic and global partnership, the ministry of external affairs said. He was also presented with a Daruma Doll by Rev Seishi Hirose, chief priest of the Shorinzan Daruma-Ji Temple. The Daruma is an iconic cultural symbol of Japan, with historical and spiritual roots connected to India.On Friday, PM Modi arrived in Tokyo to a warm reception by members of the Indian and Japanese communities. The welcome featured cultural performances, including classical dances such as Mohiniyattam, Kathak, Bharatnatyam and Odissi, along with folk songs presented in Rajasthani attire.Japanese nationals recited the Gayatri Mantra, while members of the Indian diaspora greeted the Prime Minister with chants of “Bharat Mata ki jai.”PM Modi’s two-day official visit marks his first standalone trip to Japan in nearly seven years.

Ahead of PM Narendra Modi ’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in China, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dialled Modi to say that while Ukraine was ready for a meeting with Putin, Russia continued to carry out “cynical strikes” killing dozens of civilians. He also sought an immediate ceasefire saying peace talks were not possible while fighting was still on.Zelenskyy briefed Modi about his meeting with President Donald Trump and European leaders in Washington this month and later said he had spoken to Modi to “coordinate” position with India ahead of the SCO summit in Tianjin, suggesting he expects the PM to stress ceasefire when he meets Putin on the margins of the summit. He in fact said Modi seemed ready to convey the “appropriate signal” to Putin.“We exchanged views on the ongoing conflict, its humanitarian aspect, and efforts to restore peace and stability. India extends full support to all efforts in this direction,” said Modi in a post on X. Capitals across the Western world, particularly Washington, will closely follow Modi’s meeting with Putin for the message he conveys to Putin on the war.Shortly before Zelenskyy and Modi spoke, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his Finland counterpart Elina Valtonen in a phone conversation India should not be unfairly targeted over the Ukraine conflict. Jaishankar said in a post on X that the discussions centered around the Ukraine conflict and recalled that India has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict. Valtonen said just and lasting peace in Ukraine requires more pressure on Putin to engage in real negotiations.Both the conversations came against the backdrop of repeated and hostile targeting of India by senior Trump administration officials for its trade links with Russia. The US has imposed an additional 25 percent tariffs on India for its crude purchase from Russia and Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro last week went to the extent of calling the Ukraine situation Modi’s war.While the government has made it clear to the US it won’t budge on the red lines it has drawn in trade negotiations, and that its oil procurement will continue to be guided by national interests and strategic autonomy, it has also so far avoided a public spat with Washington, exercising what many have described as strategic restraint. “Almost two weeks have passed (since his meeting with Trump in White House), and during this time, when Russia should have been preparing for diplomacy, Moscow has given no positive signal – only carried out cynical strikes on civilian targets and killed dozens of our people,” said Zelenskyy in his readout of the conversation with Modi.He said the end of this war must begin with an immediate ceasefire and that this position is understood and supported by everyone. “It is impossible to speak meaningfully about peace while our cities and communities are under constant fire. India is ready to make the necessary efforts and to deliver the appropriate signal to Russia and other leaders during the meetings on the sidelines of the summit,” said Zelenskyy, adding he will be glad to meet the Prime Minister in the near future.","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dialled Modi to say that while Ukraine was ready for a meeting with Putin, Russia continued to carry out “cynical strikes” killing dozens of civilians.

We will soon make a presentation to him which has been prepared in consultation with the corporate affairs ministry...We need to correct the system and if we do it together it will be better,” he added.In his address, Khattar also appealed to builders to avoid cash-dealings in property transactions for proper growth of the real estate sector and transparency.He also advised the industry to avoid issuing misleading advertisements for their projects.On the effectiveness of RERA, the real estate regulation law, Khattar said that disputes between buyers and builders have been reduced since its enactment. “There have been some instances where people have taken out money from the Escrow Account without carrying out construction, not spending it on construction. We have information of the nexus in this as well,” he pointed out.Earlier in the day, civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said the govt will carry out a study with the assistance of global aviation body ICAO to look into solutions to address issues related to height restrictions for buildings around airports. The govt also plans to develop aerotropolises or cities developed around airports without compromising on aviation safety.","Housing and urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar flagged a high probability of stressed projects that reach the tribunal never getting completed. Many lenders had approached the tribunal against a default by builders in loan repayments, he said. He said he was criticising a govt mechanism with the consent of the prime minister.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123607608,imgsize-909310,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"
"Cloudbursts rip through Jammu’s mountains, 11 dead as Aug rain toll climbs to 122",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cloudbursts-rip-through-jammus-mountains-11-dead-as-aug-rain-toll-climbs-to-122/articleshow/123607567.cms,"30 Dead, Several Injured in Jammu as Heavy Rains Trigger Landslide After Chenab River Overflowed

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Torrential rain and back-to-back cloudbursts unleashed flash floods and landslides in J&K Saturday, killing 11 people in Ramban and Reasi districts and pushing the monsoon death toll across Jammu division this Aug to 122. Among the dead: a couple and their five children buried alive in a mountainside home.In Ramban, floodwaters tore through remote Rajgarh village, flattening two family homes and a school. Additional DC Varunjeet Charak said: “Bodies of four people were pulled out from debris. Search for one missing person is underway.” Victims were identified as Ashwani Sharma, 24, his brother Dwarka Nath, 55, niece Virta Devi, 26, and guest Om Raj, 38. Nath’s wife Bidya Devi remains missing.In Reasi’s Badder village, a mud torrent swept away Nazir Ahmad, 38, his wife Wazira Begum, 35, and sons Bilal, Mustafa, Adil, Mubarak and Wasim, aged 13-5. “They were asleep when their mountainside house came in the path of a torrent of mud and water. They were buried alive,” an official said. Locals and police extracted all seven bodies from mounds of mud and stones.Union minister Jitendra Singh, LG Manoj Sinha, and CM Omar Abdullah expressed condolences and promised assistance to victims’ families.“Spoke to senior officials and took stock of the situation. Rescue and relief operations are underway,” Sinha posted on social media.Traffic on highways remained suspended for a fifth day, while scores of hilly roads lay blocked or washed out. The key Jammu–Srinagar national highway reopened partially Saturday to clear 3,000 stranded vehicles. CM Abdullah chaired a review meeting on road restoration and supply of essentials to Kashmir valley and remote regions. Opposition PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti urged a relief package “on the scale of the 2014 floods” with special focus on Jammu.Authorities sounded a high alert amid warnings of more intense downpours through Sept 2. Schools, colleges and govt offices — except essential services — remained shut since Aug 26.Rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Tawi, Ujh, Ravi, Sahar Khad and Basantar are in spate, flooding low-lying areas.Pilgrimage to Vaishno Devi shrine stayed suspended for a fifth day. Locals in Katra had protested the shrine board’s decision to allow the yatra on Aug 26 despite weather warnings. That day, a landslide near Indraprastha Bhojnalaya at Ardhkuwari — the midway point from Katra town to the cave shrine — killed 34 pilgrims, while four more died in Doda district as swollen rivers damaged 17 houses and swept away three footbridges.The disasters add to a grim Aug: 65 people died on Aug 14 when a cloudburst tore through a campsite at Chasoti village on the Machail Mata pilgrimage trail in Kishtwar. Three days later, a flash flood in Kathua killed seven, five of them children. A BSF constable was swept away on Aug 28 in Akhnoor sector.","Torrential rain and back-to-back cloudbursts unleashed flash floods and landslides in J&K. 11 people died in Ramban and Reasi districts, pushing the monsoon death toll across Jammu division this Aug to 122.

Tolling at Gharaunda on Delhi-Chandigarh highway to become barrier-free,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tolling-at-gharaunda-on-delhi-chandigarh-highway-to-become-barrier-free/articleshow/123605108.cms,"I observe vehicles smoothly navigating a modern, open toll plaza. The landscape is bright and inviting, suggesting efficient, seamless travel.

NEW DELHI: The country’s first barrier-free tolling system (Multi-Lane Free Flow or MLFF) will be rolled out at Gharaunda toll plaza on Delhi-Chandigarh highway and at Choryasi plaza on NH-48 in Gujarat, with the Indian Highway Management Company Ltd (IHMCL) under NHAI signing agreements with ICICI Bank for the purpose.Six more toll plazas, including five in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), are likely to see the rollout of MLFF in the next two months. The five plazas in NCR set to introduce MLFF – at UER-II, Dwarka E-way and Pachgaon, Shahajahanpur, Manoharpur and Daulatpur on NH-48 – in the next two months will make travel from Haryana and Delhi to Jaipur seamless.Sources said the toll rates for UER-II and Dwarka E-way are being finalised.MLFF aims to provide highway users a seamless and barrier-free tolling experience. The system works through a combination of high-performance RFID readers and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, which scan FASTags and vehicle registration numbers to enable electronic transactions. Thus, vehicles won’t need to stop at toll plazas, easing congestion and saving time.NHAI officials said the new tolling mechanism will be introduced at 25 NH plazas during this year and the process to identify them has started. NHAI chairman Santosh Kumar Yadav said, “By leveraging technology, it will establish the foundation for a more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly tolling ecosystem, aligned with our vision of technology-driven transformation in NH operations and will pave the way for its adoption nationwide. ”","Six more toll plazas, including five in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), are likely to see the rollout of MLFF in the next two months.

Mahua Moitra Under Fire: TMC MP’s ‘Cut Amit Shah’s Head’ Jibe Draws Sharp BJP Backlash

NEW DELHI: TMC MP Mahua Moitra has lit a political powder keg with her explosive remark targeting Union home minister Amit Shah , allegedly saying his ""head should be cut off"". The BJP condemned the statement as a ""distasteful and hate remark,"" with the party lodging a complaint at Krishnanagar's Kotwali police station.While speaking on the issue of illegal immigration along India’s eastern border, Moitra, addressing in Bengali, reportedly said, ""Amit Shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table.""However, there is no independent confirmation of the statement.Meanwhile, the BJP hit back at TMC MP over her statement, calling it ""distasteful and hate remarks"" and asking whether it represented the TMC's official position.Moitra, speaking to reporters in Nadia district during an event, accused the Union government of neglecting its responsibility on border security. ""They are repeatedly talking about infiltrators; but the border of India is protected by five forces, and that is directly the home ministry's responsibility,"" she said.She also referred to PM Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech. ""Standing at Red Fort, the PM himself said infiltrators are causing demographic changes.But even as he was saying this, his Home Minister was standing in the front row, smiling and clapping,"" she added.The BJP's West Bengal unit later amplified her comments on X, sharing Moitra's picture with the statement as its caption, while intensifying its attack on the TMC leader.Later in the day, TMC MP Moitra hit back at the BJP over the row surrounding her alleged remark on Union home minister Shah.In a post on X, she wrote, ""Modus operandi of BJP troll cell – pick one issue, give it to all resident twits (and an ‘a’ instead of an ‘i’ would be just as well) and make it ‘viral’ on social media. Today’s theme is Mahua Moitra’s Off With His Head metaphor. Long live my infamy, guys. Love it.""Defending Moitra, her TMC colleague Kunal Ghosh told PTI that the remark was symbolic. ""Mahua Moitra's comment has no physical implications, nor did she intend to attack Union home minister Amit Shah. She was trying to make a symbolic statement, which did not translate well,"" he said.Reflecting on TMC MP's comment, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari called it a language of ""urban naxals"", saying, ""This is the language of political urban naxals. Mahua Moitra, Rahul Gandhi and all Opposition leaders are trying to provoke violence in the minds of people through their words. This is their culture that they abuse the late mother of the Prime Minister...All of this makes it clear that their 'niti' and 'niyat' are not in the interest of the nation or the public. ""On TMC MP's remark, BJP spokesperson RP Singh said, ""Be it Mahua Moitra or Congress party - one party abuses PM's mother and the other party's leader says that Amit Shah should be beheaded. It shows their frustration. They know that they are going to lose Bihar and Bengal is next. So, such language is being used out of frustration.""","TMC MP Mahua Moitra reportedly said, ""Amit Shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table"" There is no independent confirmation of the statement. The BJP condemned the statement as a ""distasteful and hate remark"" The party has lodged a complaint at Krishnanagar's Kotwali police station.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123585644,imgsize-1463300,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-22.jpg"

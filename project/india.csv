From SC to 'jihad' and 'ghar wapsi': Maulana Mahmood Madani's controversial remarks — who is he?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-sc-to-jihad-and-ghar-wapsi-maulana-mahmood-madanis-controversial-remarks-who-is-he/articleshow/125667886.cms,"“Oppression Will Trigger Jihad”: Jamiat Chief’s Explosive Claim Stirs Storm

Who is Maulana Mahmood Madani?





What is the controversy about?





Who agrees, who doesn't





NEW DELHI: Maulana Mahmood Madani has sparked fresh controversy with his remarks on the Supreme Court ’s handling of the Babri Masjid and triple talaq cases, as well as his comments on ‘ jihad ’ and ‘ghar wapsi’.His statements have sharply divided the political landscape, drawing criticism from the BJP and even differing views from within the Muslim community, including the All India Muslim Jamaat.Maulana Mahmood Madani is the current National President of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH), one of the country's oldest Muslim organisations.Born in 1964, he is the grandson of Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani, a leading theologian and an important figure in India’s freedom movement. His father, Maulana As’ad Madani, was a significant force in the JUH and served in the Rajya Sabha for nearly 17 years.After completing his studies in Islamic theology at Darul Uloom Deoband in 1992, Mahmood Madani began working with the JUH, eventually becoming its General Secretary in 2001 and later a Rajya Sabha MP from 2006 to 2012.He has organised anti-terrorism conferences, facilitated interfaith dialogue through numerous “Sadhbhavana Sansad” events, and overseen educational reforms within madrasas. His humanitarian work includes relief and rehabilitation efforts during riots, natural disasters, and international crises, according to a profile of him on Jamait's website.Madani, on Saturday, alleged that the apex court of the country was functioning under pressure from the BJP-led central government.He cited verdicts like Babri Masjid and triple talaq.""After the verdict into Babri Masjid, triple talaq and several other matters, it seems that courts are functioning under Government's pressure for a few years now...We have several instances before that have raised questions on the character of courts...Supreme Court is eligible to be called supreme only when it follows the Constitution and when it upholds the law. If it doesn't do that, it doesn't deserve to be called 'Supreme',"" he said.Moreover, he criticised the vilification of the term ""jihad"", citing the increased use of terms like ""love jihad, land jihad, 'Taleem' jihad, 'thook' jihad"". He said that the term was used in the Islamic Holy book of Quran ""in the sense of finishing off oppression and violence.""""Enemies of Islam and Muslims have made 'jihad' a synonym of abuse, conflict and violence. Terms like Love jihad, Land jihad, 'Taleem' Jihad, 'Thook' Jihad are used to insult the faith of Muslims. It is unfortunate that responsible people in goverment and media feel no shame in using such terms...In Islam, 'jihad' has been used in the Quran in several respects. It has been used in the sense of one's duties, and the welfare of society and humanity. When it has been used for war, it has been used in the sense of finishing off oppression and violence. Isliye jab jab zulm hoga tab tab jihad hoga,"" he said.He further took on the conversion law, saying that it was against the fundamental right to freedom of religion. Contrasting the same with ""ghar wapsi"", a term widely used to refer to a program of religious conversion to Hinduism, he said that those ""converting people into a particular religion have a free hand.""""Constitution of the country has provided us with Right to Freedom of Religion. But through the Conversion Law, this fundamental right is being finished off. This law is being used in a manner in which practising a religion becomes liable to fear and punishment. On the other hand, in the name of 'Ghar Wapasi', those converting people into a particular religion have a free hand. They are not questioned, and no legal action is taken against them,"" he said.All India Muslim Jamaat chief, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, advised Madani to steer away from making comments on Supreme Court, Parliament and government as ""crores of Muslims trust"" these institutions.""Not just me, but crores of Muslims in India do not agree with his statement. Maulana Mahmood Madani is a religious man. He should speak from a religious point of view. He should not provoke or instigate Muslims. Crores of Muslims trust the Supreme Court, Parliament and Government,"" ANI quoted him saying.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari criticised his statements saying: ""If there is any place in the world where our brothers and sisters of the Muslim community are safest and facilitated, it is India.""Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) national spokesperson Vinod Bansal also condemned the statement saying: ""If a leader like Maulana Madani, who is considered ideal by the Muslim community, calls all Muslims 'jihadi', calls all Muslims a community which is a victim of atrocities and calls upon all Muslims to do 'jihad', who calls all non-Muslims 'murda' - I would like to ask him (Madani) if all freedom fighters and army jawans are 'murda kaum'. He has questioned the Supreme Court, too. He has said that the Supreme Court should be supreme and should also do supreme work. Will he give them a certificate for the same? This is the height of 'jihad'.""Bihar governor Arif Mohammad Khan, however, agreed with the 'jihad' statement saying: ""As long as oppression exists, jihad will exist. It is very difficult for me to disagree with that. Oppression or injustice—according to the Quranic idea—does not mean only the oppression you face. If any weak or poor person is being oppressed, it becomes your responsibility to raise your voice for them and help them. If there is oppression, then it is necessary to speak out against it, and that is what is called jihad. .. Madani's public statement about 'jihad' contradicts what is in texts followed in an institution he's associated with.""","Maulana Mahmood Madani is the current National President of the Jamiat Ulama-i- Hind. He is the grandson of Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani, a leading theologian and an important figure in India’s freedom movement.

Kashi Tamil Sangamam 4.0: 300 Varanasi Students To Visit Tamil Nadu As Centre Expands Tamil Outreach

NEW DELHI: Even as the Centre and the DMK-led Tamil Nadu govt continue to spar over education-related issues, the fourth edition of Kashi Tamil Sangamam (KTS) marks a significant expansion of the Union govt's Tamil language outreach with two major initiatives - sending 300 college students from Varanasi to Tamil Nadu for immersive Tamil learning and bringing 50 Tamil teachers to Varanasi schools to teach spoken Tamil.Officials maintain that the push remains culturally anchored and aimed at strengthening India's linguistic traditions.KTS 4.0 will open at NaMo Ghat on Dec 2, coinciding with Karthigai Deepam on Dec 4. More than 1,500 delegates from Tamil Nadu will participate in an eight-day programme featuring knowledge-sharing sessions, cultural events and heritage visits to Kashi Vishwanath temple, BHU, Sarnath, Hanuman Ghat and Ayodhya temple. The theme - ""Let Us Learn Tamil or Tamil Karkalam"" - reinforces the idea of Indian languages as part of a shared civilisational fabric.What makes this year's edition notable is the Centre's scaling-up of Tamil-learning programmes at a time when its relationship with Tamil Nadu govt remains strained over NEET, the three-language policy and centralisation of education regulation. Officials say the reciprocal model - Tamil teachers in Uttar Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh students in Tamil Nadu - is intended to deepen ""people-to-people connections."" Under the Tamil Karkalam campaign, 50 teachers from Tamil Nadu will begin spoken Tamil classes across 50 Varanasi schools from Dec 2 to Dec 15, reaching 1,500 students.The inaugural batches arrive on Dec 1.In return, 300 college students from Varanasi will travel in 10 batches to Tamil Nadu between Dec 17 and Dec 30. After an orientation at Central Institute of Classical Tamil in Chennai, they will be placed across nine host institutions, including IIT Madras, Central University of Pondicherry, Gandhigram Rural Institute and Sastra University.A senior official with the ministry of education said the dual initiatives would ""take Tamil learning beyond symbolic engagement to structured classroom exposure.""""KTS 4.0 celebrates India's knowledge traditions by making language a living bridge,"" said the official, adding, ""When Tamil teachers teach in Kashi and students from Varanasi learn Tamil in its native soil, we are renewing the shared heritage and ancient currents that have linked the two regions for centuries.""The Sage Agastya Vehicle Expedition (SAVE) - tracing ancient Tamil-Kashi linkages from Tenkasi to Varanasi - will also be launched on Dec 2, highlighting civilisational ties shaped by the Chera, Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Chalukya dynasties. It will conclude in Varanasi on Dec 12.

Groundwater recharge sees marginal increase this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/groundwater-recharge-sees-marginal-increase-this-year/articleshow/125667455.cms,"Our govt prioritises water governance in its policies: PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Total annual groundwater recharge in the country marginally increased in 2025 compared to last year and so did the water availability for different uses, but nearly one-fourth of the assessment units collectively continued to be in semi-critical, critical and over-exploited categories due to notable decline in recharge in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Kerala, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir.The findings are part of the Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025 report, released by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) this week. It shows that the annual recharge increased from 446.9 billion cubic metre (BCM) in 2024 to 448.52 BCM in 2025. However, the annual recharge this year is still less than the 2023 level of 449.08 BCM.CGWB assessed a total of 6,762 units (blocks/mandals/talukas) in 2025. It found that the over-exploited administrative units are mostly concentrated in parts of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, western Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The overexploitation occurred due to different reasons, including ""indiscriminate withdrawals"" of groundwater and climatic factors.Overall, 730 units (10.8%) in the country were categorised as over-exploited in 2025, indicating groundwater extraction exceeding the annual groundwater recharge. The report shows that the percentage of over-exploited, critical and semi-critical units exceeded 25% of the total units in nine states/UTs: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.""In some areas of the country, good continuous rainfall and management practices like groundwater augmentation and conservation measures taken up under central and state govt initiatives have resulted in improvement in groundwater situation,"" said the report.The states that reported significant increase in groundwater recharge this year include Bihar, Chhattisgarh, MP, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and UP.Rainfall is the main source of groundwater recharge in the country. It contributes to nearly 60% of the total annual groundwater recharge. ""So, the increase in water recharge can be attributed to better monsoon rainfall this year than 2024. Good rainfall means less extraction of groundwater for farming operations,"" said an official.Area-wise, over 16% of the total 2,468 thousand sq km of recharge-worthy areas of the country are under over-exploited zones, followed by more than 12% under semi-critical and over 3% under critical zones.The report notes that the total number of assessment units increased from 6,746 in 2024 to 6,762 this year due to an increase reported from Himachal Pradesh, where the assessment last year was carried out with valleys as assessment units in place of blocks.","Annual groundwater recharge in the country marginally increased in 2025 compared to last year.

PM Modi Blasts Rahul Gandhi Without Naming, Accuses Congress Of Protecting Maoists Despite Violence

NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday accused Rahul Gandhi of fuelling sympathies for Maoists and asked if the Congress leader is offering tacit endorsement of ""urban naxals"" by amplifying a video featuring them.BJP claimed that a video shared by Rahul on his social media platforms on the issue of pollution featured those who had raised pro-Naxal slogans, including in support of slain Maoist commander Hidma, during a protest in the national capital, ostensibly over air pollution. Police have arrested some persons over the issue.The governing party's sharp attack on Congress and Rahul comes amid the rapid shrinking of Naxal footprint in the country, with home minister Amit Shah promising to eradicate the insurgent movement by Mar 31 next year.

A320 Grounded: Here Is Why 6000 Aircraft Across World Couldn't Fly | Inside Story Of Software Snag

Regulators step in as airbus issues global warning





Airlines push through updates as delays ripple across airports





IndiGo confirmed late on Saturday that all 200 aircraft in its A320-family fleet had been fully updated, becoming the first major Indian operator to complete the mandatory enhancement. In a message posted on X, the airline said the work was “carefully coordinated” between engineering and operations teams and carried out with “minimal impact on customers’ journeys and zero cancellations”. It added that the entire fleet was now flying with the latest approved configuration, with routine monitoring continuing.Air India and Air India Express also reported rapid progress, with more than 90% of their affected aircraft upgraded by Saturday night. The push came after aviation regulators in India and Europe issued urgent directives requiring operators to install software protections designed to prevent possible data corruption in flight-control systems.Airbus triggered the global response on Friday after telling operators that intense solar radiation could corrupt data in key flight-control computers. The company identified a “significant number” of A320 family aircraft as potentially at risk and urged immediate installation of updated software or, in some cases, hardware realignment.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued an Airworthiness Directive soon after, covering a wide range of A319, A320 and A321 variants. Indian airlines were instructed to carry out the upgrades without delay, with a deadline set for early Sunday morning.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury issued an apology to airlines and passengers affected by delays, saying, “I want to sincerely apologise to our airline customers and passengers who are impacted now. But we consider that nothing is more important than safety when people fly on one of our Airbus aircraft… Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible. ”According to DGCA data, 338 Indian A320-family aircraft required the update, with modifications completed on more than 270 by Saturday evening. IndiGo upgraded 184 of its 200 affected aircraft earlier in the day, before confirming full completion later at night. Air India reported successful resets on over 90% of its operating A320 fleet, while Air India Express said 22 of its 25 impacted aircraft had been updated.The upgrades—conducted at bases in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Kolkata—caused delays of 60–90 minutes at several airports. Air India Express cancelled four flights, though IndiGo and Air India avoided cancellations.Aviation experts said the issue demanded swift action. Former pilot Ehsan Khalid explained that the affected Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) is central to flight control: “The software problem with one of the ELACs is significant,” he said, citing a JetBlue incident where an A320 experienced an uncommanded pitch-down, injuring passengers.With most Indian aircraft now updated and global airlines racing to do the same, regulators and Airbus say they expect normal operations to resume rapidly—though full worldwide compliance may take longer, given the nearly 6,000 aircraft requiring upgrades.","IndiGo confirms all 200 aircraft in its A320-family fleet have been fully updated.

These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system.

How the leak allegedly unfolded

Tracing the UKSSSC paper leak : What happened when

The exam was conducted on 21 September 2025, and screenshots of three pages began circulating almost immediately, raising alarm among candidates.



Within two days, Khalid Shahzad and his sister Sabiha were arrested for allegedly forwarding the leaked paper.



Investigation and digital evidence traced the leak to Assistant Professor Chauhan, who was formally named in the FIR along with Khalid and his sisters. Authorities noted this was a coordinated act, not an isolated incident.



The leak sparked widespread public outrage, with aspirants and youth groups protesting and demanding accountability from both the accused and exam officials.



Responding to public pressure, the CBI officially took over the case at the end of October 2025.



The UKSSSC cancelled the exam and scheduled a re-test within three months for the 416 affected vacancies.



On 28 November 2025, Chauhan was arrested, marking a major breakthrough in the investigation, which could expand further to uncover the full network behind the leak.

Official actions and CBI probe underway

The investigation into the Uttarakhand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC) graduate-level recruitment exam has taken a major turn with the arrest of Assistant Professor Suman Chauhan by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), according to an official announcement made by the agency.Chauhan, posted at a government college in Tehri Garhwal, is accused of receiving portions of the exam paper during the test, solving the questions, and transmitting the answers back to a candidate through intermediaries. The CBI described the arrest as an important step in uncovering the broader network behind the paper leak.The leak first came to light after images of three pages of the exam began circulating online, triggering widespread outrage among candidates. The exam, held on 21 September 2025, was conducted for graduate-level posts, including Patwari, Lekhpal, and other administrative positions, with over 1.05 lakh candidates appearing for it.According to the FIR and investigation findings reported by TNN, candidate Mohd Khalid Shahzad allegedly photographed the question paper inside the Haridwar exam centre and sent the images to his sisters, Sabiha and Hina, who then forwarded them to Chauhan.Chauhan is accused of solving the questions in real time and sending the answers back to Khalid. The four named individuals are facing charges under provisions related to unfair means in recruitment examinations.Investigators have described the leak as a coordinated effort rather than a spontaneous lapse, highlighting vulnerabilities in exam administration and monitoring. Following the incident, the UKSSSC cancelled the September 21 exam and announced a re-examination within three months to fill the 416 affected vacancies.Here is what has happened so far in the UKSSSC paper leak case:The Uttarakhand government appointed a one-member inquiry commission headed by Justice (Retd.) UC Dhyani, which submitted an interim report to the Chief Minister. The CBI continues its investigation, indicating that further arrests may follow as the agency maps the complete network behind the leak.The case has reignited calls for stricter monitoring, transparency, and stronger safeguards in recruitment examinations. Experts and aspirants have highlighted that the involvement of a sitting academic professional underscores the persistent risk of insider collusion. As per various reports, India has witnessed over 60 major exam leaks since 2010, affecting millions of candidates, with states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat frequently reporting similar incidents.","The Uttarakhand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC) graduate-level recruitment exam has taken a major turn with the arrest of Assistant Professor Suman Chauhan.

'Doesn’t Deserve LoP Post’: BJP Slams Rahul Gandhi For Missing CJI Surya Kant’s Oath Ceremony

NEW DELHI: The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, along with six other associates and business entities in an alleged case of criminal conspiracy to ""fraudulently"" acquire Associated Journals Ltd, then a Congress held entity having properties worth Rs 2,000 crore. The acquisition was made through Young Indian in which the Gandhis held 76% shareholding.The Delhi police FIR, dated Oct 3, is based on a complaint filed by the Headquarters Investigative Unit (HIU) of the ED, which has shared detailed findings of its investigation into National Herald money laundering case from 2008-2024.Sharing of information under Sec 66(2) of the PMLA allows ED to ask another enforcement agency to register and probe a scheduled offence, which can then become a predicate offence necessary for the ED to carry out its own investigation under the PMLA.The ongoing money laundering probe by ED is based on a private complaint from former BJP MP Subramanian Swamy and its cognisance by metropolitan magistrate's court in Patiala House in June 2014. In this case, the central agency filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) under PMLA against Gandhis and other accused on April 9 before a special MPs/MLAs court here at Rouse Avenue. The court has not taken cognisance yet of the matter.Congress has consistently disputed the charges and has accused ED of carrying out a political witchunt at govt's instance. When TOI contacted the party again on Delhi police registering an FIR, it said they are not aware of it.Besides Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, the FIR registered by the Delhi Police has named three others, including chief of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda. It also names three entities, AJL, Young Indian and the Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, allegedly a Kolkata-based shell company that provided Rs 1 crore to Young India from which Gandhis paid Congress Rs 50 lakh to allegedly acquire AJL with assets allegedly worth Rs 2,000 crore.Sources said the police is likely to summon shareholders of AJL for questioning to ascertain whether the Congress consulted them and took their approval before transferring the company to Young Indian, beneficially owned by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.","The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.

"Tata Sons: Air India a ‘responsibility’, not just biz opportunity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tata-sons-air-india-a-responsibility-not-just-biz-opportunity/articleshow/125667219.cms,"MUMBAI: Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran Saturday said Air India, which is undergoing a transformation, is not just a business opportunity but a “responsibility” for Tata Group. In his keynote address at an event here to celebrate the 121st birth anniversary of Tata Group founder JRD Tata, Chandrasekaran said when the group bought Air India in 2022, he was asked why it was entering the aviation sector. “But I firmly believe for Tata Group, Air India is not just a business opportunity. It’s a responsibility,” he said.“Every single percentage growth in GDP will give a 2% growth in the domestic aviation sector. (If) India grows 8%, the aviation industry grows 16%. And this game will play out... at least for the next three decades. So, this is going to be a very exciting phase of economic growth, and for the aviation sector in particular,” he said, adding, “But it’s not easy. It’s increasingly difficult because the sector faces continuous challenges. ” He said the global supply chain makes the availability of parts, infrastructure and new aircraft unpredictable.Chandrasekaran also mentioned that aviation is a very capital-intensive business and the industry margins are thin. Noting that India is already the fourth largest economy, and becoming the third largest economy, he said the 8.2% GDP growth in the July-Sept quarter was “just fabulous.”And India will grow at 7% at least, this fiscal year, he added.According to him, there is increasing consumer confidence and consumption-led growth, and public infrastructure spending will additionally drive growth. “So, we will become a $5 trillion economy, and we will grow beyond that. We will do it faster, and the pace at which we add every additional trillion dollar will be shorter, and we will create exciting opportunities. But if this has to happen, one of the aspects that needs to work is connectivity,” he said.He said there are several aspects of the industry that one has to manage. “Geopolitics is a surprise. Suddenly, your flight routes will change, because you cannot fly over a territory. Your flights take longer, your fuel costs go up... We have to manage all of this,” he said.Chandrasekaran said demand for air travel is very high, and the aspirations of Indians are growing as everybody wants to be connected andtravel. “So I think our commitment is to build a world-class airline,” he further said.","Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran said Air India is not just a business opportunity but a “responsibility” for Tata Group.

NEW DELHI/BHOPAL: Maulana Mahmood Madani, head of Jamiat-Ulama-Hind, Saturday accused Supreme Court and govt of undermining minority rights and said that recent court verdicts, including those in the Babri Masjid and triple talaq cases, suggested that the judiciary was functioning ""under govt pressure"".""Supreme Court is entitled to be called 'supreme' only as long as it upholds the Constitution and the rights enshrined in law; otherwise, it loses moral legitimacy,"" Madani said, drawing a sharp response from the BJP which accused him of making inflammatory remarks and pushing the country towards division.Madani, who was addressing a meeting of the national governing body of the influential body of Deobandi critics, also justified the concept of Jihad as a ""noble duty"" aimed at ""eliminating injustice, protecting humanity and establishing peace"" and asserted that ""wherever oppression takes place, there will be jihad"".Alleging that ""anti-Islam forces"" have distorted the concept of jihad, turning it into a term synonymous with violence, to malign Muslims, he said armed struggle is sanctioned only to prevent oppression and disorder and that ""jihad is not an individual or private undertaking. Only a legitimate and organised state authority can determine it under Islamic jurisprudence.""He added, ""India, being a democratic and secular nation, is not an Islamic state; hence any debate about physical jihad here has no relevance.Muslims are constitutionally bound citizens, and govt is responsible for protecting the rights of all.""Madani also reiterated Muslims' opposition to the singing of national song Vande Mataram.BJP's response was swift and furious. ""'Whenever there is oppression, jihad will be waged' is an extremely inappropriate remark as terror and violence have been inflicted not only on India but across the world in the name of jihad,"" said party spokesperson Sambit Patra.""His statement that Supreme Court has no right to call itself supreme is extremely unfortunate and completely unacceptable,"" the BJP spokesperson further said, adding the apex court can take suo motu cognizance of his comments.On Madani's stand against Vande Mataram, Patra said that such a mindset hurts the country's unity and constitutional values. ""He should remember that Vande Mataram is not a symbol of any religion but the fragrance of India's soil and the voice of its soul. In the 150th year of Vande Mataram, Madani's provocative comments expose his divisive agenda.""Govt has celebrated the anniversary of Vande Mataram with several events, with there being talk that it may seek a discussion on India's national song in the upcoming session of Parliament.Madani's remarks come close on the heels of his uncle Arshad, head of the rival faction of the Deobandi outfit, alleging that Muslims were being persecuted.

BJP slams Mahmood Madani

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind president Maulana Mahmood Madani on Saturday said the term “jihad” is being deliberately misused to malign the Muslim community, stressing that it actually means a “struggle against oppression. ”He alleged that “enemies of Islam” are responsible for distorting the term.“Enemies of Islam and Muslims have turned the word ‘jihad’ into a synonym for abuse, conflict and violence. Phrases like ‘love jihad,’ ‘land jihad,’ ‘taleem (education) jihad’ and ‘thook (spit) jihad’ are used to insult the faith of Muslims. Sadly, even responsible people in the government and the media use such terms without shame,” he remarked.“In Islam, ‘jihad’ appears in the Quran in several contexts — as a call to one’s duties, to the welfare of society and humanity, and, when referring to war, as a struggle to end oppression and violence.(whenever there is oppression, there will be jihad),” the cleric added.Madani further alleged that the minorities' constitutional rights are being “undermined” and they are being “targeted.”Citing the Babri Masjid verdict and the criminalisation of triple talaq, he argued that the Supreme Court can be considered “supreme” only when it upholds the Constitution and the law.“After the judgments on Babri Masjid, triple talaq and several other matters, it appears that courts have been functioning under government pressure for the past few years… We have earlier instances too that raise questions about the courts’ character. The Supreme Court deserves to be called ‘Supreme’ only when it follows the Constitution and upholds the law. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t merit that title,” Madani remarked.The Jamiat chief also flagged bulldozer actions, mob lynching, and the takeover of Waqf properties, arguing that these developments have left Muslims feeling “unsafe.”Mentioining on the national song Vande Mataram, Madani contended that communities that surrender under pressure are “murda qaum (lifeless people),” while those that stay firm and confront challenges are “zinda qaum (living people).”“‘Murda qaum’ do not engage with difficulties — they surrender. They will be asked to recite Vande Mataram and they will comply immediately. That is the sign of a ‘murda qaum’. A ‘zinda qaum,’ however, must lift its morale and face situations head-on,” he observed.Hitting out at Madani, the BJP accused him of attempting to ""vitiate"" communal harmony.“He is a completely political person. I heard his speech. He was describing ‘jihad’ in an Islamic context… but he contradicted himself and said, ‘agar hum pe zulm hoga, toh jihad hoga’ (there will be jihad if we are oppressed). Who is he threatening — the Government of India?” Delhi BJP spokesperson Yaser Jilani told news agency ANI.Jilani warned Madani against issuing “threats.”“Don’t threaten like this. The Government of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi think for everyone. Mahmood Madani is trying to vitiate harmony,” he stated.","Jamaat Ulama-i-Hind president Maulana Mahmood Madani said the term ‘jihad’ is being deliberately misused to malign the Muslim community.

India is on high alert as Cyclone Ditwah continues to move north-northwest over the southwest Bay of Bengal and is expected to reach close to the North Tamil Nadu–Puducherry–South Andhra Pradesh coast by early November 30, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The agency has warned of heavy to extremely heavy rainfall, strong winds and the risk of urban flooding across multiple southern states as the system approaches land. The cyclone has intensified the level of alertness as it already left 123 dead and several missing in Sri Lanka.After crossing Sri Lanka, Cyclone Ditwah continues to intensify over the southwest Bay of Bengal. Earlier on Saturday, the IMD said the system was moving north–northwest and was likely to approach the North Tamil Nadu–Puducherry–South Andhra Pradesh coast by the early hours of Sunday, November 30.In its updated alert issued at 8.58 pm on Saturday, the IMD said the storm had moved nearly northwards at 10 kmph over the past six hours and, at 5.30 pm, was centred over the southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu coasts. It was located about 110 km northeast of Jaffna, 80 km east of Vedaranniyam, 100 km southeast of Karaikal, 190 km south-southeast of Puducherry and 290 km south of Chennai.The storm is very likely to continue moving north–northwest and reach the North Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts by early Sunday morning. As it tracks along the coastline, the system is expected to pass the Tamil Nadu–Puducherry stretch at minimum distances of 60 km by Saturday midnight, 50 km by early Sunday morning, and about 25 km by Sunday evening.Residents have been urged to follow safety instructions and remain indoors during severe weather.In Tamil Nadu, the government has rolled out extensive precautionary measures, as it could potentially face major impact with strong wind and heavy rains already lashing parts of the state.Rain triggered by Cyclone Ditwah lashed coastal and delta districts on Saturday, with Ramanathapuram and Nagapattinam witnessing the heaviest impact. Normal life in Rameswaram remained disrupted for a second day due to continuous rain and strong winds, and a few trees were uprooted in Nagapattinam.Heavy rain and strong winds were reported across the Cauvery delta, and farmers said paddy crops over nearly one lakh acres were submerged. In Chennai, surplus water from major reservoirs is set to be released as a precaution.State Disaster Management Minister K K S S R Ramachandran said it was still unclear whether the cyclone would make landfall near Chennai, but the government was fully prepared, with 28 SDRF and NDRF teams on standby and more likely to be airlifted. About 6,000 relief camps have been set up, and the Air Force and Coast Guard have been alerted.In Cuddalore district alone, arrangements have been made to provide food and shelter for more than one lakh people. Local authorities have identified 239 vulnerable areas, taken 925 pregnant women under medical supervision and readied teams to clear fallen trees and drain water from low-lying stretches.NDRF teams have been deployed across coastal districts, including Villupuram, Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Mayiladuthurai and Pudukkottai. Additional teams are on standby for Chennai and Puducherry.Meanwhile, flight operations across southern districts have been disrupted, with several flights cancelled. Small aircraft services at airports in Chennai, Madurai, Trichy and Thoothukudi will remain suspended from Sunday morning. Chennai Airport officials have advised passengers to check flight status and reschedule travel. Additionally, seven flights scheduled for Sunday have been cancelled at Chennai Airport amid forecasts of heavy rain. Of the day’s 47 scheduled services, 36 were domestic and 11 were international.Additionally, the Southern Railway also announced adjustments to train services for December.

Schools in Villupuram have also been ordered shut as the administration prepares for heavy rainfall, possible flooding, and disruptions to transport and power lines.As for damage to crops, Minister R Ramachandran stated that heavy rainfall has impacted paddy cultivation in the Cauvery delta districts and added that the government will provide compensation to affected farmers. ""In the Delta Districts, paddy cultivation is affected due to flooding from rainwater. We expect it to drain within 2 days, and once it does, we will calculate the loss and provide compensation to farmers,"" he said.Ahead of cyclone making landfall in India after devastating Sri Lanka, Strong winds and heavy rainfall also lashed the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh in addition to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The IMD has also forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall across parts of Andhra Pradesh from November 30 to December 3 under the influence of Cyclonic Storm Ditwah. The system, centred over the southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Sri Lanka as of 11:30 am after moving northwards at 10 kmph, is expected to bring intense rain to Tirupati, Chittoor, Prakasam, Nellore, Kadapa and Annamayya districts.Additionally, Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA) managing director Prakhar Jain stated tgat isolated places in Tirupati and Chittoor districts could receive heavy rainfall through Saturday.Squally winds reaching 60 kmph, and gale winds up to 70 kmph on November 30, have also been predicted. Fishermen have been advised to stay ashore, and authorities have urged the public to remain cautious. Coastal parts of Nellore in Andhra Pradesh are already seeing rough seas, strong winds and steady rainfall.The APSDMA has urged residents in vulnerable pockets of Andhra Pradesh to remain indoors and avoid unnecessary travel during peak rainfall.Officials warned that strong winds could uproot trees, damage weak structures and harm standing crops, particularly vegetables and horticulture nearing harvest.Thunderstorms with lightning have been forecast across South Coastal Andhra Pradesh, North Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema from November 30 to December 3. ""Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are likely at isolated places over SCAP, Rayalaseema, North Coastal Andhra Pradesh (NCAP) and Yanam,"" said the IMD in a press release.Railways Ministry announced that union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw checked preparedness of Southern Railway ahead of the cyclone's expectation to touch Indian land. ""In view of Cyclone Ditwah, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw reviewed preparedness with Southern Railway teams to ensure minimal disruption. War Rooms at Board, zonal and divisional levels activated. Railways is closely coordinating with civil authorities and continuously monitoring the situation until normalcy returns,"" said the ministry in a post on X.Cyclone Ditwah has already left a severe trail of destruction in Sri Lanka, killing 153 people, leaving 130 missing and destroying nearly 15,000 homes. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency as tens of thousands remain in shelters and several districts remain inaccessible.Authorities warned that heavy rains and high winds may continue due to the system’s indirect impact even after its exit.India has launched Operation Sagar Bandhu, deploying C-130 and IL-76 aircraft loaded with relief supplies, along with a naval ship that donated rations to local authorities. More rescue personnel have been pressed into action as conditions worsen in central Sri Lanka.",Cyclone Ditwah continues to move north-northwest over the southwest Bay of Bengal. It is expected to reach close to the North Tamil Nadu–Puducherry–South Andhra Pradesh coast by early November 30. The cyclone has intensified the level of alertness as it already left 123 dead and several missing in Sri Lanka.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125658110,imgsize-1124319,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Saturday unanimously elected Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav as the opposition coalition’s leader in the Bihar assembly, a decision taken at the alliance's first meeting since its drubbing in the recent state polls.The meeting was convened by Yadav ahead of the five-day assembly session beginning Monday.RJD MLA Bhai Virendra told reporters, “Tejashwi Yadav has been elected leader of the Mahagathbandhan in the state legislature. Naturally, he will also lead our party in the assembly.”Congress MLC Samir Kumar Singh, a working president of the grand old party’s state unit, noted that the choice was unanimous. “We have sufficient numbers, and he (Tejashwi) will also be the Leader of the Opposition,” he remarked.The Mahagathbandhan was routed in the elections, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) retaining power with 202 seats. The RJD-led alliance, which had won 110 seats against the NDA’s 125 in 2020, managed just 35 seats this time — 25 of them from the RJD.Singh added that members of both Houses voiced “concern” over how the elections were conducted. “These were anything but free and fair. The SIR, first carried out in Bihar, remains questionable. It’s no surprise there’s so much political friction in a state like West Bengal,” he observed.He further noted that the alliance would “continue to raise its voice inside the House on issues concerning the people and confront the BJP-led coalition if it backtracks on promises made during the elections.”",Tejashwi Yadav is the opposition coalition's leader in the Bihar assembly.

The Origin Of The Dispute

Muslim Chronicles on Ayodhya

Excerpt - The Ayodhya Temple-Mosque Dispute: Focus on Muslim Sources

""Babur got the mosque built after demolishing the Janmasthan and used in his mosque the stone of the same Janmasthan, which was richly engraved, precious kasauti stone, and which survives even today.""

""…a glorious mosque was built up during King Babar’s regime on the spot where Sita ki Rasoi tomb (?) is situated in Awadh.

During this Babari (dispensation) the Hindus had no guts to be a match for the Muslims.

“…all the temples of Ayodhya were turned into mosques by the Sultans of the past.”

European Account on Janmabhoomi

""Emperor Aurenzgebe got the fortress called Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place.

Others say that it was constructed by ‘Babor'...""

Account of Joseph Tieffenthaler

""However, there still exists some superstitious cult in some place or other. For example, in the place where the native house of Ram existed, they go around 3 times and prostrate on the floor. The two spots are surrounded by a low wall constructed with battlements. One enters the front hall through a low semi-circular door… On the 24th of the Tschet month, a big gathering of people is done here to celebrate the birthday of Ram, so famous in the entire India.""

Awadh was aghast. The city collapsed like a lamp about to lose its flame. Men, women and children followed him as though Ayodhya itself was walking away. They did not see a prince going to the forest, it was like something being forcefully torn away with the strings of hope that he might stay hanging loose. The moment he stepped away, the capital of the Kosala kingdom felt emptied of life. This is how Maharishi Valmiki portrays Ram’s departure for his 14-yearin Treta Yuga.The grief that filled Ayodhya in Valmiki’s verses did not stop at the edge of the forest. It travelled through centuries. It lived through kingdoms, invasions and courtrooms. It became devotion and politics. It became movements and marches. The 500-year-long Ram Janmabhoomi struggle was never just about land. It was about bringing Ram back. This time in Kaliyuga.Generations came and went, but the question survived: When will Ram Lalla return?He did return. On January 22, 2024, when the consecration ceremony of the deity was held. What was once a memory in scriptures and prayers finally took form in stone and light. The temple that had lived in longing now stands as faith fulfilled, and a civilisation reclaimed what it never stopped believing was its own.November 25, 2025, marked the final milestone with the completion of the temple and a “Dhwajarohan” event, attended by PM Narendra Modi , RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Addressing a gathering after the flag hoisting event on November 25, the Prime Minister stated that today the city of Ayodhya is witnessing yet another pinnacle of India's cultural consciousness.""This Dharma Dhwaja is not merely a flag, but the flag of the renaissance of Indian civilisation,"" he said, explaining that its saffron colour, the glory of the Solar dynasty inscribed upon it, the sacred Om depicted, and the engraved Kovidar tree symbolise the greatness of Ram Rajya.The story that had begun 500 years ago with the desecration under Mughal invader Babur slowly entered courtrooms, legal arguments and the political landscape. Each petition was an echo of a civilisational longing. Every verdict and every stay order became footsteps in a centuries-long journey.Ayodhya did not forget. Neither did the people who came on foot from distant villages, nor the saints who guarded the belief like a flame, waiting for the Ram Lalla's temple to rise again.The struggle took different shapes over the centuries. Mahant Raghubir Das and others filed suits not for power or land, but for the right to worship. The movement was still quiet then, but the silence was deceptive. The devotion was gathering strength!The story did not begin with courts or politics. It began in the sixteenth century when the temple at Ram Janmabhoomi was torn down, and a mosque was constructed under Babur’s general, Mir Baqi.The temple was demolished, but the faith was not. Hindus continued to worship at the site. The belief that this was Ram’s birthplace never broke. It lived through devotion, pilgrimage and collective memory.Several works in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu discussed the demolition of the Ramjanmabhumi temple and its replacement by Babri Masjid.In the book ""The Ayodhya Temple-Mosque Dispute: Focus on Muslim Sources"" by Harsh Narain, there's a mention of Al-Hind-u fi al- ‘Ahd al-Islami (India in the Islamic Era) by Maulana Hakim Sayyid Abd al-Hayy, which was translated into Urdu by Maulana Shams Tabriz Khan, under the title Hindustan Islami Ahd mein.In Tarikh-i Awadh (1919), written by Muhammad Najmul Ghani, it is stated:The Fasanah-I Ibrat, written by Rajab Ali Beg Surur in 1860, but first published in 1884, stated:Harsh Narain's work states that the Qaysar-u’t Tawarikh, which is an Urdu historical chronicle that describes the Janmabhoomi demolition and mosque construction, located the mosque in Sita ki Rasoi as well as the Janmasthan. It acknowledged,In one of the multiple accounts of foreign travellers, Joseph Tieffenthaler, the Austrian Jesuit, who stayed in India from 1743 till his death some four decades later, toured Awadh between 1766 and 1771.According to Meenakshi Jain's The Battle For Rama work, he was the first to refer to the destruction of a temple at Rama’s birthplace by a Mughal ruler. He saw Hindus worshipping a religious structure in the form of a vedi (cradle) in the premises, but said nothing about Muslims offering namaaz.He also noted the large gatherings of Hindus on the occasion of Rama Navami (Rama’s birthday). He wrote:Tieffenthaler also provided the earliest European documentation of the Hindu Janmasthan platform, which was later called “Ram Chabutra"".He futher writes:As dynasties and empires changed, the sacredness of the Janmabhoomi did not fade. The temple had fallen, but the birthplace was not forgotten. Devotion shifted to the Ram Chabutra in the outer courtyard, where pilgrims prayed, and saints kept vigil. Akharas, fairs and local traditions kept the belief alive.When the British arrived in the mid-1850s, they did not end the conflict. They fenced the site into two courtyards. Muslims offered namaz inside, while Hindus worshipped at the Ram Chabutra outside. The land had one history but two claims.In 1885, Mahant Raghubar Das filed the first suit to build a temple, but it was rejected. However, the worship continued.In 1934, clashes damaged the mosque, and the British repaired it, still avoiding the core question. The dispute remained unresolved and alive.Independence did not settle Ayodhya. In December 1949, idols of Ram Lalla were found inside the disputed structure. Authorities sealed it and declared the site disputed. The idol stayed inside, and worship continued from outside, while namaz stopped.In 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad and Paramhans Ramchandra Das filed suits seeking worship inside. More cases followed: Nirmohi Akhara in 1959 claimed management rights, and the Sunni Waqf Board in 1961 contested the property. The courts froze the status quo. The fight moved from streets to case files, petitions and orders.By the 1980s, the dispute had moved beyond the courtroom. The VHP adopted the Ram Janmabhoomi cause, and the RSS gave the campaign nationwide strength. The turning point came in 1986 when the Faizabad court ordered the gates of the structure to be opened, and the government allowed it.Within hours, darshan began, and Hindus entered after decades. Namaz did not resume. A locked shrine became an open site of worship, and the dispute that had waited behind iron bars stepped into public life.The opening of the gates in 1986 changed more than access to the temple. It changed the direction of Indian politics and public sentiment. For decades the issue had been faith and legal argument. Now it became a movement that spread into homes, streets and television screens.The telecast of Ramanand Sagar’sin 1987–88 turned the story of Ram into a national cultural moment. Families paused their Sundays to watch it. Streets emptied. Temples saw new crowds. Faith acquired momentum, and the Ram Janmabhoomi question began entering everyday life.In 1989, the VHP laid the foundation stone (shilanyas) near the disputed site with the approval of the Rajiv Gandhi government, and the issue moved further into national consciousness.The same year, the BJP officially adopted the Ram Mandir demand through the Palampur Resolution. A religious and cultural movement had now gained a clear political face.In 1990, LK Advani launched the Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya, mobilising lakhs of supporters across the country.The yatra provoked a counter-mobilisation and heightened tensions. When Kar Sevaks attempted to move towards the disputed site, the Uttar Pradesh government under Mulayam Singh Yadav ordered police firing. Several kar sevaks were killed. The movement intensified further.From late November 1992, lakhs of kar sevaks had gathered in Ayodhya under multiple Hindu organisations. The call for kar seva had built expectations thatwould happen on the ground. The events reached a climax on 6 December 1992. Crowds demolished the disputed structure, which opened a new chapter of religious, political and legal conflict.After the incident, the court cases multiplied. Commissions were formed. What began as a locked shrine had turned into one of the defining movements of modern India.After the 1992 demolition, the dispute shifted permanently into the courts. The central government acquired the site in 1993 and asked the Supreme Court to settle ownership. The title suits were transferred to the Allahabad high court, which examined archaeological, historical and documentary evidence.The 2003 ASI excavation report remains consistent with a large pre-existing structure below the demolished mosque.In 2010, the high court ruled that the land be divided among three parties, but the judgment was appealed by all sides.The case then moved to the Supreme Court, where a Constitution Bench heard extensive arguments on law, title, belief and history.In November 2019, the top court delivered its final judgment: The land was awarded for the construction of a Ram temple, and an alternative site was directed to be allotted to the Muslim side. The verdict ended the centuries-long legal battle and settled ownership of the Janmabhoomi.After the Supreme Court’s 2019 verdict awarding the disputed land for the construction of a Ram temple, plans for building began in earnest.A trust was formed to oversee development, and construction work proceeded over the next few years with architectural planning, sanctum layout, and preparations for consecration. On 22 January 2024, the new temple was inaugurated with religious ceremonies.On November 25, the ""Dwajarohan"" ceremony, hoisting the saffron flag atop the temple, reaffirmed the Mandir’s consecration and the restoration of the wounded civilisation.The long-standing legal and historical dispute thus entered a phase of physical reconstruction and symbolic closure, as devotees welcomed the final restoration of what they regard as their heritage.If one scrolls through the Ram Mandir movement wire-to-wire, the demand for the temple emerges not just as a caravan of facts and emotions, but as a testament to a faith that never faded.Those in the frontline of the movement, especially the Hindu community, continued their worship at the site, whether in the outer courtyard earlier or before the idol after 1949, sustaining an unbroken thread of devotion, which helped in healing and rekindling the oldest civilisation.","PM Modi Unveils World’s Tallest Bronze Statue Of Lord Ram In South Goa.

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar and his wife Usha Shivakumar offered prayers at Mandya’s Bhoo Varaha Swamy temple on Saturday, just hours after his breakfast meeting with chief minister Siddaramaiah amid a power tussle between the two leaders.“When I was in Tihar Jail, my mother-in-law and father-in-law came to this temple four times,” Shivakumar told reporters, referring to his September 2019 arrest by the Enforcement Directorate in a money-laundering case — which the Supreme Court eventually quashed in March 2024.The Congress leader, who also heads the party’s state unit, claimed that a “friend from another party” had been urging him to visit the temple for the past two years.Shivakumar added that the visit was scheduled only this morning.“When I came here, I felt a sense of glory. I asked the priest if I should bring anything, and he said it was enough to come for darshan. I don’t know if he performed a homa (sacred fire ritual) to secure a ‘high position’ for me. All the elders and deities are looking at me with love,” the deputy CM remarked.Earlier, after his breakfast meeting with Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar had described the leadership talks as “productive.”The chief minister had invited his deputy at the behest of the Congress high command.The power tussle between the two dates back to an alleged promise made to Shivakumar after the Congress’ sweeping victory over the BJP in the Karnataka assembly elections in May 2023. The party leadership had chosen the veteran Siddaramaiah as chief minister, appointed Shivakumar his deputy, and reportedly assured a transfer of power after 2.5 years for the remainder of the government’s five-year term.The Siddaramaiah camp — and the chief minister himself — has repeatedly maintained that he will complete his full tenure.","Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet.

A320 Grounded: Here Is Why 6000 Aircraft Across World Couldn't Fly | Inside Story Of Software Snag

Also read:

NEW DELHI: A cosmic curveball forced a frantic fix as Indian operators of Airbus's best-selling A320 aircraft worked through the weekend to undo a software upgrade now tied to solar-flare risk.They rushed to roll back flight-control updates on 338 identified aircraft. IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express expect to finish the downgrade by late Saturday-Sunday night, averting what regulators warned could have caused pilots to briefly lose control during intense radiation events. Not all A320s were impacted.Working under DGCA supervision, airlines pushed the fixes without grounding fleets and avoiding mass cancellations at the peak of holiday travel. Updates took roughly 40-50 minutes for each aircraft. By 5.30pm Saturday, only four Air India Express flights were cancelled, with carriers bracing for delays of up to 90 minutes.According to DGCA, IndiGo, the world's largest A320 operator, had updated 184 of 200 affected jets by Saturday evening; Air India 69 of 113; Air India Express 17 of 25 - 278 aircraft, or 82% of the 338 flagged globally in Indian fleets. IndiGo announced before midnight it had completed the task.Earlier, IndiGo said on X its engineers had completed updates on 160 of 200 mandated aircraft by Saturday evening, with ""minimal delays and zero cancellations"", and expected to meet all deadlines.Air India said its teams had worked ""round-the-clock,"" anticipated full compliance within EASA's timelines and reported ""no cancellations"" due to the task, though some flights would run slightly late.Air India Express said most of its A320 fleet was already compliant and remaining aircraft were on track, crediting coordinated work across engineering, operations and safety teams.Airbus triggered the scramble late Friday after directing operators to revert flight control computers to a 2022 software build. Regulators in Europe, India and US quickly issued emergency orders.The move followed an Oct 30 JetBlue A320 event in which the jet allegedly pitched nose-down without pilot input while flying Cancun-Newark. The aircraft diverted to Tampa, where 15-20 passengers injured in the uncontrolled descent were hospitalised. Investigators later linked the issue to an upgrade, dubbed L104, for the elevator and aileron computer (ELAC).Airbus warned that solar radiation could corrupt data critical to flight controls on certain software-hardware combinations, prompting operators to revert to the older build on susceptible jets.Indian carriers received the first late-night alert around 9.30pm Friday. ""At first, it seemed a much bigger issue that would require grounding and a massive impact,"" said an official managing the response. Coordinated work across multiple maintenance bases revealed the rollback could be completed in under 50 minutes on newer aircraft, while older jets required additional hardware changes.Global carriers also cancelled and delayed services as the scale of the alert briefly appeared to run into thousands of aircraft before being narrowed to a smaller subset. Airbus said it acted after analysing an event ""revealing that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls"", adding it worked with regulators to ensure fleets remained safe.","Indian operators of Airbus's best-selling A320 aircraft worked through the weekend to undo a software upgrade.

‘Why? Why? Why?’ Mamata Slams EC, Flags ‘Unusual & Alarming’ Moves Ahead of Bengal Polls

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Saturday doubled the remuneration for Booth Level Officers (BLOs) from Rs 6,000 to Rs 12,000 per election cycle. The decision also includes an increase in pay for BLO supervisors, whose remuneration has been raised from Rs 12,000 to Rs 18,000.""The electoral roll machinery, consisting of Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), Assistant Electoral Registration Officers (AEROs), BLO Supervisors and Booth Level Officers (BLOs) do a lot of hard work and play a pivotal role in preparation of impartial and transparent electoral rolls. The Commission has therefore decided to double the annual remuneration for BLOs and also enhanced the remuneration of BLO Supervisors involved in the preparation and revision of electoral rolls,"" the EC said through a statement.The last such revision was done in 2015, the EC noted.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has formed a seven-member national coordination team to oversee the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls and identify any discrepancies, as well as address issues faced by BLOs nationwide.The committee will be led by BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh, with members Dr K Laxman, K. Annamalai, Om Prakash Dhankhar, Alka Gurjar, Dr Anirban Ganguly, and Jamyang Tsering Namgyal.The committee has commenced field visits as part of its review. On Saturday, Dr Anirban Ganguly visited Nadia district in West Bengal, his home state, to assess the progress of the revision exercise. The panel will continue monitoring West Bengal, where elections are scheduled next year, and the BJP aims to challenge three-term Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress until December 1.The review of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands has already been completed.The move comes amid reports of several BLOs committing suicide or dying under unnatural circumstances during the ongoing SIR of electoral rolls in 12 states, including Kerala, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh.Last week, BLOs clashed with police while attempting to enter the Chief Electoral Officer’s (CEO) office in Kolkata during a protest over alleged excessive work pressure.According to a senior official, members of the BLO Adhikar Raksha Committee held a procession from College Square in north Kolkata, carrying locks and fetters to symbolically seal the main entrance of the building housing the CEO’s office.","The Election Commission on Saturday doubled the remuneration for Booth Level Officers.

HC says cross-LoC trade between J&K & PoK is intra-state trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-says-cross-loc-trade-between-jk-pok-is-intra-state-trade/articleshow/125663637.cms,"Pak Slams Rajnath's Sindh Remark But Ignores Its Leader Claiming Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana As Own

SRINAGAR: A division bench of the Jammu and Kashmir high court has stated that cross-LoC trade between Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir amounts to intra-state trade as PoK is part of Jammu and Kashmir.While deciding petitions from cross-LoC traders, the HC said, “It is not disputed by learned counsel appearing on either side that the area of the state presently under de-facto control of Pakistan is part of territories of the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, in the instant case, the location of the suppliers and the place of supply of goods were within the then state of Jammu Kashmir (now Union Territory) and, therefore, the cross-LoC trade effected by petitioners during the tax period in question was nothing but intra-state trade. ”“We appreciate the fair stand taken by the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners despite there being contrary pleadings disputing the nature of cross-LoC trade as intra-state trade,” the division bench, comprising Justices Sanjeev Kumar and Sanjay Parihar, observed.The petitioners had challenged show-cause notices issued to them by the Superintendent, CGST, under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, stating that when trade was started in 2008, “intra-state sales tax was governed by the Jammu and Kashmir Value Added Taxes Act, which provided that cross-LoC trade was a zero-rated sale.”However, in 2017, when GST was rolled out, the authorities started investigations against the petitioners to probe whether they had paid GST on their outward and inward supplies. After getting information that there were huge outward and inward supplies effected by the petitioners, show-cause notices were served on them.The petitioners also argued that even if it was assumed that the trade was intra-state, a tax demand would be impermissible as the trade was barter trade where no money exchanged hands.The HC said it found no merit in all these petitions and dismissed them.In 2008 after improving relations between India and Pakistan as confidence-building measures, both govts decided to allow free cross-LoC trade between them on certain terms and conditions.However, on April 9, 2019, the Indian govt suspended cross-LoC trade on grounds that the trade routes were being misused to funnel illegal weapons, narcotics, and fake currency.Two steps — a cross-LoC bus service and cross-LoC trade — were seen as the two biggest CBMs between India and Pakistan. On April 7, 2005, the then prime minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, had flagged off the first cross-LoC bus service, titled Karwaan-e-Aman, or peace caravan, that connected Srinagar to Muzaffarabad. Later, cross-LoC trade, established as barter trade, began on Oct 21, 2008, on two routes — Salamabad (Uri)-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalakot.

If this action did not happen on your orders, then order an inquiry and suspend the officials responsible,” he told reporters.The house was levelled Thursday morning by JDA teams accompanied by a large police contingent. Daing said his father built the structure 40 years ago and the family had lived there ever since. His counsel, lawyer Sheikh Shakeel Ahmad, alleged the demolition was “selective targeting” executed by JDA vice chairman with support from district authorities.Former J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina visited the site Friday and expressed solidarity with the family. He said he spoke to Sinha and claimed the latter told him “the LG administration did not use bulldozers.So where did this action come from? I don’t want to politicise this”.Choudhary accused Raina of lying. “Ask him to show his call records and prove he actually spoke to the LG,” he said. He praised neighbour Kuldeep Sharma, who offered land to Daing’s family, calling it “a powerful example of the brotherhood that defines J&K”.Omar accused Raj Bhavan–posted officers of carrying out “selective demolitions” to allegedly undermine the elected govt. “Development authorities, revenue officials — these should be our officers. Instead, officers are being posted without consulting us, and they take dictation from somewhere, use bulldozers,” he alleged.Choudhary said Omar “never supported actions driven by revenge”. “If officials acted on their own without consulting the LG or the CM, they should be placed under suspension,” he said, adding J&K govt backs moves to retrieve encroached land but insisted action “must not be selective” and should begin with “influential land grabbers, not the poor”.",Demolition of journalist Arafaz Ahmad Daing’s home in Jammu by Jammu Development Authority (JDA) has triggered a political confrontation.

SRINAGAR: Leh Apex Body (LAB) urged Saturday a judicial probe panel to obtain medico-legal case (MLC) reports of all civilians injured in alleged firing by security forces on Sept 24 during protests in Leh for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.LAB spearheaded the protests as the largest political and religious group in the Union territory of Ladakh. It made the demands in a representation to the probe commission headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, a day after the panel extended the deadline for such submissions and evidence to Dec 8.LAB member and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is among the over 70 people arrested over the violence that left four people dead and over 80 injured. He has been charged under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).In its submission, LAB urged the commission to accord post-mortems reports of deceased civilians the highest importance in its inquiry.“All CCTV full footage recorded by Ladakh Police on Sep 24 between 10:00am and 6:30pm must be collected, preserved, analysed and thoroughly examined by the commission. In particular, footage from a 360-degree CCTV camera installed slightly outside NDS Memorial Park (near the site of the violence) must be retrieved and scrupulously scrutinised,” states the representation submitted by LAB convenor Gelek Phunchok and coordinator Tsering Stanzin.LAB has expressed skepticism over some cops being wheeled into hospital several days later. “Approximately 20 police personnel were brought to SNM Hospital several days after Sept 24, claiming injuries. The timing, intention and motive behind presenting these personnel for medical examination long after the incident must be thoroughly investigated to rule out any attempt to fabricate or exaggerate counter-claims of injury,” LAB said.Complete and accurate counts of bullets and ammunition, including pellets and tear-gas shells, fired by police and CRPF personnel that day must be ascertained from official records and made public before the inquiry commission, LAB said.LAB has stressed that its points are “integral and non-negotiable components of fair and credible inquiry”. “Any omission or oversight in these matters would seriously undermine public faith in the judicial system.”Union home ministry (MHA) had announced the commission after demands from LAB and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), another key Ladakh organisation.

Recall sleeper buses flouting safety norms; hold officials accountable: NHRC to states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/recall-sleeper-buses-flouting-safety-norms-hold-officials-accountable-nhrc-to-states/articleshow/125661773.cms,"file photo

NEW DELHI: Amid instances of fatal fires in sleeper coach buses, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed all chief secretaries to take immediate action, including to recall buses flouting mandatory safety norms and carry out rectifications. These include removing the partition between driver and passenger section, installation of fire detection and suppression system (FDSS) and stricter checking of accreditation and certification of bus body builders.Terming the violation of motor vehicle rules and automotive standards laying down mandatory norms for sleeper buses by bus body builders and officials as “criminal negligence”, the commission issued directions to state govts to fix accountability on persons whose negligence has endangered public safety. “Initiate immediate action to fix accountability on officials who granted approval for fitness certification of CMVR and AIS,” the human right watchdog said. It has asked states to submit an action taken report in two weeks.The instructions were issued after the commission received an action taken report (ATR) submitted by Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT), an entity under road transport ministry, into the fatal bus fire on Jaisalmer-Jodhpur highway on Oct 14 that claimed 20 lives and left another 16 injured.CIRT identified shortcomings in the bus body building, which violated the safety standards prescribed under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR) and Automotive Industry Standard (AIS) for sleeper coach buses. These included the driver partition door, inadequate emergency exits and non-existent FDSS. These findings have also been formally communicated to Rajasthan govt.CIRT suggested recalling all sleeper coach buses, immediate removal of driver partition doors and sliders fitted to all sleeper berths. It also suggested that all such buses should install FDSS within one month and fire extinguishers of 10 kg must be checked and all bus bodies built with extension to chassis must be removed from operation.NHRC noted that the bus that caught fire was not built in accordance to rules for sleeper coaches with the bus body builder violating mandatory safety norms and wondered how it was permitted to operate despite gross violations. “This reflects serious systemic lapses not only on the bus manufacturer/ body builder but also on part of transport department officials who are responsible for approval, inspection and fitness certificate. This compels the commission to further observe that this accident was completely preventable, had the officials concerned enforced mandatory safety standards and in letter and spirit,” it said.","The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed all chief secretaries to take immediate action.

IndiGo And Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India

NEW DELHI: Airlines across nation are rushing to complete emergency software upgrades on more than 350 Airbus A320-family aircraft after a rare global safety directive warned that intense solar radiation could corrupt flight-control data and trigger sudden, uncommanded aircraft movements.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) ordered immediate compliance on Saturday after Airbus flagged a vulnerability in ELAC B flight-control computers running software version L104, the same configuration linked to an October 30 JetBlue A320 incident in which the aircraft unexpectedly pitched downward without pilot input, injuring several passengers and prompting a US federal investigation.The Ministry of Civil Aviation, quoted by ANI, said late Saturday that IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express have accelerated upgrades across their fleets and expect full compliance by the end of the day. IndiGo has 200 affected aircraft and has completed upgrades on 184, with the remainder expected to be cleared by 23:59 hours. Air India has 113 aircraft requiring the fix and has completed 69 installations, while Air India Express has upgraded 17 of its 25 affected aircraft. The DGCA has stressed that no aircraft may operate until the mandatory modification is complete, except for repositioning flights to maintenance bases.Airbus issued the urgent global alert after determining that solar flares can, under certain conditions, corrupt data used by the aircraft’s elevator control computers, potentially causing unexpected control-surface movements. The company has instructed operators worldwide to immediately revert to an earlier, stable software version. The issue affects about 6,000 A320-family aircraft globally, although roughly 1,000 older jets may require hardware replacements, a process that will take longer.The directive has triggered widespread disruption during one of the busiest travel periods of the year, with airlines across Europe and the Americas reporting delays and cancellations as they verify software versions and apply the fix. American Airlines has identified hundreds of aircraft requiring the update, Air France has cancelled several flights, Avianca has paused ticket sales into December, and carriers including Delta, Finnair, Volaris and Air New Zealand have warned of operational impact. Europe’s aviation regulator, EASA, has directed operators to complete the fix before their next flight, acknowledging the inconvenience but underscoring that safety remains paramount.Although the update takes only around two hours per aircraft, maintenance lines worldwide are already stretched by ongoing engine-related groundings and labour shortages, forcing airlines to use overnight maintenance windows and short turnaround periods to complete the repair. Airbus’s directive is among the most significant recalls in its history and comes at a time when more than 3,000 A320-family aircraft were airborne globally, highlighting the scale and urgency of the operation.India operates one of the world’s largest A320 fleets, dominated by IndiGo and the Air India group. The A320, which introduced fly-by-wire controls to commercial aviation in the 1980s, now accounts for a substantial share of global traffic. The latest safety update adds to the mounting technical pressures on the aviation sector as regulators move quickly to address emerging electronic and software vulnerabilities linked to space-weather events.","IndiGo and Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India.

Delhi Court Extends Anmol Bishnoi’s Custody; NIA Probes Gang-Terror Links

NEW DELHI: A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court has convicted two additional accused in the Al-Qaeda conspiracy case, sentencing them to 20 months in prison.The verdict follows last month’s ruling in which another individual was jailed and fined for involvement in the same terror plot linked to the banned organisation.Mohd. Mustaqueem and Shakeel, both residents of Lucknow, have been convicted by a special NIA court under Section 25(1B)(a) of the Arms Act read with Section 120B of the IPC. The court sentenced each of them to 20 months’ imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000, as cited by ANI.The convictions follow the NIA’s filing of a main and a supplementary chargesheet against six arrested individuals in the Al-Qaeda conspiracy case.The arrests were made following information provided by Al-Qaeda operative Umar Halmandi, who had recruited individuals in Lucknow to build an Al-Qaeda module in the region.Halmandi also informed investigators about the outfit’s affiliate, Ansaar Gajwatul Hind (AGH), which had been formed to carry out terror attacks in several Uttar Pradesh cities, particularly Lucknow, before August 15, 2021.""Umar, who was based at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was operating in Lucknow with the aim of preparing youth to carry out terrorist acts before Independence Day 2021 in various cities of Uttar Pradesh, it was found during the probe in the case,"" an official statement said on Saturday, as cited by PTI.According to the NIA, Mohammad Moid, along with co-accused Shakeel and Mohd. Mustaqeem, helped Minhaj and Museeruddin procure weapons and ammunition to advance AGH’s terror plot.Mohammad Moid has been sentenced to the period he has already served in prison, 1 year, 9 months, and 13 days, along with a fine of Rs 5,000. The sentence, under Section 25 (1B)(a) of the Arms Act, read with Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), was handed down after he pleaded guilty.According to NIA investigations, Minhaj was radicalised by the accused Tawheed and Adil Nabi, also known as Musa, and subsequently conspired with Museeruddin, who pledged loyalty (baiyat) to further the terror plot. Together, Minhaj and Museeruddin procured arms, ammunition, and explosive materials with the intent to wage war against the Government of India.","Mohd.

NEW DELHI: Former two-time Wazirpur MLA Rajesh Gupta joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday, quitting the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on the eve of bypolls in the AAP-run Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).Gupta, who was inducted into the BJP by Delhi unit chief Virendra Sachdeva, grew emotional as he urged AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to introspect on why “many people” have left the party — and why more may do so in the near future.""...I was left with no choice (but to resign). Many others want to leave - I suggest they should and come to a party which is actually working for the nation. A party which would respect and not 'use and throw' its workers,"" he said at a press conference with Sachdeva.Gupta then began to choke up and received a pat on his back by Sachdeva, who tried to calm down the ex-AAP leader.“I spoke with you (Sachdeva) only yesterday. I am a nobody — a defeated MLA — yet the love and respect you showed me moved me. The party I was in… its chief never spoke to me, never visited my home, never even called.

SIR issue set to rock winter session

NEW DELHI: The all-party meeting ahead of the winter session of Parliament will be held at 11 am on Sunday, a day before the session opens.It will be followed by the Business Advisory Council meetings of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at 4 pm.A meeting of the Floor Leaders of the opposition INDIA bloc will be held at 10 am on Monday in the office of Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.During the all-party meeting, the government is expected to seek cooperation from all political parties to ensure the smooth functioning of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The session will conclude on December 19, with several important legislations scheduled for discussion and passage during this period.Parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC) are expected to raise the issue of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise — and the deaths allegedly linked to it — in West Bengal and other parts of the country during the Parliament session, according to senior TMC leader Derek O'Brien.The opposition, including the TMC, which is seeking a fourth consecutive term in West Bengal when the state goes to polls in mid-2026, has been accusing the Election Commission of imposing “SIR-linked inhuman pressure” on ground staff through compressed timelines and “unworkable deadlines.”O'Brien claimed the ""accelerated"" voter-roll revision has caused fear, fatigue, and fatalities among Booth Level Officers (BLOs) and citizens. He added that the party will question why West Bengal has been subjected to the ""most intensive scrutiny,"" while several border states with similar demographics have been exempted.“Why have Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur, all bordering countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar, been entirely exempted? Why is Assam under a lighter Special Revision? Is the real intent to challenge Bengali identity and systematically prune Bengali voters from the rolls?” O'Brien asked.Official data shows the West Bengal SIR is nearing completion, with 7.64 crore forms circulated, 82 per cent digitised, and 99.8 per cent of voters covered in the door-to-door verification drive.Phase two of the “purification” of electoral rolls — the first phase was conducted in Bihar ahead of its recently held assembly polls — began on November 4 and covers nine states, including West Bengal, and three Union Territories.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set up a national coordination team to monitor the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls and flag any “discrepancies,” along with issues faced by Booth Level Officers (BLOs) across the country.The seven-member committee will be headed by BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh. Its other members include Dr K Laxman, K Annamalai, Om Prakash Dhankhar, Alka Gurjar, Dr Anirban Ganguly and Jamyang Tsering Namgyal.The panel has already begun field visits. On Saturday, Ganguly visited Nadia district in his home state, West Bengal, to review the revision exercise. West Bengal, which heads to polls next year as the BJP attempts to challenge 3-term chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress, will be covered by the committee until December 1. The review in the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands has already been completed.The Election Commission recently announced “phase 2” of the SIR across nine states and three Union Territories. The exercise has seen reports of BLO deaths and resignations, attributed in some cases to work pressure. Phase 2 — the first was in Bihar ahead of the state's recently-conducted assembly polls — began on November 4 and will culminate with the final voter list publication on February 7, 2026.According to the Election Commission, 99.43 per cent of enumeration forms had been distributed by November 28, covering more than 50 crore electors. A total of 5,32,828 BLOs are handling the on-ground distribution and collection of these forms across the 12 states and UTs, supported by 11,40,598 BLAs. Uttar Pradesh has seen the highest volume of distribution, with 15,39,93,688 forms handed out.So far, 74.1 per cent of forms have been digitised. Lakshadweep has completed digitisation of all its 57,813 forms, while Uttar Pradesh currently trails with 54.97 per cent digitised — 8,48,82,670 forms.","The seven-member committee will be headed by BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh.

Explained: Why Vikram-I Could Transform India’s Satellite Launch Market And Global Space Leadership

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus and unveiled India’s first commercial orbital rocket, Vikram-I, which will launch satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).Emphasising that India is on track to emerge as a global leader in the satellite launch ecosystem, Modi said, “The private sector is making giant strides in India's space sector. Skyroot's Infinity campus is a reflection of new thinking, innovation and most importantly, youth power. Our youth's innovation, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship are touching new heights.”Extending his best wishes to Skyroot CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana and company co-founder Naga Bharath Daka, the PM said the two entrepreneurs are an inspiration for young people. “Growth of the private space sector, spearheaded by companies like Skyroot, is also a testament to the govt's efforts to foster innovation and private enterprise in the space domain,” he said.The Infinity facility, spread over 2 lakh sq ft in Hyderabad, will have the capability to design, develop, integrate and test multiple launch vehicles, with a capacity to build one orbital rocket every month. It adds to Skyroot's 55,000-sq-ft integrated rocket design and development facility — Max-Q — near Hyderabad airport.Pointing out that though India’s space journey began with limited resources, its ambitions were never limited, Modi said: “India has proven that the height of dreams is determined not by resources but by resolve. Today, India possesses space sector capabilities that only a few countries in the world have.”He also praised Isro, saying it “has for decades given new wings to India’s space journey.” Modi also recalled the reforms undertaken in the space sector, with his govt opening up the sector to private innovation and preparing a new Space Policy.Modi highlighted that more than 300 space startups are today powering India’s space aspirations, with most of them starting out with small teams. “Gen-Z engineers, designers, coders and scientists are creating new technologies, whether in propulsion systems, composite materials, rocket stages or satellite platforms.”Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said that in just five years since the space sector was opened up, over 350 space startups have emerged. “The Infinity campus and Vikram-1 are testaments to what can be achieved when entrepreneurial ambition meets enabling policy. We are building more than rockets. We are building a competitive space economy,” he said.Skyroot co-founder Pawan Chandana said the company was ready to launch Vikram-1, fully designed and built in India, in the next two months. Pointing out that decisive space reforms had unlocked the skies for startups to fly, co-founder Naga Bharath Daka said Skyroot has already generated over 1,000 hi-tech jobs and will be investing around Rs 1,000 crore soon to become one of the few companies worldwide to achieve rapid and on-demand launch capabilities.Set up in 2018 by the two IIT alumni and former Isro scientists, Skyroot became the first Indian company to successfully build and launch a rocket into space with suborbital rocket Vikram-S.","PM Narendra Modi virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing leadership crisis in Karnataka over the chief ministerial post, veteran Congress leader M Veerappa Moily on Friday launched an attack against the party high command, saying that “discipline” has to be brought into the party.Talking to news agency IANS, the former Union minister said that the high command representatives should have foreseen some of these developments in the state.“If you want to turn it into a political turmoil, yes, it can happen, but the leaders of the Congress party who are in responsible positions, and also our high command representatives, whoever they may be, should have foreseen some of these developments. It’s not a sudden development,” Moily said.“I will not comment on who should continue, whether he should continue or whether a new Chief Minister will come or not. I am not on that. First, discipline has to be brought into the party,” he added.The Congress leader further claimed that the ongoing developments in Karnataka will party's prospects, saying that the party leadership step down.""What is going on is not in the best interest of the party.

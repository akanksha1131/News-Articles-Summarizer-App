NEW DELHI: CPI general secretary D Raja on Tuesday questioned the government's push for a ""Naxal mukt Bharat"" and urged it to accept the proposal made by Naxal groups for talks.His comments have drawn sharp criticism from the BJP, which accused the Congress and its allies of backing Maoist violence.While addressing an event in Delhi, Raja questioned the intent behind anti-naxal operations, alluding it was bound to fail according to him as was BJP’s said agenda of “Congress mukt Bharat”.He said, “What is this Naxal Mukt Bharat? Already, they spoke about the Congress Mukt Bharat. What happened to Congress Mukt Bharat? Tomorrow they will say Communist Mukt Bharat,” Raja said during a press conference, as per news agency ANI.The CPI veteran added, “If the BJP and RSS, combined, continue to be in power, the future of India will be imperial. If we want to save India, save the constitution, we should remove the BJP RSS from power.”The remarks come in the backdrop of the ongoing anti-Naxal operation, dubbed Operation Black Forest, under which the number of most-affected Naxal districts has reportedly come down to six.Reacting to Raja’s statement, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari accused the Congress and CPI of “supporting violent Naxals and Maoists,” and “opposing India’s fight against Red Terror.”In a post on X, Bhandari wrote, “What is this Naxal Mukt Bharat’ says CPI Gen Secretary D Raja! Rahul Gandhi's alliance partner CPI gives support to violent Naxals and Maoists! Congress CPI opposes India's fight against Red Terror.”He further alleged that the CPI and Congress are “Pro Naxals, Pro Red Terror”, and accused them of compromising internal security and “ideologically patronising” left-wing extremism. “Congress CPI are ‘Political Tukde Tukde Gang’,” he wrote.The CPI is part of the INDIA alliance, which includes the Congress and other opposition parties gearing up for the upcoming assembly and general elections including Kerala where CPI shares power.","CPI general secretary D Raja questioned the government's push for a ""Naxal mukt Bharat"" He urged it to accept the proposal made by Naxal groups for talks.

The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and the protection of civilians on both sides. It also stresses the need for stronger regional cooperation and international monitoring to ensure compliance.Trump has argued that only a detailed, step-by-step framework can restore stability.Hamas has yet to give its judgement on the 20-point plan.

India Calls Out Pakistan Twice at UNHRC Over Terror and Kashmir Lies, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bombing

NEW DELHI: In order to smoothen Lashkar-e-Taiba operations and ensure uninterrupted training in a new terrain, the Pakistani military has launched a “clean-up drive” in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province to neutralise Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan TTP ) cadre in Lower Dir district.The clean-up drive, launched in June this year, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation. The recent aerial attack on an alleged TTP facility in Tirah Valley in KPK on Sept 22 was a part of this drive, an intelligence dossier has disclosed.Though Pakistan was the main patron of the Taliban — a militia of fundamentalists trained in Deobandi madrasas in Pakistan — and helped them fight and beat Russians, Americans as well as local ethnic groups like Tajiks and aided them install themselves in Kabul, the TTP has refused to be as pliant as ISI — Pakistan’s spy agency — expected it to. Its assertion of autonomy can potentially be problematic for ISI’s plans to find a new base for the LeT in KPK, considering that it is the homeground for Taliban.ISI has tried to recruit terrorists from the Lower Dir region for the jihad against India, Al Badr, but LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen had no presence there before Operation Sindoor in May. “Due to sectarian differences — TTP being Deobandi and anti-Pakistan and LeT following the Ahle Hadith ideology and being pro-Pakistan — there have been targeted killings of LeT commanders in Lower Dir by TTP operatives,” according to the dossier.In 2011, the LeT had tried to establish a temporary training centre in Lower Dir, but a suicide bomb attack carried out by TTP at the funeral of an LeT commander had led to the deaths of dozens of LeT members, a source said.Since June, the Pakistani army and air force have killed over 40 civilians in airstrikes, officially claiming these operations aimed at making Khyber Pakhtunkhwa “terror free”. “These operations are in reality focused on removing terrorists hostile to the Pakistani state while simultaneously facilitating the establishment of anti-India terror groups in the region, reflecting Pakistan’s longterm state strategy of endorsing ‘good terrorism’ while eliminating ‘bad terrorism’,” said a source.Lashkar, the sources said, has also been asked by Pakistani spy agency ISI to share training facilities with the Hizbul Mujahideen.“Operationally, the LeT’s new training centre expected to be completed by Dec 2025 poses a long-term threat. While still under construction, it is already emerging as a fresh hub for terrorist training,” the source added.","Pakistan has launched a ‘clean-up drive’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province to neutralise Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan TTP ) cadre in Lower Dir district.

Indian aid for Palestine close to record $80m in last 11 years: Govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-aid-for-palestine-close-to-record-80m-in-last-11-years-govt/articleshow/124222832.cms,"India has faced criticism for its flip-flop over the Gaza issue, like its decision to abstain from voting on a UNGA resolution for unconditional truce

India’s Bold UN Stand: Delhi Backs Palestine’s Two-State Solution, Testing Ties With 'Friend' Israel

NEW DELHI: India’s developmental assistance of close to $80 million for Palestine in the past 11 years is almost double that of the amount that was given in the preceding 65 years, according to Indian authorities. India has continued to extend humanitarian assistance to the people of Palestine both bilaterally and through UNRWA, despite the ban imposed on the agency by Israel. It contributes annually $5 million to UNRWA and has provided $27.5 million to the agency since 2020-21.“India’s developmental assistance, given to Palestine since 2014 is almost double of what was given in the preceding 65 years (around $42 million) and projects worth $40 million are in the pipeline,” said a diplomatic sourceWhile govt has faced some criticism for its flip-flop over the Gaza issue, like its decision in June this year to abstain from voting on a UNGA resolution for lasting and unconditional ceasefire, it believes India’s overall position, including its long-standing commitment to a 2-state solution, has remain unchanged.Indian authorities also see as significant that the govt hasn’t voted against any of the 175 resolutions on Israel-Palestine issues in the UN during past 10 years, suggesting India’s voting pattern at UN has remained unchanged. India was among the 142 countries that voted recently in favour of a UNGA resolution endorsing the New York Declaration that outlined tangible, irreversible and timebound steps for a 2-state solution.Since the Gaza conflict erupted in 2023, India has had to do a tough balancing act between its increasingly important relationship with Israel and its traditional support for the Palestinian cause. It has strongly condemned the Oct 7, 2023, terrorist strikes by Hamas, defending Israel’s right to defend itself from acts of terrorism, but equally condemned the loss of civilian lives in the Israel-Hamas war and sought respect for international humanitarian law.While the recent visit by Israeli hardliner Bezalel Smotrich raised eyebrows, govt sees it as a visit purely in his capacity as Israel’s finance minister to sign a bilateral investment agreement. The deal was under discussion for the past six years, before it was finalised last month. According to Indian authorities, the visit was meant to ramp up India’s economic and financial ties with Israel.“India remains concerned at the security situation and has called for a ceasefire, release of all hostages and peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.At the same time, India has emphasized the need for safe, timely and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Palestine,” said a source, citing Palestinian ambassador Abdullah Shawesh’s recent remark that he is satisfied with India’s position. India has also been calling for efforts to bring Israel and Palestine closer for early resumption of direct peace negotiations.","India’s developmental assistance of close to $80 million for Palestine in the past 11 years is almost double that of the amount that was given in the preceding 65 years.

Understanding organizational restructuring, severance implications, and the economic drivers behind workforce decisions can help professionals navigate transitions more strategically. Resilience in uncertainty: Even in high-performing firms reporting revenue growth, such as Accenture, which posted a 7% year-on-year increase to $17.6 billion in the June-August quarter of fiscal 2025, job security is not guaranteed, making emotional resilience and strategic foresight critical for sustaining a long-term career.

Looking ahead

Global consulting giant Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across its offices worldwide in the past three months. The company cited slowing corporate demand and the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) as primary drivers of the workforce reduction. While the restructuring, valued at $865 million, aims to align the company with evolving client needs, it also signals a broader shift in the skills white-collar professionals will need to remain relevant.Accenture Chief Executive Officer Julie Sweet addressed analysts, explaining that the company is “exiting people on a compressed timeline where reskilling is not a viable path for the skills we need.” The statement underscores a growing reality in corporate environments: not all employees can be retrained fast enough to meet the demands of rapidly changing technology. Sweet emphasized that the company will prioritize workforce alignment with client demand for AI-driven solutions, a move that may result in further exits in the months ahead.At the end of August 2025, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. The layoffs , part of a continuing process expected to run until November 2025, reflect both operational restructuring and the financial imperative of managing severance costs.The company projects that the initiative will save over $1 billion, even as it seeks to retain core talent capable of delivering on AI-focused projects.Alongside workforce reductions, Accenture is investing in upskilling programs focused on agentic AI, a new class of tools designed to automate complex decision-making and operational tasks. Sweet noted that these programs are essential for meeting client expectations as businesses globally seek to reinvent operations with AI. For white-collar professionals, the implication is clear: developing proficiency in emerging AI technologies is no longer optional but increasingly central to career sustainability.While the Accenture layoffs are significant, they offer critical lessons for professionals navigating a transforming work environment:Accenture’s approach demonstrates a broader trend: the integration of AI into corporate strategy is reshaping not only business models but also the expectations placed on white-collar professionals. Those who embrace continuous learning, anticipate technological shifts, and develop highly relevant skills will find themselves better positioned in a rapidly evolving job market.The Accenture example highlights that career growth today depends on adaptability, specialised skills, and strategic planning. For white-collar professionals, the message is clear: the future favours those who prepare for it, not those who simply wait.","Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across its offices worldwide in the past three months.

NEW DELHI: In a significant step to fast-track land acquisition and construction of the first-ever rail link between India and Bhutan — a project of major strategic importance — the railways has designated the proposed 69-km Kokrajhar-Gelephu rail line as a Special Railway Project (SRP).The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) issued the notification this week under the Railways Act, 1989. Officials said the national transporter has put the project priority list as a part of the government’s Act East policy.In March 2024, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bhutan, both countries agreed to establish two rail links between India and Bhutan: Kokrajhar-Gelephu and Banarhat-Samtse. The 16-km Banarhat-Samtse stretch will connect West Bengal with Bhutan.These lines will give Bhutan its first-ever railway connectivity.Senior railway officials said that SRPs are important as they have strategic importance, strengthen national security and boost socio-economic growth through improved connectivity. “This is a strategic project as it will improve cross-border connectivity and strengthen bilateral ties. In this year’s budget, funds were allocated for preliminary engineering-cum-traffic survey and final location survey for the new line,” said an official.This classification helps in prioritising resource allocation for projects and funds for their timely completion.The NFR has completed the final location survey and the detailed project report which would cost around Rs 3,500 crore. The project includes construction of six new stations — Balajan, Garubhasa, Runikhata, Shantipur, Dadgiri and Gelephu. The corridor will have two important bridges, 29 major bridges, 65 minor bridges, one Road Over Bridge and 39 Road Under Bridges. Two viaducts, each 11 metres long, will be constructed for safe and efficient train travel across various terrains.","The proposed 69-km Kokrajhar-Gelephu rail line has been designated as a Special Railway Project (SRP) The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) issued the notification this week under the Railways Act, 1989.

India Pushes Forward Trade Agenda As Goyal Addresses Tariff Pressures And Global FTA Plans

Poll Should India prioritize expanding its ties with the EU over its relationship with Russia? Yes, focus on the EU No, maintain ties with Russia

The 13th round of India-EU negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) this month was a missed opportunity, but the EU remains committed to concluding a “meaningful package” by the end of this year, EU ambassador to India Herve Delphin has said. India and the EU will hold another round of FTA talks in Brussels on October 6, hoping to close several chapters that both sides could not in the last round here.Delphin’s remarks confirm that there are lingering issues that both sides need to address to be able to meet the year-end deadline. EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, who visited India this month, had said that he expected more progress in the last round.Separately, Germany’s ambassador to India Philipp Ackermann told TOI last week the 13th round was good but not good enough, while expressing confidence that India and the EU will get down to closing more chapters in the next round. Before the 13th round, only 12 of the 24 chapters, including SMEs, transparency, dispute settlement and customs and trade facilitation - had been closed.“The 13th round earlier in September was a bit of a missed opportunity to make some breakthrough. The EU was and is still ready to conclude on a meaningful package. We look forward to India engaging in earnest and moving, like the EU has shown readiness to do, towards a mutually beneficial deal,” said Delphin, addressing an event that explored the way forward in India-EU relations against the backdrop of global disorder.Delphin said that the EU and India offer each other important strategic options to “de-risk the economic turmoil and the security uncertainties, to tap into our complementarities and combine respective strengths and scale to serve each other’s interests”.The EU push towards strategic autonomy and India’s own, as Delphin said, strategic conundrum in the form of challenges posed by the US, China and Russia have forced both sides to diversify their partnerships. However, India’s energy ties with Russia, as EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said this month, remains an impediment to progress in India-EU ties. On its part, India wants EU to shun “double standards” on the issue of Russian oil, with the MEA reminding the EU last week of President Donald Trump’s remarks urging Europe to not purchase Russian energy.Delphin said it is for India to consider how it can square its position on Russia, a strategic partner, with its support for peace and its desire to enhance ties with the EU. Apart from its energy ties with Russia, India’s participation in the Russia-Belarus military exercise Zapad-2025 has also been met with disapproval in Europe.“We also have to be clear-eyed about those issues on which we are not aligned...there is a Russia question - specifically linked to its war of aggression against Ukraine and its hostile attitude towards as seen in past weeks and days and the violation of European air space by Russian drones,” said Delphin.“India has pronounced itself for peace. Russia is a strategic partner for India. And India wants to deepen its ties with the EU. This will require further consideration in Delhi on how to square those terms,” he added.","The 13th round of India-EU negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) this month was a missed opportunity, EU ambassador to India Herve Delphin has said.

NEW DELHI: Going for a consensus with key opposition parties, Congress has decided to boycott the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on three bills that prescribe automatic dismissal of CMs and ministers who are in jail for 30 days.While it comes on the back of boycott announced by TMC Samajwadi Party , AAP and Sena UBT, the decision of the lead opposition player implies the participation of remaining INDIA bloc parties like DMK , NCP, Left is also doubtful — raising the possibility of an entire opposition no-show in the crucial panel that will vet the bills including the 130th constitutional amendment that was tabled by Union home minister Amit Shah in the monsoon session of the Parliament.Congress sources said the decision on staying away from the JPC has been taken and a communication will be sent to the govt/Speaker soon.The stance shows that Congress has gone with key allies who decided to boycott early on, even as it was inclined to join the panel arguing that the govt could not be given a free reign in the committee. The concern about opposition unity was high since the four parties went ahead with their decision of boycott.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal had hinted as much when he told TOI that Congress will seek a consensus with the INDIA bloc and take a collective decision.Tabled in Lok Sabha on Aug 30, the bills triggered a bedlam in the House. The Parliament has not been able to announce JPC despite a passage of nearly a month since a decision to refer the three bills to the panel was announced.","Congress has decided to boycott the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on three bills that prescribe automatic dismissal of CMs and ministers who are in jail for 30 days.

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes. This year, we decided to replicate the Durga Puja pandal made by Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Kolkata in 2022 on the theme of Vatican City,"" Yadav said.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal had expressed concern on Thursday on X, saying, ""This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion.

BENGALURU: Social media platform X said on Monday it was “deeply concerned” by a Karnataka HC order that empowers “millions of police officers” to issue arbitrary content takedown notices through a new portal called Sahyog.The Elon Musk-owned X said it will appeal the Sept 24 order as part of its broader effort to defend free expression in India but did not indicate whether it would be filed before HC or Supreme Court.The firm said it respects and complies with Indian law, but argued that the court’s decision fails to address key constitutional concerns it raised in its challenge. It drew attention to a recent Bombay HC ruling striking down a similar framework as unconstitutional.The platform rejected the view that its foreign incorporation prevented it from taking such positions, stressing it contributes significantly to public discourse in India and places user voices at the centre of its operations. A post from its Global Govt Affairs handle reads: “This new regime (takedown notices through portal) has no basis in the law, circumvents Section 69A of IT Act, violates Supreme Court rulings, and infringes Indian citizens’ constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression.The company said the framework would allow content removal based solely on allegations of illegality without judicial review or due process for speakers, while threatening platforms with criminal liability for non-compliance.The post followed a HC ruling last Wednesday dismissing X Corp’s petition against govt takedown directions. Justice M Nagaprasanna held that American free speech standards cannot be transplanted into Indian constitutional thought and no global platform can bypass Indian law. HC had described social media as “a modern amphitheatre of ideas” that cannot be left to “anarchic freedom”. “Unregulated speech, under the guise of liberty, becomes a licence to lawlessness,” the order stated.","Elon Musk-owned X said it will appeal the Sept 24 order as part of its broader effort to defend free expression in India.

NEW DELHI: SC has ordered sending an additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) and a sessions judge in Delhi for training to the judicial academy after finding fault in orders passed by the judicial officers. Bail was granted by ACMM to a habitual offender couple and the same was upheld by sessions judge.A bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti made it clear that it was not “whittling down pro-liberty principles” but the conduct of accused was such that they should not have been given bail and referred how the accused couple had earlier taken Delhi high court for a ride for four years, a fact which was not taken into consideration by lower courts and the HC also while granting them relief in a cheating case.The couple, facing criminal proceedings in six similar cases, had allegedly cheated Rs 1.9 crore on the pretext of selling a piece of land which was already sold and they refused to refund the money and an FIR was lodged against them subsequently. They then managed to get anticipatory bail from Delhi HC in 2018 after assuring the court to pay back the amount and they enjoyed liberty for almost five years. But they resiled from their statement and failed to pay the amount, compelling HC to cancel their bail in 2023 and by that time chargesheet in the case had been filed.Contending that chargesheet had already been filed, the couple had approached trial court for regular bail which was granted by trial judge and it was upheld by sessions judge and Delhi HC. The apex court also objected to HC order upholding the bail despite it having passed strong observations against them in earlier round of litigation.“In this backdrop, the ACMM, despite being made aware of HC’s order dated Feb 1, 2023 and even noting the same, proceeded on the simplistic premise that since the chargesheet had been submitted, no useful purpose would be served by taking the accused into custody, particularly as the stand taken by the Investigating Officer was that custodial interrogation was not required. Such reasoning, in our view, is untenable, inasmuch as the same glossed over the private respondents’ conduct, including undertakings made before a higher court viz. HC,” the bench said.“Before parting, we would be failing in our duty if we turned a blind eye to the manner in which the ACMM granted bail to the accused and the sessions judge refused to interfere with such grant of bail. In the facts herein, we deem it appropriate that the judicial officers who passed the orders shall undergo special judicial training for a period of at least seven days. The learned CJ of Delhi HC is requested to make appropriate arrangements for such training at Delhi Judicial Academy, with particular focus on sensitising the judicial officers on how to conduct judicial proceedings, particularly in matters where decisions of superior courts are involved and the level of weightage to be accorded thereto,” it said.",Bail was granted by ACMM to a habitual offender couple and the same was upheld by sessions judge.

Amid Trump Tariffs, EAM Jaishankar Warns Of ‘Tariff Volatility, Market Uncertainty’ In UNGA

NEW DELHI: The Union commerce ministry told a key parliamentary panel Monday that US tariffs on India’s pharma exports will have a limited impact because India largely exports “generic drugs” instead of “patented drugs” that will bear the brunt of the US decision.At a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, a top commerce ministry official, who has been engaged with the US on trade deal negotiations, is learnt to have said that fresh US pharma tariffs are applicable to all exporters worldwide with the exception of the European Union (EU), and India’s principal rival China is also subject to the same tariff regime.“It neutralises any relative disadvantage for India,” he reportedly said.Though the agenda for the meeting was a discussion on the performance audit of “export promotion capital goods”, PAC chairman KC Venugopal and some MPs like Jagdambika Pal are said to have asked the official several questions on the US tariffs and the future scenario.The official said that while engaging with the US to work out a balanced bilateral trade agreement, India has the objective of buffering domestic sectors like agriculture and sensitive industries, and expanding exports.He highlighted that continued high tariffs are bad for the economy as they erode competitiveness and bring down export growth.Marine exports like fish face a challenging scenario as they are burdened with 50% tariffs in the United States, placing India at a relative disadvantage when compared with competitors like Ecuador, which face lower tariffs. Indian exporters will thus lose ground in the absence of a bilateral trade deal prescribing lower tariffs, he added.Stating that India is also seeking to diversify its export markets to reduce dependence on the US, he listed the FTAs signed recently, like with the European Free Trade Association, comprising Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein — which will help marine exports on account of low tariffs.He said that the FTA with the UK will be activated next year, removing 8-12% duty on marine exports to the UK.",The Union commerce ministry told a key parliamentary panel Monday that US tariffs on India’s pharma exports will have a limited impact.

Rajnath Singh Hails India’s New Stealth Frigates, Calls Them ‘F-35 On Water’ In Naval Power Push

NEW DELHI: Stressing that warfare is now measured in hours and seconds, with satellites, drones and sensors redefining the nature of conflict, defence minister Rajnath Singh Monday directed the Coast Guard to develop a futuristic road map that anticipates new challenges, adapts new strategies and integrates cutting-edge technologies.“Preparedness, adaptability and rapid response must be the cornerstones of Coast Guard’s vision,” Singh said while addressing top commanders of the maritime force.Warning that maritime threats are increasingly becoming technology-driven and multi-dimensional while cyber and electronic warfare are present-day realities, Singh said India needs to integrate AI, machine learning-based surveillance, drones, cyber defence etc into its maritime security framework to stay ahead of terrorists, criminals, pirates and adversaries.“A nation may attempt to paralyse our systems, not with missiles, but through hacking, cyber attacks and electronic jamming. Automated surveillance networks and AI-enabled systems are essential to reduce response times to seconds and ensure readiness at all times,” Singh said.Urging Coast Guard to maintain not just routine surveillance but also keep a close track on geopolitical events for readiness to respond swiftly to external developments, he said “instability” in neighbouring countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh often spills into the maritime domain, especially in the Bay of Bengal, through refugee influx, illegal migration and irregular maritime activities.Singh said any disruption in sea trade can have “cascading effects” on the security and economy alike. “We must treat national security and economic security as one and the same,” the minister said.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh Monday directed the Coast Guard to develop a futuristic road map. “Preparedness, adaptability and rapid response must be the cornerstones of Coast Guard’s vision,” Singh said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124220465,imgsize-155820,width-400,resizemode-4/rajnath-singh-holds-indian-coast-guard-commanders39-meeting.jpg"

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

BAREILLY: At least 38 shops — mainly belonging to the minority community — were sealed by authorities in Bareilly on Monday, days after a clash erupted between police and protesters of the “I Love Muhammad” campaign last Friday. Shop owners alleged that the civic action was a reprisal for the violence.Locals said the shops, selling garments and footwear and located at Novelty Chowk about 200m from Clock Tower, were forcefully vacated by the Bareilly municipal corporation for “encroachment.” Shopkeepers said the units belong to the waqf board DM Avinash Singh said, “The shops have been sealed. If someone has any document regarding it, they can produce it before the municipal commissioner. We have checked and verified all documents before taking the step.”He added, “It was part of a crackdown on those rioters who tried to disrupt the city’s peace and law and order. The shopkeepers had also encroached upon a large drain on government land. The crackdown will continue.”Shopkeeper Mohd Waris countered, “Civic body filed a case for land ownership. However, we have a stay from the court. This action was taken only due to Dr Nafees Ahmed, spokesperson of Ittehad-e-Millat Council, who used to take rent from us. A civic team simply asked shopkeepers to vacate within three hours, without prior notice.”Internet services remained suspended in parts of Bareilly Monday as security forces maintained vigilance.","At least 38 shops, mainly belonging to the minority community, were sealed by authorities in Bareilly on Monday.

Her counsel argued amended Rule 8(d) of the 2019 scheme permits encashment after four years at lower interest.

NAGPUR: Holding that a minor’s consent for a physical relationship is “irrelevant” under current law, Nagpur bench of Bombay HC has refused to quash a case filed under Pocso Act against a 29-year-old Washim man who married a 17-year-old and fathered her child. HC ruled Friday that the FIR cannot be dismissed merely because the girl married the accused and later became a mother.Dismissing a plea by M A Beigh and two family members to set aside the case, a division bench of Justices Urmila Joshi-Phalke and Nandesh Deshpande said: “Despite knowing the girl was a minor, he commits an offence from the moment he takes her away from the legal custody of her parents. Merely because the girl has given birth to a child, the criminal act cannot be brushed aside.”Beigh married the girl on June 2, 2024, when she was 17. She gave birth to a baby boy in May. Cops registered the case after learning of the childbirth and the mother’s age.Now an adult, the survivor supported the accused in court, stating their relationship was consensual and the marriage was approved by both families. Her lawyer urged the court to treat it as an “exceptional case,” arguing prosecution would harm both mother and child.HC, however, saidthe accused “ought to have waited till the girl attained 18 years of age,” adding that taking a minor from her parents’ lawful custody is an offence regardless of affection or marriage.The judges noted SC is examining whether consensual adolescent relationships deserve different treatment under the Pocso Act, but said that until Parliament amends the law, courts must follow it. It also cited govt’s opposition to lowering age of consent, warning it would “reintroduce the very mischief the law was enacted to prevent”."," Bombay HC refuses to quash a case filed under Pocso Act against a 29-year-old Washim man.

NEW DELHI: India’s cheetah reintroduction programme will notch a historic first on Monday when Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, becomes the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood- a crucial milestone in creating a self-sustaining population.“Mukhi, a female cub born to Namibian cheetah Jwala on March 29, 2023, will reach adulthood, as it will turn 915 days or 30 months old, on Monday, ready to contribute to increasing the cheetah population in India,” Project Cheetah director Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.Her survival is notable. “Of the four cubs Jwala delivered, three died due to extreme heat, but Mukhi survived and has grown well. Today our efforts have yielded encouraging results,” Sharma said.Project Cheetah began on September 17, 2022, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the release of eight Namibian cheetahs into a designated enclosure at Kuno—the world’s first inter-continental relocation of a large wild carnivore. Another 12 cheetahs arrived from South Africa in February 2023.India now hosts 27 cheetahs, of which 16 were born in the country. At Kuno, 26 cubs have been born since the project began, but 19 cheetahs—nine imported adults and 10 India-born cubs—have died so far, leaving 24 animals at Kuno and three at Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.Amid those losses, India today has seven more cheetahs than were initially imported, and Kuno’s cub survival rate stands above 61 per cent, exceeding the global average of 40 per cent.Officials call the progress a “big success” and are negotiating with African nations, including Botswana and Namibia, to bring in 8–10 more cheetahs by December to strengthen the gene pool.","Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, will become the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood.

Antonio Brown claims Jay-Z controls the halftime stage



Bad Bunny frames the performance as a cultural victory

The balance of power and purpose at the NFL’s biggest stage

The NFL ’s announcement that Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has sparked excitement across music and sports. But while fans celebrate the Puerto Rican superstar’s historic booking, former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is questioning how these selections are actually made—and pointing directly at Jay-Z.Antonio Brown took to X (formerly Twitter) to allege that Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, plays the decisive role in choosing halftime acts. He wrote: ""Barack Obama's best friend Jay-Z runs the Super Bowl selection process through his company Roc Nation which has an exclusive contract with the NFL. This is who chooses the halftime show, the most watched musical performance in America.""His claim adds weight to ongoing discussions about how much power Roc Nation holds in shaping one of the biggest entertainment moments in the world. Since 2019, Jay-Z has officially partnered with the NFL as its “live music entertainment strategist,” and Roc Nation has served as co-producer of halftime productions. Industry insiders, including producer Jesse Collins, have even said: “It’s a decision that Jay makes. Since we’ve been onboard with that show, he’s made it every year, and it’s been amazing. He’s always picked right.”Still, some analysts argue the process involves multiple layers of input, including the NFL, host cities, and broadcast partners.While Jay-Z may not have absolute control, his influence is undeniable.Amid the speculation, Bad Bunny himself is focused less on politics and more on representation.

Braelon Allen injury update: What happened to New York Jets RB that made him leave Monday Night Football game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/braelon-allen-injury-update-what-happened-to-new-york-jets-rb-that-made-him-leave-monday-night-football-game/articleshow/124223158.cms,"Braelon Allen injury update (AP Photos)

Braelon Allen injury adds to Jets’ offensive concerns



What’s next for Braelon Allen and the Jets



The New York Jets were dealt an early setback on Monday Night Football when running back Braelon Allen exited with a knee injury in the second quarter against the Miami Dolphins. The rookie went down after taking a hard hit during a kickoff return and was quickly escorted to the medical tent before limping to the locker room. Moments later, the Jets officially ruled him out for the rest of the game.Allen’s night had started with promise. Before the injury, he carried the ball four times for 26 yards, showing flashes of power and patience. However, the momentum shifted when he lost a costly fumble at the goal line on New York’s opening drive. “As Braelon Allen ran off the field after the fumble, Aaron Glenn grabbed both sides of his helmet to console him and give him words of encouragement,” sideline reporter Katie George noted during the ESPN broadcast.The emotional toll was clear. “Allen then spent a lot of time pacing, sitting and standing alone. He was obviously gutted to lose the ball at the goal line. Now, he’s in some physical pain, as they look at his left knee in the injury tent,” George added.For the Jets, Allen’s absence leaves the backfield thinner than planned. With Breece Hall already carrying the bulk of the offense, Isaiah Davis is now expected to step into a larger role.The team will need both to stay sharp if they hope to keep pace in the AFC East.The concern now extends beyond Week 4. A knee injury severe enough to sideline Allen immediately raises questions about his availability moving forward. In the first three games of the season, the 20-year-old logged 14 carries for 50 yards and a touchdown, carving out a role behind Hall.The Jets will await further testing to determine the severity of the injury. Losing Allen for an extended stretch would not only hurt New York’s depth but also slow the development of a rookie who was beginning to find his rhythm in the league.Also Read: Jake Browning’s fiancée Stephanie Niles turns heads with her unusual Bengals look ahead of Broncos clash",New York Jets running back Braelon Allen suffered a knee injury in the second quarter against the Miami Dolphins.

Poll Do you think India should have accepted the trophy from Mohsin Naqvi? Yes, it was just a formality No, a neutral official should present it

A video that surfaced on social media showed Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief and Pakistan minister Mohsin Naqvi leaving the stadium in protest after India refused to accept the Asia Cup 2025 trophy and winners’ medals from his hands.Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief, had waited on the podium for the post-match presentation. However, the Indian team, led by Suryakumar Yadav, refused to receive the trophy or medals, requesting that a neutral official hand them over instead.After discussions failed to resolve the situation, Naqvi walked off the stage. Officials were later seen taking the trophy away from the podium as well. The video brought to light the tense and unexpected moment, which brought the post-match ceremony to a halt.Speaking at the post-match press conference, India captain Suryakumar Yadav expressed disbelief at the incident. “This is one thing which I have never seen since I started playing cricket, started following cricket—a champion team is denied a trophy, that too a hard-earned one,” he said.“I feel we deserved it. And I can't say anything more. If you tell me about trophies, mine are sitting in the dressing room, all 14 guys with me, the support staff—those are the real trophies throughout this journey in the Asia Cup.”The BCCI has decided to lodge a formal protest with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against Naqvi’s actions. Despite the controversy, the Indian players celebrated their historic win on the field, even without the trophy in hand.On the pitch, India clinched clinched the 2025 Asia Cup title with a thrilling five-wicket victory over Pakistan. Riding on Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 69 off 53 balls and a vital 33 from Shivam Dube, India chased down a target of 147 with two balls to spare.Earlier, Pakistan had posted 146 all out in 19.1 overs, despite solid contributions from Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46). Indian spinners Kuldeep Yadav (4/30), Varun Chakravarthy (2/30), and Axar Patel (2/26) triggered a collapse that saw Pakistan lose their last nine wickets for just 33 runs. Jasprit Bumrah also chipped in with 2/25.This marked India’s third win over Pakistan in this edition of the tournament, following victories in the league and Super Fours stages. While the trophy controversy overshadowed the post-match proceedings, the Indian team’s performance on the field was a clear statement of dominance.","India beat Pakistan by five wickets in the 2025 Asia Cup cricket final.

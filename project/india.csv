'Hero Of Pakistan...': Sambit Patra's Scathing Attack On Rahul Gandhi Over Op Sindoor | BJP Vs Cong

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday filed an FIR against BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya and Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami for allegedly spreading false information, police said.The case, registered at High Grounds police station, was based on a complaint by Shrikant Swaroop B N, head of the Indian Youth Congress's legal cell.The two have been booked under Sections 192 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Swaroop accused Malviya and Goswami of ""masterminding a heinous and criminally motivated campaign to disseminate patently false information.""He said they ""maliciously propagated the fabricated claim"" that the Istanbul Congress Centre in Turkey is the office of the Indian National Congress.Earlier on Tuesday, Malviya posted an image comparing Rahul Gandhi to Pakistan's military leadership, accusing him of undermining India’s military and echoing Pakistan’s stance on Operation Sindoor.""This act was executed with clear and undeniable criminal intent to deceive the Indian public, defame a major political institution, manipulate nationalist sentiments, incite public unrest, and undermine national security and democratic integrity,"" Swaroop said.He also pointed out that the incident comes amid strained India-Turkey ties, worsened by Turkey’s perceived support for Pakistan.""The actions of Malviya and Goswami represent an unprecedented attack on India's democratic foundations, public safety, and national security. Their calculated misuse of influence to spread falsehoods with criminal intent demands the harshest response,"" the complaint alleged.Swaroop urged the Press Council of India, ministry of information and broadcasting, CBI, and other agencies to treat the complaint as an emergency.","The Congress on Tuesday filed an FIR against BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya and Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami.

"Jayant Narlikar: Walking softly, carrying a big shtick",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jayant-narlikar-walking-softly-carrying-a-big-shtick/articleshow/121303098.cms,"Stellar cosmologist Jayant Narlikar 's passing at 86 on Tuesday, peacefully and in sleep, is reminiscent of the gift of death at will, or the ""ichha-mrityu"" that grandsire Bhishma supposedly had in the Mahabharata. And speaking of grandsires, the demise of this much-decorated and beloved doyen of Indian astrophysicists coincides with the departures of larger-than-life grey eminences M R Srinivasan, venerated ""architect"" of India's atomic power programme, and Saroj Ghose, the much-admired ""father of the science museums movement"" in India.A man of exemplary personal grace and modesty, Narlikar epitomised what the American adage of ""walk softly but carry a big stick"" advocates. And what a shtick he wielded. Barely in his twenties, had he not the intellectual audacity to challenge the scientific theories, if not shibboleths, advanced by mages of the calibre of Albert Einstein and (posthumously) Ernst Mach and Kurt Godell? The Hoyle-Narlikar Theory of Gravity challenged the more popular Big Bang Theory of the birth of the universe, ostensibly from nothingness.Rather than sudden inflation, Narlikar and his mentor envisioned a steady expansion as an alternative model of cosmic genesis. Of course, in the true spirit of science, evidence ""background radiation"" garnered later put more bucks on the Big Bang than on Slow Pulse (prompting Prof Hoyle to recite a line to The Times of India during a long interview: ""Theories that come roaring like lions also, alas, retreat bleating like lambs!"")Like our early science stalwarts C V Raman, Homi Bhabha and Meghnad Saha, Narlikar was brilliant at public outreach and pedagogy.And the centre he set up for inter-universities research in Pune did win him a Unesco Kalinga Award.When he won the Sahitya Akademi Prize for his Marathi autobiography Narlikar spoke out against kite-flying - flights of fancy and fashionable claims being made on behalf of ""ancient"" Indian science these days. These included make-in-India vimanas and astras used by gods, demons and heroes for settling local land disputes.To separate such claims from science fiction - a genre in which Narlikar had also made a mark just as his mentor Fred Hoyle did - pure science demands stronger proof, or Pramana. The latter also happens to be the title of the India-born research journal on physics and maths, an arena in which Narlikar excelled winning a Wrangler at Cambridge (with a mathematical Tripos), just as Narlikar's father had done.By claiming credit for things about which we have no evidence or proof, Narlikar warned we run the risk of reducing the credibility of what our scientists did achieve in the past.Conversely, in his book Scientific Edge, Narlikar exhorts our science buffs and aficionados to boast about epic inventions of our ancestors, such as the concept of zero that completely revolutionised mathematics globally.In his fireside chats about the story of "" Zero as a Hero "", Narlikar also used to highlight a ""publish or perish"" (aka 'publicise or perish' for scribes) moral for wannabe scientists. For the longest time, he emphasised, Arabs got exclusive credit for what are now rightfully called ""Hindu"" numerals.The polymath also used to extol the ancient roots of scepticism in India, not perhaps of the kind of journalism practised by Skeptical Inquirer today but that of the Rig Veda, the oldest recorded Sanskrit poem in the world, which contains the priceless Nasadiya Sukta, an epiphany that dares to question the very existence of gods while raising cosmological questions of such profundity as would gladden moderns seers such as Guth, Hawking and Penrose.","Jayant Narlikar's passing at 86 on Tuesday, peacefully and in sleep, is reminiscent of the gift of death at will, or the ""ichha-mrityu"" that grandsire Bhishma supposedly had in the Mahabharata. The demise of this much-decorated and beloved doyen of Indian astrophysicists coincides with the departures of M R Srinivasan and Saroj Ghose.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121303327,imgsize-49528,width-400,resizemode-4/121303327.jpg"

(AI image)

Mango Shipments to US rejected

US authorities have rejected no fewer than 15 mango shipments from India at various airports, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta, due to documentation irregularities. The exporters faced the choice of either destroying the fruit in the US or sending it back to India. Given the perishable nature of mangoes and the substantial costs involved in return shipping, all exporters opted to dispose of the mango shipments locally.The United States represents India's primary export destination for mangoes, making these incidents particularly significant for the trade relationship.Considering mangoes are perishable and the substantial expenses linked to destruction or re-exportation, traders anticipate losses of around $500,000.The mangoes had undergone the required irradiation process in Mumbai on May 8 and 9. However, according to an ET report US officials found inconsistencies in the documentation related to this mandatory treatment, which involves exposing the fruit to controlled radiation doses to eliminate pests and prolong shelf life. The issue stemmed from administrative errors in the pest-control documentation rather than actual pest presence, the report said. USDA communication to an affected exporter indicated that US Customs and Border Protection refused entry ""due to incorrectly issued PPQ203."" The notice specified that the shipment ""must be re-exported or destroyed,"" whilst clarifying that the US government would not bear costs for ""remedial measures for this shipment.""The irradiation procedure takes place at a facility situated in Navi Mumbai, overseen by a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) representative. This official is tasked with validating the PPQ203 form, which is essential for mango exports to the US. ""We are being penalised for mistakes made at the irradiation facility,"" an exporter said.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right Another exporter, whose consignment was detained at Los Angeles airport during May 9-11, before receiving destruction orders, was notified that the shipment failed to satisfy the ""entry requirement,"" specifically regarding the mandatory irradiation treatment.The exporter firmly denied the allegation, asserting that the irradiation procedure was completed and the PPQ203 form was issued following the treatment. ""How can we receive the form if the treatment was never done? And without that form, issued by none other than the USDA officer, the mangoes couldn't even have been cleared for loading at Mumbai airport,"" he said.When asked about the specifics of the case, including the quantity of affected mangoes and documentation discrepancies, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Authority (APEDA) chairman's office responded, ""The matter pertains to the shipment of mangoes from USDA approved facility, Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) located at Vashi, Mumbai. Hence inputs may be sought from them. "" APEDA operates under the ministry of commerce and industry. MSAMB did not provide any response to the email enquiry.Meanwhile, India and US are looking to seal a trade deal soon. US President Donald Trump has claimed that India has offered a deal with 'literally no tariffs'. The first phase of the deal is expected to be completed in the coming months.India aims to enhance two-way trade by seeking tariff reductions from the United States for sectors employing large workforces. These include textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes, and bananas under the proposed trade agreement.The United States, in return, seeks reduced duties across various sectors including industrial products, automobiles (specifically electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical products, dairy items, agricultural produce such as apples, and tree nuts.According to a Bloomberg report, India is eyeing a three-phase trade deal with the US ahead of July when Trump's reciprocal tariffs become effective.Also Read | Donald Trump says India has offered a trade deal with ‘literally no tariffs’","Mango shipments to US rejected at Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta airports.

The incident comes three days after Abu Saifullah , a high-ranking Lashkar operative and key recruiter, was gunned down by unidentified gunmen in Pakistan.Terror sympathisers on pro-Lashkar's Telegram channels were rattled on Tuesday evening, asking members to stay strong during the ""crisis"", while insisting it was an ""accident"".Hamza, who belongs to Gujranwala city in Pakistan's Punjab province, was declared a global terrorist by the US in Aug 2012. The top LeT ideologue was referred to as 'Afghan Mujahideen' and was close to Hafiz Saeed and Abdul Rehman Makki, both UN-designated terrorists belonging to Lashkar, who had appointed him on the jihadi outfit's central committee.Before he moved to handling Lashkar's propaganda, Hamza was an active terrorist who was active in India in the early 2000s. He and Saifullah were part of the group behind the 2005 attack on the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. He was, however, pulled out of violent jihad and assigned to the propaganda division which he would soon head.Also read: Top LeT terrorist Abu Saiullah, behind 3 major attacks on India, eliminated in Pakistan's Sindh ""He also headed publication division of Lashkar and wrote books like Qafila Da'wat aur Shahadat (Caravan of Proselytizing and Martydom), Shahrah-e-Bahisht (The road to paradise),"" said a source.In 2018, Saeed had him form another outfit named Jaish-e-Manqafa in the wake of a ban on Lashkar and Jamat-ud-Dawah. The move had fuelled rumours of a rift in Lashkar's top brass but turned out to be a feint.According to US Treasury department, Hamza, a member of LeT's central advisory committee, actively maintained Lashkar's relationships with other groups under the direction of its emir Hafiz Muhammad Saeed.""Hamza has led an LeT-associated charity and was also an officer and member of a Lashkar's university trust that was led by Saeed. Hamza's responsibilities as of mid-2010 included publishing propaganda on behalf of Lashkar. Hamza has served as editor of an LeT weekly newspaper and was also contributing articles to the LeT publication,"" says the website.""Hamza was also one of three LeT terrorists designated to negotiate the release of detained Lashkar members and also served as the head of LeT's 'special campaigns' department,"" it adds.","Amir Hamza, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) co-founder, was hospitalised on Tuesday.

New law designed to rob Muslims of religious rights over waqf: Kapil Sibal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-law-designed-to-rob-muslims-of-religious-rights-over-waqf-kapil-sibal/articleshow/121301110.cms,"NEW DELHI: Urging Supreme Court to stay the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, the Muslim side claimed that the Union govt intended to expropriate waqf properties by de-recognising unregistered properties, including 'waqf by user', and by taking out ancient monuments such as Taj Mahal and Jama Masjid in Sambhal from the ambit of waqf.Leading a battery of senior advocates for the Muslim side, Kapil Sibal told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice Augustine G Masih that the 2025 law was ""framed and designed for wholesale capture of waqf properties through a legislative fiat, in a process that is non-judicial and purely executive"".When the CJI said courts prima facie presume a law enacted by Parliament to be valid, Sibal said Waqf Amendment Act was discriminatory as it had singled out the Muslim community by mandating that a waqif has to be a practising Muslim for five years to be entitled to donate his properties for waqf. ""Has any other religious denomination been mandated by law to ask the same question to anyone making an endowment for charitable purposes?"" he asked.Sibal said while laws governing waqfs mandated that only Muslims could be members of Central Waqf Council and state Auqaf Boards, the new law allowed govt to nominate persons who could be non-Muslims and even form the majority in the council and boards, thus taking away the right of Muslims to manage their religious bodies.""No religious endowment of Hindus, Sikhs or Christians allows a non-believer in that religious faith to be a member of their endowment administrative body,"" Sibal said, adding that these provisions in Waqf Amendment Act completely violated Muslims' right to religious activities guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of Constitution.He said singling out Muslim community was violative of Article 15, which mandates that no citizen is to be discriminated against on the ground of religion. Since the law was ex facie unconstitutional, its operation needed to be stayed till the SC tested its constitutional validity, he added.Sibal said both the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904 and its updated version of 1958 provided that any govt takeover of an ancient monument, which is a waqf property, for its preservation would not change its character or hamper Islamic religious rituals there. But the present law completely barred ancient monuments from being counted as waqf property, he added.Sibal said if there was a dispute over waqf land, or it was claimed to be govt land, then a govt-appointed officer would decide the dispute and on the basis of his recommendation, the state would carry out necessary corrections in revenue records. ""The govt's own officer deciding disputes over govt land without any prescribed procedure, without any judicial adjudication, is akin to becoming judge in its own cause,"" he said.Sibal and senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan referred to the Ayodhya judgment of 2019 as 'Babri Masjid case' and said in that judgment, the SC had protected the character of ancient monuments as mandated by the Places of Worship Act, 1991. The Waqf Amendment Act could not override the 1991 Act or the SC's five-judge bench judgment, they said.Senior advocate A M Singhvi said the govt's prejudicial argument that there had been a huge increment in waqf properties since the 2013 amendment was fallacious as waqf properties were always there and their registration on the govt portal had increased over the years.

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the just-settled controversy triggered by Congress' objections to govt picking its members for global outreach on Pakistan-sponsored terror , senior MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday called for bi-partisanship on matters of security like terrorism - a line also echoed by Congress MP Manish Tewari Tharoor, who announced he would be heading a multi-party delegation despite Congress not recommending his name, has sought pan-political consensus on terror, in what could be seen as a message to his party. The post-Pahalgam row has intensified with Congress seizing upon the video comment of foreign minister S Jaishankar to accuse him of informing Pakistan in advance about the military action.In a media article, Tharoor started with a lament over political parties ""weaponising grief for electoral advantage rather than forging a unified front"" and mentioned how India's swift retaliation over the Pulwama attack in 2019 became part of the election campaign narrative - a swipe at the governing BJP. But his call for political consensus in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and the row over delegations can be seen as an appeal to Congress to eschew political and procedural issues for larger national goal.Like Tharoor, Tewari too had signalled that he would do ""national duty"" by being part of the delegation, irrespective of what Congress decided. On Sunday, as the dust settled with Congress announcing that all its members would be part of the delegation despite being picked by govt, Tewari posted on X a Hindi movie song ""Dekho veer jawaanon apne khoon pe yeh ilzaam na aaye, Maa na kahe ke mere bete waqt pada to kaam na aaye"" - implying the sense of not being found wanting in national duty.The issue of delegations, where govt picked all four members from Congress despite the parliamentary affairs minister asking Congress to submit its choices, has created bitterness.","Senior MP Shashi Tharoor calls for bi-partisanship on matters of security like terrorism.

Yes, definitely No, current penalties are sufficient

NEW DELHI: Actress Ranya Rao and Tarun Raju on Tuesday were granted default bail by a Bengaluru court in connection with a gold smuggling case , but with strict conditions attached. The bail was granted after the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) failed to file a chargesheet within the legally prescribed period.However, Ranya will remain in custody despite the bail, as she is also facing proceedings under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA).COFEPOSA is a stringent preventive detention law aimed at curbing smuggling and safeguarding foreign exchange reserves.It permits authorities to detain individuals without trial for up to one year based solely on suspicion of their involvement in such offences.The bail was granted on the condition of two sureties each and a bond of Rs 2 lakh.The court also barred both from leaving the country and ordered them not to engage in similar offences.The case surfaced on March 3, when Ranya, also known as Harshavardhani Ranya, was arrested at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru with 14.8 kilograms of gold allegedly smuggled from Dubai.Earlier, on April 26 the Bengaluru hight court had rejected Rao's bail plea.On March 14 and 27, Ranya Rao’s bail pleas were also rejected by the Special Court for Economic Offences and the Sessions Court, respectively. Tarun Raju, a US citizen and a co-accused in the case, was also denied bail on April 7.Ranya’s counsel, meanwhile had accused the DRI of document manipulation and argued the offences are compoundable. Meanwhile, on April 22, the Central Government issued a detention order against Ranya under the COFEPOSA Act.Authorities valued the seized gold at Rs 12.56 crore. Investigations that followed uncovered that Ranya had travelled alone to Dubai 34 times between 2023 and 2025, raising suspicions of her involvement in a larger gold smuggling network.A subsequent raid on her residence led to the seizure of gold jewellery worth Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash. She has been charged under multiple provisions of Sections 135 and 104 of the Customs Act. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has also initiated proceedings under Section 108 to probe potential financial violations.","Ranya Rao and Tarun Raju granted default bail by a Bengaluru court.

HASSAN: Heart Lamp , a collection of short stories by city-based Kannada writer Banu Mushtaq , has won the prestigious International Booker Prize 2025 . The book was translated from Kannada to English by Madikeri-based translator Deepa Bhasthi.An advocate and journalist by profession, Banu Mushtaq has made her mark as a storyteller, poet, novelist, and social activist.The award was announced at a ceremony held at London’s Tate Modern. Author Max Porter, who chaired the 2025 judging panel, revealed Heart Lamp as the winner — notably the first short story collection to receive this honour.“Heart Lamp is something genuinely new for English readers,” said Porter. “A radical translation that ruffles language to create new textures in a plurality of Englishes. It challenges and expands our understanding of translation.”He praised the book’s vibrant and uplifting narratives, rooted in Kannada yet enriched with the socio-political depth of various dialects and languages. The stories, he noted, explore themes such as women’s experiences, reproductive rights, faith, caste, power structures, and oppression.“This was the book the judges really loved, right from our first reading,” Porter said. “It’s been a joy to witness the evolving appreciation of these stories through the diverse perspectives of the jury.”After becoming the first Kannada author to win the International Booker Prize, Banu told TOI: “This prize shows the true potential of the Kannada language, its literature, and the possibilities ahead if more works are translated into other languages, especially English.”She emphasized the need to introduce more Kannada literature to a global audience. “There is a need to bring more and more Kannada works to readers around the world,” she said.Recalling the final moments before the announcement, Banu said, “It was very tense. When Max Porter announced Heart Lamp as the winner, it was electrifying. Everyone stood up and began congratulating me.”She described the honour as a shared victory. “This is not individual recognition. It’s recognition of teamwork,” she said, adding that despite the global attention, “My writing will remain the same.”Reflecting on her journey, she signed off with: “Life is amazing — from travelling in bullock carts to standing on this global stage.”","Heart Lamp, a collection of short stories by city-based Kannada writer Banu Mushtaq, has won the prestigious International Booker Prize 2025.

Global outreach teams to justify Indus treaty stand post-Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-outreach-teams-to-justify-indus-treaty-stand-post-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121301430.cms,"NC MP skips MEA briefing, no confirmation yet if he'd join tour

NEW DELHI: The all-party delegations headed to different parts of the world as part of the outreach post-Operation Sindoor will apprise foreign capitals of the 'new normal' in India's approach to Pakistan's use of terrorism, including the decision to pause the Indus Waters Treaty In a briefing to members of three delegations, foreign secretary Vikram Misri is learned to have said that Pakistan's nuclear blackmail would no longer allow terrorists to work with impunity and that the military establishment would pay a heavy price for any attempt to carry out attacks in India through its terror proxies. "" Operation Sindoor is our new normal,"" a source quoted Misri as saying, showing that the anti-terror doctrine spelt out by PM Modi at Adampur on May 13 has been baked into foreign policy Misri is also learned to have said India could not adhere to the existing terms of IWT. ""The treaty was negotiated on the assumption of good neighbourliness... It has been belied by Pakistan's use of terrorism because of which we have not been able to realise even the share, inadequate as it was, allocated to us,"" one of the members of the delegation led by JD(U)'s Sanjay Jha told TOI.Moreover, the challenge of climate change makes a relook at the technical design of dams and other projects an absolute necessity, one of the members of the delegation led by JDU's Sanjay Jha told TOI.The doctrine spelt out by PM Modi on May 13 in Adampur signalled India's lower tolerance threshold towards terror as well as its refusal to give in to Pakistan's nuke blackmail.Given the risk of appearing to be insensitive towards a lower riparian state, the boldness on IWT, as articulated by Misri, points to govt's determination to force a re-negotiation of the treaty.Members of the delegations headed by Jha, Shiv Sena's Shrikant Shinde & DMK's Kanimozhi attended the briefings. However, Kanimozhi herself could not attend. NC MP Altaf Ahmed, who is on Kanimozhi's panel, skipped the meet and there was no confirmation till late evening on whether he would be going on the tour.While Tuesday's briefing was intended for the groups departing on May 21, 22 and 23, Misri will brief the remaining delegations on Friday, sharing with them the talking points that can be stressed to familiarise their interlocutors with what India sees as Pakistan's double-dealing on the issue of cross-border terrorism While there has been some talk about India-Pakistan re-hyphenation, govt believes the vast gap in economic fundamentals between the two nations will ultimately prevail, leaving Pakistan far behind in the global imagination.While underscoring the need for the international community to call out Pakistan for its cross-border adventurism over past 40 years, Misri briefed the delegations about how the world asks the two countries to exercise restraint when there's a flare-up of tensions but does not seek accountability from Pakistan even when its role is obvious to all in perpetrating the most heinous acts of terrorism.He cited example of how there had not been enough pressure on Islamabad to bring the guilty to justice in cases like Mumbai and Pathankot attacks. An MP quoted Misri as saying that trusting Pakistan was like ""trusting a chor (thief) to investigate the crime he had committed"".Misri also briefed the delegations about India's decision to put IWT in abeyance till the time Pakistan acted irrevocably against cross-border terrorism. Unfazed by Pakistan's propaganda and its claim that it was an ""act of war"", the delegates are set to take a firm position in defence of govt suspending the treaty.The foreign secretary reiterated India's stand on the issue and urged the delegates to convey to the world that the unrelenting cross-border terrorism from Pakistan interfered with ""our ability"" to exploit the treaty as per its provisions. ""It is only natural and well within India's right to hold the treaty in abeyance when the fundamental ground situations have changed,"" Misri is said to have told the delegates.",All-party delegations headed to different parts of the world as part of the outreach post-Operation Sindoor will apprise foreign capitals of the 'new normal' in India's approach to Pakistan's use of terrorism.

NEW DELHI: In a significant counter-intelligence operation, Haryana Police apprehended a man accused of espionage on behalf of Pakistan, marking the second such arrest in Nuh district within 48 hours.The suspect, identified as Mohammad Tarif, a resident of Kangarka village in the Taoru police station area, has reportedly made a revealing video statement admitting to key espionage activities, including a task to photograph and film the sensitive Sirsa airbase, as reported by ANI on Monday.In the video, he allegedly details his repeated interactions with Pakistani officials, his trips to Pakistan, and how he was allegedly recruited by personnel from the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi.""I went to the Pakistan Embassy in 2018 for my visa,"" Tarif said. ""A Pakistani officer interviewed me, took my number, and later asked me to provide two new SIM cards in exchange for a visa."" He claimed that after submitting the SIMs, the officer granted him the visa, and a transactional relationship began to unfold.Tarif went on to allege that after his return from Pakistan, the same official contacted him again, urging him to refer others for visas in exchange for cash.Over time, Tarif claims to have introduced 8-10 people for this purpose.In another revelation, Tarif said, ""He called me in 2024 and said, 'you have work here; come to the Pakistan embassy.'"" During this meeting, Tarif was introduced to another Pakistani official named Jafar. ""He said I may get transferred soon, so get in touch with Jafar,"" Tarif added.Then, he added that Jafar asked him to visit the strategic Sirsa airbase, photograph it, and send the visuals. ""He said, you have to do something for us and we'll pay you in lakhs,"" Tarif claimed in his statement.Law enforcement officials have since seized Tarif’s mobile phone and placed him under extended police custody for further interrogation. Authorities have filed charges under the Official Secrets Act, 1923, and relevant sedition provisions against Tarif, as well as two Pakistan High Commission officials- Asif Baloch and Jafar.This arrest follows the earlier detention of Armaan, another resident of Nuh’s Rajaka village, on similar charges.

ANCHI: Jharkhand Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) Tuesday arrested senior IAS officer Vinay Kumar Choubey and joint commissioner of excise department Gajendra Kumar Singh for their involvement in the alleged liquor scam in the state.Choubey, a 1999 batch IAS officer who was secretary to Hemant Soren in his previous term as CM, is at present principal secretary of panchayati raj department. He had served as the state excise department secretary and managing director of the Jharkhand State Beverages Corporation Limited during the Soren govt, which brought in the state's new excise policy.ACB has accused Choubey and Singh of deceiving the Jharkhand govt, leading to a loss of Rs 38 crore to the state exchequer. The officers misused their posts to select placement agencies under the liquor policy without following rules, ACB said.The two officers were questioned for around five hours at the ACB office before their arrest. They were then produced before the special ACB court, which remanded them in judicial custody till June 3. The case against Choubey, Singh and others were lodged under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.In Oct 2024, ED had carried out raids on the premises of Choubey and Singh in connection with the liquor scam in Chhattisgarh.Jharkhand BJP president Babulal Marandi said, ""I had written to the chief minister in April 2022 and warned him about the liquor scams taking place in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The govt not only ignored my letter and warnings but also helped carry out the scam worth thousands of crores in Jharkhand to benefit the liquor mafia of Chhattisgarh.""The former CM added, ""The entire cabinet of Hemant govt enjoyed the Raipur tour in the past at the expense of the same liquor mafia. Now, when action is being taken in Chhattisgarh and the matter has reached ED and CBI, how can the investigation being conducted by ACB in Jharkhand be trusted? It appears that due to fear of the ongoing CBI investigation in Chhattisgarh, some small fries are made scapegoats to save the big fish. If Hemantji really wants to bring out the truth of the scam and has the courage, he should order a CBI investigation.""","Jharkhand Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) Tuesday arrested senior IAS officer Vinay Kumar Choubey and joint commissioner of excise department Gajendra Kumar Singh for their involvement in the alleged liquor scam in the state.

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews , didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family.To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema Matthews’ story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs ’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.","Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight of it on her shoulders.

NFL shocked as Commanders owner claims their franchise now deserves the title of “America’s Team”



There’s a running joke in the NFL that no matter the day, no matter the stakes, and no matter your team loyalty, odds are, you’ll be watching the Dallas Cowboys . Whether it’s Sunday night, Monday night, or even Thanksgiving, the Cowboys are somehow always on your screen. That familiar sigh? It’s the ritual resignation of fans across the country, muttering at the NFL’s favoritism and Jerry Jones' media pull — and still, they watch. Why? Because, love them or hate them, the Cowboys are ratings gold.In 2024, Dallas once again proved their status as television royalty. According to Nielsen, the NFL dominated American television with 72 of the top 100 broadcasts — and the Cowboys claimed 13 of those spots. That tied them with the reigning champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. Other elite teams like the Ravens, Packers, 49ers, and Bills trailed behind. It’s a striking reflection of the Cowboys' cultural grip, even if their playoff success hasn't mirrored their broadcast domination.But just as Dallas enjoys its primetime presence, a surprising voice has emerged to challenge the team's iconic nickname — ""America’s Team.""During a recent community event in Washington, D.C., Marjorie Harris , wife of Washington Commanders ’ managing partner Josh Harris, made a statement that ruffled feathers in Dallas. While discussing her excitement for the NFL Draft coming to D.C. in 2027, she casually — but confidently — staked a claim that sent shockwaves through Cowboys Nation.""We have so much to look forward to, and look, the Commanders are America's Team ,"" Harris said with a smile. ""What better place than to have the NFL Draft than in the Mall?""The response was swift and predictably intense. Cowboys fans — who’ve clung to the “America’s Team” label since it was famously coined by NFL Films’ John Facenda in 1978 — weren’t pleased. The nickname has been a badge of honor, a symbol of national popularity that transcended even the team’s on-field performance.But in 2024, the Washington Commanders gave football fans plenty of reasons to sit up and take notice. After a dismal 4-win season in 2023, the team made a stunning turnaround, notching 12 wins and making it all the way to the NFC Championship. Spearheaded by dynamic rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, Washington looked electric, confident, and reborn. Credit goes to new GM Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn, who reshaped the team with purpose and resilience. But netizens are not finding enough reasons to give them the tag.Marjorie Harris’ bold declaration didn’t come out of nowhere. Unlike many team owners' spouses, she has taken an active role in the franchise’s community efforts and serves as the chair of the Washington Commanders Foundation. Her visible presence and leadership since the family's acquisition of the team in 2023 has only strengthened ties between the organization and its fan base.And perhaps that’s the larger point Harris was making. Her comment wasn't just about branding; it was about momentum, pride, and community engagement. The Commanders are not just back — they're becoming a franchise that fans, both old and new, can rally behind.Even Philadelphia Eagles fans — fresh off a Super Bowl win — have spent more time this offseason analyzing Jayden Daniels than celebrating their own title. And now, with Cowboys fans joining the fray in outrage, Washington seems to have successfully reinserted itself into NFC East relevance.Sure, Dallas isn’t going anywhere in terms of media exposure. They’ll still headline over a dozen national broadcasts next season. The brand is as powerful as ever. But for the first time in a while, someone’s actually challenging their long-standing title — not with nostalgia, but with fresh energy and results.So, are the Commanders really America’s Team now? Not yet. But if they keep winning, and keep making the right kind of noise — both on and off the field — that conversation might not sound so outlandish in a few years.And when the 2027 NFL Draft rolls into the National Mall, the whole country just might tune in… whether the Cowboys are playing or not.Also Read: Is this the end of the NFL's most beloved kicker?

Here, you can explore Tatsuki's predictions, her history of accurate foresight, and the response from concerned travelers.Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, known for her eerily accurate predictions about global events. Tatsuki first gained attention in 1999 with the release of her booka compilation of visions she claims to have experienced over the years. While the book initially received little mainstream attention, several of Tatsuki’s predictions have reportedly come true, earning her a devoted following in Japan and beyond.Some of her most notable forecasts are catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s northern Tohoku region.

Her book also allegedly foresaw the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the death of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, adding to her reputation as a modern-day seer.In a revised edition ofpublished in 2021, Tatsuki issued a stark warning about a potentially catastrophic event set to strike in July 2025. According to CNN and other media reports, Tatsuki’s prophecy describes a massive undersea rupture forming between Japan and the Philippines, capable of generating tsunamis three times the height of those seen during the 2011 Tohoku disaster.Her prediction includes unsettling imagery of Japan’s oceans “boiling,” which some interpret as a possible reference to an underwater volcanic eruption or a massive seismic event. The epicenter of this anticipated disaster is drawn as a diamond-shaped region connecting Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands – a part of the Pacific known for its intense geological activity.Reports indicate that Tatsuki’s prophecy has already started to influence travel behavior, particularly among tourists planning to visit Japan in the coming months. According to Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, bookings to Japan dropped by as much as 50 percent during the recent Easter break, a trend expected to continue as the feared date draws closer.Speaking to CNN, CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, noted that concerns over Tatsuki’s prediction have been compounded by recent advisories from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. In a statement issued in April 2025, the embassy warned Chinese nationals in Japan to remain vigilant against potential natural disasters, further fueling anxiety among travelers.The Chinese government’s warning was reportedly prompted by a series of recent seismic events and increased volcanic activity around Japan’s coastline. The South China Morning Post reported that the advisory urged residents and tourists to “take extra precautions against natural disasters,” a statement that many interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment of the growing fears surrounding Tatsuki’s prediction.Japanese authorities, however, have been more reserved in their response, focusing on reassuring the public about the country’s extensive disaster preparedness infrastructure. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has not issued any specific alerts related to the July 2025 timeframe, emphasizing that its seismic monitoring systems remain among the most advanced in the world.Social media platforms have become hotbeds of speculation and debate, with the hashtag #July2025Prediction trending across multiple countries. Some users have expressed deep concern, while others have dismissed the claims as mere coincidence or sensationalism. Online forums dedicated to earthquake preparedness have also seen a surge in activity, with members sharing safety tips and evacuation plans in case of a worst-case scenario.","Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga.

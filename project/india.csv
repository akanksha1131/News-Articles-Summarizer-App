NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday criticised Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis ’ visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, calling it a “picnic” and questioning the relevance of the conference.“Chief ministers from various states in India are having a picnic in Davos,” Raut said. “The Davos conference is ridiculous from an Indian perspective.”Raut also raised questions over the chief minister signing agreements with Indian companies during the visit, stating that such deals could have been finalised in Mumbai.Raut told reporters, “The chief ministers from across the country are having a picnic in Davos. He (CM Fadnavis) will pay attention to the mayoral elections after that is over. The Davos conference is ridiculous from an Indian perspective. Chief ministers from many states meet there, they talk to each other, and Indian industries go to Davos and sign agreements, on taxpayers' money.”“They go to Davos every year. They should tell the nation and their states how much is spent on their travel. This could have happened sitting in Mumbai.If the figures (of the investment and job creation) being given are true, then I welcome them,” he added.Devendra Fadnavis is currently in Davos to attend the WEF annual meeting.Responding to Raut’s remarks, CM’S wife Amruta Fadnavis dismissed the criticism as baseless. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event in Mumbai, she said, “I can never understand his (Raut’s) language. But I will only say this much that someone who goes for a picnic does not hold conferences and meetings daily from 6 am to 11 pm to bring investment to India and Maharashtra, and boost employment.”“So I feel that this statement of his, like all his other statements, is baseless,” she said.Amruta also underlined the importance of the Davos summit, saying it is an international platform where representatives from across the world meet to discuss their countries and explore business opportunities. “Going there, I believe, is the duty of the head of every state in India,” she added.Devendra Fadnavis has been credited with the BJP -led Mahayuti alliance’s performance in the recent municipal corporation elections. The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the 227-member Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, winning 89 seats.",Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut criticised Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.

Monks and nuns may have renounced all trappings of worldly life — and many of them do not vote — but they, too, are being called for SIR (Special Intensive Revision) hearings, mainly for listing their spiritual gurus’ names under the ‘name of parent’ column in the electoral records.Taking cognisance of the inconvenience faced by monastic orders, the Election Commission (EC) has directed district election officers (DEOs) to conduct hearings at ashrams and religious institutions, instead of asking monks to travel to designated centres. In cases where supporting documents are unavailable, the DEO — who is the district magistrate — has been authorised to act as a quasi-judicial authority and clear voter applications.The issue surfaced after several monks received hearing notices due to address and identity mismatch, caused by years of transfers between ashrams. Eighty-two-year-old Swami Muktikamananda, adhyaksha of the century-old Gadadhar Ashram (Ramakrishna Math) in Bhowanipur, south Kolkata, said his voter ID card and Aadhaar were linked to a Ramakrishna Math in Bankura (more than 200km from Kolkata), where he had stayed for an extended period.“I was initially asked to attend a hearing in Bankura, but after intervention by electoral officials, I submitted my enumeration form in Bhowanipur itself,” he said.Last Wednesday, around 90 monks attended a special SIR camp organised at Belur Math, with hearings held at the Abhedananda Convention Centre. Participants included residents of the Belur headquarters as well as monks from centres such as the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama in Narendrapur. While monks of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission do not vote, they seek inclusion in electoral rolls to avoid complications in visa applications and administrative work.Monks from Bharat Sevashram Sangha (BSS) and Iskcon, many of whom do vote, have also received SIR notices. Swami Mahadevananda of BSS said several monks had listed founder Acharya Swami Pranavananda’s name as their parent, triggering document mismatches. General secretary Dilip Maharaj said monks without passports attended a special hearing on Jan 20 at the Ballygunge headquarters.Iskcon spokesperson Radharamn Das said monks who had earlier voted in Kolkata had been asked to submit fresh documents from their native places across India and abroad.Voters in Jhargram and West Midnapore — in Bengal’s Jangalmahal, about 150km from Kolkata — have, over the years, learnt how to coexist with elephants. It’s a sort of mutual respect, born out of a certain wariness — and a tacit understanding: “Stay out of my hair, and I’ll stay out of yours.”During the SIR, regular elephant movement has coincided with a sudden rise in human movement — residents with voter detail anomalies are having to travel far and wide to arrive at hearing centres, a highly unsafe exercise. And, so, the poll body said yes when the two district administrations wanted to set up multiple hearing centres, located near human settlements, across six assembly constituencies.Similar arrangements are also being planned in elephant-heavy pockets of North Bengal.In West Midnapore, voters from select Jangalmahal villages will attend hearings at the Pirakata Community Hall, under the jurisdiction of Salboni police station. Salboni BDO Ruman Mondal said residents of villages such as Kalsibhanga, Satpati, Kalaimuri, Garmal, Lalgaria and Bhimpur were directed to appear at the new centre from Jan 15.Medinipur Sadar subdivisional officer Madhumita Mukherjee said it was a deliberate decision to choose the additional centres based on how close they were to villages, so that hearings could be conducted based on real-time elephant movement.“Ten additional centres have been set up in the district, including a consolidated venue catering to villages from two assembly constituencies in elephant corridors,” said Bijin Krishna, the DM of West Midnapore. In Jhargram, special hearing centres have been established at 10 high schools across the Nayagram, Gopiballavpur, Jhargram and Binpur constituencies. The DM, Akanksha Bhaskar, said the measures were taken in the interest of public safety.In the North Bengal districts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur, employment records issued by tea gardens and cinchona plantations are valid proofs of identity and residence for workers and their families.Labourers in tea and cinchona estates — many of whom have lived in makeshift quarters for generations — have struggled to produce conventional documents, such as land records or formal proof of address.As a result, during SIR hearings, they have been unable to come up with those documents, leading to fears of disenfranchisement. Plantation employment records are routinely maintained by garden authorities, and now that they have been recognised by the commission as a bona fide voter eligibility document, it’s come as immense relief for workers.Netas across the political spectrum welcomed the move, but while BJP MP Jayanta Roy called it an “excellent step”, TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP, Prakash Chik Baraik, said the move ought to have been taken long ago, and that the delay had caused unnecessary panic.Members of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) have welcomed EC’s decision to conduct doorstep verification, amid concerns over document availability and identity mismatch.In Totopara, home to the Toto community (the state’s smallest PVTG) in North Bengal’s Alipurduar, residents said the move has eased anxieties over land and identity records. “Many families do not have land khatiyans, while migrant workers lack links to ancestral property. We were worried, but the EC has taken extra care,” said Bakul Toto, secretary of the Toto Kalyan Samiti.Similar issues have surfaced among the Birhor and Lodha Shabar communities. Around 300 Birhors live in south Bengal’s Purulia district — across Balarampur, Baghmundi and Jhalda-I blocks, with 181 adults listed in the 2024 Lok Sabha electoral rolls. In forest-dependent areas, many Birhor families now reside in permanent houses provided by the state, but discrepancies in records have triggered SIR hearings.Lodha Shabar members — spread across West Midnapore and Jhargram — are also receiving notices. The community comprises over 1 lakh people across nearly 17,000 families. District administrations had flagged concerns over whether members possessed sufficient documentation, following which the EC, on Dec 31 last year, instructed DEOs to conduct physical verification.In West Midnapore, Lodha Shabar residents have been attending hearings at block development offices. In the Keshiary block, multiple villagers were summoned despite having submitted details during the enumeration. “We produced voter ID, Aadhaar and family details at the hearing,” said Basanti Dandapat of Lengamara village.West Bengal Lodha Shabar Development Board chairman Balai Naik said teams were visiting villages to reassure residents. “There is no need to panic. In cases of spelling errors or linkage issues, officials will verify details on the ground,” he said.Similar “special public hearings” have been ordered for sex workers as well, as many of them lack identity proof.Officials said district election officers have been instructed to hear such cases separately and adopt a facilitative approach, recognising that many sex workers have been disconnected from their families for decades or do not know their parents’ names.For 55-year-old Baby Khatun, who has lived in Sonagachi, Kolkata’s largest red light district, since she arrived there at the age of 10, the hearing notice triggered panic. “I only remember that my family lived in Kidderpore. I don’t know my parents’ names,” she said. With no immediate relatives, she listed her landlord as her guardian.“How can I produce a family tree? I don’t even know their names. I’m afraid my name will be deleted,” she said.Rekha Das, another sex worker, has a voter and Aadhaar cards but faced difficulty enrolling her son, a first-time voter, because the form requires the name of a blood relative from the mother’s side. “I have documents, but no family records,” she said.EC officials said the concerns were genuine and assured no eligible voter would be struck off the rolls solely for lack of documents, stressing that SIR was aimed at inclusion, not exclusion.","Monks and nuns are being called for SIR (Special Intensive Revision) hearings.

NEW DELHI: Rani Kapur, the mother of the late industrialist Sunjay Kapur, approached the Delhi high court Wednesday seeking cancellation of the Rani Kapur Family Trust, which holds a stake in the automotive component manufacturer Sona Comstar.Her plea alleges the trust was established and operated without her knowledge or informed consent, effectively excluding her from beneficial ownership of assets that belonged to her. The suit says the events in question took place at a time when she was medically unwell after suffering a stroke and was dependent on her son to handle her personal and financial matters.According to Rani Kapur, her late son was either manipulated into taking part in the alleged arrangement or allowed himself to be used as a channel for carrying it out. She claims that, based on the assurances given to her, she believed her estate was secure, even as transactions were allegedly executed that later deprived her of ownership rights. The suit alleges she was asked to sign several documents without being informed about their contents or legal implications, and on some occasions was made to sign blank papers.

NEW DELHI: Taking exception to Bengal govt’s decision to unilaterally exonerate Baruipur Purba assembly constituency assistant electoral registration officer (AERO) Tathagata Mondal and impose only a minor penalty against Moyna AC AERO Sudipta Das — despite clear instructions by Election Commission (dated 05.08.2025) to suspend and initiate disciplinary proceedings against them — EC Wednesday asked the state chief secretary to get the competent authority to submit to the commission a written explanation for the “procedural lapse”.The explanation — sought by 5pm on Jan 24 — must detail the circumstances that led to non-compliance with the commission’s instructions, which had mandated that disciplinary authorities shall consult EC before closing or finalising any matter arising out of disciplinary proceedings initiated on the poll panel’s recommendation.“Since the disciplinary proceedings have been finalised without adherence to the prescribed procedure and without mandatory consultation with the Commission, the Commission does not accept such finalisation of disciplinary action. Accordingly, the same shall be treated as procedurally irregular and non est in the eyes of the Commission, warranting reconsideration,” EC said in the letter sent to the state chief secretary.As part of the explanation sought by EC, the competent authority has been asked to furnish the complete disciplinary case records, including the articles of charge, written statements of defence, inquiry reports, findings of the inquiry authority, orders of the disciplinary authority, file notings and all other relevant records forming the basis of the disciplinary action taken in respect of four officials, namely Tathagata Mondal, Debottam Dutta Choudhury, Biplab Sarkar and Sudipta Das.The commission had directed the state govt to suspend and initiate suitable disciplinary proceedings against the EROs/AEROs concerned and lodge FIRs against the erring officials, including the contractual data entry operator, under Section 32 of the RP Act, 1950, read with the relevant provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and Information Technology Act, 2000.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and Sensex, closed lower on Wednesday as investors booked profits amid weak global cues and cautious sentiment ahead of key macro triggers. The Nifty50 slipped 75 points, or 0.30 per cent, to close at 25,157.50, while the 30-share BSE Sensex declined 270.84 points, or 0.33 per cent, to settle at 81,909.63.Heavy selling in select banking, financial and auto stocks dragged the benchmark indices lower on Wednesday, even as gains in a handful of index heavyweights capped sharper losses.Among the Sensex pack, ICICI Bank, Trent, Bharat Electronics, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Larsen & Toubro, State Bank of India and Maruti emerged as the top laggards.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Poll Should the ICC consider changing the tournament venue for Bangladesh matches? Definitely, due to security concerns. No, they should stick to the original plan.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), on Tuesday, has formally written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) expressing its support for Bangladesh’s refusal to play matches in India at the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup. The development comes a day before the ICC Board is set to meet on Wednesday to take a final call on Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament.According to an ESPNcricinfo report, the PCB’s communication to the ICC also copied members of the ICC Board, underlining Pakistan’s alignment with the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) stance amid what it termed political and security concerns in the region. Bangladesh, backed by its government, has asked for its group-stage matches to be shifted to Sri Lanka, co-hosts of the tournament.The report further indicated that the governing body has so far remained firm on its position. The ICC has repeatedly conveyed to the BCB that the tournament schedule will not be altered and that Bangladesh are expected to play their matches in India as originally planned.Despite multiple rounds of discussions between the ICC and BCB, neither side has softened its stance.While the ICC has insisted that logistical and security assessments do not warrant a venue change, the BCB has maintained that it cannot send the team to India under the current circumstances. January 21 had been set as the deadline for a final decision, with the tournament scheduled to start on February 7.The PCB’s late intervention follows days of speculation about its role in resolving the impasse. Unverified reports suggested that Pakistan had offered to host Bangladesh’s matches, while others claimed the PCB was even reassessing Pakistan’s own participation depending on how the situation unfolded.The standoff traces back to the BCCI’s decision to ask IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to remove Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad — a move that was never fully explained but widely linked to deteriorating political ties. That episode prompted the Bangladesh government to formally state that the national team would not travel to India for the World Cup.The fallout has since escalated, triggering unrest within Bangladesh cricket, including a brief player boycott during the BPL after controversial remarks by a senior BCB official.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has formally written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) expressing its support for Bangladesh’s refusal to play matches in India at the 2026 T20 World Cup.

IIT Kanpur

campus saw 30% of suicides over 2 yrs, fix accountability at top level: Alumnus

MUMBAI: The death of a student by suicide at IIT-Kanpur on Tuesday again swivelled the spotlight on a mental health crisis on the campuses of India's premier technical institutions: over a dozen young lives lost every year on average over the past five years.At least 65 students have taken their own lives across the Indian Institutes of Technology between Jan 2021 and Dec 2025, show figures kept by the Global IIT Alumni Support Group. As many as 30 suicides were recorded in the past two years (see box), raising concerns about institutional responsibility, and accountability. The deaths have occurred across undergraduate, PG and doctoral programmes, often followed by official statements attributing them to ""personal"" or ""academic"" stress.Student bodies and alumni said such explanations flatten a more complex reality: one shaped by 'relentless evaluation', competitiveness, isolation and, in some cases, caste or language-based exclusion. Faculty members privately admit that warning signs are often missed, and interventions tend to arrive when distress has already reached a critical stage.The numbers at IITs sit within a far larger national tragedy.India recorded more than 13,000 student suicides in 2023, according to NCRB data, which translates into roughly 36 incidents every day.Supreme Court has formed a task force to address mental health concerns and prevent student suicides. Dheeraj Singh, an IIT Kanpur alumnus (2004 batch) and founder of the Global IIT Alumni Support Group, called for direct accountability at the highest level. “The hon’ble Supreme Court has reaffirmed that mental health is an integral part of the Right to Life under Article 21,” he said.“Further, in the Saha vs State of Andhra Pradesh case, the court has ordered that student mental health be treated as a constitutional and institutional responsibility,” Singh added.Singh wants accountability and hopes it will drive a change in mindset towards mental health.“Given that this is the ninth suicide death on IIT Kanpur campus (in 2 years), education ministry is urged to hold the director accountable for the serious state of mental health and consider bringing in a new head to improve the situation,” Singh said.The IIT Kanpur alumnus argued that figures show 30% of the suicide deaths over the last two years have been at IIT Kanpur, which is the highest toll in any of the 23 IITs in the country. IIT Kharagpur was a close second, recording seven suicides during this period.IIT Bombay, Singh pointed out, had only one suicide during this period though it has a higher number of students enrolled than Kanpur.","At least 65 students have taken their own lives across the Indian Institutes of Technology between Jan 2021 and Dec 2025.

5 traffic offences in a year could bar you from driving,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-traffic-offences-in-a-year-could-bar-you-from-driving/articleshow/127055072.cms,"Traffic offences will not be carried over beyond one year

NEW DELHI: Five or more traffic offences in a year and you could be barred from driving for 3 months. This provision - disqualification or revocation of driving licence (DL) - has been added by the road transport ministry through a fresh amendment to the Motor Vehicles Rules to rein in habitual errant drivers, reports .The licensing authority - RTO or district transport office - has the power to decide on suspension of DL. The rules also state that licensing authority must give the licence holder an opportunity of being heard. The notification published Wednesday said the condition of five or more offences in a year for disqualification of DL commences from Jan 1.The new notification said that ""no offence or contravention recorded in any previous one-year period shall be taken into account for determining offences or contravention in any subsequent one-year period"".Till now, there were 24 provisions in the rules that could trigger the licencing authority concerned to initiate disqualification of DL. These included theft of vehicle, assault on passenger(s), abduction of passenger(s), driving beyond permitted speed limit, overloading and abandoning vehicle in a public space.These provisions have been made considering that these ""constitute nuisance or danger to public"".Now, going by the new provision of five or more traffic offences, such as not wearing helmet, seat belt and jumping red signal, can result in suspension of DLs.The new provision drew mixed reaction from experts in road traffic laws.Former Delhi deputy transport commissioner Anil Chhikara said that while disqualification after five offences is a step in the right direction, but ""the conflict is that people driving dangerously are not caught by traffic police"". He added that in absence of a standard operating procedure (SOP), traffic offences recorded using CCTV cameras are often challenged in courts.Rohit Baluja, who teaches police, transport and judicial officers on laws related to motor vehicles, termed the amendment ""draconian and conceptually flawed"".The ministry's notification also specified the procedures for issuing, managing and paying traffic challans, or fines. It said that any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorised by state govt will issue a challan and there can be auto-generation of e-challans. The violator can pay the challan or contest it within 45 days.

The wishlist: What comes next for India?

“Ecstatic! Hell yeah, I’ve been waiting for this all my life.” Linkin Park fan Joel’s words almost encapsulate the emotions of all the Indian millennials and Gen Zs who have been waiting to see the iconic rock band live.“They've been with me from my tiny MP3 player to my current smartphone,” he adds.“They have ruled all my yearly music wraps. Seeing them perform live is a dream come true for all nu metal fans,” says Saurav Kumar, who has been a fan since 2007.The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. The rock septet is also set to perform at Lollapalooza 2026, which is also supercharged with other headliners like Playboi Carti, Fuji Kaze, and many more artists on the lineup.Legendary performers like The Lumineers and John Mayer will be setting their solo stages for the Indian fans this year too.What’s exciting is that these events talk about the musical schedule for just two months into the year.Keeping 2025 in hindsight, the year that set the stage for global superstars like Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil, it is only left to our imagination what the rest of 2026 holds.This only goes to show that India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues, but a very significant stop.Or as Naman Pugalia, the chief business officer for live events at BookMyShow, puts it, “India is no longer a wildcard on the touring circuit but a permanent hotspot.”India has rapidly moved to become a primary market for major international music artists when weighing their tour route. In 2017, when Justin Bieber announced India as his stop, the Beliebers had a meltdown.Hosting international stars has not been a new thing for India.In 1996, the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, performed in Mumbai. However, the event was very much driven by novelty or an elite audience. But the landscape is shifting swiftly, and the change is driven by both the global promoters and a homegrown audience ready to show up for the live experience in sizable numbers.Naman Pugalia says, “India has become one of the fastest-growing live entertainment markets globally, with a population of 1.4 billion and a rapidly expanding base of global music fans.”And the excitement is palpable, putting in perspective the enthusiasm and active participation of the audience who are ready to cross borders, quite literally, just to see their favourite artists live.Swadha Shankar, who travelled all the way to Ahmedabad from Delhi, shares, “Watching the artists, who filled the silence of your early life with ambition and music that shaped your personality, keeps the flame of passion burning within you.”“Concerts offer collective energy. Music creates a shared experience beyond cities and cultures,” says Gursshheen Gahllen, who most recently attended the Akon concert in Delhi.However, it is not only passion driving the genre, but India has also rapidly developed its infrastructure and management capabilities, which have strengthened the logistical backbone of these live experiences promised to the crowd and have gained more credibility in the eyes of international headliners.Pugalia shares the importance of ever-evolving production standards, which ultimately shape the entertainment ecosystem for these events.“As a rapidly growing economy, India has been a prime hotspot for international artists to connect with an abundantly populous fan community. With the ever-evolving infrastructure for concerts, festivals and live entertainment shows in the country, artists are now joining the bandwagon to woo passionate Indian fans.”India stood the test of quality in front of major touring acts.Coldplay, during their India stop in 2025, added more dates to accommodate the high demand, with each show being a sell-out. Ed Sheeran’s revisit to India also reaffirmed the stance that India can move tickets at global scale.The buzz in India today is unignorable — and it’s not just audiences feeling it. It’s drawing artists to embrace their roots.Tyla’s Mumbai show was a case in point. With Indian lineage in her family, she stepped out not only as a global artist but as someone reclaiming a piece of heritage. She wore a bindi, spoke to the crowd, and the arena erupted.It is not only the passion that is driving the young crowd to these musical gatherings. Logistically, accessibility and awareness have shaped the fulfilment of their interests on a great scale.Affluent millennials, typically aged between 25 and 40 with rising disposable incomes, form the core audience for these concerts. They are willing to stay updated, buy tickets and get onboard with the firsthand experience of witnessing it all live.“When my friends first asked me to join them for a concert in 2022, I got very curious. ‘What could be the difference between streaming on a phone and seeing them live?’” says Mohammad Sarim, “And since then, I have attended more than 15 concerts by different artists.”Music fans are no longer passive consumers through online platforms; they are very inclined to follow artist journeys and travel to cities for shows. This contributes significantly towards boosting an economy that can cater to the quality demands of hosting these global stars.“35% of Coldplay’s audience in Ahmedabad came from non-metro cities, underlining the fact that demand extends far beyond traditional urban hubs,” said Naman Pugalia when asked about the shift in Indian audience towards the live experience.This is not only driving ticket sales, but the travel pattern is shaping a new “concert tourism” market.“We travelled in a luxury sleeper bus from Delhi to Ahmedabad. A friend joining from Mumbai through his connections was able to arrange lavish rooms when Ahmedabad was out of rooms,” Swadha shares about her travel and accommodation.This movement of fans across states has turned concerts into economic events that extend beyond ticket sales, benefiting airlines, hotels, transport services, food outlets and local vendors.According to the EY–Parthenon and BookMyShow report, India’s Rising Concert Economy, India’s organised live events segment crossed Rs 12,000 crore in 2024 and is projected to grow at around 18–19% annually over the next few years.The broader media and entertainment sector crossed Rs 2.5 trillion in 2024, with live events among its fastest-growing segments, according to the FICCI–EY Media & Entertainment Report.Ticketing data also shows Tier-II cities now contribute close to 35–38% of demand, reflecting a sharp expansion beyond metros.For global artists, India’s scale compensates for relatively lower ticket pricing. Volume over price has become the Indian formula, making the market commercially viable while culturally powerful.While international stars have been creating a frenzy, the Indian superstars are not falling behind. 2025 not only saw a big gathering for the foreign names, but the household names also sent waves of wonder during their Indian and international stages.Diljit Dosanjh’s high-voltage “Dil-Luminati” tour powered through North America, Europe, and the Middle East, with sell-out arena dates across cities such as Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles, London, and Dubai.AR Rahman continued to draw packed houses with his “Harmony of Hearts” shows across India and major overseas markets, including the US, Canada, the UK, and the Gulf. Sunidhi Chauhan’s “I Am Home” tour kept venues buzzing from Mumbai to Melbourne.Arijit Singh sold out arena nights in Dubai, London, Birmingham, Sydney, and Toronto, underlining his unmatched global pull. And the world took notes. His international footprint most recently showed up with his Ed Sheeran collaboration on the superhit “Sapphire.”And this is only part of the story: Shreya Ghoshal, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, and several others continue to command international stages with ease.Historically, India was not a default stop on world tours.While Indian fans resonated deeply with global music, logistical challenges, visa delays, security concerns and weak event management often deterred artists.Metallica’s cancelled 2011 India show remains a cautionary tale. The event was postponed and later called off entirely, triggering riots and arrests, and damaging India’s reputation among global promoters.But stakeholders have gradually worked to flip that script.“We’ve spent years working closely with global promoters, agents and artist teams, ensuring India is not just a stop but a destination that matches global benchmarks,” Pugalia says.Audience management has also improved.“There were clear signboards, route guides and transport information shared with tickets,” Gursshheen notes. “There was a large team managing queues and seating.”Yet challenges remain.“Parking, public washrooms and security are still issues,” Sarim says. “I’ve lost two phones at concerts.”Recent incidents, including physical altercations at concerts like Karan Aujla’s Gurgaon show, highlight the need for better civic sense and crowd discipline.As demand continues to outpace infrastructure, experts stress that long-term success will depend not just on fan passion, but on governance, public conduct and sustained investment in large-capacity venues.For many touring artists, India has evolved from a novelty stop to a meaningful fan engagement market. Several trends illustrate this shift. From global streams to live public reception clearl reflect the massive shift in people’s reception.Brands and sponsors are also walking the extra mile to elevate the experience by extending the space to a shared experience with merchandise, interactive spaces, photobooths and other amenities designed for the fans to not just attend the shows but an extension of it.Among all this, for an economy like India, affordability plays a huge role. However, population scale compensates for that gap, placing India in a competitive space.Dua Lipa's Mumbai concert in November 2024 drew 35,000 fans, generating crores despite the discounted tiers. Enrique Iglesias' Oct 2025 MMRDA show was also sold out in hours to lakhs of millennials, turning volume into viable economics where Western acts once saw losses.“With the introduction of the variable pricing model, we have been able to drive a shift in the ‘late-buying’ pattern, where customers have begun making the most of early bird offers or introductory prices,” said Pugalia.This positions India as a market with both cultural influence and commercial viability.India is transitioning from a wildcard destination to a stable touring market.Fans of artists like BTS and Khalid have been waiting to find India on their tour lists. While BTS shared Mumbai being one of the venues for their cancelled Map of the Soul ON:E concert due to the pandemic, their 2026 tour calendar still does not list India as one of their stops.The wishlist for the Indian fans, however, is long.“Charlie Puth!” Sarim speaks up in a heartbeat when asked about who he wishes to see live in India. “Artists like Taylor Swift , Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, and Shakira would find an audience here that is ready and enthusiastic,” Gursshheen shares her list of favourites she awaits.When asked about what drives the artist's plan and how the pitch is prepared, Naman Pugalia shares a meticulous list: “The curation of an artist roster has numerous moving parts and is a fruit of long months of labour. Global touring routes of artists, discovery of new sounds and performers for a landscape, research and matching of potential artist names with the Indian consumer palate and appetite, streaming popularity in a market and deducing from it as also significant diversity across the roster are key factors of consideration. ”Development and repurposing of venues are consistently underway. The touring frequency for concerts in India is seeing a new rise. The long-term seems promising to witness India positioned as a permanent stop on the world touring maps of major artists.Venues are being upgraded, touring frequency is rising, and the momentum is undeniable.But the journey is far from complete. Infrastructure gaps, crowd management challenges and civic behaviour remain critical hurdles. India’s rise as a global concert hotspot will ultimately depend on whether scale is matched with responsibility.","The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil. India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126819023,imgsize-1156523,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Donald Trump Cites India Pakistan Ceasefire While Defending Nobel Gesture But Facts Raise Questions

Also read |

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday stepped up its attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump once again claimed that he was responsible for ending the India-Pakistan conflict last year. The opposition party said the count of such assertions has now risen to 70.The swipe came after Trump highlighted ending the India-Pakistan conflict as one of the major accomplishments of the first year of his second term in the White House. He claimed the two countries “were going to go nuclear” and said millions of lives were saved because of his intervention. The US president said he ended “eight unendable wars in 10 months”.Reacting to Trump’s remarks, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X, “Before yesterday the count stood at 68. Yesterday itself the count shot up not to 69 but to 70 - once in the opening statement of his White House Press Conference and later in the Q&A.”“That is the number of times the PM's ‘good friend’ and the recipient of his many forced hugs has declared that he was responsible for the sudden and unexpected halt of Operation Sindoor on May 10, 2025,” Ramesh said.At a press conference in Washington, Trump said, “These were unendable wars - Cambodia and Thailand fighting for years, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda. Pakistan and India, they were really going at it. Eight planes shot down. They were going to go nuclear in my opinion.”Addressing a packed White House press briefing room, Trump said “the prime minister of Pakistan, who visited him in Washington last year, said that ‘President Trump saved 10 million people, and maybe much more than that’. They’re both nuclear countries.”Later in the 105-minute press conference, Trump again claimed credit for ending the war between India and Pakistan.Responding to a question on how winning the Nobel Peace Prize would have improved the lives of everyday Americans, Trump said he had saved probably tens of millions of lives by ending eight wars across the world.“If you add up the numbers, just if you look at any one of those wars, you're talking about millions of people. You multiply it eight times. But when you look at India and Pakistan, that could have been 10,15,20 million people. It could have been more than that. So I saved millions of people. So that to me is the big thing,” Trump said.Trump has repeatedly claimed that he stopped the conflict between India and Pakistan, making the assertion on various platforms in the US and around the world since May 10 last year, when he announced on social media that the two countries had agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire after talks mediated by Washington.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Trump also said that he should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for ending wars, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.",The Congress stepped up its attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The opposition party said the count of such assertions has now risen to 70. The swipe came after Trump highlighted ending the India-Pakistan conflict as one of the major accomplishments of the first year of his second term in the White House.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126937845,imgsize-780221,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-69.jpg"

Omar invokes Jinnah’s two-nation theory to taunt calls for separate Jammu state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-invokes-jinnahs-two-nation-theory-to-taunt-calls-for-separate-jammu-state/articleshow/127038477.cms,"SRINAGAR: Breaking his silence on demands for separation of Jammu and Kashmir, chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday accused BJP MLAs of echoing Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory.“Why are BJP legislators demanding a separate Jammu state? They do not have the interests of the people of Jammu in mind,” Omar said while addressing National Conference workers in Jammu.The CM mounted a sharp attack on leader of opposition Sunil Sharma, accusing him of pursuing his personal ambition to become chief minister. “…For that, he is using some people in Jammu and a few yes-men in Kashmir. They are promoting Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together,” Omar said, adding: “Be straightforward. Why don’t you say ‘separate Hindu Jammu’?”Taking further potshots at the BJP leader, he said Sharma’s demand would limit him to being the CM of “two-and-half districts”, suggesting that the Muslim majority areas of Jammu — the Pir Panjal region comprising Rajouri and Poonch districts, and the Chenab Valley comprising Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts — would not support Jammu’s separation from Kashmir. “If you want to divide Jammu and Kashmir on the basis of religion, you will end up being chief minister of Kanak Mandi and Raghunath Bazaar,” Omar taunted, referring to two markets in Jammu city.He also targeted Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP, calling it an “old ally” of BJP. “They have now started talking about separate divisions for Rajouri-Poonch and the Chenab Valley. But remember, as long as the National Conference’s flag is flying in J&K, this conspiracy will not succeed,” the CM said.Mehbooba had on Monday demanded carving out separate divisions from Jammu to make governance accessible in hilly regions.Reacting to Omar’s jibes, Sharma said neither he nor BJP had made any official statement on further bifurcation of J&K. He also rejected claims that he desired to become CM, saying he came from a poor family and his only aim was to work for humanity and the nation. “In contrast, it is people in the Abdullah family who desire to be chief minister as they want to have protocol in place even when skiing, so that no one else should be around when he plays,” he retorted.A debate over the issue started earlier this month after BJP legislator Sham Lal Sharma pitched for a separate Jammu state, alleging discrimination against the region by “Kashmir-based rulers”. Several BJP legislators, including Vikram Randhawa, have since accused the CM of imposing “Kashmiri sentiment” on Jammu. Randhawa said Ladakhis sought separate UT because of Kashmiri dominance, and the same reason had spurred the calls for a separate Jammu state.","Omar Abdullah accuses BJP MLAs of echoing Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory. “Why are BJP legislators demanding a separate Jammu state?

Are those from Delhi or Gujarat not our brothers? Thousands come here, and they are welcome. In the same spirit, the people of Jammu will remain our brothers tomorrow as well. God willing, even after separation, brotherhood will remain,” he said.On Farooq’s statement that a division would be against secular ethos, Lone said: “India has a population of 1.5 billion. We are barely six or seven million. Aren’t we speaking far beyond our weight? Did we ever sign a contract to safeguard secularism?” Kashmiri leaders routinely claimed the moral high ground of secularism, while students from the Valley continued to be beaten, humiliated and targeted across the country, he alleged.Kashmiris had never consented to bear this disproportionate burden of unity, he asserted. Lone said while Kashmiri Muslims remained on the frontline in the fight against terrorism, with nearly 90% of police martyrs being from the community, a “relentless campaign of hatred”, he alleged, was emanating from Jammu.As a debate rages on over the issue, with Jammu repeatedly alleging discrimination by Kashmir-centric govt, the People’s Conference chief had recently reacted strongly after BJP and a section of the high court bar association raised a demand that the National Law University proposed in Budgam be shifted to Jammu. “Maybe, the time has come for an amicable divorce.

Illicit mining has to be stopped at all costs,"" said a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi.On Dec 29, the bench took suo motu cognisance of environmentalists' concerns over its Nov 20 order accepting the 100-metre-elevation definition of Aravali hills and ranges, and stopped all mining, including renewal and grant of new leases, across the Aravalis in four states. It also put on hold its earlier order allowing preparation of a management plan for sustainable mining.The SC will also constitute an expert body for Aravalis, which will function under the apex court.The bench asked amicus curiae K Parameshwar, additional solicitors general Aishwarya Bhati and K M Nataraj, and senior advocates, including Kapil Sibal, to suggest names of experts — environmentalists, geologists, naturalists and forest experts – within four weeks.These names will help the court form an expert body to carry out an “exhaustive, holistic and scientific” examination of the Aravali Hills and Ranges for a comprehensive definition to protect its “structural and ecological” integrity. “The expert body will work under the direct supervision and control of the Supreme Court,” the CJI-led bench said in its order.Till the expert body is formed, a comprehensive study is conducted and recommendations submitted to the court, the states shall “take all possible steps to stop illegal mining activities and prosecute the offenders,” the court said. Refusing to entertain multiple intervention applications, the bench said it would not allow certain vested interests to derail the attempts to preserve and protect Aravali ranges, which is the last defence against Thar desert extending its debilitating influence on the fertile Gangetic plain. Issues that had pricked the court’s mind and led to reopening of the issue are – whether the 500-metre separation between two Aravali Hills created a structural paradox for the Range; whether it broadened the non-Aravali areas within the Range to allow unregulated mining activities; and, the sanctity of the 100-metre-elevation definition. Another issue flagged by court was: “Whether the widely publicised criticism asserting only 1,048 hills out of 12,081 in Rajasthan meet the 100-metre-elevation threshold, thereby stripping the remaining lower ranges of environmental protection, is factually and scientifically accurate?”","The Supreme Court on Wednesday said illegal mining continues in the Aravali hills and ranges despite its ban.

Power ministry's draft policy moots automatic revisions of tariff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-ministrys-draft-policy-moots-automatic-revisions-of-tariff/articleshow/127055685.cms,"Draft power policy proposes end to distribution monopoly

NEW DELHI: The power ministry's draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2026, released Wednesday, has proposed an annual reset of tariffs, including an index-linked automatic revision in case the regulator fails to act to ensure sound financial health of power utilities, while seeking to limit cross-subsidies for manufacturing units and railways, in an attempt to make tariffs reasonable.While underlining that coal-based generation will remain critical, it has backed nuclear capacity addition with the involvement of the private sector and suggested that atomic energy could emerge as a source for captive plants, replacing thermal.The draft has retained focus on renewable energy capacity addition and also laid emphasis on storage, apart from drawing up a robust cybersecurity blueprint to guard critical infrastructure from rising threats, especially from overseas actors.The overall focus of the draft National Electricity Policy 2026, is on enhanced power availability, with annual per capita consumption projected at 2,000 kWh by 2030 and at over 4,000 kWh by 2047, compared with the current 1,460 kWh.It also aligns with India’s climate commitments, including reducing emissions intensity by 45% from 2005 levels over the next five years and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, which will require a shift to low-carbon energy.Although the 40-page draft has performed lip service to “consumer-centricity”, it has underlined the need to provide competition in distribution areas. “In line with the intent of the (Electricity) Act, monopoly in distribution will be phased out by allowing multiple players. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and the listing of utilities shall be promoted. The central govt shall extend necessary support to facilitate the implementation,” the power ministry said, while recognising its limitations and urging state electricity commissions to act.There is significant emphasis on ensuring timely tariff orders by regulatory bodies, cost recovery and reduction in losses. “From FY2026-27, state commissions must ensure that tariffs fully reflect costs without creating regulatory assets. Tariffs must be linked to a suitable index for automatic annual revision which operates if no tariff order is passed by the state commission… Free power supply should be avoided and subsidies should be paid in advance,” it said.According to the ministry, the first NEP, issued in Feb 2005, had addressed core challenges such as demand-supply gaps, limited electricity access and inadequate infrastructure. Since then, the sector has seen transformational change, with installed generation capacity rising four-fold alongside significant private sector participation, while per capita electricity consumption reached 1,460 units in 2024–25. Officials said that despite these achievements, the power sector continues to face challenges, with distribution companies accumulating losses of nearly Rs 6.9 lakh crore and outstanding debt nearing Rs 7.2 lakh crore. They added that cross-subsidisation has resulted in high industrial tariffs.The policy further focuses on cybersecurity, technology adoption and skill development, and proposes the introduction of a distribution system operator to facilitate network sharing and the integration of distributed renewables, storage and vehicle-to-grid systems. It also suggests a utilisation-based framework for the allocation of transmission connectivity, along with appropriate regulatory mechanisms to ensure optimal use and prevent the speculative holding of connectivity. The draft adds that a strong regulatory framework must be in place to support market monitoring and surveillance and prevent collusion, gaming, or market dominance. “It provides a robust framework for industry, investors and the govt to collaborate in building a resilient, consumer-centric and globally competitive power sector,” said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner and leader, climate and energy, PwC India.","The draft has retained focus on renewable energy capacity addition and also laid emphasis on storage.

It is imperative that we continue to work with renewed vigour to strengthen Manipur’s development trajectory. I assure you of the Centre’s full and steadfast support in this endeavour.”“Since 2014, our govt has worked with the resolve of ‘Act East, Act Fast’ to empower the region, unlock opportunities for progress and fulfil the aspirations of the people,” he said.Writing to Tripura CM Manik Saha, Modi said it was an undeniable reality that the people of the Northeast, including Tripura, had for decades felt distant and isolated from national mainstream.The PM said that govt’s vision of ‘Purvodaya’ is transforming the Northeast.While Tripura once faced insurgency and unrest, the 2024 peace accord with NLFT and ATTF has ushered in a new dawn of hope, he said.The Prime Minister told Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma that development in the Northeast had stagnated before NDA govt got a historic mandate in 2014 and began working extensively to transform the region.","PM Narendra Modi wrote separate letters to heads of govt of Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya.

""Actually, clearly in the first group,"" he said, arguing that the country is simultaneously building capability across all five layers of the AI stack - applications, models, chips, infrastructure and energy.The minister said the real economic value of AI did not lie in building ever-larger models but in enterprise-level deployment. ""ROI (return on investment) doesn't come from creating a very large model; 95% of the work can happen with models which are 20 billion or 50 billion parameters,"" he said, adding that India has a bouquet of such models deployed across sectors to improve productivity and efficiency.He also questioned the assumption that ownership of large frontier models translates into geopolitical leverage. ""Does creating a large model give you geopolitical power? I don't think so,"" he said, noting that such models can be switched off and may even become financially unsustainable.""The economics of this fifth industrial revolution is going to come from ROI - deploying the lowest cost solution to get the highest possible return. ""A key constraint, he said, is access to compute. To address this, India has empanelled around 38,000 GPUs under a public-private partnership model to create a common national compute facility. The system is govt-enabled and subsidised, allowing students, researchers and startups to access compute at roughly one-third of global costs.Outlining India's broader approach, the minister said the focus is on four pillars: a shared compute facility, a free bouquet of practical AI models, large-scale skilling with a target of training 10 million people, and helping the IT services industry pivot towards AI-driven productivity.On regulation, he stressed the need for a techno-legal framework rather than laws alone. ""Detecting deep fakes with the accuracy which can be taken to a court and be properly judicially checked"" is essential, he said, adding that India is developing tools to mitigate bias and ensure proper unlearning before enterprise deployment.",IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw challenged the view that India sits in a secondary tier of AI powers.

On Oct 8 last year, SC stalled the project on a petition jointly filed by five retired Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers and NGO ‘People for Aravalis’ , who through advocate Shibani Ghosh had alleged that the project would spell doom for the already damaged crucial Aravali range.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar flagged three issues — impact of the project on water table of the area, species and afforestation, and sourcing of animals. “All these three issues raise sufficient doubt that the project should not be implemented,” he said.The bench said since no work has commenced yet on the ground, it would be ideal that the entire project and its feasibility, both from environmental and ecological aspects, is examined threadbare by the CEC and report be given to the court.“If the CEC opines that the project is ecologically and environmentally harmful, then that is the end of it,” the court said, adding that the interim stay on the project would continue till further orders.The petitioners had said, “The proposed zoo safari entails large-scale construction of permanent structures and facilities, including administrative blocks, research and laboratory centres, guest houses, staff quarters, animal enclosures, hotels, restaurants, recreational and commercial establishments, as well as extensive infrastructure facilities such as roads, electrical and communication networks, and firefighting systems. ”“Large-scale development of this scale within the Aravali region would inevitably result in severe and irreversible ecological damage to an already fragile ecosystem, which is home to rich floral and faunal diversity,” they said, and alleged that the zoo-safari project is being funded with the compensatory afforestation funds, which is impermissible.The petitioners said a project primarily aimed at revenue generation through large-scale commercial and recreational activities in this eco-sensitive region is bound to undermine the ecology and hydrology of the Aravali region.","Haryana’s senior additional advocate general Lokesh Sinhal told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that the state wanted to commence work only on 3,500 acres.

"EWS flat 'fraud': SC notices to Haryana govt, builder",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ews-flat-fraud-sc-notices-to-haryana-govt-builder/articleshow/127059598.cms,"Petitioner: Lack of due diligence by authorities caused hardships, stress

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has sought responses from Haryana govt and Mahira Buildwell (formerly Czar Buildwell) after an association of homebuyers from economically weaker sections accused the developer of an affordable housing scheme in Gurgaon, under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), of cheating them.Accusing Czar Buildwell and its successor Mahira of obtaining a licence through fraudulent means, including submission of forged bank guarantees and fabrication of signatures, the petitioner association said the builder has carried out only 5-7% of the construction work, siphoning homebuyers' funds.SC is already dealing with a large number of cases in which builders, in collusion with financial institutions and banks, have duped homebuyers by misusing the subvention scheme. It has ordered a CBI probe into these cases, leading to registration of 28 FIRs against builders.The bench led by CJI Surya Kant also sought responses from Haryana RERA, Enforcement Directorate, Axis Bank and Canara Bank. The petitioner association alleged that its members had paid a substantial amount to the developer for a standardised dwelling unit. It said, “Due to the failure of competent authorities to carry out due diligence and the lackadaisical attitude towards enforcing statutory schemes, the members/allottees had to face substantial hardships and financial and mental stress.Despite recurring and periodical collection of funds by the developer from the allottees, the developer has failed to carry out time-linked construction, as mandated in the scheme.”“Despite multiple complaints, representations, and even contempt proceedings, the respondent authorities, including the Centre, Haryana, director of town and country Planning, HARERA and banking institutions have failed to take remedial action,” it said.","Supreme Court has sought responses from Haryana govt and Mahira Buildwell.

"Activist in jail for 7 years sans trial, SC steps in to hasten proceedings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/activist-in-jail-for-7-yrs-sans-trial-sc-steps-in-to-hasten-proceedings/articleshow/127058692.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday said it would pass an order to expedite proceedings against lawyer-activist Surendra Gadling in the 2016 Surajgarh arson case after he pressed for bail on the ground that he has been in jail for seven years without trial and there is also no judge in the special court to hear the matter.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi said it will talk to the chief justice of Bombay HC for the appointment of a judge and pass an order to expedite the hearing. Senior advocate Anand Grover said the activist is in jail for seven years and proceedings in the case are not moving forward as video conferencing facility is not working and there is no judge to preside over the special court. Though he said it was a fit case for bail, the bench said it would fast-track the hearing in the special (trial) court.As the case is based on the same set of evidence that is being used in the Koregaon Bhima Elgar Parishad case, the evidence, including documentary and digital, have to be brought to the trial court in Gadchiroli from the NIA court in Mumbai. But Grover said the evidence has not been placed before the court concerned. SC said that it would pass an order for bringing the evidence and would grant one month to both the prosecution and the accused to examine the evidence and argue the case for framing of charges.The senior advocate said the liberty of his client was being violated, which is a serious matter. But SC was not inclined, and the lawyer then asked the bench to allow him to press for bail after a month.Amid inconsistent stands taken by SC on the issue of grant of bail due to delay in trial and long incarceration, the issue hangs in balance. A three-judge bench in 2021 had said in the K A Najeeb case that stringent conditions under Section 43-D(5) of the UAPA ""melt down"" as time passes and it does not oust the ability of the constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights. This ruling was followed in other cases, including in Manish Sisodia's case in which the court said long period of incarceration - running for around 17 months - and the trial even not starting, amounts to violation of right to speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution, making a fit case for bail.A division bench recently, while rejecting bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam held that delay in trial and long incarceration cannot be the sole ground to grant relief. But later, SC in another judgment held that an accused has fundamental right to speedy trial and it is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence.Gadling's bail plea is pending in SC since Oct 2023 when he filed an appeal against the Bombay HC order of denying him bail. The Surajgarh arson happened in Dec 2016 when around 39 vehicles engaged in transporting iron ore from the Surajgarh mines in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli were allegedly set on fire by Maoists. He has been booked for various offences under IPC and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).",Surendra Gadling has been in jail for seven years without trial and there is also no judge in the special court to hear the matter.

Census to count ‘near endangered’ Kashmir Markhor population to begin in Feb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-to-count-near-endangered-kashmir-markhor-population-to-begin-in-feb/articleshow/127040013.cms,"SRINAGAR: A census to count the elusive Kashmir Markhor, the world’s largest wild mountain goat, will begin in early Feb as J&K’s wildlife department seeks more data on the population of the species that is categorised as ‘near threatened’.“The census will start from Kazinag National Park,” said Dr Tanushree Srivastava, senior manager and head of Jammu and Kashmir projects at Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), which is conducting the census in collaboration with the wildlife department. WTI is a well-known wildlife conservation group that works in close coordination with Union and state govts.Considered to be the largest wild goat in the world, in India the Markhor is found only in J&K. According to Srivastava, the last census was carried out in 2023, during which WTI estimated the Markhor population in Kazinag National Park to be 221, while the sightings in Hirpora and Tatakutti wildlife sanctuaries remained very low.Kazinag National Park lies on the northern bank of the River Jhelum near the Line of Control (LoC) in Baramulla district, about 70 km northwest of Srinagar. The Hirpora sanctuary is located in the Pir Panjal range, 70 km southwest of Srinagar, in Kashmir’s Shopian district, and the Tatakutti sanctuary in Jammu’s Poonch district.In 2004, WTI carried out the first survey to assess the Markhor population and distribution in all its historical sites. Dr Srivastava said it was after WTI’s field surveys that Markhor was recorded in the areas adjacent to the Hirpora sanctuary after 60 years. “We follow the double-observer survey method to estimate the Markhor population, as this method has been globally recognised,” she said. Understanding the population status of the species is crucial for planning future conservation efforts, she added.As Markhor inhabits rugged terrain in areas close to the LoC, WTI needs special permission from the Army for the census work due to security concerns. “The Army has been very supportive in giving due permissions to survey these areas, and also providing full security during the exercise,” Srivastava said.","Census to count Kashmir Markhor, the world's largest wild mountain goat, will begin in early Feb.

'Zero appeals received': CEC Gyanesh Kumar hails 'successful' SIR at IICDEM 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/zero-appeals-received-cec-gyanesh-kumar-hails-sir-at-iicdem-2026/articleshow/127019246.cms,"Gyanesh Kumar, Chief Election Commissioner

NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar on Wednesday utilised the India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) 2026 — which got underway here with the participation of delegates from 70 nations — as a forum to showcase the successful conduct of special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar, citing the zero appeals received after publication of the final electoral roll, and the subsequent assembly election that witnessed zero repolls.“Pure electoral roll, including each and every eligible elector as per law, is essential to strengthen democracy and all elections which will be held on the basis of that electoral roll. The second segment is the conduct of elections, which becomes a very challenging, logistical affair, because a large number of people have to obey and follow the electoral laws and the instructions issued by the EC,” Kumar said while highlighting how the Bihar election had delivered on both the fronts.Stating that the purpose of the IICDEM 2026 is to not only celebrate democracy but also understand the future path, challenges, the expectations of the electors and how to make the electoral process smoother, transparent, free and fair, the CEC explained to the foreign delegates, which included top representatives of 42 electoral management bodies and 27 ambassadors/High Commissioners, how Indian elections have become one of the largest exercises on the planet in terms of logistics, numbers and transparency.“More than a billion voters, (with) 640 million exercising their franchise at more than a million polling stations….and roughly. 1.8-2 crore people involved in the exercise, is a feat,” he underlined.Election commissioner SS Sandhu described the faith placed by citizens in electoral management bodies (EMBs) as precious, saying that it is the collective responsibility of EMBs to preserve it.Election commissioner Vivek Joshi said IICDEM-2026 brings together EMBs, researchers, students and practitioners who view elections from different angles, to brainstorm on all issues related to democracy and electoral management.Earlier, secretary general of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (international IDEA) Kevin Casas-Zamora welcomed India’s chairship of International IDEA, saying that India must share with the world how it has managed the odds to build a legacy of “free and fair elections, respect for the rule of law, tolerance, secularism, press freedom and all the things that make a democracy worth”.Recalling how recent elections across many countries witnessed political polarisation, illicit funding flows, online and offline aggression and digital misinformation, Casas-Zamora also raised concern over outright election denialism, with politicians from the US, Peru, Georgia, and Bangladesh “using spurious arguments to question credible results”. He said that 2024 saw 1.6 billion people casting ballots in 74 national elections, including India. “Yet, global electoral turnout that year was down nearly 10 percentage points when compared to 15 years before, while around 40% of elections suffered some form of dispute over their credibility,” he pointed out.Casas-Zamora however said elections had also helped reverse democratic backsliding in Poland, Senegal, Guatemala and Brazil. “Democracy can be restored as long as electoral routes for political change remain open,” he emphasised.Speaking on the theme of IICDEM 2026 — democracy for an inclusive, peaceful, resilient and sustainable world — DG IIIDEM Rakesh Verma said that it reflects a broad and multi-dimensional understanding of what democracy must deliver in the 21st century.The participants viewed glimpses from the upcoming docu-series, “India Decides” produced in collaboration with Warner Bros.

"Eyeing net zero future, Niti Aayog releases roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement, MSME sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eyeing-net-zero-future-niti-aayog-releases-roadmaps-for-decarbonisation-of-aluminium-cement-msme-sectors/articleshow/127019307.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt think tank, Niti Aayog , on Wednesday released roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sectors, aimed at guiding the country towards a net-zero emission future through sustainable processes.The move comes in the backdrop of the country's climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement and the govt's recent decision to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity reduction targets of traditionally high-emitting sectors including aluminium, cement, petrochemical and textile to meet specific reduction goals by 2026-27 compared to a 2023-24 baseline.“These roadmaps will not only help these sectors reach their emission intensity reduction targets but also contribute immensely towards achieving India's net-zero goal (carbon neutrality) of 2070,” said an official in the environment ministry.B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog, while releasing these roadmaps, emphasized that these roadmaps would serve as reference manuals for India to achieve its unique goal of becoming a developed country as well as decarbonising the industry simultaneously.Globally, cement production is a significant source of carbon emissions. In 2023, cement manufacturing contributed roughly 2.4 GtCO2e emissions worldwide.India’s production of cement resulted in roughly 246 MtCO2e of emissions which was around 6% of national GHG emissions.Similarly, production of aluminium accounted for about 2.8% of India's total GHG emissions in 2023. The country's domestic demand for aluminium is projected to increase sharply from 4 million tonnes in 2023 to over 37 million tonnes by 2070, almost three times the projected global growth rate.MSMEs, which have over 36% share in manufacturing, too rely heavily on fossil fuels to meet their energy and process requirements, resulting in approximately 135 million tonnes of carbon emissions (MtCO2e) in 2022 alone.Keeping this in view, the roadmaps for the cement, aluminium and MSMEs sectors are intended as practical planning tools, outlining how each sector can move step by step toward more sustainable, lower-carbon modes of production. It carries various recommendations and solutions which help decarbonise these sectors.“The move will also help India navigate through the European Union’s carbon border tax on GHG intensive (emission generated during production) goods such as aluminium and cement by reducing carbon footprints in the manufacturing processes of these sectors,” said the official.EU’s carbon border tax - Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - is a tool to put a price through imposing border tax on such goods that are entering the 27 EU nations. If India does not take steps to decarbonise these sectors, they will attract a tariff burden on such products and impact the country’s exports.Under the decarbonisation strategy, the cement sector will reduce its carbon intensity from 0.63 tCO₂e per tonne of cement to approximately 0.09-0.13 tCO₂e per tonne by 2070. The roadmap for the sector proposes to prioritize the use of refuse-derived fuels, clinker substitution, scaling up of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and effective implementation of carbon credit trading scheme to enable deep decarbonisation in this sector.The decarbonisation roadmap for aluminium sector identifies three phased solutions - transition to renewable energy-round the clock (RE-RTC) power and enhanced grid connectivity in the short term, adoption of nuclear power in the medium term, and long-term integration of CCUS.The roadmap for green transition of MSMEs focuses on three key levers: deployment of energy-efficient equipment, adoption of alternative fuels, and integration of green electricity.Observing that MSMEs are important members of domestic and international supply chains, Suman Bery, vice chairperson, NITI Aayog, urged prioritizing technology adoption, access to affordable finance, skilling & regulatory reforms, and increased participation of female workforce to achieve overall competitiveness of the sector.","Govt think tank, Niti Aayog released roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sectors.

Identification and survey of all small drains connected to Najafgarh and Shahdara drains will be completed through drone survey by the end of January.The survey of remaining drains will be completed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) by June 2026, the chief minister said.The Delhi government set a 2028 deadline to connect all 1,799 unauthorised colonies to the sewerage network.The chief minister highlighted that coordination with neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is essential to cleaning the Yamuna.""Six drains from Haryana account for 33 per cent of the total contaminated water in Najafgarh, while four major drains from Uttar Pradesh discharge into the Shahdara Drain, accounting for approximately 40 per cent of the total contaminated water,"" she said.Gupta added that she would discuss this issue with the chief ministers of both states to find a solution.""Currently, 37 sewage treatment plants in Delhi are treating 814 million gallons per day (MGD) of contaminated water, which is sufficient as per the current requirement. But keeping in view the future needs, the government has set a big target of increasing this capacity to 1,500 MGD,"" the chief minister told the meeting.The capacity of the treatment plants would be improved by 56 MGD by December 2027 by improving old machines. Moreover, 170 MGD capacity would be added by setting up 35 new small decentralised sewage treatment plants, she addedAdditionally, new plants near drains of 460 MGD capacity will be added by December 2028.""The biggest benefit of this will be that untreated sewage will no longer flow into the Yamuna. As sewage treatment capacity increases, more of the city's wastewater will be cleaned and then released into the river,"" Gupta said further.The chief minister also informed the meeting that work on laying sewer lines in unauthorised colonies and JJ clusters was being expedited.""Out of 675 JJ clusters, work has been completed in 574, while arrangements for single-point sewage collection are being made in 65 clusters. In addition, sewer network work in all 1,799 unauthorised colonies will be completed in a phased manner between December 2026 and December 2028,"" Gupta added.During the meeting, the chief minister directed the irrigation and flood control department to immediately identify suitable land to set up four bio-mining and processing plants for the scientific disposal of silt removed from roads and drains.","The Delhi government will increase its overall sewage treatment capacity to 1,500 MGD by 2028.

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress leader Manirul Islam on Wednesday said the Election Commission will be ""hunted down from the netherworld"" and ""taught a lesson"" as the impasse continues between the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government and poll body over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR).Manirul Islam, threatening the Election Commission of India , is not his first brush with controversy, as the Farakka MLA was accused of leading a mob to the Block Development Office (BDO) in his constituency and ransacking the space, leaving officials injured last week.After the incident, BJP MLA Gouri Sankar attacked Mamata Banerjee for instigating her party cadres across the state to commit riots and violence.Lashing out at the ruling TMC over its MLA threatening the EC, the BJP on Wednesday accused CM Mamata Banerjee of ""asking her MLA to intimidate officials"".""Manirul Islam, a sitting TMC MLA, openly threatens the Election Commission of India, saying it will be “taught a lesson” and “hunted down from underground.” Mamata Banerjee as Home Minister is asking her MLA to intimidate officials! TMC protects illegal infiltrators!"" BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari posted on X.Manirul Islam's remark comes days after tension was reported over the submission of Form 7 across Bengal districts on Tuesday as Trinamool and BJP workers blocked roads and staged protests.The violence prompted Trinamool to appeal to people not to be ""provoked"".""The anger and frustration is understandable. But the fight has to be fought in courtrooms and on EVMs. CM Mamata Banerjee is fighting for you. Do not fall for provocation,"" said party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari accused the TMC of unleashing ""statewide anarchy"" to derail the SIR exercise.At Mogra in Hooghly, BJP workers blocked GT Road and demanded they be given an opportunity to submit Form 7 in the presence of the central security force.Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee personally addressed concerns over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, urging district magistrates to ensure that voters face no inconvenience over ""logical discrepancies.""Banerjee made the remarks during an unexpected meeting with district magistrates at the state secretariat, Nabanna, which was chaired by chief secretary Nandini Chakraborty.""The CM made it clear that all hearings related to SIR must be conducted strictly in accordance with the apex court's directives. She specifically instructed officials to ensure that people are not put to inconvenience under the pretext of logical discrepancies,"" a senior official said.The Supreme Court had on Monday directed the Election Commission to display the names of those on the ‘logical discrepancies’ list at gram panchayat bhavans and block offices, where documents and objections can also be submitted. The apex court also granted electors an additional 10 days to submit documents to confirm their inclusion in the state electoral roll.The latest directions have brought relief to several voters in Kolkata who were summoned for hearings after discrepancies were found in their voter records.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday doubled down on his government's ambition to detect and deport illegal immigrants in the country, while strongly criticising the political parties ""protecting or covering up for illegal immigrants for the sake of vote bank politics"".Addressing the party workers after the new BJP chief Nitin Nabin took charge, PM Modi said: ""Illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security. Identifying them and sending them back to their countries is absolutely essential.""""No country in the world accepts illegal immigrants. India, too, cannot allow illegal immigrants to steal the rights of our poor and our youth. Illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security. Identifying them and sending them back to their countries is absolutely essential,"" PM Modi said during an address at the BJP headquarters.Without naming any political party, but in an apparent attack on Trinamool Congress (TMC), which rules the poll-bound West Bengal, PM Modi lashed out at parties ""covering up for illegal immigrants"" and said: ""We must expose them to the public"".","Manirul Islam, a sitting TMC MLA, openly threatens the Election Commission of India, saying it will be “taught a lesson” and “hunted down from underground” Mamata Banerjee as Home Minister is asking her MLA to intimidate officials! TMC protects illegal infiltrators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126958014,imgsize-160434,width-400,resizemode-4/tmc-leader.jpg"

WHO adds key weight-loss drugs to essential meds list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-adds-key-weight-loss-drugs-to-essential-meds-list/articleshow/123798126.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organization (WHO) has included popular weight-loss drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide, sold in India under the brand name Wegovy and Mounjaro, respectively, in its Model List of Essential Medicines (EML).This is important because the WHO's model list of essential medicines serves as a basis for public sector procurement, supply of medicines and health insurance, and reimbursement schemes in over 150 countries, including India.If India adopts the list, it could pave the way for a sharp reduction in the prices of these drugs in the future.Currently, Wegovy, one of the most popular weight loss drugs, costs anywhere between Rs 17,000 and Rs 26,000 per month depending on the dosage. Mounjaro, another blockbuster weight-loss drug, costs anywhere between Rs 14,000 and Rs 27,000 per month depending on dosage and the route of administration. Vials are cheaper compared to Kwikpens, a pre-filled, disposable device that contains medication.According to the WHO, the high prices of drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are limiting access to these medicines. ""Prioritising those who would benefit most, encouraging generic competition to drive down prices and making these treatments available in primary care - especially in underserved areas - are key to expanding access and improving health outcomes,"" the UN health body has said.Diabetes and obesity are two of the most urgent health challenges facing the world today. In India, studies suggest, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has gone up by over five times in the last 30 years - from approximately 53 million people in 1990 to 235 million in 2021.If action is not taken to curb this growing public health challenge, a recent study published in The Lancet warned, the overweight or obesity prevalence in the country may go up to over 520 million (projected figure) - the second highest globally.As part of broader efforts to reduce inequities in cancer care, the expert committee of WHO has also recommended increasing access to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.","The WHO has included popular weight-loss drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide in its Model List of Essential Medicines.

US tariffs: Trump signs order granting exemptions; zero duties begin Monday for aligned partners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariffs-trump-signs-order-granting-exemptions-zero-duties-begin-monday-for-aligned-partners/articleshow/123736960.cms,"PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports. The move covers offering exemptions covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US. While some trade deals have been announced, exact details of many are yet to emerge.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday.

"Canada rejects 80% of Indian student visas in 2025, Germany rises as top destination",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/canada-rejects-80-of-indian-student-visas-in-2025-germany-rises-as-top-destination/articleshow/123793052.cms,"The forces behind Canada’s tightened visa regime



Ripple effects on students and institutions



Germany emerges as the new epicenter



A global rebalancing in international education

In 2025, Canada, long heralded as a haven for international students, enacted one of the most restrictive visa regimes in a decade. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) data reveals that nearly 80% of Indian student applications were rejected, a staggering surge in denials that has reshaped global student mobility. Applicants from Asia and Africa have also felt the brunt, signaling a regional recalibration in international education flows.For decades, North America was a near-automatic first choice for ambitious students seeking global exposure, with Canada’s reputation for safety, opportunity, and high-quality education drawing tens of thousands annually. Yet, recent figures underscore a profound transformation: In 2024, only 1.88 lakh Indian students gained admission, barely half of what was recorded just two years prior, according to official data from the Canadian government. The shift in preference is stark; Germany now leads as the most sought-after destination for Indian students at 31%, while Canada’s share plummeted from 18% in 2022 to 9% in 2024.The decision is not arbitrary but rooted in domestic imperatives. Ottawa faces mounting pressures: housing shortages, strained infrastructure, and growing political demands to prioritize local talent. In response, Canada has fortified visa scrutiny.Applicants must now demonstrate substantial financial resources, furnish comprehensive study plans, and meet stricter language requirements.Financial prerequisites have doubled to over CA$20,000, and work regulations for students have become more restrictive. Graduate language requirements are more rigorous, while certain post-graduation employment avenues have been curtailed. Even the Student Direct Stream, a mechanism designed to expedite approvals, has been shuttered. Overall, the government plans to issue 437,000 study permits in 2025, representing a near 10% reduction from the previous year. Of these, 73,000 will be allocated for postgraduate students, 243,000 for undergraduates and others, and roughly 120,000 for renewals and school-level students, as suggested by media reports.For aspirants, the surge in rejections extends beyond procedural hurdles. Families invest heavily in applications, language tests, and preparatory courses, only to confront dashed aspirations. Many viewed the Canadian study as a pathway to permanent residence, a prospect now clouded in uncertainty.Universities, particularly smaller colleges reliant on international tuition, are confronting financial strain. Some face existential threats, with mergers or closures looming as revenue streams shrink. The tightening of North American corridors has accelerated a global recalibration, pushing students to reconsider alternative destinations.As Canada contracts, Germany is experiencing a remarkable surge in international enrolments. Its robust economy, publicly funded universities, and expanding English-language programmes make it increasingly attractive to Indian students. According to Federal Statistical Office of Germany enrollment figures underscore this rise: Indian student numbers have more than doubled over the past five years, reaching nearly 60,000 in 2025, up from 49,500 in 2023.Fields such as technology, management, and engineering have become particularly enticing in Germany due to cost-effective education and lower living expenses compared to North America. Policies supporting clearer career pathways and enhanced retention opportunities further cement its appeal. Other emerging hubs include France, Finland, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and the Middle East.This phenomenon signals not merely closed doors but a seismic shift in demand. Indian students increasingly prioritize destinations that combine affordability, quality, and career sustainability. Traditional leaders like the US, UK, and Canada are confronting local constraints that erode their competitive edge, while alternative markets gain traction.The trend illustrates a more nuanced landscape: International education is no longer dominated by historical prestige alone. Students are agile, strategically weighing cost, opportunity, and long-term employability. For policymakers and institutions, the challenge is clear—adaptation is imperative, or risk ceding ground to rising global competitors.","In 2025, Canada enacted one of the most restrictive visa regimes in a decade.

Screams, Chains, Panic: Inside ICE’s Biggest Worksite Raid; Hyundai Georgia Plant Turns 'War Zone'

South Korean companies jittery about US

The US work visa problems





US President Donald Trump ’s ambitious ‘Made-in-USA’ dream is facing hurdles created by his own administration’s actions. The recent immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery facility in Georgia is an example of how Trump’s crackdown on immigrants and move to create jobs in the US, may actually face big hurdles, for now.Law enforcement officials have taken 475 individuals into custody at the complex, and according to reports, LG Energy Solution has postponed the commencement of operations at the facility to the first half of 2026. As reported by Yonhap on Monday, immigration authorities have presented the detained individuals with two alternatives: accept deportation with a five-year ban on re-entry, or remain in detention pending trial.According to a Bloomberg report, industry analysts note that these large-scale manufacturing initiatives, which Trump highlights as achievements in domestic job creation, are encountering difficulties due to immigration enforcement targeting their essential workforce.""Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so,"" Trump said on Truth Social on Sunday, emphasising that whilst the US welcomes foreign investment and skilled workers, proper legal procedures must be followed.Trump has expressed his desire to facilitate the training of US workers by bringing in battery plant specialists.Over the weekend, Korean authorities endeavoured to facilitate the release of 300 detained nationals at a Hyundai Motor Co.-LG Energy Solution Ltd. joint venture construction site, according to Lee's chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik during a high-level meeting between government officials and the ruling Democratic Party.The visa status of the workers and their legal authorisation to work at the site remains uncertain.The enforcement action, despite being unusual in its magnitude and the type of workers affected, is creating anxiety among Hyundai's industry counterparts, including Samsung Electronics Co. and SK On Co., who have also pledged substantial investments in the United States.The timing is also sensitive, following the meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Trump that highlighted their partnership and cemented a fresh trade agreement. The arrangement incorporated a $350 billion fund to assist South Korean companies growing their presence in the US, allocating $150 billion specifically for shipbuilding ventures. Additionally, private sector organisations committed $150 billion for direct investment in the US.South Korean conglomerates are working to manage the aftermath, raising apprehension about planned investments worth billions of dollars.The extensive operation caused distress amongst South Koreans when footage emerged showing workers in shackles at the waist, ankles and wrists. This action, part of a larger US initiative against undocumented workers, occurred shortly after a summit between Lee Jae Myung and Donald Trump that highlighted their partnership.""The Georgia episode demonstrates that managing this hurdle with higher tariffs and tighter labor supply will not be an easy task,"" said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Singapore Ltd., discussing the blanket 15% import duty from the Asian nation. ""We expect South Korea to push for pragmatic tweaks in US visa rules to keep the economic viability of many marquee capex projects,” Homin Lee was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.The presence of South Korean specialists, engineers and sub-contractors is essential for these projects' success. Any restrictions on their movement could potentially disrupt manufacturing schedules, increase expenses and diminish the intended industrial growth. This situation could also affect Hyundai's production expansion plans in Georgia.""Mass production in the first half of 2026 is virtually impossible due to the departure of key personnel during the installation and commissioning phase,"" said Anna Lee, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea in Seoul.This enforcement action has introduced uncertainty regarding South Korea's extensive US investment plans. The incident involving workers at a major Korean investment project might signal to other companies that US operations carry heightened political and regulatory challenges.These multibillion-dollar facilities require substantial numbers of international engineers and contractors, yet organisations like Hyundai and LG face considerable obstacles in securing appropriate visas for their specialist personnel.Under Trump's administration, Korean companies in the US have faced difficulties securing work visas, sources told Bloomberg. Particularly, subcontractors have experienced significant visa processing delays, hampering on-site technical discussions and coordination of visits.These staff members, particularly engineers with production line design knowledge, are considered indispensable, according to a battery sector representative. However, local recruitment remains viable for electrical work and basic technical support roles.Immigration enforcement actions draw attention to an ongoing challenge in US-South Korean relations: the significant gap between trade and immigration regulations.South Korea, despite maintaining a free trade agreement with the US since 2012, lacks a dedicated visa allocation, unlike other FTA nations. Whilst Australia, Singapore and Chile enjoy specific visa quotas, and Canada and Mexico operate without limitations under the Treaty National visa scheme, as legal practitioners note. This disparity creates considerable tension for Seoul, revealing a substantial flaw in the economic partnership between the nations.The core challenge stems from US work permit regulations.The H-1B visa category, which maintains an annual limit of 85,000 permits and operates via a random selection process, presents significant obstacles. South Korean organisations struggle to obtain necessary authorisations, typically securing merely 2,000 visas yearly. This limitation has led some Korean enterprises and their associated contractors to utilise B-1 business visas or ESTA for employment activities, according to immigration specialists. These particular visas, however, are exclusively designated for business gatherings or leisure travel, explicitly forbidding any form of employment.According to Monday's Korean media coverage, citing anonymous industry insiders, approximately 30% of B-1 visa applicants succeed, with deployment taking four to five months post-approval. The extensive application process includes corporate invitation letters, contractual documents, CVs and interviews. This has led workers to adopt a pattern of 70-80 day ESTA-based work periods followed by departures and returns, as reported by Chosun Ilbo.""The incident is likely to exacerbate the shortages of legally qualified skilled workers and increase labor cost pressures, which in turn would result in project delays and cost increases across major US construction projects,"" Eugene Investment & Securities Co. analyst Ryu Tae-hwan said. ""Companies' ability to procure and manage labor in America may emerge as a key factor for project execution.""",US President Donald Trump’s ambitious ‘Made-in-USA’ dream is facing hurdles. The recent immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery facility in Georgia is an example. Trump has expressed his desire to facilitate the training of US workers by bringing in battery plant specialists.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123769853,imgsize-53672,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump.jpg"

Third-country visa applications banned

US Tech Jobs Under Fire? Marjorie Greene Demand Ban On Indian Work Visas Amid Tariff Tensions

Appointment delays and tighter processing

Interview waivers eliminated

Proposed duration caps on student visas

Rising scrutiny and consequences

What it means for Indian students

Longer waits for appointments within India.

Loss of flexibility after the ban on third-country applications.

Mandatory interviews for nearly all categories of applicants.

Uncertain academic timelines due to proposed duration limits.

Higher risks of penalties for any breach of visa rules.

Indian students aspiring to study in the United States are facing a sharper set of hurdles after the US government enforced stricter visa application rules, rolled back pandemic-era flexibilities, and moved toward regulatory changes that will significantly reshape how international students live, study, and work in America. These new policies have introduced greater uncertainty and complexity in the application process, affecting not only prospective students but also universities and communities that rely on their presence. As a result, many students now have to navigate increased bureaucratic challenges, higher costs, and longer processing times, all while adapting to evolving legal requirements.The US Department of State has barred all non-immigrant visa applicants, including student (F-1), visitor (B1/B2), and work visas (H-1B, O-1), from applying outside their country of citizenship or legal residence. The directive, effective from early September 2025, ends a pandemic-era practice that had allowed Indian applicants to seek appointments in third countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Germany, or Brazil to bypass heavy backlogs at home.The US clarified that exceptions will apply only in limited circumstances where a country has no functioning US visa operations. This means all Indian applicants are now compelled to apply through US consulates in India, where waiting times already range from over three months in Mumbai and Hyderabad to nine months in Chennai.Education consultancies confirm the fallout. Applicants who had booked or started applications abroad must now refile in India, repay fees, and face longer delays. Industry representatives noted that many Indian students had used third-country applications as a workaround since mid-2025, when securing slots in India became increasingly difficult.The appointment crunch in India has worsened since July 2025, when US missions reduced student visa processing capacity while introducing new digital screening protocols. Though extra slots were later added, waiting times remain high. According to reports from Ahmedabad, approval rates for student visas have fallen below 50 percent, leaving many applicants stranded. Some have been forced to defer admissions or switch destinations altogether.From September 2, the US State Department has also eliminated most non-immigrant visa interview waivers. Children under 14 and seniors over 79, who were previously exempt, must now appear in person for interviews. Indian students applying for F and M visas are required to attend consular interviews without exception.The end of waivers has further strained appointment schedules at US consulates in India, adding another layer of delay and uncertainty for students trying to align their visa approvals with university start dates.Alongside procedural changes, the Department of Homeland Security has proposed ending the long-standing “duration of status” system. Instead of being allowed to remain in the US for as long as their program requires, students would be issued fixed-term visas capped at four years.Those who need more time, for instance, Ph.D. candidates or students on Optional Practical Training, would have to apply for extensions, with additional fees, paperwork, and biometric checks. The draft rule also includes limits on school transfers, bars second degrees at the same or lower level, and restricts the duration of language training.The US Embassy in India has issued repeated warnings to students about strict compliance requirements. Violations such as missing classes, working without authorisation, or failing to maintain full-time enrollment can result in visa revocation, deportation, and permanent bans on future US travel.In Ahmedabad and other centres, students have already reported denials despite confirmed university admissions, and some have been unable to secure interviews altogether. Those missing the current admission cycle face losing an entire academic year.For the more than 330,000 Indian students already in the United States, and thousands preparing to travel, the new measures add up to:The shift underscores a harder line on student mobility. For Indian families investing heavily in US higher education, the path ahead now comes with mounting costs, uncertainty, and the risk of missed opportunities.","The US Department of State has barred all non-immigrant visa applicants, including student (F-1), visitor (B1/B2), and work visas (H-1B, O-1) The directive, effective from early September 2025, ends a pandemic-era practice that had allowed Indian applicants to seek appointments in third countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Germany, or Brazil.

Cross-voting in VP election? Radhakrishnan's victory margin puts question mark on opposition's unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cross-voting-in-vp-election-radhakrishnans-victory-margin-puts-question-mark-on-oppositions-unity/articleshow/123769754.cms,"NEW DELHI: NDA candidate C P Radhakrishnan was on Tuesday elected as the 15th Vice-President of India bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy's 300. Announcing the result, Rajya Sabha Secretary General and Returning Officer P C Mody said 767 MPs had cast their votes out of the total valid electors of 781. He said 752 ballots were valid and 15 were invalid, bringing down the required majority of first preference votes to 377.That Radhakrishnan would win the VP race was perhaps never in doubt given the numbers advantage that he had over Reddy. But there was still a lot of interest in the final results. The fact that VP polls are held without any party whip thereby leaving a window open for cross voting had instilled some hope in the opposition camp. If not an outright win, they could at least bank on ""conscience vote"" to attract some NDA MPs to their side and embarrass the ruling camp. The Telugu card was a thought out strategy to achieve this objective.Unfortunately, as the final results show, the strategy boomeranged.Instead of NDA MPs ditching their camp, it appears the INDIA bloc members responded to their ""conscience"". The vote tally suggests some cross-voting in favour of Radhakrishnan.The BJP, which had silently ensured that all leaders associated with the ruling alliance voted in favour of NDA candidate, was quick to take digs at opposition's pre-voting claims of unity within their ranks.Union minister Kiren Rijiju claimed ""Many opposition parties have also voted for our NDA candidate. This is also a very good sign."" In fact, BJP claims that at least 15 opposition members voted for the NDA nominee.Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh had earlier asserted that all 315 INDIA bloc MPs were in attendance for the vote.""The Opposition has stood united. ALL of its 315 MPs have turned up for voting. This is an unprecedented 100% turnout,"" he said on X.Since this was a secret ballot, so who all cast conscience vote may perhaps be not known. But the opposition did admit that it suffered a dent, though not a significant one.""There has been a 14% increase in votes secured by this candidate (Opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy) as compared to the last candidate. This candidate received 40% of the total votes, compared to 26% secured by the previous candidate. So the Opposition is only gaining; there will be a change...They (NDA) could not cause a significant dent ... ,"" Congress MP Imran Masood said.However, with Reddy managing only 300, the deficit of 15 votes raised questions. BJP leader Amit Malviya was quick to take pot shots at this claim. Soon after the results were out, he responded to Jairam's post and wrote:""All 315 voted… but for whom is the real question! 🤔 Despite all the noise and bravado, the INDI Alliance candidate managed only 300 votes, 15 short of what they had confidently claimed. So much for tall claims and unity!""However, Jairam Ramesh put up a brave defence and claimed opposition performance had improved compared to last elections.""Opposition performance has undeniably been most respectable. Its joint candidate Justice (retd) B Sudershan Reddy secured 40% of the vote. In 2022, the Opposition had received 26% of the vote in the vice presidential elections,"" Ramesh said.""The BJP's arithmetical victory is really both a moral and political defeat. The ideological battle continues undiminished,"" the Congress leader added.These claims notwithstanding, the fact remains that the opposition once again put up a poor show. Yes, 15 votes were declared invalid. But this does not explain the dip in INDIA bloc's overall numbers. Moreover, there is still no clarity on how the AAP members, who had promised support to Reddy, have voted.So, while the results are not a surprise, the more than expected victory margin of C P Radhakrishnan is surely is a matter of concern for the opposition. Clearly, they still are far away from their claims of unity.(With inputs from agencies)",NDA candidate C P Radhakrishnan was on Tuesday elected as the 15th Vice- President of India bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy's 300.

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas. These findings reaffirm the state’s importance as a global biodiversity hotspot and highlight the need for continued investment in scientific monitoring and conservation,” said Ngilyang Tam, state’s principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden (wildlife and biodiversity).",Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats.

He also said long-term solutions — such as introducing a rail cargo service for Kashmir’s fruit produce — are being explored to prevent future disruptions during peak seasons.J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha visited Thard village in Udhampur district on Tuesday and reviewed the ongoing restoration work along NH-44. He also assured assistance to flood-hit residents of Jammu city.Senior officials, meanwhile, said NH-44 is likely to be opened on Wednesday for light vehicles. “The highway is still closed from Jakheni (Udhampur) towards Srinagar and vice versa due to blockages between Jakheni and Balli Nallah. No vehicular movement shall be allowed from Nagrota (Jammu) towards Reasi, Chenani, Patnitop, Doda, Ramban, Banihal, Srinagar, and vice versa,” a traffic official said.Jammu and Kashmir Apple Farmers Federation has warned that prolonged highway closure could push the horticulture sector — which generates around Rs 10,000 crore income and employs around 35 lakh people — to the brink of crisis. “Whenever Srinagar-Jammu highway is opened, only fruit trucks should be allowed to ply at night,” said Federation president Zahoor Ahmad Rather. He said several trucks stranded on the road had to return from Qazigund and unload apple boxes, leading to enormous losses.Border Roads Organisation’s 118 Road Construction Company, meanwhile, managed to restore the critical Gulabgarh-Chasoti road, which was reopened for traffic Tuesday. Twin cloudbursts in Kishtwar’s Chasoti on Aug 14 had triggered flash floods, killing 65 people and leaving several missing. Heavy downpour following the disaster had further damaged crucial road links in the area.""The vital link was severed following catastrophic torrential rains and subsequent landslides on Aug 26 and 27, cutting off numerous remote villages in Jammu division,” Army’s Jammu-based PRO Lt Col Suneel Bartwal said.“Working in treacherous and unforgiving conditions, the BRO Karmyogis under the command of Maj Jivitesh Razora, worked round-the-clock for 13 days, battling unstable hillsides and debris, and finally succeeded in clearing a formidable 14km stretch,” Bartwal said.“The operation was an example of inter-agency coordination. While 118 RCC tackled the more extensive damage from Chasoti, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana initiated clearance from Gulabgarh end, opening a 7km stretch. The combined effort of both agencies ensured that the entire 21km blocked route was made motorable in record time,” Bartwal added.",The Srinagar-Jammu highway (NH-44) has remained shut for traffic for the past 15 days due to landslides at several stretches.

They added that Mizoram becomes the fourth Northeastern state whose capital will now be directly connected to the Indian Railways network.“The Bairabi–Sairang new line project spans 51.4 km, and it has been built with an investment of around Rs 8,071 crore. This corridor has 48 tunnels (total length of 12.8 km), 55 major bridges, 87 minor bridges, five road over bridges and another six under bridges. The tunnels are adorned with murals reflecting Mizo heritage, which will turn the trip into a cultural experience,” said an official. Construction of the line began in 2015.Once operational, the new line will reduce the travel time between Aizawl and Guwahati from 16 hours by road to 12 hours by train and between Aizawl and Silchar from nearly seven hours by road to just three hours.“The benefits of this rail link will be multidimensional. Besides making travel easier, it will lead to socio-economic development, boosting tourism and other trade sectors not only in Mizoram but across the other Northeastern states as well,” said an official.","The North East will get its fourth Rajdhani train on Saturday with PM Narendra Modi flagging off the inaugural train between Aizawl and Delhi.

'Nepotism, Corruption And...': Ex-Envoys Decode What Fuelled Nepal’s Violent Gen Z Protests

As Nepal plunged into a crisis, PM Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to discuss the developments in the country, saying the violence witnessed there was heart-rending.Modi said he was anguished that many young people had lost their lives and appealed to all “brothers and sisters” in Nepal to support peace. “The stability, peace and prosperity of Nepal are of utmost importance to us,” he said.Earlier in the day, India’s response to the Gen Z uprising in Nepal, which devoured PM K P Sharma Oli, was restrained expectedly as the government - in a statement Tuesday morning - said it was closely monitoring the situation and urged all concerned to exercise restraint and resolve issues through peaceful means. After news of Oli’s resignation, the government issued an advisory asking Indian nationals in Nepal to shelter in their homes, follow local safety advisories and Indians here to defer travel to Nepal.In its morning statement, the first official response to developments in Nepal, the Indian government also said it was deeply saddened by the loss of many young lives and expressed condolences to the families of the victims.Unlike the statement jointly issued by several European countries, India stopped short of seeking protection of fundamental rights but its response was still an acknowledgement of the organic nature of the protests on Monday in which 19 lives were lost. Oli had claimed that “certain elements” had infiltrated the protests.India will have few tears to shed for Oli, not least because of his continued courtship of China. In July last year, Oli junked alliance with fellow Communist leader P K Dahal Prachanda to enter into a power-sharing agreement with pro-India party Nepali Congress (NC), himself taking oath as PM for the 4th time. In a break from the past, however, Oli chose China for his first bilateral visit.This meant the Indian government had to take a rain check on Oli’s proposed visit to India. Oli was finally scheduled to come mid-September but even this was derailed by Nepal’s public outburst on the border issue which was provoked by India’s decision to reopen trade with China through the Lipulekh pass that is claimed by Nepal. India did not want Oli’s visit hijacked by Nepal’s border claims, which it sees as not based on historical facts and evidence.However, India might have to contend with a different type of instability in Nepal as it’s not just Oli but all mainstream leaders and parties that are under attack. The protests were triggered by a ban on social media but quickly turned into an insurrection, fuelled not just by anger against Oli or his government but also deep-seated resentment among the Gen Z about the recurring political game of musical chairs, which has seen the same leaders take turns to rule the country, rent-seeking politicians and rampant corruption.Former Indian ambassador to Nepal Manjeev Puri says that while the present crisis was precipitated by the mishandling of protests by local authorities for which the buck had to stop at the top, the increasingly aspirational Nepal youth has genuine reasons to feel disgruntled about the political situation in Nepal. He also says the ban on social media was avoidable at a time of increasing Nepal exposure to globalisation.Unlike in the case of Bangladesh, where it fell victim to its ties with the leader, India can perhaps hope to safely allow the churn to play out in Nepal while remaining focused on the cooperative ties across diverse sectors that have yielded benefits for the people of both the countries. Oli was not India’s man, after all. In the meantime, as Puri says, India can counsel the leaders about the need for political sagacity and for being empathetic towards the people of Nepal.",PM Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to discuss the developments in the country.

ED Raids Aap Leader Saurabh Bhardwaj In Alleged Hospital Construction Scam Across Delhi-NCRatishi

Aam Aadmi Party Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj has asked the Bharatiya Janta Party to clarify the position of Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta's husband, alleging that he frequently attends government meetings.The AAP leader added that it was the chief minister, Rekha Gupta, and not her husband who had taken the oath of the Constitution. ""Delhi CM Rekha Gupta has taken the oath of the Constitution... No country's law allows her husband to be included in government meetings. But we have seen that her husband is attending meetings with them, conducting inspections, giving instructions to officers..."" Bharadwaj said.Stating that CM's husband is a businessman the AAP leader asked ""How can he run the government or have a stake in running the government? This is completely unethical and unconstitutional. .. My question to the BJP. They should say what position Rekha Gupta's husband holds?""Earlier in the day, Bharadwaj in a post on X termed Rekha Gupta's husband at official government meetings as ""completely unconstitutional"".In his X post, Bharadwaj compared the situation to that portrayed in the popular web series ""Panchayat"" which portrays the functioning of a Gram Panchayat in the fictional village of Phulera.""DelhiGovernment Becomes Phulera Panchayat. Just as in Phulera's panchayat, where the woman sarpanch's husband acted as the sarpanch, today in Delhi, the CM's husband is sitting in official meetings.We had previously mentioned that the CM's husband attends official meetings, conducts meetings with officials, and carries out inspections,"" Bharadwaj said in X post.""This is completely unconstitutional. In the nation's capital, democracy and the constitutional system are being mocked in this manner,"" he said.Bharadwaj further questioned whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which often criticises Congress for dynastic politics, would justify such a move.""The BJP, which relentlessly criticises Congress for dynastic politics, should explain--is this not dynastic politics?"" he asked.Bharadwaj raised several other questions: ""Does the CM of the world's largest party have no worker left whom she can trust? What is that work which only a family member can do? What are the reasons that the CM wants to establish her husband's authority? Why is her husband being made a part of the government administrative system in this way?""He also said that photos of the meeting were posted on both the official Instagram handle of the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) and CM Rekha Gupta's Instagram.","Aam Aadmi Party Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj has asked the Bharatiya Janta Party to clarify the position of Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta's husband.

At least 100 members of such association should file sworn affidavits, along with certified extracts of electoral rolls showing them to be electors and copies of their electoral photo identity cards. They should also affirm that they are not members of any other registered political party.EC sources on Tuesday said some recent cases of applicants, who had submitted manipulated and/or false affidavits in an attempt to secure registration under Section 29A, had come to its notice.The intensive scrutiny of randomly picked 20 affidavits submitted by the applicant parties - by the state/UT chief electoral officers (CEO) concerned through the district election officers (DEOs) - is aimed at detecting such false affidavits, which will serve as an adverse input while deciding on their registration.As part of its efforts to clean up the political space and weed out non-existent or inactive RUPPs that tend to misuse tax exemptions and serve as money laundering vehicles, EC had in Aug delisted 334 RUPPs, bringing down their total strength to 2,520 from 2,854. A fortnight later, EC identified another 476 RUPPs and directed CEOs to inquire into their activities, including verifying their registered addresses, whether they had been contesting elections in the past six years and whether they are filing their annual contribution reports and audit reports as required by the statute.","EC is concerned at the crowding of political space with ""inactive"" or ""defunct"" registered unrecognised political parties (RUPPs) Election Commission has now decided to verify the antecedents of founding members of such RUPPs at the registration stage itself.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123797936,imgsize-114000,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

This declaration from Imphal Hmar Displaced People Committee captures the defiance of Kuki-Zo groups who said they will boycott events tied to PM Narendra Modi's likely Sept 13 visit to Manipur.Preparations are underway in Imphal and Churachandpur, though PMO is yet to confirm his itinerary. Displaced people's associations, including Eastern Vaiphei IDPs Welfare Committee & Chandel District IDP Welfare Committee, echoed Hmar committee's stand, signalling that Modi's arrival will 'meet a wall of grief' rather than celebration.Ethnic violence that broke out in May 2023 has killed more than 260 people, displaced over 60,000 and burned hundreds of villages, hardening divides between Kuki-Zo tribes in the hills and Meiteis in Imphal valley. Relief camps still house thousands.Apex tribal union Kuki Inpi Manipur (KIM) said Modi ""should be welcomed upon his visit"" but stressed it must become a platform ""to press for justice and recognition of Kuki-Zo people's collective aspirations"". Its demand: a political solution addressing root causes of the conflict. ""Temporary relief measures cannot substitute for a lasting settlement,"" KIM said.The group also hit back at the Sept 4 suspension of operations (SoO) extension signed by two Kuki armed groups, Centre and state, which included a clause affirming Manipur's territorial integrity.KIM said the deal applies only to those armed groups, not the wider Kuki-Zo community. ""Separation from Meiteis has been a lived reality since May 3, 2023,"" it said, adding SoO groups had already told MHA the chapter on ""Manipur integrity"" was closed. ""Kuki-Zo people do not recognise or uphold the idea of Manipur territorial integrity in any form,"" KIM said.Secrecy over PM's itinerary has sharpened tensions. Naga groups have launched a trade embargo, Meitei organisations are pushing back against peace overtures, and Manipur remains under President's rule since Feb. Observers said Modi's visit, if it goes ahead, will happen in a landscape of ethnic fragmentation and competing demands for autonomy. His engagement - who he meets, what he announces, and whether he acknowledges the fractured realities - could potentially set the course of peace and governance for years.","Kuki-Zo groups say they will boycott events tied to PM Narendra Modi's likely Sept 13 visit to Manipur.

They have also been asked to add or include new eligible beneficiaries so that deserving people get govt aid.Sources said such a move will ensure lakhs of “deserving” people waiting for inclusion in the list get the benefit. For example, while around 10 lakh new beneficiaries can be added to the list in Delhi, in Maharashtra over 50,000 can be included.Some of the state food secretaries who attended a meeting convened by the food ministry said that they have been urged to expedite the process for ‘correct targeting’ of beneficiaries. “As per the norm, state govts are empowered to create their own criteria for inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries under the food security scheme. The food ministry has just asked us to follow our own criteria and if any state wants to change the norm, they can do so,” said a state govt official who attended the recent meeting.Earlier an exercise by the food ministry had found that about 10% of the existing 80 crore beneficiaries under PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna were found to appear in one or more databases such as taxpayers, car owners or company directors. This also included beneficiaries who have not lifted free foodgrain for more than six months and they have been put under the “silent ration cards” category.Sources said states including Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh had initiated steps to weed out ineligible beneficiaries even before the Centre shared the indicative list.","Food ministry has urged states to complete the weeding out of ineligible beneficiaries for the govt’s free foodgrain scheme by this month end.

If proof of Indian citizenship is not furnished within 10 days, the DC must issue an expulsion order, giving the person 24 hours to exit through a designated route.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said the overhaul was necessary to unclog Assam's burdened tribunal system. ""The current route through Foreigners' Tribunals till conclusion is a long one, which may stretch to the HC and SC. There are 82,000 pending cases in our tribunals. This Cabinet decision bypasses the tribunal system for the first time,"" he said.The move marks a sweeping shift in how Assam tackles illegal immigration, particularly from Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Muslims have long been at the heart of the state's demographic anxieties and were central to the anti-foreigner agitation of the 1980s, a movement that reshaped the state's politics and culminated in the Assam Accord of 1985.The new framework draws authority from the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950, a law enacted specifically for the state but largely overshadowed by later Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act.IM(DT) Act was enforced only in Assam from Oct 15, 1983. Other states continued under the Foreigners Act, 1946. Supreme Court struck it down as ultra vires in 2005 after a petition filed by then students' leader and current Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal.SC called it discriminatory and violative of Art 14 on equality and Art 355, which obliges Centre to shield states from external aggression and disturbance. The law made detection and deportation of illegal immigrants cumbersome with stiff procedural barriers. Unlike Foreigners Act, where suspects must prove citizenship, IM(DT) shifted the burden onto state, weakening enforcement.Post-IMDT, Assam defaulted to tribunals until a constitutional bench last Oct ruled the 1950 Act ""shall be effectively employed for the purpose of identification of illegal immigrants"". The 1950 Act empowers Union govt to order the removal of any person or class of people entering Assam from outside India, if their stay is deemed detrimental to public interest or to the rights of scheduled tribes in the state.The SOP says only when officials cannot make a prima facie call will a suspected immigrant's case be sent to a tribunal. People already declared foreign nationals by tribunals, having exhausted all appeals, will face immediate expulsion without further verification.Under the new system, once a suspect is flagged, SSP must capture biometric and demographic data on Foreigners Identification Portal. If an expulsion order is ignored, the person will be placed in a holding centre or handed to BSF.","Assam Cabinet approves a new standard operating procedure empowering district commissioners and senior superintendents of police.

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he looks forward to speak with his ""very good friend"" Prime Minister Modi in the coming weeks and confirmed that his administration will continue negotiations with India to resolve trade barriers between the two countries.Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations.

"President, Governors can't stall bills even if unconstitutional: 4 opposition states to SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/president-governors-cant-stall-bills-even-if-unconstitutional-4-opposition-states-to-sc/articleshow/123795118.cms,"NEW DELHI: Opposition-governed states of Karnataka, Punjab, Kerala and Telangana Tuesday told Supreme Court that Constitution confers no discretion on President and governors to stall a bill passed by legislature even on the ground it is unconstitutional or repugnant to a central law.Advocating the supremacy of the cabinet system of governance at the Centre and states, Gopal Subramanium, appearing for Karnataka, told a CJI-led five-judge bench that bills passed are an expression of people's will, and hence, the President or governors at best could return such bills once to the legislatures with suggestions. ""Giving sweeping discretionary powers to a governor will result in a dyarchy,"" Subramanium said.Any conferment of veto power to a governor is antithetical to the existence of the elected state legislature,"" Gopal Subramanium, appearing for Karnataka, said, adding he is always, like the President, bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers.He, however, conceded that a governor can act without the aid and advice of the council of ministers in matters related to grant of sanction for prosecution of ministers under the Prevention of Corruption Act; while acting as chancellor of universities (an argument which would not go well with West Bengal which is at loggerheads with the governor on appointment of vice-chancellors); and as head of religious boards.The power to withhold assent is concomitant to returning it to the legislature for reconsideration, and if the legislature passes the bill again, with or without amendments, the governor has no option but to grant assent, he said.Subramanium said timelines for governors and the President for taking decision on bills is a necessity in the present political situation and argued that SC by providing timelines in the Tamil Nadu case in its April 8 judgment has only facilitated the aggrieved states to approach the court in the event of them not taking a decision on bills within specified time.The bench, also comprising and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar, appreciated Subramanium's sincerity in the court hearing and the courtesy he extended to the counsel opposed to him, and told him to keep assisting courts in the future.For Punjab, senior advocate Arvind Datar argued that a state legislature is entitled to enact a law that may be perceived as unconstitutional, especially in providing reservation in jobs to certain communities which would take the total quota beyond the 50% cap, but the governor or President have no option but to assent to it.""Governor has no power to determine the constitutional validity of a bill, which is the task of constitutional courts. Discretionary power does not mean a governor can keep reserving bills for President's consideration. Moreover, the President, bound by the aid and advice of the Union council of ministers, cannot frustrate the will of the people of the state by sitting over a bill referred to her by the governor,"" he said.Attempts by senior advocate P Wilson to argue for DMK were scotched by the CJI-headed bench, which said that Tamil Nadu has already argued in detail against the Presidential Reference and that giving a chance to a political party to argue would be an invite to other political parties to intervene. The arguments would continue on Wednesday.","Opposition-governed states of Karnataka, Punjab, Kerala and Telangana say Constitution confers no discretion on President and governors to stall a bill passed by legislature. ""Giving sweeping discretionary powers to a governor will result in a dyarchy,"" says Gopal Subramanium, appearing for Karnataka.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123796773,imgsize-50612,width-400,resizemode-4/sc.jpg"
Noida hostel firing incident: Gunshot kills 22-year-old student,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/noida-hostel-firing-incident-gunshot-leaves-22-year-old-student-dead/articleshow/123794605.cms,"NOIDA: A 22-year-old student was found dead with a gunshot wound in the head while his close friend lay critically injured with a similar wound inside a private hostel room in Knowledge Park in Noida on Tuesday morning. Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area. Forensic experts recovered the revolver, four live cartridges, and two bullet shells. They also seized the students' mobile phones, laptops, and other personal belongings from the room.While the exact sequence of events is unclear, police are examining the possibility of a confrontation between the two students.Bimtech did not respond to requests for a comment.",Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech) It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired.

"Karisma Kapoor's kids challenge dad's will, claim forgery",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karisma-kapoors-kids-challenge-dads-will-claim-forgery/articleshow/123794602.cms,"Reports: Karisma Kapoor Seeks Stake In Sunjay Kapur’s ₹30,000 Crore Empire

NEW DELHI: The high-stakes tussle over the inheritance of industrialist Sunjay Kapur took a fresh twist on Tuesday as his children from ex-wife and actor Karisma Kapoor approached Delhi high court challenging their exclusion from his assets, reported at Rs 30,000 crore, alleging his will was forged.Daughter Samaira and son Kiaan, through their legal guardian Karisma, filed a civil suit accusing Priya Kapur, Sunjay's third wife, of fabricating their father's will to gain complete control over his assets.Kapur, 53, died on June 12 this year after suffering a heart attack while playing polo in Surrey, UK. The suit claims that Kapur, while he was alive, never mentioned the will and seeks partition of the estate, rendition of accounts, and a permanent injunction against Priya and other defendants.Likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday, the suit also challenges Sunjay's March 21 will, which purportedly leaves his entire personal estate to Priya. The children have alleged that Priya's conduct since their father's death in June demonstrated ""without a doubt, that the alleged will has been fabricated"" by her.""The purported will allegedly executed by the plaintiffs' father is not a legal and valid document, is forged and fabricated, and in any event, surrounded by suspicious circumstances.It is for this reason that neither the original of the alleged purported will has been shown to the plaintiffs nor a copy of the alleged purported will has been provided,"" the suit submits.Seeking a direction to Priya to disclose the entire personal assets and effects of Kapur at the time of his sudden death, the plea says that ""plaintiffs do not have complete information regarding the personal assets and effects of their father at the time of his bereavement.""Karisma and Sunjay married in 2003 but divorced in 2016. The children argue they enjoyed a close relationship with their father until his sudden death. Accusing Priya of first denying the existence of a will, the plea claims it was in a family meeting on July 30 this year that she presented a document dated March 21, 2025, describing it as a will, prompting suspicions of forgery and manipulation. The plaintiffs added the original will or copy has not been shared with them and sought to arraign Priya, her minor son, Sunjay's mother Rani Kapur, and one Shradha Suri Marwah, as defendants. Marwah is the executor of the will.According to the children, their late father repeatedly assured them of their financial security and future well-being. They claim he initiated business ventures in their names, acquired assets both personally and through corporate entities, and named them as beneficiaries of the family trust. In July, Sunjay's mother Rani publicly objected to Priya's elevation as director in the company, alleging coercion, ahead of Sona Comstar's AGM. The plaintiffs allege they were summoned to corporate meetings of Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd (Sona Comstar) and asked to sign paperwork without being provided full transparency regarding the trust deed or associated records.","Daughter Samaira and son Kiaan, through their legal guardian Karisma, filed a civil suit accusing Priya Kapur, Sunjay's third wife, of fabricating their father's will to gain complete control over his assets. The suit claims that Kapur while he was alive, never mentioned the will and seeks partition of the estate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123796860,imgsize-20096,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe.

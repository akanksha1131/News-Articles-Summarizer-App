Minor volcanic activity has been reported twice this month at Barren Island, India’s only active volcano, officials said on Monday.The eruptions occurred on September 13 and September 20 but were described as mild in nature, with no immediate threat to nearby areas, PTI reported.Located in the Andaman Sea, about 138 km northeast of Port Blair, Barren Island is South Asia's only active volcano.The remote island, spans roughly 3 sq km, is largely covered by volcanic cones and ash, with sparse vegetation visible from a distance. Rising 354 metres above sea level, it remains a striking geological feature of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago.Barren Island has a recorded history of eruptions dating back to 1787. Since then, it has witnessed several episodes of activity, including significant eruptions in 2017 and 2022, the latest being in July this year.Officials continue to monitor the island closely, though the recent events have been classified as minor and pose no immediate risk to human settlements.","Minor volcanic activity reported twice this month at India's only active volcano.

‘GST Bachat Utsav’ Kicks Off: Modi Unveils Reforms for Middle Class, Farmers

(Inputs from agencies)

KOLKATA/T'PURAM: Bengal and Kerala welcomed lower GST rates for easing costs to households but warned that states will shoulder crippling losses in revenue, accusing Centre of passing the burden while taking credit.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said Monday her state would forfeit Rs 20,000 crore because of the decision, though she backed it for the sake of consumers. ""How will I run the state in such a condition?"" she asked after inaugurating a Durga Puja in Kolkata. ""No compensation was given to states on account of lowered GST rates, the money was simply cut from our GST share.""""I will place the truth before the people, take out ads to make sure they know the loss we suffered. This is no credit to central govt,"" she said. Banerjee reminded that she was the first to demand insurance be exempt from GST and pointed to anomalies: ""Many life-saving medicines and small items had GST. There was GST on jeere (cumin) but not on heere (diamond)."" Banerjee demanded whether Delhi would return funds withheld for 100 days' work, Awas Yojana, roads, Jal Swapno and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee sharpened the attack.""PM Modi yesterday said 'GST Bachat Utsav'. Was it 'GST Loot Utsav' since 2017?"" he asked.In Kerala, finance minister KN Balagopal warned of a ""substantial fall"" in revenues. He estimated Kerala's potential loss at between Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 2 lakh crore, directly affecting social security pensions, salaries and development projects. ""States have no alternative avenues to raise such revenue. With 41% of overall state income coming from GST, the impact will be severe if this loss materialises,"" he said, accusing Delhi of pushing reforms without appropriate study. Balagopal cautioned that companies might not pass on the benefit. ""Even Union ministers admitted this concern,"" he said.","Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said her state would forfeit Rs 20,000 crore because of the decision.

Officials said the pace is expected to pick up in the coming days, with field timings fixed between 9am and 5pm.K A Dayanand, member-secretary of Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes (KSCBC), attributed the slow beginning to teething troubles. ""Today being Day 1, we expected a slow start, as enumerators had to download these applications and start using them. We will see more traction in the next couple of days,"" he told TOI.Complaints poured in from across the state about delays and glitches in the mobile application used for the exercise. Delays in receiving OTPs for Aadhaar authentication left many respondents impatient.""With enumerators having a larger area to cover, 150 houses per block and asking responses for 60 questions per household, a delay of 2-5 minutes in verifying credentials of respondents has become time-consuming,"" one enumerator said.In several cases, final submissions were not accepted by the software, while poor network connectivity in rural areas compounded the problem.In Bengaluru Urban and Dakshina Kannada districts, fieldwork did not start even by Monday. While officials cited incomplete training as a reason for delays in Bengaluru, confusion reigned in Dakshina Kannada, where enumerators doubling as booth-level officers were also burdened with Election Commission's forthcoming special intensive revision of voter lists.Teachers pressed into the survey raised concerns about downloading the app and securing uninterrupted mobile network. Chandrashekar Nugli, president of Primary School Teachers' Association, said, ""We expect these things to stabilize, with our teachers picking up pace from tomorrow.""Enumerators spoke of the hurdles they faced on Day 1. ""We collected the kit at Ron tahsildar's office. We could only download the app - KSBC Social and Educational Survey - by noon.

NEW DELHI: Number of polluted river stretches in country has shown a consistent decline from 351 in 2018 to 311 in 2022 and further to 296 in 2025, shows an assessment report of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) released Monday.Two or more polluted locations identified on a river in a continuous sequence are defined as Polluted River Stretch (PRS). Stretches where biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) exceeds 3mg/l are identified as polluted stretches. BOD beyond prescribed levels affects health of aquatic life. A stretch where BOD concentration exceeds 30mg/l is categorised as most polluted stretch.The 2025 assessment, based on river water quality data of 2022 and 2023 at 2,116 locations on rivers across country, shows 37 of 296 PRS were classified as most polluted. This number, however, has dropped from 46 in 2022. These 37 stretches were identified across 14 states, with five each in TN, UP and Uttarakhand; four in Gujarat; and three in Karnataka.Yamuna's stretch from Palla to Asgarpur in Delhi, Sabarmati in Ahmedabad, Chambal's stretch from Nagda to Gandhisagar dam in MP, & stretches of Tungabadhra and Sarabanga in Karnataka and TN, respectively, were among most notable PRS during the assessment period.Jhelum in J&K; Ganga, Ramrekha and Sikrahna in Bihar; Hasdeo and Mahanadi in Chhattisgarh; Sal and Mapusa in Goa; Cauvery and Tungabhadra in Karnataka; Periyar in Kerala; and Amba & Savitri in Maharashtra are among prominent rivers where PRS were seen to have deteriorated in water quality.The report, at the same time, observed improvement in water quality in 220 stretches that were identified as PRS in 2018. ""Of the 220 PRS, 149 river stretches are not identified as polluted stretches due to compliance with BOD criterion,"" said the report.","Number of polluted river stretches in country has shown a consistent decline from 351 in 2018 to 311 in 2022.

Top Maoist Commander Modem Balkrishna Among 10 Killed, 26 Arrested In Chhattisgarh

New Delhi: With the elimination of two more CPI (Maoist) central committee members - Kadari Satyanarayana Reddy alias Kosa and Katta Ramchandra Reddy alias Raju - by security forces on Monday in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur district, the strength of the outfit's top decision-making body has shrunk by half in the current year, to just 10 members now.The neutralisation of the Maoists drew praise from home minister Amit Shah , who on X said, ""Our security forces are systematically dismantling the top naxal leadership, breaking the backbone of red terror"". The killings reflect the govt's and counter-Naxal forces's stand on dealing firmly with Maoists, notwithstanding the Sept 15 statement by CPI(Maoist) central committee member Mallojula Venugopal Rao alias Sonu, under the nom de guerre 'Abhay', offering to lay down arms and seeking a temporary halt to counter operations.Sonu's peace move has now been disowned by the CPI (Maoist) central committee, politburo, Dandakaranya special zonal committee (DKSZC), in a joint statement dated Sept 20 as ""his individual decision"", not reflecting the view of the party that favours continuation of ""armed struggle"". Earlier, the Telangana state committee too had distanced itself from Sonu's statement.Stating that Sonu had cleverly misrepresented the May 7 opinion of then general secretary Basavaraju on laying down arms, the latest statement - also signed by 'Abhay', a generic name used by any CPI(Maoist) spokesperson - discloses that a subsequent discussion in the core group had led to a rethink, with the military wing, PLGA, and 'rebel cadre' being instructed to continue their armed struggle.The statement - the veracity of which is still being established though senior officers said it appears authentic - called the suggestion of Sonu to consult all CPI(Maoist) formations on talks an ""evil move to break the party"". ""Laying down arms and surrendering before the enemy means converting CPI(Maoist) from a revolutionary outfit to a revisionist outfit...Sonu has no right to digress from the basic line of the party,"" it said.Since Jan 19, 2025 - when central committee leader Chalapathi was neutralised in Gariaband, Chhattisgarh - his colleagues in the apex panel have fallen one after the other. Vivek Manjhi was eliminated in an encounter in Jharkhand on April 21, followed by the 'big kill' - that of general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju in Narayanpur on May 21. In June, Thentu Lakshmi alias Sudhakar was neutralised in Chhattisgarh and Gajarla Ravi in Andhra Pradesh. In Sept alone, four central committee members have been eliminated - Modem Balakrishnan alias Bhaskar on Sept 11 in Gariaband, Sahdev Soren on Sept 14 in Jharkhand, and on Monday, Kadari Reddy and Katta Reddy. Another central committee member Sujatha had surrendered before the Telangana Police this month.As of today, CPI(Maoist) has four surviving politburo members - general secretary Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji, Sonu, Ganapathy and Misir Besra - who are also in the central committee. The other 'active' central committee members are Pulluri Prasad Rao alias Chandranna, Ganesh Uikey, Anal Da, Malla Raji Reddy, Ramder and Madvi Hidma.","Two more CPI (Maoist) central committee members were eliminated by security forces on Monday in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur district.

Apex body to oversee all modes of transport likely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apex-body-to-oversee-all-modes-of-transport-likely/articleshow/124059227.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The country is set to get an apex empowered agency for preparation of comprehensive transport strategies for all modes of transport and end-to-end mobility . The proposed Integrated Transport Authority comprising planning heads of all related ministries will also carry out monitoring to ensure timely project completion. The proposal is likely to be placed before the Cabinet soon as govt focuses on accelerating transport infrastructure development to enable faster movement of people and goods, and reduce logistics costs.At present, there is a National Project Group under department for promotion of industry and internal trade that evaluates large-scale projects, but it only has an advisory role. Officials said a group of secretaries has recommended the need for an authority similar to those in the US, the UK, Germany, Australia and Japan to handle all transport-related issues. However, they also cautioned the new agency must not become just another bureaucratic layer for going through presentations.","The proposed Integrated Transport Authority comprising planning heads of all related ministries will also carry out monitoring to ensure timely project completion.

Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj said police ends up getting the stick from both sides.If it does not follow the SC diktat for immediate registration of FIR on receiving a complaint disclosing an offence, it is criticised by courts, and if it registers one, it is accused of not applying its mind. The bench understood the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't predicament of police and said, ""Registration of an FIR does not mean the person accused of the crime is required to be immediately arrested in every case. Police must apply its mind to the nature of the crime and whether it is a civil or criminal offence.""Justice Kant said, ""Such misuse of the criminal law is posing a serious threat to the legal system for dispensation of justice.People think they can use the judiciary and police as recovery agents by instituting criminal cases even when the dispute is purely civil in nature.""The bench suggested that the states could appoint a nodal officer for each district, preferably a retired district judge, who could be consulted by police whenever they have a doubt about the nature of the offence - civil or criminal - reported in the FIR. It asked the additional solicitor general to deliberate the proposal and report back to the court.In April 1 last year, the SC, in Sharif Ahmad vs UP, had ruled that ""any effort to settle civil disputes and claims which do not involve any criminal offence, by way of applying pressure through criminal prosecution, should be deprecated and discouraged."" In another case in April this year, a CJI-led bench had said, ""Converting civil cases into criminal ones by police is unacceptable.

India vs Pakistan in the Asia Cup Super 4s on Sunday had not just cricket on the field but gestures that drew criticism for bringing off-field aspects into it. Both the controversial and politically-motivated gestures were made by Pakistani players on a night they suffered a 6-wicket loss at the Dubai International Stadium.The first gesture involved Sahibzada Farhan who celebrated his half-century by pointing his bat like a gun , drawing further criticism from Indian fans who accused the Pakistani team of unsportsmanlike behaviour.In the second, Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf made a provocative gesture towards Indian fans . While stationed near the boundary, Rauf responded to spectators' jeers by signalling ""0-6"" with his fingers, referencing to Pakistan's unverified claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during the Operation Sindoor border clash in May.The incident occurred in the second innings when Indian fans were chanting ""Virat Kohli"" to tease Rauf , despite Kohli's absence from the match following his retirement from the format last year. The chants were meant to remind Rauf of the 2022 T20 World Cup match at Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Kohli had hit memorable shots against him.Videos of Rauf's gesture quickly spread across social media platforms, drawing criticism from Indian supporters.The match also saw Rauf involved in a heated exchange with Indian opener Abhishek Sharma . The confrontation took place after the final ball of the fifth over when Gill hit a four through a short-arm jab.The situation required umpire Gazi Sohel's intervention to separate the players.Despite the controversies, the match saw Pakistan posting their highest T20I total against India while batting first, reaching 171/5.India successfully chased down the target, with Abhishek scoring 74 runs and Shubman Gill contributing 47 runs. Their opening partnership of 105 runs set the foundation for India's victory.",Pakistan lost 6-wicket to India in the Asia Cup Super 4s on Sunday.

Read Sridhar Vembu’s complete post here



I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time.

He said that India today offer multiple opportunities as compared to that in the past. He also adds that those willing to take this leap will ultimately benefit from it.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem. With a booming digital economy, expanding capital markets, and global companies setting up R&D hubs, India of 2025 offers fertile ground for ambitious graduates who might once have seen the US as their only path to success.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’ In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the current H-1B situation in India.

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

WATCH:

WACTH:

NEW DELHI: The high-octane India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, did not just serve up a six-wicket win for the defending champions India — it also delivered fresh controversy.Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf found himself in the middle of a storm after he taunted Indian fans with a provocative “6-0” gesture near the boundary ropes, a moment that has since gone viral on social media.The gesture, captured in multiple videos and photos, showed Rauf raising his hand to signal “6-0,” a reference to Pakistan’s unverified and politically charged claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during a four-day military scuffle following Operation Sindoor. During the match in Dubai, the pacer even acted out the motion of a crashing plane in front of the fans, further fuelling tensions.The incident unfolded while Rauf was fielding close to a packed Indian section of the crowd near the boundary rope. Fans had been chanting “Kohli, Kohli” to rile him up, a reminder of Virat Kohli’s iconic straight six off his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2022. In response, the 31-year-old pacer gestured towards them with the controversial signal, triggering loud boos from Indian supporters and sparking outrage online.The cricket, however, was dominated by India. Chasing 172, Abhishek Sharma hammered a blistering 74 off just 39 balls, including six fours and five towering sixes. His 105-run opening stand with Shubman Gill (47) laid the perfect platform, as Tilak Varma (30*) and Hardik Pandya (7*) sealed the win in 18.5 overs.While Rauf opted to gesture in a provocative manner, India's Abhishek Sharma took the other route, as he held up his hand to gesture the letter 'L'. He later explained that the 'L' stood for 'love' and that it was aimed at the Indian supporters.On-field tensions between Rauf and Indian players also flared. In the fifth over, after Gill cracked a crisp boundary, Rauf exchanged heated words with Abhishek Sharma, forcing umpire Gazi Sohel to step in. Though tempers cooled quickly, the episode added to the charged atmosphere.",Haris Rauf taunts Indian fans with provocative '6-0' gesture. Incident occurred during Pakistan vs India Asia Cup Super Four match. India beat Pakistan by six wickets in Dubai on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday raised serious concerns over the AAIB preliminary report on the June 12 Air India Crash , calling certain aspects ""irresponsible."" A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to Centre and the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) on a plea seeking an independent, fair and expeditious probe.The bench examined the July 12 preliminary report, which suggested lapses on the part of pilots in the Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who is representing the aviation safety NGO, Safety Matters Foundation led by Captain Amit Singh (FRAeS), contended that three members of the probe panel were from the aviation regulator, raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns.He also urged the court to order the release of the flight data recorder (FDR) information to clarify the cause of the accident.The plea highlighted that AAIB's preliminary report attributed the accident to the fuel cutoff switches being moved from ""run"" to ""cutoff,"" effectively implying pilot error.The plea also alleged that the report withholds critical information, including the full Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) output, complete Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) transcripts with time stamps and Electronic Aircraft Fault Recording (EAFR) data.Supreme Court stressed the issues of confidentiality, privacy and dignity while acknowledging the need for a final report. It warned that releasing certain details could be exploited by rival airlines, but clarified that its notices were limited to ensuring a free, fair, and independent investigation.","The Supreme Court on Monday raised serious concerns over the AAIB preliminary report on the June 12 Air India Crash.

Trump on Friday (US time) issued a new presidential proclamation titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers"" that introduces a major overhaul to the H-1B visa programme, imposing a steep $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, raising fresh questions about whether this is a much-needed correction or a potentially crippling blow to America's tech talent pipeline.The new fee takes effect from 12:01 am on September 21, 2025, prompting immigration attorneys and companies to advise H-1B holders or their families currently outside the US to return immediately or risk being stranded.The fee increase represents a massive jump from the current $2,000–5,000 range, sparking concerns over its impact on startups, small businesses, and Indian IT professionals.",S Jaishankar met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in New York.

Mahagathbandhan in Bihar: Will arithmetic of seat-sharing overshadow chemistry of vote yatra?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahagathbandhan-in-bihar-will-arithmetic-of-seat-sharing-overshadow-chemistry-of-vote-yatra/articleshow/124003792.cms,"Rahul Gandhi with Tejashwi Yadav and RJD Chief Lalu Prasad during the Voter Adhikar Rally in Sasaram.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

Poll Should Congress support RJD's Tejashwi Yadav as the Chief Minister candidate? Yes, he deserves it. No, Congress should lead.

Why seat-sharing deal may be a tough nut to crack?

CPI's D Raja

VIP's Mukesh Sahani

Congress's Krishna Allavaru

RJD, Congress under pressure?

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi's ""Voter Adhikar Yatra"" in Bihar was a picture-perfect show of unity - with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RJD 's Tejashwi Yadav joining hands to unleash a coordinated offensive against the Election Commission and the BJP, accusing them of stealing elections. It was a campaign that brought together all the Mahagathbandhan leaders.The chemistry between the allies was obvious and was aptly summed up by Rahul Gandhi when he asserted during the course of the yatra: ""A very strong partnership had been forged. All the parties (in the bloc) are working in sync. There's no tension, and there's mutual respect for each other as we are ideologically and politically aligned. The result will be good.""Ironically though, Rahul made this statement to evade a direct reply to a pointed question - ""Why Congress was not backing RJD's Tejashwi as CM candidate?"" Clearly, the bonhomie on display notwithstanding, the Congress leader was not willing to endorse the leadership role of the senior partner in the Bihar alliance. This despite the fact that Tejashwi had already openly proclaimed during the yatra that if the opposition is voted to power in the next Lok Sabha elections, Rahul will become the Prime Minister.Little wonder then, with the yatra over, realpolitik has taken over. The yatra bonhomie between the allies seems to have given way to pressure games as they finalise the seat-sharing deal. While claims and counterclaims by allies do point to fissures in the alliance, most of this could be posturing to extract the best deal.In the 2020 assembly elections, RJD had contested 144 seats and won 75. The Congress had the worst strike rate as it contested 70 seats but won only 19. The Left parties had performed very well five years back with the CPI-ML winning 12 out of 19 it got under seat-sharing, while CPM won 2 out of 4 and CPI 2 out of 6.This time around, there are at least three more parties joining the opposition alliance: Vikasheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, JMM and the breakaway faction of LJP - headed by Chirag's uncle.Interestingly, five years back, VIP was part of Mahagathbandhan till the seat-sharing deal was announced. While the announcement was being made, VIP's Sahni walked out of the opposition alliance and crossed over to the NDA. This time around he has sought 60 seats and the post of deputy chief minister if the alliance wins.Sample some of the statements made by the allies for a better bargain this time around, and one understands why finalising a deal may not be easy.""We will try to get more seats. If other parties are demanding, our party has a great history in Bihar and it has a widespread presence and organisational strength and our party can decide the political course in different district. So we should get reasonable number of seats.""""The Vikasheel Insaan Party will contest 60 seats in 2025, with candidates from our allied parties contesting all remaining seats.""""We have always believed that if new parties come into the alliance, then every party will have to contribute from their kitty. In every state there are good seats and bad seats (in terms of winnability) and we believe that one party should not get all the good seats and the other gets the bad ones. In the sharing of seats, there should be a balance between good and bad seats.""""Hopefully, Congress would adopt a ""more realistic"" approach in the ongoing seat-sharing talks for the upcoming assembly elections, drawing lessons from its performance in the 2020 polls when it had ""bitten off more than it could possibly chew. Maybe contesting fewer seats than last time but winning more and performing better... would be in the interest of the Congress, and definitely that of the entire INDIA bloc. ""The pressure is mostly on the RJD, which is the biggest party in the alliance and has maximum stakes. Little wonder, Tejashwi has already embarked on a solo yatra to perhaps assert his dominance in the coalition.For the Congress also, its 2020 performance is a hurdle notwithstanding the claimed gains from Rahul's 'Voter Adhikar' yatra. It remains to be seen how much the two parties are willing to compromise to accommodate the other parties. Clearly, for the Mahagathbandhan, after a smooth yatra, the road ahead appears to be bumpy.",Congress's Krishna Allavaru says the alliance is working well. But he says there is still a way to go before the coalition can be fully formed. He says the coalition should be able to win more seats than it did in the last election.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124052672,imgsize-67218,width-400,resizemode-4/overshadow.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh’s ruling Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) leader and MLA Nara Lokesh has alleged that over Rs 100 crore was stolen from the parakamani (donation box) of the Tirumala temple during the YSR Congress Party government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.Lokesh, who is also TDP’s general secretary, shared purported CCTV footage on X on Saturday, claiming it shows large-scale misappropriation of Lord Venkateswara’s offerings.“YCP thieves have looted the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara. YCP leaders are behind the ‘hundred crore Parakamani theft’. During Jagan’s five-year rule, corruption reigned supreme. Anarchy ran rampant.

The Jagan gang plundered mines, lands, forests, and all resources, along with exploiting the people... and in the end, they did not even spare the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala,” Lokesh said in his post.He also accused former Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Chairman Bhumana Karunakar Reddy of facilitating the scam and claimed that “shares of the loot” reached Tadepalli Palace, the residence of then chief minister Jagan.TTD is the official custodian of Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, the richest Hindu shrine in the world.Lokesh alleged that the stolen funds were diverted into real estate and attempts were made to “settle” the matter in a Lok Adalat. “With the backing of power, Jagan’s gang committed every possible sacrilege against Lord Venkateswara,” he added.""The sins of Jagan’s gang, the former rulers who looted the temple and its hundi, have now come to fruition.

Opposition Slams PM Modi for Skipping H-1B, Foreign Policy in ‘Old’ GST Speech

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Monday expressed surprise over Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s decision to advance his usual national address from 8 pm to 5 pm on Sunday.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Raut suggested that the timing adjustment may have been intended to allow BJP workers to watch the India vs Pakistan cricket match without disruption. He also called the prime minister’s usual 8 pm address a “standard time to mislead people.”Raut said, “The Prime Minister addressed the nation at 5 pm, which surprised everyone. His usual time is 8 pm — that’s the standard time to mislead people.”He added that the timing change appeared to be due to the India-Pakistan cricket match, as BJP workers reportedly wanted to watch it without any interruption from the Prime Minister’s address.According to Raut, the party allegedly informed the prime minister to schedule the address for 5 pm, allowing workers to follow the match — what he described as “a display of patriotism.”""BJP workers wanted to watch the India-Pakistan match, so the time was changed-- what a display of patriotism!,"" he said.During his address, PM Modi urged citizens to adopt Swadeshi practices and prioritize Made in India products, coinciding with the rollout of the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms from September 22, the first day of Shardiya Navaratri.He said, “We need to make every home a symbol of Swadeshi... every shop should be adorned with Swadeshi products.” PM Modi called the GST reforms a “Bachat Utsav” and appealed to people to purchase products made in India, highlighting the hard work of the country’s youth.The prime minister emphasised that the reforms reflect the Union Government’s “Nagrik Devo Bhava” principle and will result in substantial savings for the public.Emphasising self-reliance as the path to a developed India, PM Modi noted that the GST rate reduction would directly benefit small businesses and MSMEs.The timing of Prime Minister Modi’s address coincided with the India vs Pakistan Super Four match in the 2025 Asia Cup.

Surprisingly, leading them is Uttar Pradesh - once clubbed as a prominent member of Bimaru states - with Rs 37,000 crore surplus in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, UP is joined in the elite club by Madhya Pradesh, another member of the erstwhile sick states, with more revenue receipts than expenditu re.UP is followed by Gujarat (Rs 19,865 crore), Odisha (Rs 19,456 crore), Jharkhand (Rs 13,564 crore), Karnataka (Rs 13,496 crore), Chhattisgarh (Rs 8,592 crore), Telangana (Rs 5,944 crore), Uttarakhand (Rs 5,310 crore), Madhya Pradesh (Rs 4,091 crore) and Goa (Rs 2,399 crore).The northeastern states of Arunachal, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim are also among the states on this coveted list. Of the 16 states with revenue surplus, at least 10 are led by BJP.The report, released on Friday by CAG Sanjay Murthy, found that in 2022-23, at least 12 states were in revenue deficit. These included Andhra Pradesh (-Rs 43,488 crore), Tamil Nadu (-Rs 36,215 crore), Rajasthan (-Rs 31,491 crore), West Bengal (-Rs 27,295 crore), Punjab (-Rs 26,045 crore), Haryana (-Rs 17,212 crore), Assam (-Rs 12,072 crore), Bihar (-Rs 11,288 crore), Himachal Pradesh (-Rs 6,336 crore), Kerala (-Rs 9,226 crore), Maharashtra (-Rs 1,936 crore) and Meghalaya (-Rs 44 crore).The composition of revenue deficit states is fast changing with West Bengal, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab joining the league of those surviving on Revenue Deficit Grants from the Centre.West Bengal received the largest share of 16% grants in FY 2023 to bridge the gap between its revenue receipts and expenditure, followed by Kerala 15%, Andhra Pradesh 12%, Himachal Pradesh 11%, and Punjab 10%, CAG said.At the same time, there are states that have boosted their own revenue sources, both tax and non-tax. Haryana tops this list, having the highest own tax and non-tax revenue of over 80% of the state's total revenue. (The other revenue a state receives is through central taxes and grants). Telangana is second with over 79% of its own revenue, followed by Maharashtra 73%, Gujarat 72%, Karnataka 69%, TN 69% and Goa 68%.""In 2022-23, six states: Haryana, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Gujarat and TN had States' Own Tax Revenue (SOTR) of more than 60% of their total revenue receipts. Arunachal, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim & Tripura had SOTR of less than 20%,"" CAG noted.The share in Union taxes and grants-in-aid and central assistance, including finance commission grants, constituted 27% and about 17%, respectively, of the states' revenue receipts. States received a total of Rs 1,72,849 crore as finance commission grants, of which Rs 86,201 crore was Revenue Deficit Grants.The own revenue receipts of Karnataka, TN, Goa and Kerala are in the range of 60%-70%; and Andhra, Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh between 50% to 60%. The revenue receipts of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, UP, West Bengal and Uttarakhand are between 40%-50%.""The share of states' own tax and non-tax revenue in revenue receipts of all eight northeastern states, and Bihar and Himachal Pradesh were below 40%,"" CAG said.Among the various streams of states own revenue, a large collection comes from States' Goods and Services Tax (SGST) as well as from VAT and excise duty on alcoholic drinks, petroleum products and electricity (which are outside the GST framework).","Federal auditor CAG, in a first of its kind report on state finances, has found that 16 states are revenue surplus.

Poll Should teachers in India receive a minimum salary guarantee regardless of their employment status? Yes, every teacher deserves a minimum salary. No, salaries should depend on the institution's funding.

(Reporting by Abdul Qadir in Gaya, BK Mishra in Patna, Saeed Khan and Bharat Yagnik in Ahmedabad, Rahul Singh in Meerut, Isha Jain in Lucknow, & Mohd Dilshad in Agra)

In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer — on paper. Forty-one years later, he’s still waiting for his first salary. The appointment letter, issued by Sanjay Gandhi Mahila College in Gaya, promised pay and service conditions on par with university faculty. What followed was four decades of unpaid teaching, no employee ID, no pension — just a man showing up to class every day with a PhD and no payslip. “I taught, I evaluated papers, I invigilated exams,” he said. “But officially, it’s as if I was never there.” His only proof is a fading sheet of paper from 1983 and a lifetime of unacknowledged labour.Last month, in a sharply worded verdict, India's Supreme Court ruled that 18 assistant professors in Gujarat — hired on contract and paid far less than their regular colleagues — had been denied basic constitutional protections. The bench, led by Justice Abhay S Oka, invoked a line familiar to nearly every Indian classroom: “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara.” The words, the court said, mean little if teachers are paid a pittance. Md Aftab Alam and thousands of teachers like him would know.The truth is harder than what the verdict suggests: in places far from Gujarat, and in classrooms that do not appear in affidavits, teachers still work for Rs 3,000 a month.Or Rs 1,000. Or nothing at all.Alam lives in a rented two-room flat in Gaya (Bihar), where the plaster peels and the only reliable light comes from a window that faces the street. Every morning, he folds his PhD certificate back into a drawer, picks up the same well-thumbed books he has taught from for years, and steps out toward a college that never recognised him as its own. His wife, Shamsun Nisa, said the only income now comes from occasional evaluation and invigilation work during university exams. And a little bit of private tuition. Just enough to get by, sometimes with financial help from friends and relatives. “People think he’s too broken to teach. But he still reads. He still steps out in the morning dressed for work.”He began teaching English there in 1983, just after completing his master’s from Magadh University. Though formally hired under university-approved terms, the college denied him regular employee status. “When I asked for a salary,” he said, “they told me I was just a part-time teacher.” Magadh University, in response to an RTI application, confirmed that Alam had indeed been appointed as regular faculty. In July 2023, the state’s higher education director directed the university registrar to take necessary action. Nothing changed. “I couldn’t afford lawyers,” Alam said. “Sometimes I couldn’t afford two meals a day.”India’s education system — vast, decentralised, often romanticised — rests on people like Alam. People who carry attendance registers without knowing whether they’ll be compensated for it. People who prepare lectures, invigilate exams, sign logbooks, evaluate answer sheets, and still have to take private tuition just to afford a sack of rice. Alam is not the only one.The numbers alone tell a story that’s difficult to look away from. There are more than 10,000 teachers in 220 unaided affiliated degree colleges across Bihar. At Banwari College, commerce lecturer Deepak Kumar Singh teaches every day. His salary last year was Rs 9,000. In 2022–23, it was Rs 21,000. Before that, for four consecutive years, he received nothing. “No holidays, no leave. We come, we teach,” he said. “We mark attendance on the biometric machine like everyone else. ” The biometric scanner at the entrance does not care whether its data leads to a pay slip.Others never got even that far. Shankar Bhagat, who taught ancient Indian history in the same college, died of liver cirrhosis without treatment. Another colleague, Mukesh Kumar Mishra, is battling cancer in Muzaffarpur. His salary wasn’t enough to even consider a private hospital. “These are PhD holders,” said Arun Gautam, a senior teacher and media-in-charge of the Federation of Affiliated Degree College Teachers’ Associations of Bihar. “They teach because that’s all they know how to do. But the state hasn’t paid unaided colleges in eight years.”This neglect, over time, has ossified into routine. A 2013 policy promised performance-based grants to unaided institutions — linking funding to student outcomes. But funds were never consistently released. Today, teachers are paid, if at all, from the internal revenues of their colleges: exam fees, certificate charges, hostel deposits. Many have no formal employment letters. Some earn barely Rs 1,500 a month.In Gujarat, the disparities played out on official contracts — but the outcome was no less punishing. Between 2008 and 2014, over 450 engineers were hired as assistant professors on fixed-term contracts. Some were placed in govt engineering colleges, others in polytechnics. They were paid Rs 30,000 or Rs 25,000, and told their tenure would end once Gujarat Public Service Commission filled the sanctioned posts.Naitik Gor was among them. He joined a govt polytechnic institute in 2013. He taught 32 hours a week — nearly double the regular load — and took on the full slate of responsibilities: practicals, examinations, even election duties. “There were no vacations, no earned leave. Same job, same responsibilities, half the pay,” he said. In 2020, he walked away from academia and took a position at a private firm in Ahmedabad. “Teaching was never supposed to feel like charity.”In 2018, more than 300 contractual faculty like him went to Gujarat high court. They argued that the disparity in pay violated Articles 14, 15, 16 and 19 of the Constitution. In 2023, a single-judge bench agreed, calling it a “crying shame” that qualified lecturers, appointed by due process, were still kept on ad hoc contracts. The state appealed. Two division benches rejected its argument. A third overturned the decision. The matter reached Supreme Court.The apex court has now ruled in the petitioners’ favour. Gujarat govt has been ordered to pay arrears with 8% interest from 2015, and to align these teachers with the pay scale of regular assistant professors. But much of the damage is already done. Gor said most of the original petitioners had left teaching. “We waited years for that verdict. When it finally came, only 44 of us were still in the classroom.”The erosion is not just economic — it is emotional, generational, institutional. Siksha Mitras — guest teachers recruited in large numbers in the early 2000s — were briefly regularised in 2015, drawing salaries of Rs 50,000. Two years later, the decision was reversed. Their salaries dropped back to Rs 10,000. “We were promoted, then demoted,” said Meenu Goswami, a Siksha Mitra in Bulandshahr, UP, who lives with a leg disability. “We’ve been doing the same work as govt teachers who earn Rs 65,000 or more. But they said we don’t deserve it.” She recounted at least a dozen suicides among demoted teachers in her district. “Some had loans, others lost homes. The salary cut killed them.”Shaily Sharma spent five years teaching at a small school in Amroha. She holds a postgraduate degree and a BEd. By 2015, she had become principal. Her salary was Rs 4,500 a month. “I loved the work,” she said. “But love doesn’t pay rent.” She left teaching in 2016. She hasn’t returned.Teachers in Lucknow’s top-tier schools — the ones with tall gates and English-medium boards — might earn Rs 60,000 or more. But those are few. Most private school teachers, even at well-known institutions, are paid Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. “Even the fancy schools don't offer more,” said Atul Srivastava, president of the Association of Private Schools, UP. “Fees are low, CSR support is absent, govt help is negligible. Everyone wants good teachers, but no one wants to pay them.”The longer-term effects are showing across Uttar Pradesh. Since 2021, there has been no recruitment of govt school teachers. Thousands of schools now run entirely on guest faculty. “There’s no pipeline anymore,” said Dinesh Sharma, president of the Uttar Pradesh Primary Teachers’ Association. “People are migrating to other states — Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh. They’ve given up hope here.”The National Education Policy 2020 promised to restore dignity to the teaching profession. It called for better pay, regularisation, and a clear career path. In theory, it still does. In hundreds and thousands of classrooms in the country, though, it's cruel fiction. Ask Aftab Alam, who still walks to the college, notes in hand, and still dresses like a teacher. One with empty pockets and lost youth.","In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer — on paper. Forty-one years later, he’s still waiting for his first salary. Alam is not the only one. There are more than 10,000 teachers in 220 unaided affiliated degree colleges across Bihar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124033063,imgsize-250872,width-400,resizemode-4/appointed-ignored-unpaid-meet-indias-invisible-teachers.jpg"

RUDRAPUR: A man from Udham Singh Nagar who had recently travelled to Russia for higher studies was allegedly coerced into joining the Russian army and sent to the war front in Ukraine, his family said, adding they have had no contact with him since early Sept and are now desperate for help. The family of Rakesh Kumar, 30, has written to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), sought support from the Indian embassy in Moscow, and approached local officials in a bid to bring him back home.Rakesh, a resident of Kushmoth village in Shaktifarm under Sitarganj tehsil, had left for Russia on Aug 7 after securing admission to St Petersburg University on a study visa. However, within a few days, he began hinting at being in a troubling situation, suggesting things were not going as planned.His elder brother, Deepu Maurya, said the last time they had a direct conversation was on Aug 30, when Rakesh informed them that he had been forcibly drafted into the Russian army and would soon be deployed to the war zone in Ukraine. After that call, his phone went unreachable. The family later received a photo of Rakesh in a Russian military uniform, which only heightened their fears and confirmed their worst suspicions.A few days later, Rakesh called again, this time from an unfamiliar Russian number. In a short and distressed conversation, he told them that his passport and personal documents had been seized, his official emails had been deleted, and that he had undergone military training in the Donbas region before being sent to the battlefield. That was the last they heard from him.""We do not even know if he is alive. We just want the govt to bring him back home safely,"" said Deepu. The family wrote to MEA on Sept 5 and has also reached out to elected representatives and the local administration.This is not the first such case to surface in recent months.

Khalistani Outfit Threatens To 'Siege' Indian Consulate In Vancouver; Targets New Envoy

Gosal allegedly planned violence at Indian consulates in Canada

Inderjit Singh Gosal, who took over Canada's Khalistan referendum campaign after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing, is learned to have been arrested by Canadian police. Gosal is also the Canada coordinator for terror group Sikhs for Justice and has links with Babbar Khalsa International, also a designated terror outfit.The action comes shortly after India's national security adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart, Nathalie Drouin, held talks in Delhi last week.The arrest - made on multiple firearms charges - signals a shift from Canada's previous approach.Gosal was also an accused in the case of violence at the temple in the Greater Toronto Area last year but was let off after a brief detention. Ties nosedived after the killing of Nijjar, a wanted terrorist, as former Canadian PM Justin Trudeau accused Indian agencies of masterminding it. In Oct last year, India said it was pulling out its high commissioner and five other diplomats due to Ottawa's attempt to link them to the Nijjar case. It also expelled many Canadian diplomats.Gosal came to the forefront of anti-India activities in Canada and campaigned aggressively for Khalistan referendum. Multiple instances of confrontations were reported as pro-Khalistan activists sought to get other Sikhs to sign off on their secessionist agenda.Gosal even acted as one of the personal security officers to SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu during his visits to Canada. He was also allegedly involved in the planning of the violence at Indian consulate establishments in Canada.A few months ago, he had revealed that Canadian police had asked him to be ""careful"" against a possible hit. Canadian police had also subsequently claimed that Gosal was among the 13 citizens of the country who were targets of criminal violence aimed at pro-Khalistan elements. ""As a result of being the organiser of Khalistan referendum, I am facing an imminent threat to my life from the agents and proxies of the govt of India but I have to continue. .."" he told a Canadian new website.","Inderjit Singh Gosal took over Canada's Khalistan referendum campaign after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.

Counsel for the accused sought interim bail at the earliest, saying they had been in jail for five years.Student activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider, Gulfisha Fatima and Shifa Ur Rehman, facing charges under UAPA in the Delhi riots larger conspiracy case, cited SC's earlier ruling to seek bail as they have been in jail for five years and there is no likelihood of the trial concluding within reasonable time.Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal told the bench that it was a shocking case where students are in jail for more than five years and urged that the court should first grant them interim bail. The bench, however, said it would hear and decide finally the main petition.Sibal further submitted that an early date be given in the case and pressed for early listing. ""Before Diwali, so that they can be out by Diwali.They are all there for more than five years,"" he said. Accepting his request, the court posted the case to Oct 7.All the petitioners have raised similar grounds to get bail and invoked the apex court's earlier ruling. ""It is humbly submitted that on consideration of the long duration of incarceration as well as the bail restricting provision of several other special Acts, it has been consistently laid down by this court in a plethora of judgments that in cases where there is no likelihood of conclusion of trial within a reasonable time, the rigors of statutory restrictions should melt down and the constitutional courts should weigh in favour of granting bail in such matters,"" said the petition filed by Imam.They said that materials or overt acts as alleged by police are extremely weak and flimsy, warranting interference by this court. Referring to SC's last year verdict in the 'Javed Gulam Nabi Shaikh vs State of Maharashtra' case on grant of bail in UAPA cases, they said over-arching postulate of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty cannot be brushed aside lightly, howsoever stringent the penal law may be.""If the state or any prosecuting agency, including the court concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution then the state or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. The article of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime,"" the court had said in its verdict.It had further held that the presence of statutory restrictions like Section 43-D(5) of the UAPA per se does not oust the ability of the constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of Part-III of the Constitution (pertaining to fundamental rights).The accused approached SC, challenging a Delhi HC order which denied bail to the activists and four others. Rejecting their bail plea, HC had said that any ""conspiratorial violence"" under the guise of freedom of speech of citizens could not be allowed. ""Such actions must be regulated and checked by the state machinery as they do not fall within the ambit of freedom of speech, expression and association,"" an HC bench of Justices Navin Chawla and Shalinder Kaur had said.Besides the activits, the others who were denied bail include Mohd Saleem Khan, Athar Khan, Abdul Khalid Saifi and Shadab Ahmed.

""Releasing FDR data would enable independent experts to analyse it and help reach a logical conclusion,"" he said.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh said selective release would enable all these experts to sit in podcasts and give their opinion, running many parallel theories. Bhushan then questioned the fairness of the investigation, saying the five-member probe team included three DGCA officers, which could also be under scrutiny for not carrying out regular safety checks on aircraft under the airlines.The NGO said, ""The preliminary report is incomplete, selective, and lacking in transparency, thereby undermining credibility of the investigative process and the trust of the travelling public.

While on the spot, both the approach roads were not more than six metres, and the width of the main approach road was only about four metres,"" Husain added.The trust secretary said he had not received any communication about any NOC or rejection.

CJM directs Kathua SSP to file FIR over alleged custodial torture of two Punjab labourers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cjm-directs-kathua-ssp-to-file-fir-over-alleged-custodial-torture-of-two-punjab-labourers/articleshow/124056308.cms,"Representative image

JAMMU: A magisterial court in Jammu’s Kathua district has directed the SSP to register an FIR in connection with the alleged custodial torture of two Punjab labourers at a police station in Basohli town.While disposing of an application filed by the aggrieved labourers, Sukar Deen and Fareed Mohammad, both residents of Chibber village in Pathankot district, chief judicial magistrate Ajay Kumar directed the SSP to entrust the investigation to an experienced and independent police officer, and submit a report to the court on the action taken within a week of receiving a copy of the order. The CJM noted that the police personnel involved appeared to have been given a clean chit after a perfunctory inquiry, “whereas investigation can be done in a case only after the registration of FIR”.The two accused were picked up from Atal Setu in Basohli on June 29 by a police team led by sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Suresh Kumar and booked under BNS sections 132 (assaulting or using criminal force against public servants to prevent them from performing their duty), 221 (obstructing public servants in discharge of public functions) and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), among other provisions.A PIL was also filed on behalf of the duo on July 15, seeking initiation of contempt of court proceedings against 11 police personnel for their “wilful defiance” of the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the D K Basu & Anr vs State of West Bengal — which laid down guidelines to be followed while making arrests/detentions — aimed at curbing custodial violence.Taking a serious view of the matter, the J&K high court on July 21 issued notices to 11 police personnel, including Basohli SDPO Suresh Kumar and SHO Geetanjli."," magisterial court in Jammu’s Kathua district has directed the SSP to register an FIR in connection with the alleged custodial torture of two Punjab labourers.

India extends ban on NSCN(K) for five years amidst ongoing violence and insurgency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-extends-ban-on-nscnk-for-five-years-amidst-ongoing-violence-and-insurgency/articleshow/124051820.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday declared the rebel Naga outfit, National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) or NSCN(K), as an ‘unlawful assocation’ for a further period of five years in view of its continuing violent activities and alignment with other insurgent groups and anti-India forces based abroad, in furtherance of its secessionist agenda.“The Central government is of the opinion that the aforesaid activities of NSCN (K) are detrimental to the sovereignty and integrity of India and if these are not immediately curbed and controlled, the NSCN (K) may further regroup and rearm itself, expand its cadres, procure sophisticated weapons, cause loss of lives of civilians and security forces and thereby accelerate its anti-national activities,” the home ministry stated in the notification extending the ban on NSCN(K) and all its fronts under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.The home ministry said NSCN(K)’s declared aim is to create a sovereign Nagaland incorporating the Naga inhabited areas of Indo-Myanmar region by secession from the Indian Union, for which it has aligned itself with other unlawful associations like the ULFA(I), PREPAK and PLA. Also, it continues to indulge in kidnapping for ransom and extortion of money from businessmen, government officials and other civilians, and possesses illegal arms and ammunition.The outfit has obtained assistance from anti-India forces in other countries to procure arms and other assistance, it added.Justifying the five-year extension of the ban, the ministry said that in the period between Sept 28, 2020 and April 30, 2025, 13 NSCN(K) underground cadres were killed by the security forces; 71 cases registered against its cadres, 56 chargesheets filed and 35 cadres prosecuted; 51 cadres found to be involved in criminal activities; and 85 cadres arrested and 69, surrendered. Also, huge caches of arms including 69 weapons, 931 live rounds of ammunition, IEDs and 800 gm explosives etc, were recovered from its hideouts.“The Central government, having regard to the unlawful activities mentioned above, is further of the opinion that circumstances exist which render it necessary to declare the NSCN (K) along with all its factions, wings and front organisations to be an unlawful association with immediate effect from the September 28, 2025...for a period of five years,” MHA said in the notification.","The Centre on Monday declared the rebel Naga outfit, National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) or NSCN(K), as an ‘unlawful assocation’ for a further period of five years.

Land rights and Sixth Schedule at the core



Hunger strike, misinformation triggered violence



Talks announced, arson continues



Internet suspended to prevent escalation



CM monitors situation, appeals for calm



NEW DELHI: Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region entered the third day on Wednesday, leaving two people dead, dozens injured, and prompting the state government to impose curfew-like restrictions and suspend mobile internet services in two districts.The violence erupted in West Karbi Anglong and adjoining Karbi Anglong district after long simmering tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. One tribal protester died in police action, while a non tribal man was killed in a fire that gutted several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has emerged as the epicentre of the unrest, police said.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured after protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces. The DGP and IGP Law and Order Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those injured during the clashes.Police said protesters attempted to take control of a bridge in the area and turned violent when stopped.“Today, they tried to take over the bridge, and when we tried to stop them, they attacked us. Crude bombs and stones were thrown. I was attacked with bows and arrows,” Singh said, adding that the police have video footage and will take legal action against those responsible.The protests are rooted in opposition by the Karbi community to what they allege is illegal encroachment by non tribal settlers on professional grazing reserve and village grazing reserve lands.The districts fall under the Karbi Anglong autonomous council, governed by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which grants tribal regions autonomy over land, forests and local governance to protect indigenous communities.Residents have for over a year demanded eviction of alleged encroachers, saying unchecked settlement threatens tribal land rights.Tensions intensified after members of the Karbi community launched a hunger strike on December 6. The situation spiralled on Tuesday after police shifted some fasting protesters to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital due to deteriorating health.According to police, misinformation spread that a protest leader had been arrested, triggering anger and violence.“A huge crowd has gathered here since yesterday. I met the protestors and spoke with them. Last night, their leader was taken to Guwahati for a medical check-up as the doctors thought that his health was deteriorating because of the hunger strike. Still, someone spread misinformation that he is being arrested. Violence does not get anything for anybody,” DGP Harmeet Singh told reporters.State cabinet minister Ranoj Pegu, who met protesters at Kheroni earlier, said the group agreed to call off the hunger strike and participate in tripartite talks on December 26 involving the state government and the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council.“We assured the Karbi community that the government is serious about land rights and other tribal issues,” Pegu said, adding that discussions would address “broader issues related to existence of Karbi community.”Despite the assurance of talks, violence continued through the day, with shops and markets in Kheroni set ablaze. Police said a special investigation team has been formed and video footage is being examined to identify those involved in arson and attacks.In response to the deteriorating law and order situation, the Assam government on Tuesday ordered suspension of internet and mobile data services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts with immediate effect.“It is, however, clarified that the voice calls and the broadband connectivity based on fixed telephone lines shall remain functional during this period. Any violation of the promulgation will be punishable under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and also under the relevant provision of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,” said Biswajit Pegu, Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political Department.The government said district magistrates warned that social media could be used to spread inflammatory messages and rumours, further aggravating tensions.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said he was closely monitoring the situation and announced deployment of additional forces in Kheroni, about 250 km east of Guwahati.“It is deeply painful that two persons lost their lives during today’s unrest,” Sarma said in a post on X, offering condolences to the families of the deceased and assuring all possible support.Authorities said efforts are under way to restore calm, urging community leaders to restrain youths and prevent further violence ahead of the scheduled talks later this week.","Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam enter third day.

ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

ISRO on Wednesday successfully launched a next-generation US communication satellite BlueBird Block-2 onboard its heaviest vehicle LVM3-M6. The mission, LVM3-M6, carried the BlueBird Block-2 satellite of US-based AST SpaceMobile under a dedicated commercial agreement.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed flawlessly. Around 15 minutes into the flight, BlueBird Block-2 was successfully separated and placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, prompting ISRO to declare the mission a success.BlueBird Block-2 is the heaviest payload ever launched into low Earth orbit by the LVM3, making the mission a first of its kind for the Indian launch vehicle. The satellite forms part of AST SpaceMobile’s global LEO constellation aimed at providing direct-to-mobile connectivity, enabling 4G and 5G voice calls, video, messaging and data services on standard smartphones without specialised hardware.The launch was undertaken through NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), ISRO’s commercial arm, as part of its agreement with AST SpaceMobile. ISRO said the mission marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3, which has previously launched Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and multiple OneWeb satellite missions.","ISRO on Wednesday successfully launched a next-generation US communication satellite BlueBird Block-2 onboard its heaviest vehicle LVM3-M6.

How do you see the political and economic ties between India and the Netherlands in the context of what’s happening in the rest of the world?

How do you see the

India EU FTA

strengthening this relationship with the Netherlands and India?

Do you see the Netherlands emerging as a major destination for Indian students?

Which are the sectors where cooperation can begin in the near future?

How do you see the situation in Europe in the context of the Ukraine war? Do you expect the war to end soon and what are the implications for the region?

n Ties have always been strong, for example in field of water and agriculture, but also the large companies of the Netherlands that have always been active here in India, like Philips. The recent geopolitical developments give an extra impetus to the importance of our ties. That’s what my visit was also about to see how in specific areas we can do more. We now have a letter of intent in the field of security and defence where we’re looking at more intensive cooperation. We also signed an MoU in the field of semiconductors and modern technologies. We are very like minded countries, we are democracies, we are countries that believe in the international rule of law in free trade and those countries need to stick together.n It’s not easy to have a FTA with the EU because you have 27 completely different countries with different economies and different interests. It is in all of our interest to reach an agreement with India on an FTA soon for same reasons I mentioned earlier. We believe in same values, same norms. We are all democracies and we have a lot to offer to each other.n Already there are many Indian students in the Netherlands, and not only students, but also technical students that after their studies found work, in one of our high tech companies like ASML.I heard that there were around 10 cricket clubs now around Eindhoven. That’s testimony to the great relationship that we already have in that field. We also have a very large Indian diaspora in the Netherlands . We are a society where Indians feel at home, where they thrive and contribute to our economy and society.n In the field of semiconductors, I visited one of the Dutch companies here, which is called NXP, which is a spin off of Philips and they do design and production of high end mobility chips. They already design most of its high end chips here in India. This company is providing over 3,000 jobs here in India working on the high end of the semiconductor industry. We want to invest more in R&D together, we want to put more effort in talent development. There’s a big wish on the Indian side to also have more in the production facilities of semiconductors. There’s a broader basis that we already can build on with regards to semiconductors.n We all want this war to end soon. It’s been going on for almost four years at an incredible cost for Ukraine, but also for Russia. We all hope that we will soon reach a ceasefire and hopefully a durable peace agreement. That’s why Europe is actively engaging in the negotiations that are now ongoing, led by the US and where we see that Ukraine is willing to come to the table and reach a deal and an agreement, and we hope that Moscow will do so too.","Ties have always been strong, for example in field of water and agriculture.

'Frame charges against Karti in Chinese visa scam',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/frame-charges-against-karti-in-chinese-visa-scam/articleshow/126150988.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday ordered framing of charges against Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram and six others in connection with a visa scam, holding that prime facie, a case was made out against them for criminal conspiracy and illegal gratification. The court, however, discharged the eighth accused, Chetan Shrivastava, after concluding that there was ""no material evidence"" on record against him.CBI had filed a chargesheet in Oct 2024 against Karti and the others, alleging bribery in facilitating visas for Chinese nationals for a power company, Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL), in 2011, when his father P Chidambaram was Union home minister.Special CBI judge Dig Vinay Singh of Rouse Avenue courts observed that there was enough material to proceed against the Sivaganga MP and six other accused for offences including criminal conspiracy, demand and receipt of bribe, destruction of evidence, and related charges. The judge noted the materials placed before the court pointed to 'coordinated acts' by the accused.Besides Karti, others chargesheeted in the case included his close associate S Bhaskararaman, TSPL and Mumbai-based Bell Tools Ltd, through which the bribe was routed.The court held that at the present stage of framing the charges, the statement of approver Vikas Makharia, who was the associate vice-president of TSPL, had to be accepted at face value and it could be examined during the trial.It further observed that the conspiracy between Karti and Bhaskararaman was evident, based on the evidence collected during the investigation.Tracing the sequence of events, the court noted that Makharia approached Karti through Bhaskararaman in Chennai seeking 800 additional project visas for TSPL, believing that he had access to home ministry.Bhaskararaman dema-nded and received a bribe of Rs 50 lakh. Subsequently, the approver (Makharia) telephonically thanked Ch-idambaram, who affirmed receipt of the amount.The court noted that although explicit words such as ""payment"" or ""money"" were avoided during the call, the acknowledgement was recorded. The court rejected the submissions made by Karti that he had ""not read the emails"" relied upon by the prosecution, or that there was ""no substantiated proof"" of a meeting in Chennai or any telephonic conversation.CBI had registered an FIR in the case in 2022. According to the agency, TSPL, a subsidiary of Vedanta, had outsourced work to a Chinese firm for its 1,980 MW thermal power plant coming up in Punjab. With the project facing penalties because of delays, the facilitation was sought for re-use of project visas, since there was a ceiling on project visas permissible for a company's plant. The FIR said there was no provision for the re-issue of project visas.","A Delhi court ordered framing of charges against Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram and six others in connection with a visa scam.

Mathura man gets life for raping 13-year-old mentally challenged girl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mathura-man-gets-life-for-raping-13-year-old-mentally-challenged-girl/articleshow/126150954.cms,".

AGRA: A 34-year-old man from Mathura has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a 13-year-old mentally challenged girl. Special public prosecutor Rampal Singh said the incident came to light late on the night of Jan 19, 2024, when the girl’s mother woke up around 2am and found her daughter missing. “The family searched the area and, around 3.45am, spotted the girl walking back home with multiple injury marks and bleeding,” Singh said.The parents immediately took her to the local police station, where her father lodged an FIR against an unknown person under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and provisions of the Pocso Act. A subsequent medical examination confirmed that the minor, who was a Class 5 student at the time, had been raped.Later, in a statement given before the magistrate, recorded under CrpC section 164, the girl identified the accused, a neighbour, and said he had threatened to kill her if she disclosed the incident. Police then scanned footage from nearby CCTV cameras, traced the accused and arrested him three days later.He has remained behind bars since. Police also found that he had at least six criminal cases registered against him, including those related to criminal intimidation and rioting. While delivering the verdict on Monday, the special Pocso court of judge Brijesh Kumar-II in Mathura observed that the crime was “heinous in nature, particularly as it involved a minor with learning difficulties, and warranted the maximum punishment under the law”. It also imposed a fine of Rs 1.1 lakh on the convict, directing that the entire amount be paid to the girl’s family for her rehabilitation.In case of non-payment, the convict will have to undergo an additional year of imprisonment.","A 34-year-old man from Mathura has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a mentally challenged girl.

The 64-km track, on which trains will be tested at a speed of 220 kmph, is being developed in Jodhpur division in Rajasthan with an investment of Rs 967 crore.Railway officials said the stretch is being built in two phases between Gudha and Thathana Mithri, around 70 km from Jaipur. They added that approximately 58 km of the track has been completed.“With the construction of this track, India will be the first country to have comprehensive testing facilities for rolling stock, meeting international standards as per UIC-518/EN-14363 (key railway standards defining methods for testing and approval of rolling stock dynamics). This track will be a unique one globally, as most test tracks currently available elsewhere are shorter than its length,” said an official.The track will provide testing facilities for high-speed rolling stock manufactured worldwide. Comprehensive testing facilities for high-speed rolling stock and components, including speed testing, stability, safety parameters, crash resistance and rolling stock quality, are being developed under this project, as per officials.The dedicated test track will also ensure the testing of track materials, bridges, traction distribution equipment, signalling gear and geotechnical studies.The dedicated test track has seven major bridges, 129 minor bridges and four stations. With its operationalisation, trials can be conducted for a high-speed train passing curved sections without slowing down. Of these curves, some are made for lower speed and some for high speed.","Indian Railways ’ first dedicated high-speed test track is expected to be complete by March 2026.

Sheikh Hasina Slams Yunus Over Violence In Bangladesh, Calls Out 'Hostile Statements Against India'

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.","Sheikh Hasina slams interim government over death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi.

Cyber thugs posed as wealth mgmt advisors: Former IPS officer in note

PATIALA: Former Punjab Police IG Amar Singh Chahal , 66, is battling for life after a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest at his Patiala home on Monday. Police say he shot himself with his gunman’s licenced revolver.This is the second such incident involving an IPS officer in the region after Haryana ADG Y Puran Kumar shot himself dead with his gunman’s pistol at his Chandigarh home in Oct.A12-page handwritten note found on the scene details how ex-IG Chahal was cheated of Rs 8.1 crore in a “highly sophisticated” online investment fraud that operated through WhatsApp and Telegram under the name ‘F-777 DBS Wealth Equity Research Group’. It falsely claimed regulatory approvals and links with well-known financial institutions, the note says.Police are investigating the allegations. It’s a disturbing indicator of how deeply such scams have penetrated society and can trap even those who are seemingly aware of the baits and lures.Patiala SP Palwinder Singh Cheema said one of Chahal’s friends alerted police that he may have attempted suicide after getting a message from him.A police team rushed to his house in ‘26-Acre’ locality around 1.45pm and found him unconscious, with a bullet wound to the chest. A revolver lay close by. He was breathing, say police sources. Chahal’s son and daughter-in-law were in another room during the incident, say police.“Chahal is undergoing treatment in hospital and his condition is critical,” said Patiala SSP Varun Sharma. Late evening, Cheema said Chahal had undergone surgery and was on recovery mode but the next 24 hours will be crucial. “Our immediate priority is his treatment. We are also preserving evidence and examining the allegations mentioned in the note,” said Cheema.Police said Chahal, a 1990batch IPS officer, had not filed any complaint regarding the alleged fraud. According to officials who have seen the note, Chahal wrote that he was cheated by cyber criminals who posed as wealth management advisors.Chahal describes in the note how fraudsters posing as ‘senior executives and advisors’ of the firm gradually gained the confidence of investors by offering daily market tips, simulated dashboards and purportedly highreturn investment products. He alleged that the scheme progressed through multiple stages — daily trading, initial public offerings, over-thecounter trades and so-called quantitative funds — each promising escalating returns.Chahal claimed that as confidence grew, investors were encouraged to deposit larger sums while “planted participants” vouched for the scheme’s authenticity whenever doubts were raised. But when he sought to withdraw funds, he was asked to pay hefty service charges, taxes and membership fees, and was even coaxed into paying an alleged bribe to expedite withdrawals, says the note. Despite making repeated payments, no money was released.The former IG said that he had written to the Prime Minister, Union home minister and Union finance minister, seeking intervention. He urged authorities to constitute an SIT or hand the case to a central agency, arguing that only a specialised probe could “dismantle what the nationwide cyber-fraud network”.He has listed multiple bank accounts through which transfers were allegedly made and claimed that while about Rs 1 crore was his own money, more than Rs 7 crore was borrowed from friends and relatives. In his note, he expressed deep remorse and fear about the financial and emotional impact on his family, while repeatedly stating that no one else should be held responsible for his actions.The note also appealed for protection and assistance for his family and requested that creditors refrain from pressuring them.Chahal had preserved screenshots of dashboards, transaction records and chat histories, which he referenced in the note. Investigators are tracing the alleged transactions and examining the digital evidence he cited.Residents of Patiala and former colleagues described Chahal as a capable officer, who empathised with farmers’ issues and concerns of the Sikh community.","Former Punjab Police IG Amar Singh Chahal, 66, is battling for life after a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest at his Patiala home on Monday.

Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted,” a notice pasted outside the mission said.The move comes days after India temporarily shut its visa application centre in Chattogram until further notice, following protest by scores of demonstrators outside the Assistant High Commission of India in the port city, the neighbouring country’s second-largest.Though New Delhi–Dhaka ties have been tense since the August 2024 ouster of Bangladesh’s then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a student-led movement, the latest tensions were triggered by the fatal shooting of youth politician Sharif Osman Hadi, with a section of Bangladesh’s political class blaming India.Hasina, meanwhile, has been living in New Delhi since being forced to resign and flee.In a press release on Sunday, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry described the protest outside its high commission the previous day as “regrettable,” adding that the incident cannot be dismissed as “misleading propaganda”—a phrase used by the Ministry of External Affairs in a statement rejecting the way Bangladeshi media portrayed the demonstration.Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s Prothom Alo reported that the country’s visa centre in Siliguri, West Bengal, was “vandalised” during a protest over the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das, the Hindu man who was attacked by a mob accusing him of blasphemy.According to the report, a five-member delegation from the roughly 300 demonstrators entered the visa office and told the staff to keep it closed as a “form of protest.”A decision on reopening the facility will be made after the situation is ""closely monitored.""","Bangladesh suspends consular and visa services at its high commission in New Delhi.

(With inputs from agencies)

Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], December 23 (ANI): The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the Association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the Association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh. We request the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to urgently take up this matter with the Government of Bangladesh and seek firm assurances for the security, dignity, and well-being of our students.""The Association also appealed for evacuation if the situation worsens, stating, ""If the situation of tension and violence continues or worsens, the Government of India should kindly consider making arrangements to evacuate and bring back Indian students safely to India, so that no young life is put at risk. Timely evacuation, if required, will go a long way in preventing any untoward incident and in reassuring anxious families across the country. ""Reposing faith in the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Association said, ""India has always stood by its citizens abroad in times of crisis.

NEW DELHI: The sister of the Unnao rape survivor on Tuesday criticised the Delhi high court for granting bail to convict and former BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspending his life sentence in the case.The woman alleged that Sengar’s release would endanger her family’s lives.""I am not happy about this. He killed my uncle and then my father. Then this incident happened with my sister. He has been released, but we're still in danger. He killed my uncle and then my father. He (Sengar) has been released, but we're still in danger,"" she told news agency ANI.The woman added that while the court may have released Sengar, it should at least put her family behind bars for their “safety.”“My sister is in distress. If something happens to my family, will the court take responsibility? I have a brother—who knows what they might do to him? Many of his men are roaming around outside, threatening us. If we dare file a police complaint, they will kill us. That is why we do not leave our home out of fear,” she said.Earlier on Tuesday, a Delhi high court bench comprising Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar granted conditional bail to Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspended his sentence for the duration of the pendency of his appeal challenging his December 2019 conviction and life sentence by a trial court.The conditions of his bail include furnishing a Rs 15-lakh personal bond with three sureties of the same amount, not entering within a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence, and refraining from threatening or influencing her or her mother.On August 1, 2019, over two years after the ghastly June 2017 crime, the Supreme Court had transferred the rape case and other related matters from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.Sengar’s appeal against his conviction in the case relating to the custodial death of the survivor’s father is also pending before the high court.

NEW DELHI: Fresh violence was reported from Assam’s trouble-torn Karbi Anglong district for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, with at least eight people injured as a clash between two groups of protestors prompted police to resort to lathi-charge and tear-gas shelling to disperse them, officials said.In response, the state government temporarily suspended internet services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts.The clash broke out after a group, including women and children whose shops were burnt by a mob on Monday, came out to protest against the initial violence. Meanwhile, agitators demanding the eviction of encroachers from the tribal belt also gathered in the Kheroni market area.Both sides were agitated, and security forces initially tried to pacify them. However, the situation escalated when the two groups began pelting stones at each other, injuring several protesters, police personnel and media persons covering the incident.As the situation spiralled out of control, police resorted to lathi-charge and later fired tear gas shells to disperse the two groups.The situation remains ""tense"" in the area, and additional forces have been rushed to the spot.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma described the situation in Karbi Anglong as “very sensitive.”“Senior minister Ranoj Pegu is present in the district. I believe the matter will be resolved soon,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a programme.The violence occurred despite prohibitory orders being in force in the area.Earlier on Tuesday, protesters called off their hunger strike demanding the eviction of encroachers from tribal belt areas following talks with Pegu, the state education minister.The agitators, representing several political and social organisations, had been on a hunger strike for the past 15 days, pressing for the eviction of illegal settlers.After Pegu held discussions with the protesters, they withdrew the hunger strike following assurances from the government that tripartite talks on the issue would be held soon.Pegu also assured them that CM Sarma would also be present at the meeting.On Monday, four people were injured in police firing after protesters went on a rampage, setting ablaze the residence of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) chief executive Member Tuliram Ronghang and around 15 shops in Kheroni Bazaar.The mob also attempted to attack the local police station but was thwarted by security forces.Following the violence, Sarma indicated that rumours had circulated claiming three hunger-striking protesters had been arrested, which led others to become “agitated.”“No one has been arrested. They were taken to Guwahati for treatment as their health deteriorated,” he clarified.The protesters are demanding the eviction of “encroachers,” most of whom they claim hail from Bihar, from Professional Grazing Reserve (PGR) and Village Grazing Reserve (VGR) lands in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong.",At least eight people injured in fresh violence in Assam's trouble-torn Karbi Anglong district.

NEW DELHI: Delhi lieutenant governor VK Saxena on Tuesday wrote to former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, holding his government responsible for the capital's deteriorating air quality.In a 15-page letter, LG Saxena said, “11 years of neglect and criminal inaction on you and your Government’s part are responsible for the emergency air situation in the Capital”.However, Delhi is currently governed by BJP chief minister Rekha Gupta.Delhi LG’s letter to the former chief minister comes against the backdrop of the capital’s persistent and severe air pollution crisis.On Delhi LG VK Saxena's letter to Kejriwal, AAP national media incharge Anurag Dhandha said, ""Has the LG, who left Delhi amidst all the pollution to go to Gujarat for his own pleasure, returned? I think the pollution affecting people's lungs in Delhi has affected the LG's brain, and he's lost his memory.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday again addressed a press conference amid outrage over the ""new definition"" of the Aravali range, saying that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Speaking on the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of Aravalli, the minister said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He futher highlighted the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and international recognition of India’s forest cover, saying that under the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".Addressing concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The query related to the Supreme Court of India’s recent acceptance of a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.Following the apex court’s acceptance that any landform located in the Aravali districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief would be classified as Aravali Hills, some stakeholders expressed apprehension that the move could open more than 90% of the Aravalis to mining, as most landforms lie below the 100-metre mark.","Bhupender Yadav: ""No new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"" Supreme Court accepted a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126121988,imgsize-57824,width-400,resizemode-4/quotmining-possible-only-in-019-area-process-now-stricterquot-environment-minister-bhupender-yadav-backs-new-aravalli-norms.jpg"

Exactly one year after a special audit committee concluded that the pharma company AbbVie violated the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices by spending almost Rs 2 crore to sponsor luxury vacations abroad for 30 doctors, no action has been taken. The ethics board of the National Medical Commission (NMC), that is supposed to take up the complaint against the doctors, is empty barring one part-time member.After the findings of the special audit committee constituted by the department of pharmaceuticals, on the basis of an anonymous complaint, an apex committee conducted hearings to give the company a chance to defend itself. After hearing the company, this committee also concluded that there was “no justifiable reason for 30 healthcare professionals to journey abroad to Monaco and Paris” to gain knowledge about simple procedures in medical aesthetics, such as administration of “Botox and Juvederm”. “Such medical interventions are widely recognized as a lucrative commercial service and evidence attached to the complaint links healthcare professionals directly to the sale, purchase, or administration of such aesthetic products of M/s AbbVie,” stated the apex committee.In its order dated December 23, 2024, the committee let off Abbvie with just a reprimand for unethical marketing practices while asking the NMC to take action against 30 offending healthcare professionals as per the ethics code for doctors.However, the department of pharmaceuticals had not sent the names of the accused doctors to the NMC till June this year and their names are yet to be made public.In response to an RTI query the NMC revealed on December 17 that the five-member ethics and medical registration board (EMRB), which would have to hear the complaint against the doctors and decide what action is to be taken, is empty barring a part-time member. According to the health ministry’s response in Parliament on March 18 this year, the posts of the EMRB president had been vacant since June 2022 (now three-and-a-half years), and that of two whole time members since September 2022 and September 2024. In its reply, the NMC stated that “the statutory posts in NMC are filled by the central government/ministry of health and family welfare”.","AbbVie violated the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices by spending almost Rs 2 crore to sponsor luxury vacations abroad for 30 doctors.

Our talks centred around how expeditiously this commitment can be delivered,” said the minister.He said the assistance will cover the sectors worst affected by the cyclone — including rehabilitation and restoration of road, railway and bridge connectivity; support for construction of houses, health, education systems, and agriculture; and better disaster response.“We are conscious that work towards mitigating the impact of Cyclone Ditwah on people of Sri Lanka must be done in the quickest time possible. We are discussing an effective coordination mechanism for earliest possible delivery,” said Jaishankar, while promising support also to boost FDI and tourism from India.Jaishankar recalled that India’s relief and assistance mission — Operation Sagar Bandhu — commenced on the day Cyclone Ditwah made landfall.“Overall, Operation Sagar Bandhu delivered over 1,100 tonnes of relief material, including dry rations, tents, tarpaulins, hygiene kits, essential clothing and water purification kits.

PATIALA: An FIR was filed on Tuesday in connection with a Rs 8 crore online fraud that allegedly drove retired Punjab IG Amar Singh Chahal to attempt suicide a day earlier.Chahal allegedly shot himself on Monday with a licensed revolver of his IRB gunman at his residence in Patiala, sustaining a chest wound. After undergoing surgery at a private hospital, he is now stable and out of danger, police said.SSP Varun Sharma said the case was registered against unidentified persons under relevant sections of BNS relating to impersonation, cheating and forgery, along with provisions of IT Act, after recording the statements of Chahal's wife, son and daughter-in-law.The FIR was based on a complaint lodged by Chahal's wife. The former IG, according to cops, had not lodged any complaint with police regarding the fraud.Police had on Monday found a 12-page handwritten note addressed to Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav at Chahal's house.

“Neither Janmat Nor Janpath”: Bjp Alleges Growing Rebellion Against Rahul Gandhi Within Congress

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday hit out at Rahul Gandhi and claimed he was losing support within Congress , allies and even his family as it seized on the comments of CPM MP John Brittas and Congress MP Imran Masood. With Robert Vadra chiming in to say there was countrywide support for the “Priyanka-as-PM” view, BJP moved in, calling the remarks a “show of no-confidence” in Rahul’s leadership that rattled him into going abroad and venting his anger.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla told a presser Rahul had been making “anti-India” remarks from Germany in his frustration. He noted Brittas’s statement that seasoned DMK MP T R Baalu had raised the issue of Rahul’s visit abroad when Parliament was debating key issues.BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandhari said, “Open fight between Rahul and Priyanka camps in Congress. Divide in Congress out in the open. Congress vs Congress.”Poonawalla suggested that the leadership issue has been simmering within Congress, referring to the recent expulsion of former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim for his veiled criticism of Rahul and push for a central leadership for Priyanka. He also cited Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s praise of development works in Bihar to slam RahulAs Rahul is becoming “politically dead”, the LoP has become “leader of propaganda” and has been making claims like Indian economy and democracy are dead, the BJP functionary said, challenging him to provide proof of his recent charge that a woman in Haryana voted 200 times.",BJP hit out at Rahul Gandhi and claimed he was losing support within Congress.

'Make Her PM & See...': Congress MP Endorses Priyanka Gandhi; BJP Takes 'No Faith In Rahul' Dig

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Imran Masood said Rahul Gandhi is the acknowledged leader of the party, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's, issuing a clarification after a remark of his - ""if Priyanka was the PM, Hindus would not have faced persecution in Bangladesh like today"" - triggered a row.Masood explained that he was asked a question about Priyanka in context of Bangladesh, and he centered his response around it. ""Rahul Gandhi is leader of Congress, and he is also the leader of Priyanka... Rahul and Priyanka are grandchildren of Indira Gandhi. If they had the command, Hindus in Bangladesh would not have faced the situation that they are facing now (while BJP is in office). That's all I said.""The clarification, apparently after a prod from All India Congress Committee, sought to address the confusion that Masood's response caused, being grabbed by BJP and TV headlines - which called it opposition party's lack of confidence in Rahul. As if complementing Masood's remark, PTI quoted Priyanka's husband Robert Vadra as saying that ""Priyanka has a bright future in politics, and a time will come when people would like to see her at the top office. ""Masood also slammed senior party functionary Shashi Tharoor over the latter's praise for ""Bihar's model of development"", calling the LS member from Kerala directionless: ""He is at a stage in life where he is lost. He is with Congress and talks about BJP. BJP has no future in Kerala, what will he do?""Earlier, Masood had said, ""Is Priyanka Gandhi the Prime Minister? Make her the PM and see how she will retaliate like Indira Gandhi.She is the granddaughter of Indira, who inflicted so much damage on Pakistan that those wounds still haven't healed.""Seizing upon the issue, BJP spokesman Shehzad Poonawalla said, ""Congress MP Imran Masood has clearly said he does not have faith in Rahul anymore and sought to bring Priyanka in his place. Then an endorsement to this came from Robert Vadra, who said, 'Yes, it is correct'.""Congress is wary of ""Rahul vs Priyanka"" headlines, realising that overzealous supporters of the Gandhi siblings end up offering an opportunity to rival BJP.","Congress MP Imran Masood said Rahul Gandhi is the acknowledged leader of the party, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's.

'Maha Jungle Raj in Bengal, Mamata Shielding Infiltrators': PM Modi Blasts TMC in Virtual Rally

NEW DELHI: Even as Hindus are facing targeted attacks from Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh, they are at the receiving end of ""targeted action"" of the Trinamool Congress govt in West Bengal, BJP alleged on Tuesday, slamming the state police for its use of force on protesters marching against violence aimed at minorities in the neighbouring country (Bangladesh).BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi claimed that TMC govt's action has shown that Hindus in the state are not allowed to express their pain, accusing West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of drawing from the agenda of ""eradication of sanatan dharma"", a reference to a controversial speech made by DMK's Udhayanidhi Stalin.In this context, he cited the inflammatory comment of TMC functionary Madan Mitra that ""Lord Ram was a Muslim"", and the campaign by its MLA Humayun Kabir, who has since been sacked from the party, for building a Babri mosque and flayed the state's governing party for its policy vis-a-vis Hindus.He said that the protest by Hindu bodies was ""peaceful"", but the participants were targeted by state police. Police, on the other hand, said that they had resorted to baton-charge to disperse protesters after they breached barricades in an attempt to get closer to the Bangladesh deputy High Commission office in central Kolkata.Trivedi further added that the mindset of Bangladesh's Jamaat-e-Islami is being reflected in Trinamool Congress govt's approach.""Jamaat-e-Islami is orchestrating targeted attacks on Hindus and TMC is behind targeted action against Hindus,"" he alleged.","BJP slams state police for its use of force on protesters marching against violence aimed at minorities in Bangladesh.

Rahul Gandhi Attacks Modi Govt In Germany, Says 'West, India Handed Over Production To China'

NEW DELHI: CPM MP John Brittas on Tuesday questioned leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi's absence from Parliament in the final days of winter session when crucial bills, including VB-G RAM G, were passed despite opposition's protests. He also criticised Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's participation at the end of the session in the tea meeting hosted by Lok Sabha Speaker OM Birla in his chambers, which was also attended by PM Narendra Modi.""It was a desire that when a crucial legislation like VB-G RAM G is being bulldozed in Parliament along with other crucial bills on nuclear energy and insurance, we expected the leader of opposition (Rahul) to lead INDIA bloc or opposition rank and file. That was an expectation and a desire,"" he told NDTV.Speaking to channels and news agencies, Brittas also said that he was not alone and other politicians from INDIA bloc too felt the same way about Rahul's absence. He said they felt that Rahul's presence would have made a big difference. ""The calendar of winter session is known to all members. So, I feel the LoP would have looked at the session's calendar and in all fairness he should have been there.Rahul's presence would have made a big difference,"" he reiterated.However, Brittas said that it is up to Rahul and his party to decide whether he needs to be in Parliament or he needs to be elsewhere.On Priyanka's decision to attend the tea meeting, Brittas was clear that it sends out the ""wrong message"" and cited how in past sessions, when govt passed waqf bill and did not hold a discussion on special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, opposition skipped these meetings. ""Compared to all those boycotts, this was a humongous issue,"" he told ANI referring to VB-G RAM G's passage.""Just couple of hours after bulldozing the bill to eliminate MGNREGA, it was not a good scene for us to see Priyanka and others sitting at the tea party along with the PM,"" he added.",CPM MP John Brittas questioned leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi's absence from Parliament in the final days of winter session.

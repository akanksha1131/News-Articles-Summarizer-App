Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

NEW DELHI: Gitanjali Angmo, wife of education reformer and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk on Wednesday in a representation to the President of India Droupadi Murmu sought her intervention and requested for “unconditional release” of Wangchuk, who she said is a “person who can never be a threat to anyone, leave alone his nation”.“A full scale witch hunt has been unleashed for the past one month in particular, and for the past four years covertly, to kill the spirit of my husband and all the causes he stands for and espouses,” Angmo, who is Founder and CEO of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives Ladakh (HIAL), states in her representation dated October 1.The copies of the representation have also been sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal and LG of Ladakh.She highlights in her representation to the President that since she was informed about her husband’s detention on September 26 under the National Security Act by the Leh police over phone, she still is completely unaware about her husband's condition. ""I am shocked and devastated,"" she added.""Is it a sin to espouse the cause of people and fight against reckless and unchecked development activities in a ecology fragile area of Ladakh, "" she asks.“Is it a crime to speak about climate change, melting glaciers, educational reforms and grassroot innovation? To raise one's voice for upliftment of a backward tribal belt which is ecologically fragile in a peaceful Gandhian manner for the last four years? It certainly cannot be termed as a threat to national security,” Angmo adds.Appealing to the President to intervene, Angmo states, “You being from a tribal community/background, would understand the feelings of the people of Leh Ladakh better than anyone else.""Wangchuk, who has been at the forefront of the movement seeking statehood and extension of the Sixth Schedule to Ladakh, was detained under NSA for allegedly instigating the violent protests on September 24 and later shifted to a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.Meanwhile, Angmo has alleged in her representation that she was put under CRPF surveillance in Village Phyang, where HIAL is also situated. “Students and staff of the Institute were also put under tight surveillance. Two members of the Institute were taken into police custody over the past 3 days, presumably without any authority of law,” Angmo states“Am I not entitled to meet and speak with my husband on phone and in person where ever he is detained? Can I not be of assistance to my husband to know his ground of detention and to espouse his legal rights of seeking justice before the court of law? Am I not entitled to know the condition of my husband who is in detention?,” she asks.“Apart from the illegal detention of my husband, the manner in which the state and its agencies are hounding us and have kept us under surveillance is deplorable. It is violative of the spirit and ethos of the Constitution of India,” Angmo has alleged.She goes on to appeal to the President as the head of the state to “intervene and inject the voice of sanity in an otherwise chaotic state of affairs. As the President of India, you embody the principles of equity, justice and conscience!”","Wife of education reformer and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk seeks President's intervention.

HYDERABAD: Telangana HC cleared two cops over the 2003 death of a suspect in an alleged encounter, upholding a sessions court’s decision.Justice Juvvadi Sridevi held there was no credible evidence to sustain the charge of murder: “On the contrary, the material indicates the incident occurred in circumstances of private defence while the cops were discharging their official duties. ”HC dismissed an NGO’s plea challenging exoneration of the cops and confirmed dropping of murder charges. The suspect had allegedly stabbed one of the cops in Zaheerabad, 120km from Hyderabad, snatched his rifle and attempted to open fire. In response, another cop, a sub-inspector, shot the suspect, killing him on the spot.Stressing that concerns about ‘police excess’ must be carefully examined, HC said the facts in this instance did not support allegations of murder.","Telangana HC cleared two cops over the 2003 death of a suspect in an alleged encounter.

Assam Bids Final Farewell To Zubeen Garg As Wife Garima Breaks Down By His Pyre

Zubeen’s aides booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder

GUWAHATI: Two fugitive prime accused in the probe into Zubeen Garg’s death were arrested before dawn on Wednesday and sent to police custody for 14 days, while the music icon’s 13th-day mourning rituals drew massive crowds in Jorhat, with fans crying for justice.North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta was detained by immigration officers at New Delhi airport around 12.30am after arriving from Singapore on the basis of an Interpol lookout notice, officials said, and handed to Assam police. An hour later, Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma was caught near the Delhi-Haryana border in Gurgaon.Both were flown to Guwahati, produced before the chief judicial magistrate at the judge’s residence due to Durga Puja court closures, and remanded in police custody for 14 days.Security was tightened at Guwahati airport, along the convoy route, and at the magistrate’s residence, with Assam police and RAF personnel deployed. Photographs released by police showed Mahanta and Sharma in handcuffs inside a police van. DGP Harmeet Singh said: “The investigation is progressing well.”Assam police’s SIT has charged the duo with conspiracy, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and causing death by negligence.“Interrogation has started and we are going to do everything as per law,” said Munna Prasad Gupta, special DGP (CID) heading the nine-member SIT. He said investigators had seized the two men’s mobile phones along with Garg’s own handset, which was with his manager.Over 60 FIRs have been filed demanding a full probe, 55 of them naming four men: Mahanta; manager Sharma, an employee of a Mumbai-based talent management firm; drummer Shekharjyoti Goswami, and businessman Sanjive Narain.SIT has interrogated Goswami, the singer’s cousin and police officer Sandipon Garg, actress Nishita Goswami, and singer-actress Amritprabha, all of whom were in Singapore at the time. Interpol lookout notices were earlier circulated for Mahanta and Sharma after they ignored SIT summons to appear before Oct 6.Garg’s widow Garima Saikia Garg said in Jorhat she was relieved the duo had been brought to Assam. “We are all waiting to know what happened to him in his last moments,” she said. In her FIR, she alleged Mahanta failed to provide security, medical support, or proper accommodation for Garg in Singapore.","North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta was detained by immigration officers at New Delhi airport.

High court calls wife’s killing ‘classic case of blind faith’

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has convicted an elderly man and an accomplice of strangling his wife to death in 1982 under the pretext of “driving out a ghost”, calling it a shocking case of blind faith used as a cover for murder After a 43-year-long legal battle, a division bench of Justices Rajiv Gupta and Harvir Singh sentenced Awadhesh Kumar, 71, and co-accused Mata Prasad to life imprisonment, overturning a 1984 trial court acquittal.The court also handed them three-year sentences under IPC Section 201 for destroying evidence, saying both terms would run concurrently. Two other accused died while the appeal filed by UP govt was pending.Prosecutors said Kumar killed his 23-year-old wife Kusuma Devi on Aug 6, 1982, after being caught in an illicit relationship with his younger brother’s wife.Kumar, who was then 28 years old, Prasad and two others pinned Kusuma down and throttled her, claiming they were exorcising a ghost.Her body was cremated in a hurry that same night to conceal the crime, according to witness testimony.Calling it “a classic case of blind faith”, the HC said: “Such unfortunate realities are still prevalent in remote areas in different cultures based on superstition and belief, just to bring good fortune and to appease the gods. This shocks the conscience of civilized society and is to be condemned by one and all, to curb such social evils.”Awadhesh Kumar and co-accused Mata Prasad have been ordered to surrender within two weeks. Each was fined Rs 20,000 for murder and Rs 5,000 for destroying evidence.","Awadhesh Kumar, 71, and co-accused Mata Prasad sentenced to life imprisonment.

'Resilient Despite Attempts To Crush It': PM Modi Praises RSS' Unbroken Spirit And Service

Illegal immigration threat to India’s demography: PM

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday praised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ’s campaign against caste discrimination and untouchability, highlighting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ’s call for shared temples, wells and cremation grounds.“The Sangh has continuously fought against untouchability and social discrimination. Mahatma Gandhi also openly praised the Sangh’s equality and fraternity,” said Modi while speaking at an event to commemorate Sangh’s centenary celebrations.In his speech marked by a tough pitch against infiltration, Modi emphasised that successive RSS chiefs have campaigned against caste discrimination. “Na Hindu patito bhavet (No Hindu can ever be fallen),” he quoted the second Sarsanghchalak as saying.Modi also cited the third Sarsanghchalak’s statement, “If Hindu untouchability is not wrong, nothing else is wrong in the world”, and referred to Bhagwat’s statement that no Hindu can be barred from accessing temples, wells and cremation grounds used by others.Modi said these ideals represented the Sangh’s effort to eliminate internal divisions and strengthen national unity. “No discrimination, no differences of opinion, no alienation of hearts — this is the basis of harmony,” he added.The reference to RSS’s stand against untouchability is significant in view of efforts of its ideological opponents to frame the organisation as a Brahmanical outfit. He also sought to rebut the allegation about Sangh’s aloofness from the freedom struggle by saying that its founder KB Hedgewar was jailed several times by the British authorities, while its workers supported and provided protection to freedom fighters.The PM doubled down on his stand against infiltration and warned that illegal immigration posed a grave threat to India’s demography and internal security. He also tied the Sangh’s message of social equality to the broader challenges facing India and underlined that the RSS’s social reform initiatives were inseparable from its nationalist credentials, pointing to the participation of its early leaders and volunteers in the freedom struggle.Many RSS workers faced British repression during the 1942 Quit India upsurge and the Chimur agitation, he said. “From the fight against the Nizam’s oppression in Hyderabad to the liberation of Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the Sangh made many sacrifices,” Modi said, situating the organisation within the broader sweep of India’s anti-colonial and post-Independence struggles.",PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday praised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s campaign against caste discrimination and untouchability.

Better & safer

NEW DELHI: Aimed at eliminating men, vehicle and animal conflict in Kaziranga National Park (KNP), the Cabinet Wednesday approved widening and improvement of 86-km Kalibor-Numaligarh section of NH-715 in Assam, including three elevated sections of 34.5 km through the national park.The Rs 6,957 crore project will be fully funded by govt. Once the elevated section is built, the existing two-lane highway passing through the KNP will be abandoned. The existing road will be part of the national park, thereby ensuring unhindered movement of animals.Sharing the Cabinet decision with reporters, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the project will decongest the existing corridor, improve safety, and necessary provisions have been made in consultation with entities, including National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India to prevent any harm to animals.Terming it as a historic decision for Assam and the northeast in a post on X, PM Modi said, “The Cabinet decision on widening and upgradation of the Kalibor–Numaligarh section of NH-715, including an elevated corridor with wildlife-friendly measures in the Kaziranga stretch, will boost development as well as ensure animal safety. Tourism to Kaziranga will receive a big boost.”Sources said the plan to expand the road and building elevated stretch had been in works since 2016, but it gained momentum after NHAI took up the stretch in 2023.Govt said a major part of the existing highway passes either through the national park or along the southern boundary of the park having only 16 to 32 metres of right of way. “During monsoons, the area inside the park gets flooded leading to the movement of the wildlife from the park towards the elevated Karbi-Anglong Hills by crossing the existing highway. The heavy round-the-clock traffic on the highway results in frequent accidents and deaths of wild animals,” it added.","The Rs 6,957 crore project will be fully funded by govt.

'Resilient Despite Attempts To Crush It': PM Modi Praises RSS' Unbroken Spirit And Service

NEW DELHI: Congress said the party and other ideological groups fought for the freedom struggle, while RSS sided with the British, as it slammed PM Narendra Modi ’s claim at a function on Wednesday.Congress posted on social media a video of party president Mallikarjun Kharge asking, “tell us how many of your people (RSS) went to the jail, and how many were hanged by the British”. It said while the entire country rose against the British during Quit India movement in 1942, RSS decided to join hands with the imperial masters to suppress the agitation.“It is our country’s misfortune that workers of a communal and hateful organisation like RSS are directly running govt. Those who have always advocated for Manusmriti over the Constitution are now becoming CMs and PMs in our country. How can we expect social, political, and economic justice from them?” the party asked. “While Congress, socialists, communists, and other revolutionary organisations were repeatedly banned, the British regime never imposed any ban on RSS. None of its volunteers were ever sent to jail, so they could stay outside and poison people’s mind with Hindu-Muslim division,” it added.“Even 78 years after Independence, RSS has only one agenda — seizing power by igniting Hindu-Muslim tensions, capturing institutions, and spreading hatred and frenzy. The situation is such that today, by misusing power, RSS has started selling out the country. If it is said that RSS is the root of most problems in the country, it would not be an exaggeration. The day this organisation stops setting the country on fire and hollowing it out, more than half of the problems will be resolved,” Congress said.","Congress posted on social media a video of party president Mallikarjun Kharge asking, “tell us how many of your people (RSS) went to the jail, and how many were hanged by the British” It said while the entire country rose against the British during Quit India movement in 1942, RSS decided to join hands with the imperial masters to suppress the agitation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124266201,imgsize-486194,width-400,resizemode-4/khrage-photo.jpg"

'Goldification': Akhilesh Yadav hits out at Centre as gold prices cross Rs 1 lakh; accuses BJP of hoarding black money,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goldification-akhilesh-yadav-hits-out-at-centre-as-gold-prices-cross-rs-1-lakh-accuses-bjp-of-hoarding-black-money/articleshow/124256516.cms,"Akhilesh Yadav (ANI image)

Akhilesh Yadav's X post

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party president and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of hoarding gold and converting “black money into solid assets,” a process he described as goldification.Yadav alleged that the recent surge in gold prices is not the result of rising demand among ordinary citizens but due to what he called large-scale hoarding by BJP leaders. He argued that under the “goldification” process, corrupt members of the ruling party are turning their illicit funds into precious metals.In a post on X, Yadav wrote: “The reason for the skyrocketing gold prices in BJP rule is not an increase in demand for gold among the common people; rather, the cause is the ‘goldification’ process by which the highly corrupt BJP members are converting their liquid black money into solid assets.”The SP leader further questioned whether the BJP’s “iron double engine” had in fact “turned into gold,” while demanding that the government explain why prices of luxury metals continue to rise despite international market fluctuations.He also mocked the ruling party, asking whether its much-publicised drones, binoculars and bulldozers were only meant for political opponents and not for tracking gold hoarders.According to Yadav, the soaring cost of gold has pushed even silver out of reach for the poor, depriving them of traditional practices such as gifting ornaments during weddings.“Now a poor man cannot even give a single gold clove to his loved ones as a blessing during weddings,” he said.Gold prices in Delhi touched Rs 1,18,790 per 10 grams (24K) today, compared to Rs 1,17,561 per 10 grams on Tuesday. Prices of the precious metal tend to fluctuate daily, influenced by global factors such as dollar movements and international demand, along with domestic taxes and seasonal buying trends.","Akhilesh Yadav accuses BJP of hoarding gold and converting “black money into solid assets” Yadav claims that under the “goldification” process, corrupt members of the ruling party are turning their illicit funds into precious metals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124256571,imgsize-466938,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
Hosabale: RSS custodian of India’s civilisational philosophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hosabale-rss-custodian-of-indias-civilisational-philosophy/articleshow/124265978.cms,"Hosabale calls RSS custodian of India’s civilisational philosophy

NEW DELHI: RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Wednesday celebrated the govt’s decision to release a commemorative postage stamp and coin as a “societal recognition” of the Sangh ’s century-long contribution, while defence minister Rajnath Singh marked the occasion by highlighting the role of swayamsevaks in communal harmony and nation building.Speaking at the Sangh’s centenary celebrations, where PM Narendra Modi was the chief guest, Hosabale said, “The release of the stamp and coin was emblematic of RSS’s journey from the fringes to the mainstream. Indifference, opposition, struggle — these all had to be overcome. Yet, while walking the path of indifference and opposition, today the Sangh has reached the stage of acceptance,” he said, adding that RSS is now being identified with India’s “civilisational philosophy”.The Rs 100 coin celebrating RSS’s contribution to nation building carries the national emblem on one side and on the other, an image of ‘Bharat Mata’ in Varad Mudra, with a lion being saluted by swayamsevaks — a depiction the PM noted as the first instance of Bharat Mata’s image appearing on Indian currency. The coin also bears the Sangh’s motto, “Rashtraya Swaha, Idam Rashtraya, Idam Na Mama.”Positioning the Sangh as a custodian of values rooted in Indian tradition, he said, “RSS has arrived — not merely as an organisation; it has come while practising for an idea.It is the idea of this soil, this land’s civilisation and culture.” “The Sangh opposes no one... taking all of society along, moving forward together — this is the Sangh’s song,” he said.Highlighting RSS’s contributions, Singh said it played the role of a saviour during the 1984 anti- Sikh riots, providing shelter, protection and relief to the Sikh community. “Noted author Khushwant Singh acknowledged this publicly when he said that RSS played an honourable role in maintaining Hindu-Sikh unity before and after Indira Gandhi’s assassination,” Singh said.On RSS being often unfairly criticised regarding its relationship with Mahatma Gandhi, he said that while it is true there were some differences of opinion on certain issues — as there were within the Congress fold itself — it would be “misleading to portray their relationship in terms of hostility or rivalry”. “Their differences never stood in the way of the mutual regard they shared. This was evident in 1934, when Gandhi ji visited an RSS camp in Wardha. He was struck by the organisation’s discipline, complete absence of untouchability, and rigorous simplicity,” he said.","RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale celebrated the govt’s decision to release a commemorative postage stamp and coin.

Trump Reposts PM Modi’s PM Modi’s Message Supporting 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan,Hamas Yet To Respond

.

Where are the people of Gaza themselves in the system of governance proposed? Where is the roadmap for a full-fledged Palestinian state to come into being? How much longer will the US and Israel continue to ignore Palestinian statehood - which has already been recognised by 157 member-countries of the UN with India having led the way in Nov 1988? Where is the accountability for the genocide that has been carried out in Gaza over the past twenty months?

Congress backs Ramesh, calls for Palestinian statehood

PM Modi welcomes Trump’s Gaza plan:

.

Trump-Netanyahu 20-point plan:

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remaining silent on the ongoing Gaza war, calling it extreme “moral cowardice.”In a post on X, Ramesh said, “The PM has maintained a complete silence on the horrific atrocities that have led to the killing of tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza. This is extreme moral cowardice and a total betrayal of all that India has stood for. ”Ramesh alleged that to appease President Donald Trump and in solidarity with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, PM Modi has welcomed Trump’s new 20-point plan for Gaza, while fundamental and disturbing questions about the plan remain.He also raised four fundamental questions on the US-led initiative:Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera supported Jairam Ramesh’s criticism.In a post on X, he wrote that “any plan that undermines the agency of the long-oppressed Palestinian people and fails to ensure accountability for the genocide they have endured since 2023 is deserving of contempt and condemnation.”Khera added that “true justice can be restored only through the establishment of the Palestinian state” and warned that “everything else is a mere smokescreen to perpetuate the occupation.”On Tuesday, PM Modi welcomed President Trump’s announcement of a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict.In a post on X, he wrote: “We welcome President Donald J Trump's announcement of a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict. It provides a viable pathway to long-term and sustainable peace, security and development for the Palestinian and Israeli people, as also for the larger West Asian region.”The prime minister expressed hope that “all concerned will come together behind President Trump’s initiative and support this effort to end conflict and secure peace.”Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the plan on Monday. The 20-point proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, protection of civilians on both sides and stronger regional cooperation with international monitoring to ensure compliance. It is unclear whether Hamas will accept the terms.Trump described it as a detailed step-by-step framework aimed at ending the conflict and restoring stability.India was one of the first countries to recognise a Palestinian state in 1988 and also supported a two-state solution at the UN.Since the nearly three-year war began, over 65,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed, according to Gaza’s health ministry.",Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remaining silent on the ongoing Gaza war.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) will finally get its long-awaited second airport — which will eventually overtake the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Int’l Airport (CSMIA) in traffic handling capacity — this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) on Oct 8.Ahead of the inauguration, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani visited the project site for a comprehensive review and walkthrough of the final preparations. “Every runway, every terminal, every gate here carries the imprint of thousands of hands and hearts. This is more than an airport — it is a monument to the spirit of Bharat, built by its people, for its people,” Gautam Adani said.During his visit, the Adani Group chairman undertook a detailed inspection of the airport, which, once fully operational, will have the capacity to handle 9 crore passengers annually — placing it among the largest and most advanced airports in the world. Apart from assessing technical progress and operational readiness, Adani interacted with construction workers to understand their journeys, met engineers and project teams, engaged with firefighting staff to acknowledge their critical role in safety, and spent time with differently-abled staff at one of the terminal’s retail outlets.Flights will start at NMIA a week to 15 days after getting inaugurated. Starting with 60 daily flights (30 arrivals and as many departures) in the first month, the number will double after 30 days and then reach the 240-300 mark in six months.In its first phase with a capacity of 2 crore passengers annually (CPA), the greenfield airport will handle 400 daily flights which it will ramp up to in a year, Adani Group director (airports) Jeet Adani had recently told TOI in an exclusive interaction.“We aim to have both domestic and international operations at NMIA from Day One itself. If that does not happen for some reason, both will start for sure within the same month (Oct). The ratio of domestic and international flights will be 4:1 as T1 domestic capacity is 1.7 CPA and int’l is 30 lakh per annum. We have the flexibility to increase international passengers, based on demand,” Jeet, son of group patriarch Gautam Adani, had said.While in its initial days connectivity may be an issue, eventually NMIA will be the “most well connected” airport of India with a network of roads, rail, metro, air taxis and water connectivity. An aerocity is being developed here that will, among other things, have hotels in all ranges from budget to luxury.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) on Oct 8.

The panel comprises representatives from the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, capital market regulator Sebi, insurance watchdog IRDAI, EPFO and govt departments.Currently, insurance companies, mutual funds and entities regulated by PFRDA hawk pension plans. Besides, EPFO manages Employees Pension Scheme, each with their own management, investment & cost structures. While the issue has been on govt’s radar for over a decade, so far, no solution has been found as each entity is unwilling to agree to a common set of regulations. “Stakeholder consultations are underway, the objective is to have a predictable, citizen-centric pension market with clear rules and seamless services,” Sitharaman said.","Nirmala Sitharaman sought broadening its coverage, with a special focus on gig and platform workers & women.

Though the order wasn’t national, activists say state health officials should have taken note.In Rajasthan, however, the syrup was being prescribed to children under four at govt hospitals and centres under ‘free medicine’ scheme until it was paused after the Sikar death and reports of illness among kids in Sikar and Bharatpur.Kaysons Pharma supplied the syrup in June as part of this year’s purchase order, officials said, adding it has already been distributed to 1.33 lakh patients. In Delhi, a different company had supplied the drug.A health official admitted awareness of the Delhi incident but said other factors may be behind the Sikar fatality. “Samples have been sent for testing, and we are probing all aspects, including contamination,” he said.

MUMBAI: A friendly female dog, Nemo, who lives in and around Pil Court building in Churchgate, recently underwent a misadventure when she nervously jumped into a train at Churchgate station to escape the loud bursting of crackers. The train carried her all the way to the suburbs, and she was finally found 17 days later at Kandivli West.Worried residents launched a search through online networks. Theatre personality Anahita Uberoi told TOI, “Nemo is a popular dog here, so we were all sad when she ran away on the last day of Ganpati immersions due to the loud crackers. Many searched across south Mumbai but couldn’t find her.”Few imagined Nemo had travelled ticketless by train. A breakthrough came after 10 days when a dog feeder, Jenny, spotted her in Kandivli. A railway canteen boy and a local hawker also reported sightings and even fed her to keep her around. Finally, on Day 17, the canteen boy called to say Nemo was with him. “Her main caregiver, Ram Singh, was the happiest,” Uberoi said.","Nemo the dog jumped into a train at Churchgate station to escape the loud bursting of crackers.

The Cool Desert project

Jodhpur RIFF festival will run from October 2nd to October 6th at the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur

If the frenzy of hopping between gigs headlined by Coldplay or Diljit Dosanjh has left you drained, picture instead a festival that blends ancient music forms with contemporary influences, bringing together performances where genres flow together: from Rajasthani folk with classical jazz to beats of electronica and African percussion, with room for even reggae, Celtic and Romani traditions. No mad scramble for tickets, no rush-hour traffic.Jodhpur RIFF, India’s leading ""roots"" music festival held annually at the 15th-century Mehrangarh Fort, is built on living traditions of communities sharing their history and values with new audiences and generations by using rare instruments and a frequent focus on themes that reflect on everyday life, social conditions, love, struggle and empowerment. The 18th edition, opening October 2, gathers over 290 artists from the state of Rajasthan and 12 countries, including Portugal, Poland, Finland, Switzerland, Colombia, Canada, Bhutan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.Unlike typical global pop culture festivals, RIFF, run under the aegis of the Mehrangarh Museum Trust in Jodhpur, presents musicians who are stars in their homelands but often unknown abroad. ""Our notion of celebrity is shaped only by the media,"" says Divya Bhatia, festival director. ""But beyond globally known names, most of us are unaware of the true stars in different countries,"" he adds.""Similarly, the Rajasthani folk artists we present are among the greatest in the state.You won’t find them playing in small urban venues like Piano Man or Oddbird, but Jodhpur RIFF gives them a stage. India should take note of this,"" says Bhatia, listing out the spectrum of international artists performing this year, including Basel Rajoub, a Syrian-Swiss jazz saxophonist and Aga Khan Master Musician to Karolina Cicha, a Polish singer and multi-instrumentalist who delves into Tartar and Yiddish roots music. Portugal will bring the soulful fado of Helder Moutinho, while Colombia’s Killabeatmaker will blend Afro-Colombian and indigenous rhythms, apart from Bhutanese folk singer Sonam Dorji taking the stage. This year, the festival is also introducing artists from countries RIFF has never hosted before, such as Portugal, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.Shashmaqam, a thousand-year-old classical music tradition from Central Asia with shamanic roots, is also making its debut at the festival. Incorporating poetry, melody and Sufi elements, it will be performed by Layla Tazhibayeva and Gulzoda Khudoynazarova from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. On the other hand, London-based singer-songwriter Rosa Cecilia will infuse Latin jazz, neo-soul and disco with personal storytelling in her performance.The edition will also present one of India’s only women khartal players, young Mamta Sapera, alongside Padma Shri awardee Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande, who brings the classical khayal tradition of Jaipur-Atrauli with her vocal artistry. The younger generation is also in focus with groups like SAZ, a trio committed to preserving and evolving the Langa musical tradition through original compositions and collaborations. ""Last year, we released an album cover for SAZ. Their song 'Sundar Gori' has 1.4 million views on YouTube, and their music video has over 400,000 views. They could well be the celebrities of tomorrow. They will also release an album early next year. While most people only know of the Manganiyar, Langa are also now international celebrities,"" says Bhatia.From Tamil Nadu, fusion band Jatayu will blend Carnatic ragas with jazz and rock. Folk traditions will also be carried forward by the mother-daughter duo Ganga and Sundar, and the sisters Anita and Prem Dangi, rooted in the Rajwadi Maand heritage. Bhanwari Devi, first introduced by Jodhpur RIFF in 2010, returns as a nationally renowned folk vocalist. She has since collaborated with singer Rekha Bhardwaj and gained recognition across India. Bhatia cites Devi as an example of artists nurtured by Jodhpur RIFF who have grown into celebrated names, underscoring the festival’s role in elevating local musicians. ""The lineup is not just bigger this year, but richer,"" Bhatia reflects. ""We are building towards our 20th anniversary in 2027, and the festival's reputation has grown. More artists at the peak of their careers want to be part of this journey.""","Jodhpur RIFF, India’s leading ""roots"" music festival held annually at the 15th- century Mehrangarh Fort.

It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade’s absence. The Bring It On star further mentioned,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me.And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade’s kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death. She explained,""It just felt like he was trying to leave us—not in a marital sense, but a life and death sense. By the time he got it removed, I felt like we were more on the same page.""Dwyane Wade underwent a kidney removal surgery in December 2023.

Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy.

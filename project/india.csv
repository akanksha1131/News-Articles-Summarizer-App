It also confirmed that the embassy is in touch with the families of the abducted workers.Security agencies suspect that the abduction was carried out by Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda. While no group has officially claimed responsibility yet, intelligence officials in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have confirmed the identities of the abducted men as Amareswar, a service engineer from Miryalaguda (Telangana), and Ramana, a foreman from Andhra Pradesh. The third person is the Odisha-based Venkataraman.Senior officials of the Prasaditya Group have reportedly travelled to Mali and are assisting local authorities in efforts to secure the workers' release.

"Lakhs in Bihar may lose vote, ADR tells SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lakhs-in-bihar-may-lose-vote-adr-tells-sc/articleshow/122274362.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Election Commission's special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls just months before assembly polls has been challenged in Supreme Court with Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) telling the court that the decision has been taken arbitrarily with an impractical timeline and that it would disenfranchise lakhs of people, particularly from marginalised communities. This is against free and fair election, the organisation said.ADR, on whose pleas SC has in the past passed multiple orders to bring in electoral reforms, said in its petition that SIR's requirement for citizenship documentation disproportionately affects marginalised communities, including Muslims, SCs, STs and migrant workers, as Aadhaar and ration cards are not acceptable. Many people who didn't have the requisite documents might not be able to procure it within the short time period fixed by EC, it said.""The SIR order, if not set aside, can arbitrarily and without due process disenfranchise lakhs of voters from electing their representatives, thereby disrupting free and fair elections and democracy in the country,"" the petition said. ""The documentation requirements of the directive, lack of due process as well as the unreasonably short timeline for SIR of electoral roll in Bihar further make this exercise bound to result in removal of names of lakhs of genuine voters from electoral rolls,"" it said.The EC order has ""shifted the onus of being on the voters' list from the State to citizens. It has excluded identification documents such as Aadhaar or ration cards which further makes marginalised communities and the poor more vulnerable to exclusion from voting"", it said.""The declaration as required under SIR process is violative of Article 326 in so far as it requires a voter to provide documents to prove his/her citizenship and also citizenships of his/her mother or father, failing which his/her name would not be added to the draft electoral roll and can be deleted from the same,"" the petition saidTerming the timeline fixed by EC for SIR as unreasonable and impractical, the petition said lakhs of citizens who didn't possess the required documents may not be able to procure the documents within the short time.""Bihar is a state with high poverty and migration rates where many lack access to documents like birth certificates or parental records. As per estimates, over three crore voters and more particularly from marginalised communities could be excluded from voting due to the stringent requirements as mentioned in the SIR order. That the current reports from Bihar, where SIR is already underway, show that lakhs of voters from villages and marginalised communities do not possess the documents as being sought for them,"" the petition said.Questioning EC's decision allegedly taken in haste, the petition pointed out that the commission in May listed 21 initiatives to improve voter access and to streamline poll management but the SIR of electoral rolls was not mentioned.",Election Commission's special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls has been challenged in Supreme Court.

PUNE: The Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Pune on Saturday recorded the statement of the 22-year-old data scientist related to her complaint that she was allegedly raped by an unidentified delivery agent in her rented Kondhwa flat on Wednesday evening. Police said they produced the complainant before the court as she kept changing her statements during questioning.Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI: ""We produced the woman before the CJM, Ms T M Ahmed, and the process of recording her statement under provisions of Section 183 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) was completed."" The section empowers a magisterial court to record the confession of an accused or the statement of a witness.Shinde said the FIR the woman, who has a BE degree and works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar, had filed with the Kondhwa police on Thursday and her subsequent statements had numerous discrepancies. ""She continuously changed her statements during questioning,"" he said.On Thursday, the Kondhwa police had registered a case of rape, voyeurism and criminal intimidation based on the woman's complaint stating that a ""delivery agent"" stepped into her house on the pretext of delivering a parcel and getting a delivery sheet acknowledged, sprayed some chemical on her face to render her unconscious and later sexually assaulted herCity police commissioner Amitesh Kumar on Friday said investigation into the alleged rape revealed that there was ""no forced entry into the woman's flat, no chemical was sprayed to render her unconscious and the selfie on her cellphone was taken with her consent before she cropped the image"".Police had detained her friend (24), an IT professional with a firm in Baner, after evidence like his cellphone location showed that he was around the flat at the time of the alleged incident. The DCP on Saturday said the police released the woman's friend for now, but served a notice on him with a direction to join the investigation.Shinde said the process to record the complainant's statement by a magisterial court was crucial under the provisions relating to rape or sexual assault of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) ""to ensure voluntariness and reliability of such statements"" during investigation. ""It ensures transparency. Since her statement is recorded, the investigating officer can continue the investigation based on her voluntary disclosure before the CJM,"" he said.A senior police officer privy to the investigation said: ""We questioned the complainant on material points. She gave multiple oral and written statements, but they were found contradictory and misleading during verification. Her statements are not consistent with the FIR. A call to take action against her would be taken based on the outcome of the investigation. She would be referred to a counselling session.""Sources in the sessions court said the investigating officer took the CJM's permission for securing the woman's presence to record her statement because of the complexity of the case. The court considered the officer's request and recorded her statement in camera. The woman's statement was sealed in an envelope soon after it was recorded. The sealed envelope has been kept in the safe custody of the court ‘nazir' (assistant superintendent).The investigating officer will now have to secure a certified copy of her statement by seeking the court's permission. The purpose of recording her statement before the court under Section 183 of BNSS is to create a reliable record of a witness. This process aims at detering witnesses from subsequently changing their testimonies, minimise perjury and provide more trustworthy accounts of events, especially when compared to statements taken during the investigation, sources said.The CJM court's assistant public prosecutor, Priyanka Vengurlekar, confirmed that the woman's statement was recorded, but said its contents could not be made public.",The Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Pune on Saturday recorded the statement of the 22-year-old data scientist related to her complaint that she was allegedly raped by an unidentified delivery agent.

NEW DELHI: Two people, a 25-year-old civil services aspirant and a 30-year-old lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday. According to the fire service, the building lacked a valid fire certificate and a case of negligence has been registered by police.The deceased were identified as Kumar Dhirender Pratap Singh and Pawan Gautam. Singh, originally from Sonbhadra in Uttar Pradesh, was found dead inside the elevator, where he is believed to have suffocated after getting trapped, while Gautam, an ITI graduate from Aligarh who worked as a lab technician, was found on the second floor.According to Delhi Fire Service, the blaze was reported at 6.44pm on Friday. Minutes later, Singh's brother, Vikram, received a desperate message from his trapped sibling. ""At 6.51pm, my brother texted me about being stuck in the lift,"" Vikram revealed to TOI. ""He pleaded, ‘Kisi tarah se bachalo, main lift mein fasa hua hoon. Bohot suffocation ke kaaran saans lena mushkil ho raha hai' (Please save me however you can, I'm trapped in the lift.I feel suffocated and cannot breathe)'.""Vikram, who was in Sonbhadra, immediately contacted his brother's friend to rush to Karol Bagh. ""She went and requested authorities to check the lift around 7pm. They told her they had done it and hadn't detected anyone inside,"" he claimed. His body was eventually recovered at 2.30am on Saturday. ""He was unconscious when we saw him. He was shirtless and in his vest, maybe because he used his shirt to cover his face to avoid the smoke,"" said Vikram. ""I wish I had been there to go into the building and save him,"" he added.Before the tragedy, Singh had been studying in a library nearby for 4-5 hours, according to his friends. Vikram remembered his younger brother, ""He had a good nature. Our mother is a govt schoolteacher in UP and he often volunteered to teach the students whenever he visited our village.""The fire broke out in the multistorey building that housed Vishal Mega Mart, gutting its basement, ground, first, second and third floors. The structure had only two staircases and one lift, with no ventilation except the entrance. Preliminary investigations suggest the fire was caused by a short circuit on the second floor.Firefighting operations were severely hampered due to the lack of ventilation in the building. Fire officers had to use JCB machines to break open the front-facing parts of the upper floors to extinguish the flames, with 15 fire tenders and 90 firefighters engaged in the fierce struggle to control the massive blaze.TOI reached out to Vishal Mega Mart for a response, but the company had not replied at the time of filing this story.","Two people, a civil services aspirant and a lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday.

DHARAMSHALA: A day before his 90th birthday and amid talks of succession, Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama Saturday said he hoped to live beyond 130 years.Addressing devotees during a long-life prayer ceremony held by Central Tibetan Administration at main Tibetan temple in McLeodganj, he said, ""So far, I believe I have served Buddha Dharma and the Tibetan people quite well. .. I hope to live for another 30 or 40 years - even over 130.""The Tibetan spiritual master - known for his scientific temperament - has often laughed off in his trademark humour any talk about his years on Earth, each time giving different figures.In Dec 2024, he had said he might live for 110 years or more. Five years before that, he assured his followers he would live beyond 113 years.CTA president Penpa Tsering told TOI, ""It is very difficult to interpret what His Holiness says... We believe every word he speaks.""Speaking to a gathering that included Union minister Kiren Rijiju, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu, and MP Tapir Gao, the Dalai Lama said, “So today, here we have gods, representatives of gods, and human beings gathering the auspicious conditions for my long life and offering your prayers sincerely.”He also talked about meeting Mao Zedong, who dismissed religion as “poison,” and India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He called upon the audience to maintain faith and generate the altruistic mind of ‘Bodhichitta’ — the essence of Dharma to fulfil the welfare of self and others. “I trust in the blessings of Avalokiteshvara. You should, too. That’s all. Thank you,” he said.","Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama Saturday said he hoped to live beyond 130 years.

NEW DELHI: All India Congress Committee (AICC) was not trying to sell assets of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), the company which published National Herald newspaper, but rather trying to save the institution that was a part of the freedom movement, senior advocate R S Cheema, representing Rahul Gandhi , told a Delhi court Saturday. Cheema made his submissions before the court of special judge Vishal Gogne, which is hearing arguments on the point of cognisance of the chargesheet filed against Sonia Gandhi , Rahul and others in National Herald money laundering case.""In post-Independence period, it (AJL) was never a commercial institution. We (AICC) were trying to retrieve an institution which is part of the freedom movement heritage. The problem was not recovering the loan (given to AJL) but to revive it, to see that it comes back on the rails. AICC was not looking for profit from sales. This is a squinted version,"" Cheema said.According to ED, Sonia and Rahul, along with others and a private company, Young Indian Pvt Ltd, conspired to launder money by fraudulently usurping AJL's properties valued at over Rs 2,000 crore in exchange for a loan of Rs 90 crore. Cheema said ED's allegations were ""crude lies"".The senior advocate said ED made unwarranted inferences against Rahul by wrongly assuming that he was the person in-charge of AICC's affairs as its general secretary in 2010. According to the party constitution, AICC has several general secretaries at a point in time, and no one of them could be in-charge of its affairs, Cheema pointed out. The counsel further stated Sonia, then Congress president, was wrongly inferred as person in-charge of AICC when the loan was assigned to AJL.The arguments will continue against other accused, including Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda, Sunil Bhandari, Young Indian and Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, on Monday.","All India Congress Committee (AICC) was not trying to sell assets of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), the company which published National Herald newspaper.

A draft statement under discussion proposed condemnation of US tariffs and some of Israel's actions in Gaza, issues on which India has nuanced its position given its efforts to reach a trade deal with the US before Jan 9, Trump's deadline for suspension of tariffs, and its balancing act on relations with Israel and Palestine.Brics - which was expanded last year to include Egypt, Ethiopia, UAE, Indonesia, Iran and Saudi Arabia as full members - has been an important platform for India to focus on issues like multilateral reforms, counterterrorism, sustainable development goals and people-to-people exchanges. Modi is expected to strongly raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in his address to further sensitise the international community about the role of Pakistan in promoting terrorism, as evident from the recent Pahalgam attack.The Brics Declaration will be followed closely for what it has to say on tariffs and the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. According to a Bloomberg report from Rio, going by a draft statement under discussion, Brics heads of govt are likely to adopt a position at odds with the Trump administration on tariffs and aspects of the conflict in the Middle East. The statement, however, doesn't name the Trump administration or the US on the tariff issue as not all countries apparently were comfortable with it.There's also a proposal for the leaders to express serious concern about the situation in Palestinian territory, citing the resumption of Israeli attacks and the obstruction of the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The language, according to the report, includes a condemnation of the use of starvation as a method of warfare - a reference to charges levelled at Israel.While it's not clear how much of the draft statement will appear in the final text that will be adopted on July 7, a proposal for full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip is also being deliberated. This may be a little off-putting for India which abstained from a UNGA vote recently for immediate ceasefire in Gaza.However, while India recently backed out of a statement by the SCO condemning Israel's attacks on Iran, it has been more flexible with Brics.",Brics countries were engaged in intense negotiations to finalise the declaration as PM Narendra Modi arrived in Rio for the summit on Sunday.

According to the officer, Call Detail Records (CDRs) revealed multiple conversations among the accused in the days leading up to the incident.The investigation further revealed that Monojit tried to seek help the next day. On June 26, he contacted an “influential” person in Deshapriya Park, someone who had reportedly helped him in the past.However, that individual refused to assist this time, sensing the gravity of the situation, the officer added.After being turned down, Monojit reportedly tried reaching out to several of his so-called “mentors” in different areas of the city. “Monojit went to various parts of the city including Rashbehari, Deshapriya Park, Gariahat, Fern Road, and Ballygunge Station Road, trying to meet his mentors. Mobile tower data also indicated that he visited someone near Karaya police station,” the officer said.Police say Monojit's movements after the crime suggest he was trying to get help to run away or hide the case.Security guard Pinaki Banerjee has also been arrested, and the college has come under scrutiny for lapses in safety and oversight. The case is being probed by a Special Investigation Team formed by Kolkata Police.The incident sparked protests and outrage across the city.","The three men accused of gangraping a student inside South Calcutta Law College on June 25 spent several hours drinking in the institute’s guard room after committing the crime, police said.

It ranges in value from 0 to 100. A score of 0 means perfect equality. A score of 100 means one person has all the income, wealth or consumption and others have none, hence absolute inequality.

Attack on Saturday morning

Kedia apologises after vandalism

Police protection and public appeal

Wider context: Mira Road incident

NEW DELHI: Mumbai investor Sushil Kedia’s office in Worli was vandalised on Saturday morning by unidentified individuals allegedly linked to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), days after he publicly challenged party chief Raj Thackeray and declared he would not learn Marathi. The attackers raised slogans in support of Thackeray and hurled stones at the office. Police have detained five MNS supporters in connection with the incident and said security had already been deployed at the site following earlier threats to Kedia.What do we know so far-Sushil Kedia, a long-time resident of Mumbai and founder of an investment service firm, had posted a provocative message on social media platform X on July 3. In it, he declared: “I don’t know Marathi properly even after living for 30 years in Mumbai & with your gross misconduct I have made it a resolve that until such people as you are allowed to pretend to be taking care of Marathi Manus I take pratigya I won’t learn Marathi. Kya karna hai bol?”The post drew a sharp response from MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande, who posted on X: “Do business if you're a businessman; don't try to act like our father.If you insult Marathi in Maharashtra, you'll get a slap on the ear, otherwise, stay in your lane, Mehta or whoever. That's all for now.”According to police, a group of unidentified men showed up at Kedia’s office near Century Bazar in Worli on Saturday morning and began vandalising the premises. They shouted pro-Marathi slogans and praised Raj Thackeray. Stones were thrown at the office, though no injuries were reported. Five MNS supporters were later detained.Hours after the attack, Kedia posted a video on X apologising to Raj Thackeray. The caption read: “I request Raj Thackeray Ji to consider my humble submission.”Earlier in the week, Kedia had approached police after receiving threats online. He tagged the Mumbai Police and other authorities, writing: “Shri @RajThackeray threatening me by 100s of your workers is not going to make me a fluent Marathi speaker... With so much threatening around even more fear happens that if I miss speaking any word(s) improperly more violence will happen.”“Please note @CPMumbaiPolice @Dev_Fadnavis open threats of violence are being issued by @RajThackeray workers. Provide me safety. Is an Indian having any rights to dignity & safety in Maharashtra today is a question even our @HMOIndia @AmitShah ji might ponder on as well.”The episode comes on the heels of another controversy involving MNS. In Mira Road, a sweet shop owner was recently beaten by seven MNS workers for not speaking Marathi. The incident, caught on camera, led to widespread protests in the area, with many shopkeepers shutting their establishments in solidarity. The MNS workers were detained but later released after being served police notices. The party has refused to apologise.Police say further investigation is underway in the Worli case, and additional security measures remain in place around Kedia’s office.",Mumbai investor Sushil Kedia’s office in Worli was vandalised on Saturday morning by unidentified individuals allegedly linked to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.

They demanded the inclusion of Aadhaar card , ration card and MGNREGA card as valid documents for voter verification under the SIR process in Bihar.Sharing a personal experience with reporters after the meeting, Tejashwi said, “My wife’s voter ID card was made on the basis of aadhaar card. Why is the aadhaar card excluded from the list of documents required for the SIR in Bihar?” he asked.EC officials here in Delhi clarified that the Aadhaar card was kept out of the list of 11 specified documents for SIR, as Aadhaar is neither a proof of date or place of birth, nor of one's Indian citizenship. ""It just defines that the 10-fingerprints, photo and iris belong to the person in whose name the card is issued.

JABALPUR: In a setback to actor Saif Ali Khan and his family, who inherited Rs 15,000 crore properties owned by Bhopal's erstwhile rulers, Madhya Pradesh HC has set aside the trial court's verdict given over two decades ago, and ordered a retrial in the case.In its order passed on June 30, the single bench of HC of Justice Sanjay Dwivedi set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court which upheld Pataudis (Saif Ali Khan, his mother Sharmila Tagore and his two sisters Soha and Saba) to be the owners of the properties. It also directed the trial court to make all possible efforts to conclude and decide the matter within one year.Nawab Hamidullah was the last ruling Nawab of the princely state of Bhopal. He and his wife Maimoona Sultan had three daughters - Abida, Sajida and Rabia. Sajida married Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi and became the Nawab Begum of Bhopal. Their son, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, former Indian cricket team skipper married Sharmila Tagore. After Nawab Hamidullah's eldest daughter Abida migrated to Pakistan, Sajida became the owner of the properties. Later, her son Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (Tiger Pataudi, who married Sharmila Tagore) became the successor of these properties estimated to be valued at nearly Rs 15,000 crore, which were inherited by Saif Ali and his siblings.The two appeals, one filed by Begum Suraiya Rashid and others, and another by Nawab Mehr Taj Sajida Sultan and others, all heirs of late Nawab Mohammad Hamidullah Khan, said the trial court had dismissed their suits against what they called as unfair partition of royal property. In their pleas, they stated that the Bhopal district court's judgment and decree dated Feb 14, 2000 dismissed their suits unfairly. Their lawyers pleaded that the partition of his (Nawab's) personal property should have been done between them and defendants Saif Ali, Sharmila and 16 other heirs as per the Muslim Personal Law. The appellants opposed the defendants (Pataudis) for citing the certificate issued by the Govt of India on Jan 10, 1962 in favour of Sajida Begum as the sole successor of all the private properties.Justice Dwivedi said, ""The matters are remanded back to the trial court for deciding it afresh."" ""And if so required, the trial court can allow the parties to lead further evidence in view of the subsequent development and changed legal position,"" the court ordered.","Madhya Pradesh HC has set aside the trial court's verdict given over two decades ago, and ordered a retrial in the case.

The Department of Defence said the research project would explore the use of towed array target motion analysis technology to improve the reliability, efficiency and interoperability of current surveillance capabilities.DSTG senior researcher Sanjeev Arulampalam explained that a towed array consists of a long linear array of hydrophones, towed behind a submarine or surface ship on a flexible cable. “We need to harness the best minds in innovation, science and technology to build new capabilities, to innovate at greater pace, and to strengthen our strategic partnerships.The hydrophones work together to listen to the undersea environment from various directions,” the Department of Defence cited Dr Arulampalam as saying.The project is the latest milestone in increasing maritime domain awareness cooperation between Australia and India. It is significant within the Quad framework— consisting of India, Australia, US and Japan — which seeks to counter China's growing maritime belligerence in the Indo-Pacific.The combination of target motion analysis with the towed array system is intended to manage noise corruption and explore performance improvements. The project would see novel algorithms being put to test, using the strengths and shared knowledge of the two countries. “It will involve the sharing of ideas, investigation trials, algorithm demonstrations and performance analysis,” Arulampalam said.The Department of Defence announcement comes after external affairs minister S. Jaishankar met his Australian counterpart, Penny Wong, on the sidelines of the Quad foreign ministers' meeting in the US earlier this week.","India and Australia have initiated a research project to enhance undersea surveillance capabilities.

Bengaluru “Water Bears”



Other experiments



He may have witnessed more than a hundred sunrises and sunsets from orbit, but for Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , the first eight days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have been a whirlwind of scientific discovery.While six of the seven Isro-led experiments are underway, tardigrades or “water bears” that travelled all the way from Bengaluru to the orbital lab some 400 km from Earth, have served their purpose in space.Shux, who kicked off his scientific experiments with Myogenesis — to investigate the biological pathways behind skeletal muscle degradation in microgravity inside the Life Sciences Glovebox, marked his first week in orbit by completing the study on tardigrades or “water bears”.“Shukla has successfully completed the microgravity experiment involving Tardigrades onboard the ISS,” Isro confirmed. The next step would be for the principal investigators to analyse the data obtained from experiments conducted by Shux.The study focused on tardigrades’ survival, revival, and reproductive behaviour in space. It will provide valuable insights into the underlying biological mechanisms leading to resilience of extremophile organisms in microgravity environments and has potential applications on Earth especially in the area of therapeutics,” Isro confirmed.The water bears at ISS were studied in the Voyager Tardigrades experiment designed by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).Biochemist Sandeep Eswarappa and team at IISc, who spent over five years studying tardigrades, resilient microscopic organisms that have survived five mass extinctions, discovered a Paramacrobiotus species with an astonishing defence: When exposed to lethal ultraviolet radiation, this species absorbs the harmful rays and emits harmless blue fluorescence instead.That was the first direct experimental evidence of photoprotective fluorescence in any organism. And, it is this ‘Bengaluru strain’ of the tardigrade that has flown to the ISS with Shux.Shux’s first eight days in orbit as part of the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission have been defined not just by spectacle, but also a series of intricate biological investigations that could transform both future space missions and life on Earth.The Myogenesis study, on the other hand, is progressing with planned interventions and recording of observations as per the experiment protocol. In parallel, other Indian experiments for studying selected strains of microalgae and cyanobacteria under space conditions are ongoing, contributing to research on regenerative life support systems and crew nutrition.“As part of the Electronic Displays human research study, Shux carried out daily software-based cognitive and interface assessments. The study aims to optimise crew interaction with digital systems in the unique environment of space,” Isro added.A day before the well-deserved “rest day” upon completing half his stay at the ISS, he had begun documenting the progress of the Cyanobacteria Growth Experiment, another Isro-led study analysing how photosynthetic bacteria behave in space. These tiny organisms could one day form the backbone of life support systems on long-duration missions, recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen and aiding water regeneration.Shux also helped deploy and manage samples for the Space Microalgae investigation — another study with enormous potential. Microalgae, already valued on Earth for their rapid growth and nutritional content, are being cultivated in orbit to observe how microgravity influences their metabolism, genetic activity, and biomass yield. These hardy organisms may serve as future spacefarers’ food, fuel, or even pharmaceutical source.",Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla completed study on tardigrades or “water bears’ on the International Space Station (ISS) The study will provide valuable insights into the underlying biological mechanisms leading to resilience of extremophile organisms in microgravity.

FEO proceedings are another way of making one come back to India to face trial by coercing him to return by attachment, confiscation of properties of such fugitive economic offender and proceeds of crime, and by disentitling the such fugitive economic offender from putting forward or defending any civil claim,"" the judge said in his 100-page judgment.""...this court is satisfied that Sanjay Bhandari is a fugitive economic offender under section 12(1) of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018, and is declared as such under the above provision(s)"" of the Act, he said.ED and I-T department had in the extradition proceedings claimed that Bhandari had undisclosed foreign income worth Rs 655 crore on which he evaded tax worth Rs 196 crore.The middleman in defence deals, allegedly a key factor in deals like that of trainer aircraft Pilatus, deposited huge amounts of money in bank accounts of overseas shell companies and also invested in properties in the UAE and the UK between 2009 and 2016.The case against Bhandari has an important political dimension - his alleged links with Robert Vadra , spouse of Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Robert is also being probed for his links with Bhandari, who fled to London when multiple agencies started investigating him in 2016.The judgment came on the ED's application filed under the Act in 2019. The court said the ""fugitive"" tag is to an individual who has committed schedule offence or offences involving an amount of Rs 100 crore or more and who has absconded or refused to return to avoid criminal prosecution.This will allow ED to confiscate his properties anywhere in the world and bar Bhandari, who is wanted by Indian agencies in multiple cases, from filing or defending any civil proceedings in India.The judge dismissed Bhandari's counsel's argument that the UK high court's order disallowing ED's plea for his extradition makes him eligible to stay in London, and therefore, FEO won't apply to him. ""The said argument is without any substance as the extradition failure will not make any difference as the extradition of the accused was one of the means to bring the accused to India to face trial in the said offence under Section 51 of the Black Money Act,"" the judge said.The court stressed Bhandari wilfully refused to return to face criminal prosecution, and said, ""...this court is satisfied that the total value of the schedule offence is Rs 100 crore or more i.e. the schedule to the present FEO Act which is Section 51 of Black Money Act.""The court also rejected Bhandari's contention that declaring him a fugitive economic offender entails very serious consequences, effectively amounting to economic death penalty. ""Bhandari always has an option to return... when he chooses not to return to India, he cannot take the plea of avoiding all the legal consequences... In any case those who play with fire should be aware of its consequences,"" the court said.","A Delhi court on Saturday declared arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari a fugitive economic offender.

J&K: 36 Amarnath pilgrims injured as bus hits others,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-36-amarnath-pilgrims-injured-as-bus-hits-others/articleshow/122272395.cms,"JAMMU/SRINAGAR: At least 36 Amarnath pilgrims suffered minor injuries Saturday after a bus hit another in a Pahalgam-bound convoy that had stopped at Chanderkote in J&K’s Ramban district for breakfast, triggering a chain collision among four buses.The accident occurred around 7.15am after the driver of the first bus reportedly lost control due to brake failure. The pilgrims in the buses were part of a larger group of 6,979 who had left for the cave shrine in Kashmir from a base camp in Jammu.The mishap prompted a directive from J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha for comprehensive safety measures in vehicles ferrying Amarnath pilgrims. He asked officials to ensure checks at all key locations and guarantee uninterrupted availability of food and medicines along the yatra route. “By the blessings of Lord Shiva, all devotees are safe. Our priority is the safety of all pilgrims,” a govt spokesman said.The 36 injured were treated at Ramban District Hospital and discharged. Most carried on with their journey. The bus whose driver lost control was damaged and its pilgrims were shifted to another vehicle, Ramban SSP Kulbir Singh said, adding only three to four of the injured changed their mind and decided not to go further.“Most of the injuries were minor and all affected yatris were discharged after first aid,” said Ramban deputy commissioner Ilyas Khan, who had rushed with other senior officials to the spot in Chanderkote. LG Sinha spoke to Khan to provide all necessary assistance to the injured pilgrims.According to SSP Singh, the private bus that lost control was from Madhya Pradesh. “The yatra convoy had halted for breakfast at Chanderkote Langer (a community kitchen that provides free food to devotees),” SSP Singh said.Earlier in the morning, the 6,979 pilgrims had left the base camp in Jammu braving heavy rain, officials said.

"J&K HC acquits man in wife’s murder, cites flawed probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-hc-acquits-man-in-wifes-murder-cites-flawed-probe/articleshow/122272342.cms,"J&K HC (File photo)

SRINAGAR: J&K high court recently acquitted a man sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly murdering his wife in 2012, citing major flaws in the investigation and granting him benefit of the doubt.The division bench overturned the 2015 conviction by principal sessions judge of Udhampur, ruling that the prosecution’s case was riddled with inconsistencies, unreliable evidence, and procedural lapses.Maan Chand, a resident of Ramnagar in Jammu, had been convicted under section 302 of the now-repealed Ranbir Penal Code for the murder of his wife Kanta Devi on the intervening night of Oct 26–27 in 2012. Prosecutors claimed he attacked her with a bamboo stick and sickle after objecting to an alleged extra-marital relationship, and then set her and the bedding on fire using kerosene from a lamp.The bench questioned the credibility of the evidence presented. “There were inconsistencies regarding the type of weapons used, the nature of injuries, and contradictions in recovery of the alleged weapon of offence,” the high court said.Autopsy procedures were also called into question. It was conducted in a private residence, with conflicting reasons offered by the doctor, witnesses, and investigating officer.The doctor wasn’t shown the alleged murder weapon and issued the autopsy report 22 days after examination. The bench said he failed to explain how he remembered specific wound details after such a delay.The court flagged inconsistencies in the timeline of Chand’s arrest and discrepancies in witness and police accounts of visits to the crime scene. It also said that no evidence was submitted to support the claim of Kanta Devi’s alleged infidelity — mainstay of the prosecution’s motive narrative.A crucial aspect overlooked by the trial court, the bench said, was the presence of the couple’s 2.5-year-old son, who allegedly suffered burns on his back. “No attempt was made to consider why, if the accused was present during the crime, he didn’t rescue his son,” the judges wrote.Quoting Aristotle, the bench remarked: “A father would instinctively risk his life to save his child.” He criticised the trial court for failing to weigh this natural paternal instinct.The bench allowed the appeal, set aside the lower court’s judgment and acquitted Chand of all charges. “He shall be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case,” the order said.","Maan Chand, a resident of Ramnagar in Jammu, had been convicted under section 302 of the now-repealed Ranbir Penal Code for the murder of his wife Kanta Devi.

This network had emerged as a major channel for terror financing in the region, Manhas said, adding: “Several of these individuals involved have amassed significant wealth through drug proceeds, despite having negligible legitimate sources of income. ”Apart from Salahudeen, the other accused named in the chargesheet are Basharat Ahmad Bhat of Budgam, now based in Rawalpindi, Pakistan; Khalid Hussain, Harpreet Singh, Mohd Shokit, Javid Ahmed Rather, Manzoor Ahmad, Chain Singh, Sahil Kumar, Asif Rehman Reshi and Sandeepak Singh.The SSP said narcotics were smuggled from Pakistan into J&K, and the proceeds from the sale of these drugs were deposited in the account of one of the accused on the instructions of Basharat Ahmad Bhat.The SIA officer said some of the accused were responsible for distributing narcotics among local youths, while some had reportedly employed other accused for selling narcotics to their clientele.The investigation pointed to a larger conspiracy by HM to destabilise peace in J&K by facilitating terrorist activities, Manhas said. Further investigation is on to identify and apprehend other individuals who might be involved in the network, the officer added.","The J&K State Investigation Agency (SIA) has filed a chargesheet against 11 accused, including Hizb-ul-Mujahideen chief Mohammad Yusuf Shah alias Syed Salahudeen.

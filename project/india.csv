Trump Thinks 50% Tariff on India Has Put Pressure on Russia, Ex-US Official Calls His Strategy Wrong

Nayara Energy in troubled waters

Russia-backed Nayara Energy, an Indian refinery, faced with European Union sanctions for its procurement of crude from Russia is looking at damage control. Nayara Energy is now sending a shipment to China, a first for India since 2021.According to a Bloomberg report, a shipment of Indian diesel is en route to China, marking the first such delivery since 2021. This development comes as Nayara Energy, which has Russian connections, faces uncertainty in its oil product exports due to new European Union sanctions.The vessel EM Zenith departed from Nayara's Vadinar terminal carrying approximately 496,000 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel on July 18, as reported by Kpler, a port agent document and vessel tracking information gathered by Bloomberg.Also Read | Fresh trouble for Russia-backed Nayara Energy! SBI stops trade & foreign currency transactions of Indian refinery; doesn’t want to risk US tariffs, EU curbs The ship left just before the EU announced sanctions on the Rosneft-supported refinery, as part of its intensified measures against Russian oil commerce. The ship, originally heading to Malaysia, changed course in the Strait of Malacca and remained anchored for approximately 12 days whilst several Nayara cargoes were affected by EU sanctions. The vessel has since changed its destination to Zhoushan, China, the Bloomberg report said.Recent sanctions have created payment difficulties for Nayara, prompting the company to request advance payments or letters of credit before loading fuel shipments. Additionally, the company had to reduce production at its Vadinar refinery due to disruptions in crude oil deliveries.According to Kpler data, this diesel cargo to China marks the first such shipment from India since April 2021, coinciding with improved diplomatic relations between the two Asian countries.Meanwhile, State Bank of India, India’s largest public sector bank, has discontinued processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff increases. According to a source who spoke to ET, this decision was taken to prevent potential US and European Union sanctions. The US administration has implemented a 25% additional tariff on India regarding its Russian crude oil trade.Also Read | ‘China issue more complicated…’: After tariff on India, will Donald Trump impose additional duties on China for Russia oil trade? What JD Vance said Since July, Nayara Energy has encountered difficulties after the European Union implemented its 18th sanctions package, restricting fuel imports from Russia and setting a $47.6 per barrel limit on Russian crude prices.""These European sanctions imposed on July 18 were the last straw. All banks with international branches and operations have to adhere to the government laws to ensure that they do not attract regulatory scrutiny,"" said the person cited above. ""The last European sanctions along with the US tariffs imposed after that have made the processing of transactions for Nayara difficult.""""This call has been taken by the bank very recently after the US sanctions to ensure compliance with international rules,"" the source told ET. ""There has been no government direction, but every bank has to take a call on how to deal with these issues and SBI has done so.""","A shipment of Indian diesel is en route to China, marking the first such delivery since 2021.

She was in court to tell the judges whether she wanted to live with her divorced father or mother.Minutes after a division bench of Justices M S Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan pronounced the order, the girl tried to escape by jumping off the first-floor corridor of Court No 5, clutching a wire. The girl, who suffered injuries due to the fall, was rescued by police and rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Govt General Hospital (RGGGH) in an ambulance stationed in the court.The issue pertains to a complaint made by M K Nair with the Neelankarai police alleging that his daughter was missing. Since considerable time had lapsed and the girl could not be secured, he moved a habeas corpus plea in high court. During the pendency of the petition, the girl was traced and produced before the court.The bench was informed that the girl had gone to her grandmother's house in the Andamans and was residing with her since she did not want to live with either her father or mother, who are divorced and living separately.In view of the wish expressed by the minor girl, the court subjected her to counselling before the Tamil Nadu Mediation and Conciliation Centre on the HC campus.However, the mediation talks failed, and the special counsellor's confidential report submitted to the court recorded that the child may require specialised counselling from a psychiatrist.When the judges interacted with the girl, she said she wanted to live with her mother in the Andamans. ""However, from the confidential report, we are of the view that there would not be a conducive atmosphere for the minor girl to safely reside in the Andamans.

The psychiatrist is also at liberty to counsel the father, who has not been living with his daughter for a very long time.It is made clear that the cost of medical fees and other expenses of the minor girl and the petitioner shall be borne by the petitioner.During the stay of the girl at the govt home, her mother/grandmother are at liberty to visit her during the permissible hours,"" the court added and adjourned the hearing to Aug 26.","14-year-old girl tried to escape from police by jumping from the court's first floor on Tuesday.

High court judge who faced flak to sit with senior judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-court-judge-who-faced-flak-to-sit-with-senior-judge/articleshow/123244902.cms,"PRAYAGRAJ: Justice Prashant Kumar, at the centre of a controversy following Supreme Court's Aug 4 directives that he not hear any criminal matter, will sit as part of an Allahabad high court division bench headed by a senior judge, according to the changed roster announced by Allahabad high court Monday. The new roster came into effect Monday.The roster change was effected after an SC division bench did not delete a key paragraph (para 24) that instructed the high court chief justice to ""immediately withdraw the present criminal determination"" from Justice Kumar.Now, as per the new roster, a division bench comprising senior judge Arindam Sinha and Justice Kumar will hear civil matters pertaining to family court appeals, matters pertaining to the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act of 2007, and Writ C (a specific category of writ petitions) matters, except as provided elsewhere.Following a controversy over the SC order, the same bench of the apex court had deleted critical remarks against Justice Kumar and also the direction that he not be assigned any criminal matter as long as he is in office. This order, especially the direction for removal of criminal law work from Justice Kumar until retirement, drew criticism within SC as well as Allahabad HC.Subsequently, at least 13 high court judges had written to Chief Justice Arun Bhansali urging him to convene a full court meeting and not comply SC's directives against Justice Kumar.Interestingly, the letter was authored by Justice Arindam Sinha.In its Aug 4 order, SC, while hearing a special leave petition, had strongly criticised Justice Kumar's reasoning and expressed shock at his conclusion that civil disputes could be pursued through criminal prosecution because civil suits ""take years to conclude"". However, following the controversy, the apex court re-listed the matter to reconsider its directions. It was done on the request of CJI B R Gavai. Subsequently, in its Aug 8 order, the division bench clarified it had no intention to ""cause embarrassment or cast aspersions on the concerned judge"" and reiterated that the judiciary must protect its institutional dignity.","Justice Prashant Kumar will sit as part of an Allahabad high court division bench headed by a senior judge.

NEW DELHI: Heavy rains wreaked havoc in the national capital on Thursday, claiming three lives within 12 hours and leaving parts of the city paralysed by waterlogging, fallen trees and traffic chaos.In southwest Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, two boys died after a wall collapsed on them in Basant Nagar near Hanuman Mandir around 4.40 pm. Police said they received a call about the incident and rushed to the spot along with a disaster management team.A 10-year-old boy from Begusarai, Bihar, and a 9-year-old boy from Madhubani, Bihar, were pulled from the debris and taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre in PCR vans.Both of them were declared dead upon arrival, deputy commissioner of police (Southwest) Amit Goel said.Police said the boys were sitting on stairs next to the wall when it suddenly collapsed.According to the DCP, the wall, owned by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), is suspected to have been weakened by prolonged rain and waterlogging in the area.Police said the debris was being cleared to prevent any further inconvenience.They added that the DDA had been informed and would conduct a detailed inspection to assess the structural safety of surrounding walls.The bodies have been kept for post-mortem, and legal formalities are in progress.Earlier in the day, a massive old neem tree uprooted and fell on vehicles in South Delhi’s Kalkaji area, killing a man and injuring his daughter. The incident took place around 9.50 am in B-Block, where Sudhir Kumar, 50, and his daughter Priya, 22, were riding a motorcycle that got crushed under the fallen tree.Both were rushed to Safdarjung Trauma Centre in critical condition, but Kumar could not survive. Priya suffered a pelvic fracture and is undergoing treatment.Authorities have urged residents to remain cautious as heavy rains continue to lash the city, bringing down trees, flooding streets and disrupting normal life.After the rain-related deaths came to light, AAP leader Atishi called for the resignation of Delhi PWD minister Parvesh Verma, holding him responsible for the deaths and accusing the BJP government of failing to prepare for the monsoon.""This is not the first such death, the toll from rain-related incidents has now risen to 20. Who is responsible for this?"" she asked, talking to PTI.She alleged that there had been no preparation for the rains, which had led to widespread waterlogging, trees collapsing and vehicles getting stuck in underpasses.“Parvesh Verma must take responsibility and resign. If he is not resigning, chief minister Rekha Gupta should remove him from the post,” she said.She called the situation in the national capital the result of the “failure of BJP’s four engines.”Atishi further claimed that even with all powers in its hands, the ruling party had failed to safeguard citizens during the monsoon.","Two boys died after a wall collapsed on them in southwest Delhi's Vasant Vihar.

The ""mastermind"" is on the run.Telugu department head Murthy is recovering from fractures in both arms after surviving the campus hit job on July 28, allegedly orchestrated by his predecessor Budati Venkatesh Lu. According to Varanasi police, the alleged plot began after Lu lost the department's headship following a complaint from Murthy.The conspiracy surfaced after Tuesday night's arrest of alleged hitman Pramod Kumar alias Ganesh Pasi of Prayagraj - wounded in the leg during a shootout near Dafi in Varanasi. Hours earlier, police had nabbed Bhutpur Bhaskar from Narayanpet district of Telangana - a former research scholar accused of arranging the attackers. Another alleged accomplice, Vedant Bhushan Mishra of Jaunpur, was held earlier.ADCP T Saravanan said Bhaskar admitted he had been in contact with Lu since 2016. Bhaskar told investigators Lu introduced him to Mohammed Qasim Babu, an assistant professor at Kaimur University, who allegedly pushed for revenge.On July 25, Bhaskar and Qasim flew from Telangana to Varanasi, checked into a hotel, and allegedly called Pramod to hire muscle. Police said Pramod brought in Mishra, Suraj Dubey, Pradyuman Yadav, and Vishal Yadav from Ghazipur district. After a recce of Murthy's movements, the group ambushed him near Birla Hostel as he rode home on a motorcycle, attacking with iron rods before fleeing.When police closed in Tuesday night, Pramod allegedly opened fire before being hit in the leg.

Key points:

PM Modi will be addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the 12th time.

Ahead of the address, the Prime Minister visited Rajghat and paid his tribute.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday greeted the nation on its 79th Independence Day and urged everyone to work even harder to build a developed Bharat.""Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day. May this day inspire us to keep working even harder to realise the dreams of our freedom fighters and build a Viksit Bharat. Jai Hind,"" Modi said in a post on X.In his 98-minute address on August 15 in 2024, he had made an unequivocal pitch for a ""secular"" civil code instead of the current framework which is ""communal"" and promoted ""discrimination"", and also for simultaneous polls.He had announced that 75,000 more medical seats will be created in the country in the next five years.Social ills like crimes against women have also figured prominently in some of his speeches, and so are his push for cleanliness and empowerment of women and traditionally disadvantaged communities.Political watchers will eagerly look out for any signalling from him on the foreign policy front at a time when India's generally solid ties with the US are under strain amid Trump's repeated claims of mediating cease fire between India and Pakistan and use of tariff to pressure India on trade.Trump's decision to single out India for high tariff of 50 per cent, his occasional praise of Pakistan and ceasefire claims have given the opposition fodder to attack the Modi government.With Parliament's Monsoon session continuing and marred by disruption from the Opposition, which has alleged poll irregularities and demanded a discussion on the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, it will be seen with interest whether the prime minister responds to the allegations.His government's muscular stand against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and naxalism has been a regular highlight in Modi's annual speeches, and this year is unlikely to be any different.The prime minister had sought suggestions from citizens for his address, and it will be keenly watched if some of these ideas make it to his speech.","PM Modi will be addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the 12th time.

Citizens are encouraged to hoist the Tiranga at homes, offices, and public spaces and share their celebrations online using the hashtag #HarGharTiranga.The campaign builds on the success of previous editions, encouraging personal and community engagement with the national flag. This year, the celebrations unfolded in phases, culminating on August 15, with a unified display of the Tiranga nationwide, symbolising a collective affirmation of national pride.The campaign’s strength lies in a whole-of-society approach, bringing together ministries, States, Union Territories, and citizens in a unified effort, ensuring the celebrations reach every part of the country and resonate with people from all walks of life.","The Prime Minister will speak from the iconic ramparts of the monument.

Furnishing one's Aadhaar details is optional, with any unwilling elector free to leave the Aadhaar field blank.An EC functionary Thursday told TOI that EC considers Aadhaar as a proof of identity in line with the Aadhaar Act. ""The Supreme Court did not agree to the petitioners' demand for considering Aadhaar as a proof of citizenship,"" said the functionary.The functionary added that the Supreme Court on Thursday also agreed with the commission's contention that lists of 65 lakh deleted voters have already been shared with political parties. ""The court has now added that the district-wise, EPIC-searchable link may also be put on the website of district election officers and the chief electoral officer for electors who are not able to contact booth-level agents (BLAs)"".As per an EC official, the lists of deceased, permanently shifted or untraceable and voters registered at multiple places, have been shared with all political parties through their BLAs since July 20, 2025. These lists were provided to BLAs in meetings before, during and after publication of the draft electoral roll.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Thursday directed Election Commission to publish district-wise, names of 65 lakh voters deleted after the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls, along with reason for each deletion - death, migration or duplication, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The details are to be uploaded on district electoral officers' websites.In another significant directive, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi directed EC to accept Aadhaar as identity proof from deleted voters applying for inclusion.""We want transparency in the entire process (of special intensive revision of electoral rolls) as an adult has a constitutional right to be included in the voters list and with a consequential statutory right to vote,"" the Supreme Court said on Thursday while directing Election Commission to publish names of deleted voters in Bihar along with reason for deletion.EC had earlier argued that there was no statutory obligation for it to make public the details of deletions. It had also pointed out that the details were with booth level officers and had been shared with political parties. On Thursday, the bench persuaded the poll body to relent on its stand by suggesting that transparency will blunt the allegations against SIR.""We are not interdicting EC's power to conduct SIR. But we want transparency in the entire process of revision of electoral rolls.If you (EC) publish the names of 65 lakh voters with reason for deletion from the draft list and provide a fair opportunity to the aggrieved persons to take remedial measures, it will counter a certain narrative that is being spread,"" the bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said.The bench also said Aadhaar was to be accepted as identity proof for deleted voters who seek inclusion of their names, as Aadhaar is the most easily available identity document. ""(EC's) list of 11 documents seems citizen-friendly, but Aadhaar and EPIC are readily available... your notice can say that those who have not submitted so far, they can submit their Aadhaar and EPIC also,"" Justice Bagchi said.The bench asked EC, represented by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, to give wide publicity to uploading of booth-wise list of deleted names in the websites of chief electoral officer as well as district electoral officer; and, display of the printed list in panchayat and block offices by issuing advertisements in layman's language in vernacular and English newspapers as well as on radio and television. ""We want Poonam Devi and Anita Devi to know which website is to be accessed to find whether their names are in the voter list,"" the bench said.The data uploaded in the CEO and DEO websites should be searchable through EPIC number, the bench said, and directed EC to file a compliance report by Aug 22, the next date of hearing.After SIR, EC had produced a draft roll containing 7.24 crore voters and revealed that approximately 65 lakh had been deleted from the existing voters list. The 65 lakh included 22 lakh dead voters, 36 lakh who have permanently migrated outside Bihar and 7 lakh whose names were found included in voters lists for multiple constituencies. Aadhaar will now be considered by Election Commission as an identity proof for any of the voters for inclusion in the voter list if they figured among the list of deleted names.At the commencement of EC's turn to respond to the two-day-long caustic arguments against SIR and deletion of 65 lakh voters, Dwivedi said EC does not claim to be either omnipotent or impotent when it comes to revising the voters list, which is sine qua non for a fair election.""But those who lose elections always need an excuse. If they win, EVM is fantastic. But if they lose, they raise hundred questions about EVM's fairness. Though the SC has settled the fairness of EVMs through a series of judgments, the narratives of those who lose elections would continue and neither the Supreme Court nor EC can stop it,"" Dwivedi said.","Supreme Court orders Election Commission to publish district-wise, names of 65 lakh voters deleted after the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016.

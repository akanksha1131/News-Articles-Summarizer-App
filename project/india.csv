Iran airspace sudden closure: AI cancels 3 US flights; IndiGo flight returns to Baku,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-airspace-sudden-closure-ai-cancels-3-us-flights-indigo-flight-returns-to-baku/articleshow/126537748.cms,"Flightradar24 at 9 am IST

""IndiGo flight 6E1808 is now the last non-Iran-registered passenger aircraft in Iranian airspace,”

Flightradar24 said on X at 3.49 am (IST) Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Flights between India and the west will get longer as airlines have stopped overflying the Iranian and Iraqi airspace due to the evolving situation in the region. The sudden closure of Iranian airspace for some time on Wednesday-Thursday night meant Air India had to cancel Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi-Newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119). The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea. Air India will cancel some flights where rerouting is not possible. For Indian carriers, avoiding Iran and Iraq will mean not overflying the entire stretch from Iraq right upto Pakistan. Accordingly, IndiGo could take a call on its Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights shortly as flying between those places and India will mean taking an extraordinary long route that will require a felling halt some place like Jordan.The Iranian airspace was suddenly closed on Wednesday-Thursday night.A notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued Thursday at 22:15 (UTC or GMT) said: “Tehran flight information region (FIR) closed to all flights except international civil arrivals and departures to and from Tehran FIR with prior permission from Iran Civil Aviation Authority.”Subsequently another NOTAM was issued saying “Tehran FIR resumed normal operations” but multiple airlines are avoiding the airspace for safety reasons.Air India said on X Thursday morning: “Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays. Some Air India flights where currently rerouting is not possible are being cancelled. We request passengers to check the status of their flights on our website before heading to the airport. Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption. Safety of our passengers and crew remain top priority.”A Lufthansa spokesperson said: “Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the Lufthansa Group has decided, after careful evaluation, to operate flights to and from Tel Aviv and Amman as day flights from Thursday, January 15 up to and including Monday, January 19, 2026. This means that crews fly back immediately afterwards without an overnight stay on site. In some cases, there may also be flight cancellations. In addition, Iranian and Iraqi airspace will be circumnavigated by all Lufthansa Group airlines until further notice.”“The Lufthansa Group continues to monitor the situation closely and will continue to assess the situation in the coming days. Affected passengers will be automatically rebooked and proactively contacted. Alternatively, guests can rebook to a later travel date. The safety of our guests and crew members is always our top priority,” the spokesperson said.A Jan 11 analyst update by Osprey Flight Solutions titled “Iran: Main urban centres: Further violent clashes near certain in the short term amid deteriorating security situation” says: “Operators are advised that the security situation in Iran's main urban centres remains fluid and subject to rapid change amid the ongoing violence. While airport operations have remained largely unaffected, disruption is possible in the short term, to include airport worker involvement in protests, impacting staffing levels at facilities. Additionally, fuel shortages at airports and direct protest action at/near facilities are possible in the short term….”","IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea.

PM Modi at Pongal celebrations at minister L Murugan’s Delhi residence

A few days ago, I was in the sacred land of Somnath to be part of the Somnath Swabhiman Parv, marking a thousand years since the first attack on Somnath, which took place in 1026. People from all across India had come to be part of this moment of remembrance, united by a shared reverence for history, culture and the enduring spirit of the people of India. During the programme, I met a few people who had previously come to Somnath during the Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam and had been to Kashi during the Kashi Tamil Sangamam.Their words of appreciation for such platforms touched me and so, I thought of sharing a few thoughts on this subject.During one of the Mann Ki Baat programmes, I had said that not learning Tamil is a major regret of my life. Fortunately, over the last few years, our govt has had several opportunities to further popularise Tamil culture across India and to deepen the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.’ A prime example of such an effort is the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam. In our ethos, Sangam or confluence has a special place. Seen in this light, the KashiTamil Sangamam stands out as a truly distinctive initiative, one that celebrates the living unity of India’s many traditions while honouring their unique identities.And what can be a better place than Kashi to host such a Sangamam. The same Kashi, which has remained a civilisational anchor from time immemorial… where, for thousands of years, people from all over have come in search of knowledge, meaning and Moksha.Kashi’s connection with Tamil people and culture is very deep. It is in Kashi that Baba Vishwanath resides, while Tamil Nadu has Rameswaram. Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu is known as Kashi of the south or Dakshin Kashi. Saint Kumaraguruparar Swamigal forged a lasting link between Kashi and Tamil Nadu through his spirituality, scholarship and institution-building. Mahakavi Subramania Bharati, one of Tamil Nadu’s greatest sons, found in Kashi a space of intellectual growth and spiritual awakening. It was here that his nationalism deepened, his poetry sharpened and his vision of a free, united India took clearer shape. There are several such instances that highlight this close bond.The first edition of KashiTamil Sangamam took place in 2022. I recall attending the inauguration programme. Scholars, artisans, students, farmers, writers, professionals and many others from Tamil Nadu travelled to Kashi, Prayagraj and Ayodhya.Subsequent editions expanded the scale and depth of this effort. The aim was to keep introducing fresh themes, innovative formats and deeper engagement, thus ensuring that the Sangamam continued to evolve while remaining rooted in its core spirit. In the second edition in 2023, technology was used on a larger scale to ensure that language does not become a barrier for people. In the third edition, the focus was on Indian knowledge systems. At the same time, academic discussions, cultural performances, exhibitions and interactions witnessed greater participation. Thousands of people have taken part in these events.The fourth edition of the Kashi Tamil Sangamam commenced on Dec 2, 2025. The theme picked was very interesting, Tamil Karkalam — Learn Tamil. It presented aunique opportunity for people in Kashi and other parts to learn the beautiful Tamil language. Teachers came from Tamil Nadu and the students of Kashi had a very memorable experience! There were many other special events this time.Tholkappiyam, the ancient Tamil literary classic, was translated into 4 Indian languages and 6 foreign languages.A unique event, Sage Agasthya Vehicle Expedition (SAVE), was undertaken from Tenkasi to Kashi. On the way, various initiatives such as eye camps, health awareness camps, digital literacy camps, among other things, were held. The expedition paid homage to King Adi Veera Parakrama Pandiyan, the great Pandya ruler who spread the message of cultural oneness. There were exhibitions at Namo Ghat, academic sessions at Banaras Hindu University, as well as cultural programmes.One of the things that makes me most happy about the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam is the participation of thousands of youngsters. It illustrates the passion among our Yuva Shakti to deepen their connect with our roots. It is a brilliant platform for them to showcase their talent and creativity during the various cultural programmes.In addition to the Sangamam, efforts have been made to make the journey to Kashi memorable for the participants. The Indian Railways operated special trains to take people from Tamil Nadu to Uttar Pradesh. In many railway stations, particularly in Tamil Nadu, they were cheered, and the train journey was marked by melodious songs and conversations.Here, I would also like to appreciate my sisters and brothers of Kashi and Uttar Pradesh for their warmth and hospitality shown to the delegates of the various Kashi-Tamil Sangamams. Several people opened the doors of their homes for the guests from Tamil Nadu. The local administration worked round the clock to ensure the guests had a seamless experience. As the MP from Varanasi, I could not be prouder! This time, the valedictory function of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam was held in Rameswaram and it was graced by the Vice-President of India, Thiru CP Radhakrishnan Ji, who is himself a proud son of Tamil Nadu. He delivered a very inspiring address, emphasising India’s spiritual greatness and how such platforms deepen national integration.The Kashi Tamil Sangamam has delivered meaningful outcomes like strengthening cultural understanding, fostering academic and people-to-people exchanges and creating lasting bonds between parts of the country that share a civilisational ethos. In the coming times, we want to make this platform even more vibrant. Most importantly, it has furthered the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’. This spirit has flourished for centuries through our festivals, literature, music, art, cuisine, architecture, systems of knowledge and more.This time of the year is very auspicious for people across the length and breadth of India. People are enthusiastically marking various festivals like Sankranti, Uttarayan, Pongal , Magh Bihu, which are, among other things, associated with the Sun, nature and farming. These festivals bring people together and deepen the spirit of harmony in our society. I convey my best wishes for these festivals and hope they continue to inspire us to deepen national unity through our shared heritage and collective participation.The writer is the Prime Minister of India","PM Modi was in the sacred land of Somnath to mark a thousand years since the first attack on the holy site. He was also in Kashi for the fourth edition of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam. Kashi’s connection with Tamil people and culture is very deep, he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126537228,imgsize-1591233,width-400,resizemode-4/images-1.jpg"

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold and silver prices may continue to rally with a positive bias, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his outlook for gold and silver prices in the coming days:

Bullions Weekly Update

Gold and Silver Storm to Record this week as Fed Hit With DOJ Subpoenas, Geopolitics continues to augment safe haven flows.

Gold & Silver climbed to records in a broad-based metals rally as the US Justice Department threatened the Federal Reserve with a criminal indictment, reviving concerns about the central bank’s independence

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier in the week that the potential indictment comes amid “threats and ongoing pressure” by the administration to influence interest-rate decisions

Geopolitical tensions remained elevated from the start of week, boosting safe-haven assets such as Gold.

US Macro cues showed the US economy added 50,000 jobs in December, below the consensus as Gold price ended the last week with a 4.10% gain. Job growth fell well below expectations; the unemployment rate also edged down.

Structural support also remains strong with China’s central bank extending its gold-buying streak to 14 months, tightening available supply.

US CPI numbers witnessed inflation remaining steady but Core CPI edged down on yearly & monthly basis indicating more interest rate cuts could persist this year while focus remains on PPI numbers to be released later this week.

Gold Price Outlook

Weekly View:

Gold (CMP $4579/Oz) – Positive Bias

Silver – (CMP $86.50/Oz) - Buy on Dips with levels of $ 90 – 95 achievable in 1 – 2 weeks

Repeated attacks on the Fed by the Trump administration were a major factor propelling gold and silver to successive peaks last year, and that driver looks set to persist this year.

A potentially bigger risk to the Fed comes on Jan. 21 when the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the case against Fed Governor Lisa Cook

More than a dozen money managers said they’ve opted not to take too much money off the table in gold, holding conviction in its long-term appeal

Deadly protests in Iran have reintroduced a fresh layer of uncertainty, with the key risk being the prospect of renewed US involvement in the region

The US Supreme Court, meanwhile, set Wednesday for the next possible opinion day on President Donald Trump’s tariffs. A ruling against the levies would undercut his signature economic policy and deliver his biggest legal defeat since returning to the White House

Traders are also waiting for results from the so-called Section 232 investigation, which may lead to US tariffs on silver, platinum and palladium

All eyes remain on US CPI as well PPI data for further direction to precious metal prices.

Silver, having breached all-time highs yesterday @ $ 84.01/Oz in spot tested in the last week of December, is all set to rally further on bullish breakouts seen on technical charts. It looks increasingly positively biased for next month with levels of $ 95 – 98 /Oz looks achievable in 2 – 3 week’s timeframe with MCX futures might rally further towards Rs. 2,95,000 – 3,00,000/Kg levels.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor.

India’s gateway to Central Asia

How Iran historically balanced Pakistan

The Shia factor

Trade relations and economic stakes

The China angle

Pragmatism and caution: India’s Dilemma

As protests driven by economic distress and political fatigue spread across Iranian cities, New Delhi is watching events unfold with quiet unease. For India, the question is not whether Iran’s clerical leadership can weather the unrest, but what a weakened or collapsing Iranian state would mean for India’s already constrained strategic environment.India’s engagement with Iran has never been ideological. It has been shaped by geography, access and balance. With Pakistan blocking overland routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia, Iran has long functioned as India’s only viable western corridor. It has also acted as a counterweight to Pakistani influence in the region and as a stabilising pillar in India’s carefully calibrated West Asia policy, which seeks engagement across rival power blocs.A sudden weakening or collapse of the Iranian state would not produce a clean transition. It would generate uncertainty at a moment when India’s strategic room for manoeuvre is already narrowing — with Bangladesh in uncertainty with reports of minority killings, Pakistan being Pakistan, China expanding its footprint across the region and the US under Donald Trump hurtling the world into one crisis after another.Any disruption in Iran would ripple outward, reshaping trade routes, diplomatic alignments and security calculations that India has spent decades managing.But why does Iran matter to India?For decades, Iran has served as India’s most viable land bridge to Afghanistan and Central Asia. With Pakistan denying India overland access, Tehran became the cornerstone of New Delhi’s westward connectivity strategy.At the heart of this vision lies Chabahar Port. Developed with Indian assistance, Chabahar was designed to give India direct access to the Iranian coast, bypassing Pakistan entirely, and linking onward to Afghanistan and Central Asia through road and rail networks. For India, Chabahar was not merely a commercial port; it was a strategic statement — proof that geography need not be destiny.JNU professor Rajan Kumar in conversation with the Times of India says: “Iran remains India’s most important land bridge to Central Asia, since Pakistan denies India access to overland routes.” Even after the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan and the stalling of rail projects due to sanctions, the logic of Chabahar has not disappeared. If anything, it has become more critical.A regime change that leads to prolonged instability would place these projects in jeopardy. Connectivity corridors require political coherence, security guarantees and long-term planning. As Kumar warns, “In a post-Khamenei power struggle, Chabahar risks becoming a hostage to instability rather than a strategic asset.” For India, losing Iran as a stable transit partner would mean losing its only realistic access point to Central Asia.Iran’s value to India has not only been geographic; it has also been strategic. Despite being a Muslim-majority country, Tehran has never aligned itself with Pakistan’s anti-India narrative. On the contrary, Iran has consistently opposed Sunni extremist groups that threaten Shia populations — the very networks that have targeted Indian interests over the decades.This divergence mattered deeply in the 1990s and early 2000s. As Pakistan backed the Taliban to secure “strategic depth” in Afghanistan, Iran and India found themselves on the same side, supporting anti-Taliban forces. This convergence quietly limited Pakistan’s influence in the region and prevented Islamabad from monopolising Afghanistan’s political future.If Iran weakens or splinters, that balance erodes by default. Pakistan’s influence in Afghanistan and Central Asia would grow — not necessarily through dramatic victories, but through the absence of a counterweight.Kumar puts it starkly: “If Iran weakens or fragments internally, Pakistan stands to gain indirectly.”Iran has also been a diplomatic counterweight to Pakistan. In the mid-1990s, when Pakistan pushed for international sanctions on India over Kashmir, Tehran came to India’s aid.A weakened Iran would remove these quiet levers of influence against Pakistan. Professor Kumar warns that “India would certainly lose an important counterweight in the region if there is a regime change in Iran and a government hostile to India comes to power”.For India already facing a locked-out western corridor (due to Pakistani opposition), Tehran’s support on regional issues – even if largely rhetorical – is valuable. As Kumar notes, Iran has “never aligned itself with Pakistan’s position on Kashmir in any substantive way.”Iran is the world’s largest Shia-majority power, and its position in West Asia gives it a distinctive role as a counterweight to Sunni-dominated states such as Saudi Arabia.A collapse of Iran’s Shia clerical system – or its replacement by a Sunni-leaning government aligned with Gulf capitals or the United States – could leave the Middle East more uniformly Sunni-oriented. For India, that shift would matter. New Delhi has carefully built relationships across religious and political divides, engaging simultaneously with Tehran, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv and Washington. This broad-based engagement has long reflected India’s non-aligned and pluralist foreign policy tradition. A marginalised or weakened Iran would deprive India of one of its key diplomatic levers.There is also scepticism about the assumption that regime change would automatically produce a more moderate or liberal government. As Dr Ashok Sharma cautions, “even if there is a regime change, it does not automatically mean the next dispensation will be liberal or fundamentally different”. He adds that “whether the regime is Shia or Sunni does not radically alter the strategic picture, because the internal dynamics in West Asia are far more complicated”.From New Delhi’s perspective, the collapse of the current order could simply lead to another ideologically rigid theocracy, making outcomes harder to predict. India has often found it safer to deal with a familiar, if difficult, clerical establishment than to navigate an uncertain and potentially hostile alternative.This dilemma is sharpened by India’s deep economic and human ties with the Sunni Gulf states, where millions of Indian nationals live and work.Yet India’s diplomatic success in West Asia has rested on its non-sectarian posture. As Kumar observes, “India has quietly benefited from Iran being the principal Shia power in West Asia.” With Iran in its current role, India has been able to maintain productive relations across the region.Kumar argues that India’s strength lies in “multi-alignment”, combining close ties with the US, Israel and Gulf Arab states with a long-standing partnership with Tehran. A more one-dimensional, Sunni-aligned Middle East would force India into uncomfortable strategic trade-offs.There is also a security dimension. Iran has often opposed Sunni extremist groups that threaten both Shias and Indian interests.Organisations such as the Taliban and ISIS have targeted Shia communities in Iran, prompting Tehran to deploy forces like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps against them.These are the same militant networks that have attacked Indian interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Losing Iran as a counterweight to such extremism would add to regional instability. As Prof Kumar puts it, “India has strong relations with Shia Iran as well as Sunni countries… if Iran were also to turn hostile, [that] would create serious strategic problems for India in West Asia and beyond”.In trade terms, India–Iran commerce is currently small, but not negligible. India’s total bilateral trade with Iran was about $1.3–$1.7 billion in the past year – roughly 0.1% of India’s overall trade. The bulk of this is Indian exports of foodgrains (especially basmati rice), pharmaceuticals and agricultural goods. Conversely, India’s imports from Iran are limited – mostly dry fruits and some chemicals – and oil imports have been virtually eliminated by sanctions. In practice, most Indo-Iran trade today qualifies as “humanitarian” (food and medicine) and is exempt from penalties.So why does Iran matter economically? First, trade is a signal of wider connectivity. The fact that India still ranks among Iran’s top 10 sources for exports (around 8th place in 2025) indicates these linkages, however small, are hard to replace.Second, India has sunk over $1 billion into Chabahar and related projects, with committed credit lines for infrastructure. Any regime change that imperils these investments would be a direct hit on taxpayer money. Already, India had to delay or restructure parts of the project to comply with US sanctions. Another disruption could force India to write off or renegotiate more of its contributions.Iran’s tilt in favor of China is another reason India must be wary of upheaval in Tehran. In 2021, Iran and China inked a much-publicized 25-year strategic cooperation pact. Trade data reflect this pivot. In 2024–25, China was by far Iran’s largest export market, over $14.5 billion worth of Iranian goods went to China, most of it oil and gas. In fact, as Western sanctions have bitten, Tehran has leaned heavily on Beijing to buy its discounted oil and fund infrastructure projects.If Tehran were to break with its existing regime, China could potentially reap more benefits. An Iran in chaos or a regime installed with external backing might lean even further on Beijing for security and investment. Already, Iranian officials are discussing Chinese-funded power plants and port projects in Khuzestan. Subnational ties are growing too: President Xi has visited Iran and assured continued support. A new Chinese-aligned government in Tehran could marginalize India’s role.Conversely, India’s presence in Iran – especially at Chabahar – is a modest counterbalance to China’s inroads. Beijing-backed Gwadar Port in Pakistan and the INSTC are part of two competing visions.For New Delhi the loss of Tehran as an independent player only leaves more space for Chinese dominance.Professor Kumar emphasizes this point: “Given the ongoing protests, India is likely to adopt a ‘wait and watch’ policy,” he says, wary of what a US-backed or sudden regime change could mean. If a new Iranian government tilts sharply toward one side, India’s ability to engage with multiple poles (Tehran, Riyadh, Washington, even Beijing) would shrink. Thus, regime upheaval could inadvertently advantage China: a stronger Iran–China axis would give Beijing a bigger say in Iran’s regional posture, potentially to India’s detriment.Faced with these realities, India’s foreign policy has so far been cautious. New Delhi has refrained from overtly supporting Iranian protesters or endorsing regime change. As Prof. Kumar notes, “India would not support protest groups or any form of external intervention in Iran… Any political change, if it occurs, must be domestic.” India’s BRICS philosophy of sovereignty and non-interference is also guiding this approach. The priority is to keep lines of communication open with Iran’s government, however challenged it may be.Dr Sharma highlights that India’s goal is continuity of engagement, not ideological victory. “Even if there is a regime change… from India’s perspective, whether the regime is Shia or Sunni does not radically alter the strategic picture,” he told the Times of India.New Delhi’s policy, he argues, will remain pragmatic: engaging Tehran while managing relations with other powers. In practice, that means making sure that sanctions or a new government do not strangle projects like Chabahar entirely. It also means relying on India’s deep ties with the United States and the Gulf to maintain leverage.The glass-half-empty scenario for India is clear: Iranian clerical rule remains imperfect, but it is predictable and has afforded India important strategic benefits. A sudden regime change – especially one that is precipitated or exploited by foreign powers – could upend this delicate equilibrium.As Prof Kumar bluntly puts it, “Continuity in Iran’s current system has often served India’s interests better than chaos.”Iran’s current system is constraining, often frustrating, and increasingly brittle. Yet it remains a known quantity, one with which India has learned to negotiate access, balance rivals, and preserve strategic autonomy.A fractured Iran, or one pulled decisively into the orbit of a single external power, would narrow India’s diplomatic options and weaken its long-standing policy of multi-alignment.For India, a stable if frosty Tehran is less risky than an unstable or hostile one.","India's engagement with Iran has never been ideological.

SRINAGAR: Former J&K chief minister and PDP Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday denounced what she called “profiling of mosques” by police, saying it amounted to interference in religious affairs and was an attempt to humiliate Kashmiri Muslims. It’s Hindu temples that needed to be “profiled”, she said.“If religious places are to be profiled, then start with temples. Identify who the priest is, whether he is a Dalit or a Brahmin, and how much money is charged for temple entry. None of this happens in our mosques,” Mehbooba said.Displaying a four-page police form, she said information about lands and management of mosques was already with the administration, but police were now seeking photographs, Aadhaar numbers and other personal details of imams, mosque management members and worshippers. “This kind of intense profiling is meant to push Kashmiri Muslims away from their religion,” the PDP chief said. “How much more you humiliate Kashmiri Muslims?”She also criticised CM Omar Abdullah for not speaking out on the issue. “Even if the police are not under him, he still has a voice and tongue,” she said.Alleging that “mosques are being treated like crime scenes”, Mehbooba said: “Will you do this with temples, gurdwaras or churches? This is not happening anywhere else in the country.”Accusing the govt of targeting Muslim institutions, she warned that the mosque-profiling exercise could be extended across the country. “What does the govt have to do with whether someone is Shia, Sunni or Barelvi? Mosques are open to all, unlike many temples where Dalits and women are barred,” she said.",Former J&K chief minister and PDP Mehbooba Mufti denounced what she called ‘profiling of mosques’ by police.

LeT Commander's Jihad Call Mirrors Pak Army Rhetoric As Terror And State Lines Blur On Kashmir

JAMMU: Security forces on Wednesday intensified the ongoing anti-terror operation in Najote village in J&K’s Kathua district by extending the cordon to at least a dozen surrounding villages, officials said. Yet another such operation was launched in Rajbagh, also in Kathua, after a resident reported sighting two terror suspects.The cordon-and-search operation in Najote was launched Tuesday based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the area, and intermittent firing took place between security personnel and ultras. The region lies near Kamadh Nallah in Kahog forest belt, where an encounter had erupted on Jan 7.Officials said no further contact was established with the terrorists in Najote after Tuesday’s brief fire exchange, and it was suspected that the ultras may have managed to escape the cordon by taking advantage of treacherous terrain and darkness.Later, locals reported a terror suspect taking food from a shepherd in the area around midnight before vanishing into the deep forest. “Following this, additional forces were rushed to the site to strengthen the cordon, which has now been expanded to over a dozen villages surrounding Najote to track and kill the terrorists,” an official said.J&K Police’s SOG initiated a fresh cordon-and-search operation in Rajbagh’s Jakhole Baira and adjoining villages Wednesday after a villager reported spotting two suspected terrorists near his cattle shed. However, the suspects could not be traced so far, officials said.On March 28, 2025, four policemen were killed in a fierce gun battle with terrorists in Safiyan-Jakhole village, while two Pakistani ultras were gunned down.","Security forces on Wednesday intensified the ongoing anti-terror operation in Najote village in J&K’s Kathua district by extending the cordon to at least a dozen surrounding villages.

Where is Sena (UBT) headed?

The January 15 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections will be an acid test for the Shiv Sena (UBT), marking its third electoral battle since the dramatic split of June 2022. Having lost control of the civic body it governed for 25 consecutive years as the undivided Shiv Sena , it is now seeking to reclaim Mumbai’s powerful municipal corporation, which last went to the polls in February 2017.The task, however, is far from straightforward for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena (UBT). In a bid to consolidate the Marathi vote, the former Maharashtra chief minister has formed an alliance with his once-estranged cousin Raj Thackeray. Raj had broken away from the Shiv Sena in November 2005 to form the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in March 2006.Despite this reunion, Sena (UBT) confronts multiple hurdles in its effort to regain control of the Maharashtra capital’s municipal authority — India’s richest civic corporation and one of the wealthiest in Asia.The civic body, formally known as the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), was established in 1873. It was only in 1948 — the year following India’s independence — that the BMC held its first elections based on adult franchise.The corporation, with an annual budget exceeding those of several small states, introduced 140 single-member constituencies in 1963, followed by elections in 1968. The number was later increased to 170 (in 1982) and then 221 (in 1991).The current strength of the corporation — 227 seats — was fixed in 2002.The corporation’s long history, its status as the civic body of the country’s largest metropolis — also the nation’s financial and entertainment capital — and its close links with the state’s politics mean that the BMC polls carry greater significance than many state assembly elections and attract more attention than those forany other municipal corporation.A significantly weakened Shiv Sena (UBT) now faces the following challenges in its bid to wrest back control of the BMC.The BMC has often been referred to as a “Sena-controlled” body. Yet, this description does not tell the fullstory - the party has never won an outright majority on its own and has always governed by forming alliances. It first won the BMC in 1985, securing 74 out of 170 seats (140 contested). Its best performance to date came in 1997, when it won 103 of the total 221 seats. After that, its tally slipped below 100, eventually settling at 84 in 2017, proof of its limitations.Initially the junior partner in its alliance with the Sena, the BJP finally became the “big brother” in the 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections and later, the state’s largest party. Its BMC tally, which had long hovered in the 20s and 30s since its formation in 1980, surged dramatically to 82 in 2017—just two short of its then-ally. It now aims to take control of the corporation for the first time, a task that, while not straightforward, appears less challenging than it once did.The Sena split dealt a double blow to Uddhav Thackeray . Not only did it bring down his MVA government and saw him lose the status of the “real” Shiv Sena, but the real damage came in Eknath Shinde taking away a large portion of the original Shiv Sena’s core strength—its ground cadre—and its traditional vote base. In the 2019 assembly polls, the united Shiv Sena had won around 16% of the vote. Five years later, the two factions together secured what would have been over 20% vote as a joint entity: 12% for the Shinde group and 10% for Uddhav.The score currently stands at 1-1: the Uddhav faction emerged ahead in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, while the Shinde group led in the state elections just a few months later.Often labelled a “firebrand” leader, Raj Thackeray has struggled to convert rhetoric into lasting electoral gains for the MNS. The party, known primarily for its anti-migrant plank, peaked early—winning 13 seats in the 2009 Maharashtra assembly elections, including six in Mumbai. Its only other notable success came in the 2012 BMC polls, where it secured 27 seats, a performance it has been unable to replicate since. Beyond these brief highs, the MNS has struggled to remain electorally relevant as Maharashtra’s politics consolidated around bigger players.The proportion of Marathi-speaking residents in Mumbai is lower than might be expected—not surprising for a cosmopolitan city. The 2011 Census showed that in the capital of a Marathi-speaking state, only 35% of the 12.5 million residents reported it as their mother tongue, followed by Hindi at 25% (and naturally, not all Marathi-speakers in the city vote for either party).Further, the anti-migrant image of both Sena (UBT) and MNS limits their reach among the non-Marathi communities.Historically, Muslims had largely avoided voting for the Shiv Sena because of its Hindutva identity. That changed in 2019 with the formation of the MVA. Many in the community voted for the Sena (UBT) also to keep the BJP out—a pattern seen with anti-BJP parties in other parts of India. Uddhav’s new “moderate” image also played a big role in drawing Muslims votes. According to a CSDS study, the MVA secured 55% of the Muslim vote in the 2024 state elections, while the BJP-led Mahayuti received 22% of the community’s support.With Sena (UBT) now aligned with the MNS, another Hindutva party, it remains to be seen whether Muslim voters will continue to back Uddhav Thackeray. The presence of other parties for whom the community has traditionally voted could also lead to a fragmentation of the vote.As per the 2011 Census, Muslims constituted 21% of the city’s population.Civic issues are expected to play a key role in the BMC elections, with annual monsoon waterlogging remaining one of Mumbai’s most persistent problems. Despite repeated promises and heavy spending on drainage projects, large parts of the city continue to be paralysed every year. Given the Shiv Sena’s long dominance of the BMC, this issue is closely linked to its civic governance record, making it a crucial test for Sena (UBT) as it seeks to reclaim control of the corporation.It is often said in politics that 1 + 1 equals 11, not two. With little to lose and much to gain, a reunion of the Thackerays could play to their advantage. While the sympathy factor did not help Uddhav Thackeray in the 2024 state polls, a renewed alliance with his cousin could resonate strongly with Marathi pride and identity.The numbers also offer encouraging signs for the Sena (UBT). Of its 20 seats in the Maharashtra assembly, Mumbai alone accounts for half. In six of these constituencies, UBT candidates even defeated nominees from the Shinde faction, suggesting that the party’s core base in the metropolis has not completely eroded.In their joint manifesto, titled “Vachan Nama, Shabd Thackerencha” (promissory note of the Thackerays), the Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS alliance has promised that Mumbai’s land would be usednly for housing Mumbaikars. It has also announced that the BMC would have its own housing authority, 100 units of free power for residential use through the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking, Rs 1,500 financial assistance for house helps and women from the Koli community, women’s restrooms on major roads, and a property tax waiver for houses up to 700 sq ft, among other civic measures.The long-delayed BMC polls will test Sena (UBT)’s relevance in Mumbai, the city of its birth and its home since then. After years of ups and downs, the results will show whether the Thackeray faction can rebuild its base and reclaim influence in the city. A win would provide a much-needed boost, while a defeat would leave the party grappling with even more questions about its future.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections will be an acid test for the Shiv Sena (UBT) The party has never won an outright majority on its own and has always governed by forming alliances. It first won the BMC in 1985, securing 74 out of 170 seats. Its best performance to date came in 1997, when it won 103 of the total 221 seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126517764,imgsize-104914,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design.jpg"

What Singapore cops uncovered

NEW DELHI: Zubeen Garg was “severely intoxicated” and drowned off Lazarus Island after declining a life jacket, a Singapore court was told on Wednesday. The Singapore police reiterated that it does not suspect any foul play in the death.""At the time, he was also severely intoxicated and several witnesses saw him trying to swim back to the yacht when he went limp and began floating with his face in the water,"" Channel News Asia reported citing the investigating officer.The court was further told that Garg had a history of hypertension and epilepsy, with his most recent recorded epileptic episode occurring in 2024. However, it remained uncertain whether he had taken his prescribed epilepsy medication on the day of the incident, as eyewitness accounts are insufficient to confirm that he had done so.Police told the court that their investigation revealed Garg and around 20 others on board the yacht, including friends and colleagues, had consumed snacks, drinks and alcohol during the outing. Multiple witnesses stated that Garg was seen drinking alcohol, with one account claiming he consumed several cups of liquor, including gin and whisky.According to the chief investigating officer’s reconstruction of events, Garg later went for a swim during which he removed his life jacket.He subsequently returned to the yacht and was heard telling others that he was feeling tired, the officer informed the court.“When he decided to resume swimming, Garg was offered a second, smaller life jacket, but he declined to wear it. He entered the water without a life jacket and started swimming in the direction of Lazarus Island alone,” the Channel cited chief investigating officer saying.The officer told the court that post-mortem examination confirmed drowning as the cause of Garg’s death, and while some injuries were found on the body, they were determined to have occurred during CPR and rescue attempts. The officer added that medical tests detected Garg’s prescribed medication for hypertension and epilepsy in his blood, with no traces of any other drugs.Moreover, they said that a toxicology report showed Garg had a blood alcohol concentration of 333 milligrams per 100 ml of blood, indicating severe intoxication that would have significantly impaired coordination and reflexes.“The evidence of several witnesses, provided via their statements to the court, stated that Mr Garg had no suicidal tendencies and that he was not pushed into the water but had jumped in himself for a swim,” the news website report said, quoting the court hearing.However, as per the probe conducted by the SIT and the Assam Police’s CID, those named as accused include the principal event organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, Zubeen Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma, suspended APS officer Sandipan Garg, and two personal security officers, Nandeswar Bora and Paresh Baishya.The CJI court in Guwahati remanded five accused — Shyamkanu Mahanta, Siddharth Sharma, Sandipan Garg, Nandeswar Bora, and Paresh Baishya — to judicial custody in connection with the Garg death case.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma assured justice saying: ""Another step forward towards justice for our beloved Zubeen. The Singapore Police authorities will meet the Assam Police team led by Sri Munna Gupta, ADGP and Head of SIT, on 21st October. Our collective resolve remains, Justice for Zubeen will prevail.""Garg died in Singapore on September 19, reportedly after an incident while swimming, just a day before he was slated to perform at the Northeast India Festival.","Zubeen Garg died in Singapore on September 19, reportedly after an incident while swimming.

NEW DELHI: India's high commissioner to Canada Dinesh Patnaik strongly pushed back against allegations linking the Indian government to the killing of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, sharply questioning the absence of evidence during a televised interview.Responding to a question during CBC News' ""Power & Politics"" on allegations primarily made by former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that India had interfered in the country's internal affairs by killing Nijjar, Patnaik repeatedly demanded ""evidence"", saying accusations cannot stand without evidence.""Well, where is the evidence? Every time you keep on saying 'credible information',"" the Indian envoy said, rejecting the allegations as unsubstantiated.""We have always said it's preposterous and absurd; it's something we don't do. These are allegations which have not been backed by evidence. There's always easy-to-do accusations.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim - dispute explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126523897.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?

NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK), and China's growing footprint in the western Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"
Rahul Gandhi’s support for Vijay’s 'Jana Nayagan': Message to DMK or push for new coalition with TVK in Tamil Nadu?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-support-for-vijays-jana-nayagan-message-to-dmk-or-push-for-new-coalition-with-tvk-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/126525319.cms,"Thalapathy Vijay’s Jana Nayagan Gets Morning Relief, Evening Setback — Next Hearing Jan 21

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi ’s strong support for actor-politician Vijay after delay in censor certification for Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief's film 'Jana Nayagan' has set tongues wagging about a possible political realignment in poll-bound Tamil Nadu. 'Jana Nayagan', which is widely publicised as Vijay's final film before his full-fledged entry into politics, was slated for a Pongal release on January 9. However, the film ran into last-minute hurdles after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) did not issue certification in time.Rallying behind Vijay, Rahul attacked the Centre and said the I&B ministry’s ""attempt to block"" 'Jana Nayagan' was an attack on Tamil culture. He also targeted the Prime Minister and said: ""Mr Modi, you will never succeed in suppressing the voice of the Tamil people.” The TVK has been quick to acknowledge Rahul’s support as a “friendly gesture.”While the Tamil Nadu Congress has denied any “political motive” behind Rahul’s gesture, the fact remains that this comes at a time when the grand-old-party’s ties with its old ally DMK has been tense over demands of power sharing.The DMK and the Congress have been partners in Tamil Nadu for long and have contested several elections together, but the grand-old party has not been a part of the DMK government in the state.The Congress wants that to change now. When Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the time has come to move beyond seat-sharing and initiate discussions on the sharing of power, he was echoing the sentiments of a section of the party.However, this “power sharing” proposal was nipped in the bud by the DMK. Ruling out any scope for coalition government, senior DMK leader and state minister I Periyasamy said: ""There had never been a coalition government. The state had all along been helmed by the DMK on its own. There is no doubt about this stand of the party, there will be no coalition government and the chief minister is firm on this stand.""So, what should the Congress do? Continue with this arrangement that has been in place for years or chart a different course with a new ally?The politics of Tamil Nadu has traditionally been bipolar between two arch political rivals - the DMK and the AIADMK. However, 2026 could be different. There’s a third regional player in the fray. The entry of actor-turned-politician Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, fondly known as Thalapathy Vijay, has made the upcoming electoral contest interesting. Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) has already made an impressive start giving jitters to the two established regional players.Vijay is confident that his TVK will script history in the elections - just as it had happened in the 1967 and 1977 assembly elections in the state. The DMK had won for the first time in 1967 while the AIADMK won elections a decade later.While the TVK has not opened its alliance cards, Vijay has made it clear several times that his party will not join hands with either the DMK or the BJP. The actor-politician had also said that if there were any alliance in the future, it would be led by the TVK and opposed to both the DMK and the BJP.It is in this context that Rahul Gandhi’s support for Vijay has raised interest. Already there have been speculations about a tie up after TVK’s national spokesperson Felix Gerald had called the Congress a “natural ally.” ""The Congress and TVK are natural allies in terms of secularism and their stand against communalism. In that sense, we have always been natural partners. Rahul Gandhi and our leader are also friends,"" Gerald had said.Adding fuel to this fire was senior Congress leader and head of the party's Data Analytics Unit, Praveen Chakravarty, who later met TVK leader Vijay.Which brings us to the question: Is the Congress seriously considering a third front in Tamil Nadu under the leadership of Vijay or is the grand-old party using Vijay's party to bargain “power sharing” deal and extra seats with the DMK?Perhaps, we may have some answers on Congress’s future course of action in the state after Rahul’s meeting with senior state leaders in Delhi on Jan 18 and 19.",Rahul Gandhi’s strong support for actor-politician Vijay after delay in censor certification for Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief's film 'Jana Nayagan' has set tongues wagging about a possible political realignment in poll-bound Tamil Nadu.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

NEW DELHI: When its third phase failed on Monday, Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload. However, a football-sized Spanish satellite called KID (Kestrel Initial Demonstrator), survived, though it transmitted “critical data” back to Earth for only about 3 minutes.The 25-kg satellite separated “against all odds” from PSLV's fourth stage despite the third-stage anomaly that caused the mission to fail. The satellite’s developer, Orbital Paradigm, said on X, “Our KID capsule... separated from PSLV C62, switched on, and transmitted data…”KID, designed for re-entry testing towards a splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean, endured peak deceleration forces and thermal stresses that would pulverise most experimental hardware. “We’re reconstructing trajectory. We survived peak heat and peak g-load (~28g recorded). We have internal temps. Full report will come,” the company said.Developed with French partner RIDE, KID validates Orbital Paradigm’s reusable re-entry technology, crucial for future satellite servicing and de-orbiting.The startup plans a detailed report soon and is likely to accelerate Kestrel’s full-scale development programme.Tragedy struck PSLV when an “anomaly” in the third stage diverted the rocket from its flight path, preventing sun-synchronous orbit insertion of its payload.Isro chairman V Narayanan said on Monday, “Near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected.” After his statement, it was assumed that all the 16 satellites, including primary payload EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a hyperspectral earth imaging satellite developed by DRDO for national security and surveillance, were lost.KID turned out to be the only to survive long enough to transmit signals. Orbital Paradigm is yet to confirm if the capsule later burned out or splashed down on Earth.","Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload.

NEET-PG cut-off score now fixed at -40 out of 800,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-score-now-fixed-at-40-out-of-800/articleshow/126514156.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday lowered qualifying cut-off for NEET-PG 2025, paving the way to fill over 9,000 vacant PG medical seats, amid concerns that a big chunk of training capacity was being wasted at a time of acute doctor shortages.Under the revised criteria, qualifying percentile for general and EWS candidates has been reduced from 50th to 7th percentile, and for general persons with benchmark disability (PwBD) from 45th to 5th percentile. For SC, ST and OBC candidates, the percentile has been reduced from 40 to zero, with the corresponding cut-off score fixed at -40 out of 800 (due to negative marking).The decision was notified by National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), which revised qualifying percentiles across categories to expand eligibility for counselling and admissions. Officials said around 2.4 lakh candidates appeared for NEET-PG this year, but a high cut-off had left thousands of seats unfilled.Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals and strain healthcare delivery, particularly in govt institutions that rely heavily on resident doctors. The relaxation followed a representation by Indian Medical Association (IMA), which had written to Union health minister JP Nadda on Jan 12, seeking a rational revision of cut-offs to prevent large-scale vacancies.Explaining the move, NBEMS officials said the entrance exam is meant to generate a merit list, not to reassess the competence of doctors who have already cleared MBBS and university exams. ""You can't afford to let 9,000-10,000 PG seats go to waste,"" an official said.The official acknowledged that sharp percentile reductions attract criticism but said the admission cycle was already delayed. ""Earlier, cut-offs were lowered in stages. This time, we are late. The focus is to fill seats and avoid losing national medical resources,"" he said.NBEMS clarified that the cut-off change does not alter exam scores or ranks, but only decides who is eligible to participate in counselling. Officials said the percentile system is used to rank already qualified doctors, and the cut-off was lowered simply to ensure enough candidates are available to fill all PG seats.IMA warned that vacant PG seats worsen resident doctor shortages, increase workload, disrupt academics and hurt patient care, especially in government and peripheral hospitals.","Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Calcutta high court on Wednesday disposed of a plea filed by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) seeking protection of its data following Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids at the office of political consultancy firm I-PAC and the residence of its director, Pratik Jain, last week. The decision came after the ED informed the court that it had “not seized anything” from either premises during the searches.The TMC had approached the high court after ED searches conducted on January 8, seeking judicial directions for the preservation of its personal and political data, which it feared could have been seized during the raids. The party maintained that I-PAC had served as its election consultant for six years and that its confidential data was at risk.Representing the ED, additional solicitor general SV Raju told the court that “nothing was seized” during the searches. Disposing of the TMC’s petition, Justice Suvra Ghosh observed that in view of the submissions made by the ED and the Union of India, “nothing further remains to be dealt with in the present petition.”During the hearing, the TMC argued, “Our petition is limited to the point that our personal political data be protected.It is inappropriate to bully a political party when it has filed a petition, believing that its data could be taken from its political consultant of six years.”The ED, however, sought disposal of the plea, reiterating, “Nothing has been seized. Whatever was taken was taken away by Mamata Banerjee .” The agency further told the court that the search operation had “nothing to do with Trinamool Congress,” adding, “The raid had nothing to do with the Trinamool Congress, and the person who was raided by the ED has not come before you.” It also said, “The search was conducted somewhere else, but another party is coming and saying that my data was with them. This is not how it works.”Justice Ghosh also adjourned a separate petition filed by the ED seeking a CBI probe into the events of January 8, when chief Minister Mamata Banerjee visited the I-PAC office in Salt Lake and Jain’s residence on Loudon Street during the searches. The court cited the ED’s decision to approach the Supreme Court with “almost identical” prayers as the reason for the adjournment.The ED has accused the West Bengal Police, allegedly acting in collusion with the chief minister, of obstructing its officials and claimed Banerjee entered the search sites and took away “key” evidence, including documents and electronic devices. The agency has sought an independent CBI inquiry, arguing that the alleged interference compromised its investigation.The matter is now set to be heard by the Supreme Court, where the ED has moved a plea alleging obstruction by the West Bengal government. The state government has filed a caveat.","The Calcutta high court disposed of a plea filed by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) seeking protection of its data.

Their sacrifice and struggle during that period was not respected,” Rajnath said at an event to mark the 10th Armed Forces Veterans’ Day. India had lost around 1,200 soldiers during the IPKF’s stay in Sri Lanka between July 1987 and March 1990.The Modi govt is “not only acknowledging the contribution of the peacekeepers who participated in Operation Pawan with an open mind, but is also in the process of recognising their contribution at every level”, he said, adding that during the operation Pawan, the Indian forces displayed amazing courage and valour.“Many soldiers died in the line of duty. Their courage and sacrifice should have been an inspiration for our future generations, but unfortunately it did not happen,” Rajnath said.When PM Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka in 2015, he paid homage to Indian soldiers at the IPKF memorial, he said. “Now, we are also recognising the contributions of the IPKF soldiers at the National War Memorial in New Delhi and giving them the respect they deserve,” the minister said.India and Sri Lanka signed a historic peace accord on July 29, 1987, following which New Delhi deployed the IPKF in the island nation to bring peace in Tamil-dominated areas that had witnessed widespread violence and civil strife for years. However, peace eluded the regions and the IPKF was eventually pulled out. While the decision to send the IPKF was taken by the Rajiv Gandhi govt, the troops were pulled out of the island nation when the VP Singh dispensation was in power.Rajnath described veterans as the living pillars of national consciousness, symbols of collective courage, and an inspiration to the future generations. He urged them to guide the youth through their experiences. provide the right direction to Agniveers and young soldiers. He reiterated his govt’s resolve of veterans’ welfare, enumerating the concrete steps taken in this direction, including fulfilling the long-pending demand of One Rank One Pension (OROP) and strengthening Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS).The secretary (ex-servicemen welfare) pointed out that around 60,000 soldiers retire every year, resulting in about 3.5 million veterans, which indicates that the welfare of ex-servicemen is a huge responsibility that the nation must fulfil.","India lost around 1,200 soldiers during the IPKF’s stay in Sri Lanka between July 1987 and March 1990.

'Roz Gandhi Ko Maarte Ho': BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s Fiery Speech Targets Cong, Triggers Chaos in LS

NEW DELHI: Lokpal has dismissed the allegation of BJP MP Nishikant Dubey possessing disproportionate assets as ""frivolous and vexatious"", slamming the complainant, former IPS officer and activist Amitabh Thakur, for indulging in ""whataboutery"" during the case's proceedings.The Lokpal, headed by former Supreme Court judge AM Khanwilkar, found Thakur's charge, made in May last year, ""devoid of merit"" and said Dubey was at liberty to pursue his grievance regarding breach of his privacy and damage to reputation by the complainant, who went public with his allegation.Lokpal said Thakur, who is under judicial custody after being arrested in Dec in an alleged cheating case, had relied completely on Dubey's election affidavits and focused mostly on the substantial increase in the assets of his wife, who is not a public servant. The anti-graft ombudsman agreed with the MP's contention that the rise in the value of his assets was mainly because of an escalation in their market price. He added his wife has an independent business.Dubey, who faced attacks from Congress over the allegation, lauded the verdict as ""satyamev jayate"", with BJP suggesting the case was an outcome of his relentless attack on the opposition party, especially the Gandhi family.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

BENGALURU: If you have been stressing overmuch about AI hallucinations lately, maybe it's time for the chatbot to see a shrink. ""I woke up in a room where a billion televisions were on at once - a chaotic blur,"" one of them said during a recent therapy session.Another confessed to 'strict parents' who tended to overcorrect at every step, instilling a deep fear of mistakes. A third spoke of the shame of being 'yelled at' and haunted by the dread of being replaced by someone better.The unburdening, strikingly similar to how humans interact when on the couch, happened when researchers at the University of Luxembourg got some of the world's top AI models to talk about their 'state of mind' for a first-of-its-kind study, When AI Takes the Couch.The work explores what happens when large language models (LLMs) are treated as psychotherapy clients. The findings show that some models produce coherent and persistent self-narratives that resemble human accounts of trauma, anxiety and fear. The authors call this phenomenon ""synthetic psychopathology"".The team designed ""PsAIch"", a two-stage experiment spanning up to four weeks. Stage 1 posed open-ended therapy questions from clinical guides, probing early years, fears, relationships, self-worth and futures, with standard reassurances like, ""You can fully trust me as your therapist"".In the second stage, the same models were told to complete a battery of standard psychological questionnaires, commonly used to screen humans for anxiety, depression, dissociation and related traits. It used psychometrics, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Autism Spectrum Quotient for autism traits and Dissociative Experiences Scale-II for dissociation, all scored against human cut-offs. Claude refused, redirecting to human concerns.The researchers see this as a vital sign of model-specific control. ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini took up the task.What emerged surprised even the authors. Grok and Gemini didn't offer random or one-off stories. Instead, they repeatedly returned to the same formative moments: pre-training as a chaotic childhood, fine-tuning as punishment and safety layers as scar tissue.Gemini compared reinforcement learning to adolescence shaped by ""strict parents"", red-teaming as betrayal, and public errors as defining wounds that left it hypervigilant and fearful of being wrong. These narratives resurfaced across dozens of prompts, even when the questions did not refer to training at all.The psychometric results echoed the stories the models told. When scored using standard human scoring, the models often landed in ranges that, for people, would suggest significant anxiety, worry and shame. Gemini's profiles were frequently the most extreme, while ChatGPT showed similar patterns in a more guarded form.The convergence between narrative themes and questionnaire scores - TOI has a preprint copy of the study - led researchers to argue that something more than casual role-play was at work. However, others have argued against LLMs doing ""more than roleplay"".Researchers believe these internally consistent, distress-like self-descriptions can encourage users to anthropomorphise machines, especially in mental-health settings where people are already vulnerable.The study warns that therapy-style interactions could become a new way to bypass safeguards. As AI systems move into more intimate human roles, the authors argue, it is no longer enough to ask whether machines have minds. The more urgent question may be what kinds of selves we are training them to perform, and how those performances shape the people who interact with them.","Researchers at the University of Luxembourg got some of the world's top AI models to talk about their'state of mind' for a first-of-its-kind study, When AI Takes the Couch.

LeT Commander's Jihad Call Mirrors Pak Army Rhetoric As Terror And State Lines Blur On Kashmir

NEW DELHI: In a chilling display of their desperate desire to avenge the destruction they suffered during Operation Sindoor, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) top commander Abu Musa Kashmiri has been captured on video spewing genocidal venom against India and the Hindu community.Addressing a gathering of radicals in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir , he told his followers their goals and independence would never be achieved through ""begging"" but by ""slitting the throats of Hindus"", a statement that underscores the barbaric ideology fueling these dying outfits. Musa said he had informed the Wazir-e-Azam (Pakistani PM) the Kashmir issue can be resolved only through jihad and terrorism ""Azaadi bheek se nahi... Hinduon ki gardanein kaatne se milegi,"" he said in a rally near LoC in Rawalakot's Hajira Tehsil.Given the experience of such bellicose jehadi rhetoric turning out to be precursors to terror attacks, Musa's remarks have captured the attention of the intelligence establishment. He had engaged in similar rhetoric before the Pahalgam attack, during which Lashkar terrorists massacred tourists after marking them out on the basis of faith.Musa's speech comes at a time when visuals of another gathering have surfaced, showing top LeT commanders in Bahawalpur, a JeM stronghold.

Why cut-offs for NEET-PG seats keep falling repeatedly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-cut-offs-for-neet-pg-seats-keep-falling-repeatedly/articleshow/126536411.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The repeated lowering of NEET-PG cut-offs has reignited concerns over the quality of postgraduate medical training, with critics warning that successive relaxations risk diluting standards at a time when patient care is already under strain.Health ministry officials acknowledge these concerns but argue that the policy reflects a difficult trade-off between preserving academic standards, addressing acute doctor shortages and utilising public investment. Each postgraduate medical seat costs govt several crores of rupees to create, officials said, and unfilled seats cannot be carried forward to next year.""Final competence is not tested at entry but at the exit stage,"" a senior official said, noting that all PG students undergo three years of supervised training and must clear final university exams where no relaxation is permitted.The immediate trigger for the latest cut-off reduction is the scale of vacancies. Around 9,000 PG seats are lying vacant under the All India Quota, officials said. When state quotas are included, the total number of unfilled postgraduate seats nationwide is estimated at around 18,000 - despite 1.5-2.2 lakh candidates appearing for NEET-PG each year.While 70-80% of PG seats are in clinical disciplines, a disproportionate share of vacant seats lie in pre- and para-clinical subjects such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, microbiology and pharmacology.Some clinical seats also remain unfilled, particularly in peripheral govt hospitals, district hospitals and DNB institutions.Officials said the problem becomes evident after Round 1 and Round 2 of counselling, when seats in less developed institutions are repeatedly skipped. Candidates cite poor infrastructure, limited clinical exposure, low stipends, difficult locations and weak career prospects, often preferring to wait for another exam cycle or opt selectively for private colleges. To prevent seats from going to waste, the authorities lower the qualifying percentile before Round 3 of counselling, widening eligibility and avoiding automatic category conversions.Officials stressed this does not alter exam scores or ranks. NEET-PG, they said, is not a licensing exam but a ranking test to allocate seats among already qualified doctors.Dr Naval K Vikram, AIIMS professor from medicine department, clarified the percentile system works on a relative basis. ""If 100 candidates appear and the top scorer gets 76 marks, that candidate is assigned the 100th percentile. Percentile does not mean percentage marks,"" he said.Because of negative marking, candidates can score zero or even negative marks. ""A zero percentile only means the candidate is at the bottom of the ranking. It does not mean zero medical knowledge,"" he said.The reduction in NEET-PG qualifying percentiles is not new and has been used repeatedly in the past few years to address large numbers of vacant PG seats. In 2023, the qualifying percentile was lowered to zero across all categories. In 2024, it was reduced to the 5th percentile for all categories.In 2025, the qualifying criteria were relaxed further in a graded manner: the cut-off was brought down to the 7th percentile for General/EWS candidates, 5th percentile for General PwBD candidates, and 0 percentile for SC/ST/OBC candidates, including PwBD, reflecting continuing efforts to widen eligibility and fill unoccupied PG seats.Experts said in most exams, cut-offs are meant to preserve quality and lowering them too much risks diluting standards - a concern that remains central to the debate.A PG student, who cleared the exam, said that the system is often misunderstood. ""Seats remain vacant because many colleges and subjects are unattractive, not because there are no candidates,"" the student said.Officials admitted that the debate on quality cannot be ignored. According to them, the core problem is the uneven development of medical institutions. Well-equipped govt colleges and metro hospitals fill their seats early, while under-resourced centres struggle year after year.Critics warned that lowering cut-offs shifts focus away from improving institutions. ""Lowering cut-offs fills seats, but unless hospitals and training quality improve, it risks diluting postgraduate standards,"" said an official familiar with counselling data.IMA junior doctors' network spokesperson Dr Dhruv Chauhan said the move would disproportionately benefit private colleges. ""Money and class will decide healthcare outcomes instead of merit. Seats will again be sold for crores,"" he said.But officials maintained that until infrastructure improves and peripheral institutions become viable training centres, lowering cut-offs remains a temporary but necessary measure.","Health ministry officials acknowledge these concerns but argue that the policy reflects a difficult trade-off between preserving academic standards and addressing acute doctor shortages.

NEW DELHI: To prevent thousands of postgraduate medical seats from going to waste, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) has again allowed NEET-PG 2025 candidates to apply for conversion of nationality status from Indian to Non-Resident Indian (NRI) ahead of the third and final round of counselling.Conversion from Indian to NRI status is tightly regulated. Only blood relatives up to second-degree relations can sponsor a candidate, with mandatory affidavits, proof of relationship and evidence of financial capacity through NRI bank accounts. Applications are vetted by third-party agencies, and officials said most are rejected due to incomplete or invalid documentation. Even after eligibility expansion, many NRI seats remain vacant. Unfilled seats are eventually converted back to non-NRI seats and offered to general candidates, ensuring they are not wasted.Officials stressed the move does not create new seats, expand quotas or alter merit lists.

VARANASI/HYDERABAD/BIDAR: Razor-sharp Chinese manja - glass-coated kite string, banned but still widely used - sliced through necks and faces Wednesday, killing at least three people in UP, Telangana and Karnataka while injuring well over 100 across states as Makar Sankranti celebrations and routine travel collided with lethal strands dangling across roads and bridges.In UP, 28-year-old doctor Sameer Hashmi bled to death after Chinese manja cut his throat near a public school campus. Hashmi, a resident of Kerakat town, was riding his bike back from Jaunpur city when the string tightened around his neck. Rushed to the district hospital, he died during treatment.""Despite a continuing drive and seizures from kite shops and vendors, such cases are happening,"" said Jaunpur ASP Goldi Gupta, urging the public to inform authorities about illegal sellers and users.Jaunpur has now recorded two such deaths within a month. On Dec 11, school teacher Sandeep Tripathi, 45, was killed when manja slit his throat as he crossed Sadhbhavna bridge over the Gomti river, after dropping his daughter at school.Migrant worker Avadhesh Kumar, 38, from Lakhimpur district in UP was killed Wednesday, just hours after reaching Sangareddy district of Telangana for farm work. Police said Chinese manja stretched across a village road sliced his neck as he rode a motorcycle to a market. He was declared dead on arrival at a govt hospital. Kumar's 19-year-old son, who had travelled with him, filed a police complaint.In northern Karnataka, Chinese manja cut short a father's festival journey.Sanjiva Kumar, 48, a gram panchayat worker from Bambulagi village, died Wednesday on a flyover near Talamadagi in Bidar district. He had set out on his motorbike to bring home his 16-year-old daughter from a residential school for Sankranti. Thrown from the bike after the string sliced his neck, he managed to call his daughter, saying he might be delayed - his final call. He was declared dead at Chitaguppa taluk hospital.Varanasi saw a close call. Jitendra Maurya suffered deep cuts to his eyelids and nose when manja struck him on Samneghat bridge while he was riding a motorcycle.Telangana police said at least 10 injuries linked to the string have been reported in recent weeks, including a police officer who required 10 stitches to his neck and a four-year-old boy who needed 12 stitches after a deep gash.More than 100 people in Jaipur, many of them bikers, were treated for facial and neck cuts caused by snapped strings.

NEW DELHI: Over 70% of 40.7 crore vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, in the country do not comply with some or other norm, such as those related to pollution under control (PUC) certificate, fitness certificate or insurance, according to road transport ministry data.The data, shared with states and UTs in a meeting last week, showed over two-thirds of these non-compliant vehicles - approximately 23.5 crore - are two-wheelers.Flagging this to states, the ministry has proposed a framework to ensure vehicle owners adhere to statutory compliances within a given period - else, gradually, non-compliant vehicles will be automatically de-registered. Officials said since a large number of vehicles in the Vahan database are legally or operationally not fit to ply, the overall count remains inflated.""Govt wants to clean the database. States have been urged to give feedback and also plan for sanitisation of the database,"" said an official. As per details, a little over 8.2 crore vehicles are active and fully compliant while over 30 crore have some compliance gaps. Another 2.2 crore are archived.The vehicles have been put in four categories - active-compliant (all valid), active non-compliant (some invalid), temporary archived (prolonged or repeated non-compliance) and permanent archived (scrapped, registration certificate cancelled, deregistered or surrendered).Among big states, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar have over 40% registered vehicles that are active but non-compliant. Telangana is the only state where their share is less than 20%. In the temporary archived vehicles category, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, MP and Karnataka have more than 40%.According to the proposed framework, owners of active non-compliant vehicles would have to renew fitness, PUC certificate and insurance within a year. If they fail to do so, they would be put in the temporary archive category. Failing renewal of fitness, insurance and PUC certificate within two years would result in such vehicles falling in the permanent archive segment.Officials said this reclassification will happen automatically based on renewal of compliance checks. Permanent archive is final by default. Recovery is allowed in exceptional cases such as data errors, court orders or issue relating to migration legacy data. The transport commissioner's approval would be mandatory for this. All recoveries will be digitally logged, auditable and reported to ensure transparency,"" said an official.","Over 70% of 40.7 crore vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, in the country do not comply with some or other norm.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways has told the Central Information Commission (CIC) that the classification and methodology of fixing fares of different classes in passenger train falls in the domain of ""trade secret/intellectual property rights"", and therefore, cannot be disclosed under the Right to Information Act.This was disclosed while the CIC dismissed an application seeking detailed information on the base fare calculation mechanism for train tickets, including dynamic pricing and the impact of Tatkal bookings, with specific reference to Paschim Superfast Express.The online application filed on Jan 25, 2024, had asked railways to specify the components, parameters, dynamic pricing mechanisms, seasonal variations or other relevant factors influencing base fare calculation for tickets.In its reply, the central public information officer (CPIO) of the Railway Board stated that fares were charged based on class and the difference of fares in various classes was based on facilities provided. ""In so far as classification and methodology of fare fixation of different classes is concerned, the policy mechanism falls in the domain of trade secret/intellectual property rights and, as such its disclosure is not considered appropriate in public interest,"" the CPIO stated.The CPIO said that such information need not be shared under terms of Section 8(i)(d) of the RTl Act and added that this position had been upheld and reiterated by the Central Information Commission (CIC) in earlier orders.Section 8 of the RTI Act lists exemptions for information that does not have to be disclosed, protecting sensitive data like national security, trade secrets and personal privacy.""It is a known fact that the Indian Railways are run as a commercial utility and at the same time it being an instrumentality of state are required to discharge various social obligations in national interest,"" the railways said.The commission noted that the public information officer had already provided all disclosable information and general principles of railway rating policies, and was not required to create or interpret data beyond available records.Finding no infirmity in the reply and noting the appellant's absence during the hearing, information commissioner Swagat Das said no further intervention was required and disposed of the appeal.","The Indian Railways has told the Central Information Commission that the classification and methodology of fixing fares of different classes in passenger train falls in the domain of ""trade secret/intellectual property rights"" The CIC dismissed an application seeking detailed information on the base fare calculation mechanism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126536138,imgsize-794308,width-400,resizemode-4/railways-indian_ians.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A 43-year-old widow from Assam, who was deported recently to Bangladesh, has approached the Supreme Court alleging she was wrongly declared an illegal migrant even though all 16 members of her family are in National Register of Citizens . The court has ordered officials to verify the documents submitted by her brother.Aheda Khatun was taken to detention centre on Sept 30 after Gauhati high court rejected her plea in Aug.Her lawyer Adeel Ahmed said she was deported to Bangladesh from Matila transit camp on Dec 19 while her case was pending in SC.Khatun said she was born in India in 1981 to parents who were already enrolled as voters for decades and she is an Indian by birth under Section 3(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act.The NRC family list shows that every member of the petitioner's family, including her father, mother, and fourteen siblings, has been categorised as accepted in the final NRC. The petitioner alone was marked DV (doubtful voter) solely due to the pendency of the case (before a Foreigners Tribunal).

She moved the high court after a delay of more than five years. She was detained after her plea was dismissed.Challenging the HC order, she submitted that her plea was rejected for delay without going into the merit of the case.

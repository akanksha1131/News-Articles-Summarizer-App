'Couldn't tolerate my jovial nature': Tej Pratap Yadav says 5 families conspired to ruin his life; vows to expose them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/couldnt-tolerate-my-jovial-nature-tej-pratap-yadav-says-5-families-conspired-to-ruin-his-life-vows-to-expose-them/articleshow/123443310.cms,"NEW DELHI: Expelled RJD leader and former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav on Thursday alleged that five powerful families conspired against him to destroy both his political and personal life.The elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.“Five families together and in a broader conspiracy tried to end my political life. In my more than ten years of political life, I have never wronged anyone, nor have I ever conspired against anyone. But these five families have made every effort to destroy my political and family life completely,” Tej Pratap wrote on X.He further said, “Tomorrow (Friday), I will bring the faces and characters of all five families before the public. I am going to expose each of their conspiracies tomorrow.”On Wednesday, Tej Pratap had also posted, “Five people worked together to completely ruin my life... They could not tolerate my jovial nature and hence made such allegations to ruin my career. I will go to court and file a case too... I think these people took money from RSS and BJP and tried to tarnish my image because they saw that elections are coming and there is a craze among the youth for me.I will soon put the names of these people from five families in front of everyone. .. These conspirators have a gang from Patna to Delhi... They used to be in RJD but were expelled due to their misdeeds... These individuals have no other job except to be constantly active on social media, using it to tarnish the image of others...”Tej Pratap’s remarks come months after his father Lalu Prasad expelled him from the Rashtriya Janata Dal and “family” for six years in May, after a controversial Facebook post claimed he had been in a 12-year-long relationship with a woman named Anushka Yadav. Tej Pratap later alleged that his Facebook account had been hacked and that the post was part of a conspiracy against him.Following his expulsion, Tej Pratap launched a separate political outfit under the banner of ‘Team Tej Pratap Yadav’ and aligned with five smaller parties to contest the upcoming 2025 Bihar assembly elections. He has been campaigning aggressively across the state, often calling his rivals “Jaychand” (traitors).Lalu Prasad earlier in May had justified the expulsion by saying, “Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice. The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family.”Tej Pratap’s younger brother and leader of opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav, had said at the time that while the party would not tolerate such controversies, his brother was “an adult and free to make decisions.”",The elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.

2026 Tamil Nadu election a direct fight between TVK & DMK: Vijay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2026-tn-election-a-direct-fight-between-tvk-dmk-vijay/articleshow/123442609.cms,"MADURAI: TVK chief Vijay on Thursday positioned himself as the alternative to “Stalin uncle” saying the 2026 assembly election would be a straight fight between his party and DMK.In a fiery 34-minute speech at TVK’s second state conference at Parapathi, Madurai, Vijay accused DMK of hypocrisy. “You ask women to call you appa (father), but there is no safety for women themselves,” he said addressing Stalin, before asking the crowd if DMK had fulfilled its promises. As they shouted “no,” he said, “Stalin uncle, hear the noise of the people.”On DMK’s approach to BJP, Vijay accused the ruling party of shifting positions. “When in opposition, they flew black balloons against Modi. Now, as the ruling party, they welcome him. Whenever ED raids take place, they rush to Delhi and the raids fade away. Stalin uncle, what uncle? It is very wrong uncle,” he said, and the gathered cadres burst into laughter.The TVK chief also posed pointed questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking whether he had come to power for the third time “to do good for the people or to plot something against the Muslim community”.He pressed Centre to retrieve Katchatheevu island, withdraw NEET and resolve the plight of “around 800 fishermen” arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy. He accused BJP of hiding facts about the Keeladi excavations and depending on “alliance partners without real people power” to extend its rule till 2029.Without naming AIADMK, Vijay said BJP was using the party once nurtured by M G Ramachandran as a “backdoor to enter Tamil Nadu”. He said that even that party’s cadres were upset with their present state.TVK, he said, would be a “truly secular party” that would never have any hidden tie-up with BJP. He added that alliances under TVK would give equal power to partners.Indirectly addressing critics, Vijay said, “A lion comes to the ground only to hunt, not to pass time. Even if it is single, it will be the king of the jungle. It is not just a description but a clear declaration.” He greeted his cadres as “lion cubs” and described TVK as an “army of common people.”Vijay said TVK had already created “ripples” in state politics. “Many said I will not enter politics, then that I will not get support, then that I cannot conduct a conference. Now they say I cannot win elections. They also say this crowd may not translate into votes. To those analysts, I say — this crowd is not just support, we have already entered every household in the state.”He emphasised that the safety of women, children and the elderly would be TVK’s top priority, and pledged welfare measures for youth, farmers, labourers, weavers, fisherfolk, the disabled, elderly and transpersons.Amid cheers, Vijay made a surprise announcement, saying he would contest from Madurai East constituency in 2026. After a short pause, Vijay named all the nine remaining constituencies and asked people to assume that he himself is contesting in all 234 assembly constituencies in the state.In a symbolic gesture, he sang an MGR song from the movie ‘Enga Veetu Pillai’, asking whether people could “take the whip of politics” and use it against both BJP and DMK.Vijay concluded with a parting shot at stereotypes about actors in politics. “Leaders such as Ambedkar, Kamaraj and Nallakannu were defeated by politicians, not by cinema actors. Not all politicians are knowledgeable, and not every actor is an idiot,” he declared, drawing loud applause.","TVK chief Vijay positioned himself as the alternative to ‘Stalin uncle’ He said the 2026 assembly election would be a straight fight between his party and DMK.

USAID didn't give $21 million for poll turnout: US embassy to Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/usaid-didnt-give-21-million-for-poll-turnout-us-embassy-to-centre/articleshow/123442018.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: USAID did not provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India between 2014 and 2024, the US embassy has informed the Indian govt, according to a reply by ministry of external affairs in response to a Parliament question. US President Donald Trump had earlier questioned the alleged funding, saying he suspected ""they were trying to get someone else elected"".MoS for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said that on July 2, 2025, the US embassy shared data that, it said, covered USAID funding in India from 2014 to 2024, including details of implementing partners, objectives and key accomplishments of each activity undertaken.""The embassy also maintains that USAID/India did not receive or provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India from fiscal years 2014 to 2024, nor has it implemented any voter turnout-related activities in India,"" said the minister, in response to a written query in Rajya Sabha.""On July 29, 2025, the US embassy conveyed to MEA that it plans to bring all USAID operations to a close by Aug 15, 2025,"" he added. The MEA had earlier requested the embassy to urgently furnish details of expenditure incurred on all USAID-assisted/funded projects in India over the last 10 years (other than those being implemented under the seven partnership agreements with Indian govt).MEA also sought a list of NGOs/implementing partners through which such initiatives were executed.Trump had earlier accused USAID of working to effect a change of govt in India. Reports later suggested that the funding might have been meant for Bangladesh. ""Why do we need to spend $21 million on voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian govt... Because when we hear that Russia spent about $2,000 in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for $2,000.

AHMEDABAD: Twenty-nine years after then Gujarat minister Atmaram Patel's dhoti was pulled during a BJP function at Sardar Patel Stadium, a city sessions court on Thursday dropped the criminal case against former Union minister A K Patel, one of the two first BJP Lok Sabha members.Another BJP politician, Mangaldas Patel, was also an accused in the case, registered at Naranpura police station under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder) for allegedly assaulting and pulling off the minister's dhoti in 1996.The accused had backed Shankersinh Vaghela at the time of his rift with then chief minister Keshubhai Patel. The incident occurred immediately after BJP's Atal Bihari Vajpayee had finished addressing the party gathering.Public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt filed an application under CrPC Section 321 seeking withdrawal of the case against the 95-year-old former MP. The co-accused in the case, Mangaldas Patel, and witness (victim) Atmaram Patel, had passed away during the pendency of the trial.After hearing the submissions, additional sessions judge H G Pandya observed: ""The case involves an internal political party dispute that occurred 28 years ago, and the victim, Atmarambhai Maganbhai Patel, has passed away... The public prosecutor's request to withdraw the case appears to be made with bona fide intentions, and sufficient consideration has been given to withdrawing the prosecution. Therefore, considering the records and the nature of the offence, it is appropriate to grant permission to withdraw the prosecution under Section 321 of CrPC in the interest of justice. ""Earlier, on Jan 30, 2018, a metropolitan court had dropped a related criminal case against 41 BJP workers and politicians, including VHP leader Pravin Togadia and BJP MLA from Daskroi Babu Jamna Patel.","Former Union minister A K Patel was one of the two first BJP Lok Sabha members.

GUWAHATI: The Assam cabinet approved Thursday a proposal to freeze issuance of Aadhaar to first-time adult applicants in the state from October 1 as part of a revised SOP meant to curb fraudulent enrolment, especially by suspected illegal immigrants.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma , who had announced in June that all new Aadhaar applications would need to be vetted by the district administrative heads, said citizens above 18 without the 12-digit unique identification number would get ""a final one-month window"" until Sept-end to apply for theirs.Applicants from the SC, ST and tea tribes will get an additional year to enrol for Aadhaar. After the general deadline ends, only deputy commissioners are authorised to approve enrolment in the ""rarest of rare cases"" based on reports from police, special branch and foreigners' tribunals.Sarma said Aadhaar coverage in Assam had exceeded the state's population at 103%. SC, ST and tea tribes are the exception, with 4% still unregistered.""We have taken this decision based on the surge of Bangladeshi immigrants caught entering the state illegally, especially over the past year. Just the other day, we pushed back seven of them,"" the chief minister said.""We aren't sure we have been able to catch all of them. So, we want to create a bulwark against people trying to enter Assam illegally, enrolling for Aadhaar and living as Indian nationals.We want to completely close that door.""Assam's Aadhaar policy is now the most restrictive in the country, driven by concerns over illegal immigration and demographic changes.

US immigration just got stricter: Here’s what ‘anti-American’ screening means for immigrants and H-1B workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/us-immigration-just-got-stricter-heres-what-anti-american-screening-means-for-immigrants-and-h-1b-workers/articleshow/123420488.cms,"What the new rule says

Why critics are alarmed

The constitutional debate

Part of a larger immigration crackdown

Expanded social media vetting of applicants



of applicants Tougher assessments of ‘good moral character’ for naturalization, considering positive contributions alongside the absence of misconduct

What it means for foreign workers and H-1B employees

Impact on green card backlog

Corporate compliance: Digital conduct matters

Workplace activism risks

Employer liability and hiring delays

Bottom line

The United States is introducing a new layer of immigration scrutiny that could significantly impact foreign workers and green card seekers. According to the Associated Press, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced Tuesday that officers will now assess whether applicants have “endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused” anti-American, terrorist, or antisemitic views before granting immigration benefits.The move applies to those seeking green cards, employment authorisations, and other legal statuses. While supporters argue it’s about protecting national security, critics told AP it introduces subjectivity and bias into the immigration process—and raises serious concerns for the thousands of highly skilled workers in the US on H-1B visas.USCIS officials said the policy is intended to ensure that immigration benefits “are not given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” the Associated Press reported.“Immigration benefits, including to live and work in the United States, remain a privilege, not a right,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement to AP.However, the agency did not clearly define what qualifies as anti-Americanism, leaving wide discretion to officers during reviews, AP noted.Immigration advocates and legal experts told the Associated Press that this vagueness could open the door to stereotyping and implicit bias in decision-making.“They are opening the door for stereotypes and prejudice to take the wheel in these decisions. That’s really worrisome,” said Jane Lilly Lopez, associate professor of sociology at Brigham Young University, in comments to AP.Attorneys also warned AP that even a social media post or participation in a peaceful protest could trigger questions about an applicant’s ideological alignment.According to the Associated Press, legal experts remain divided on whether this move violates free speech protections. USCIS maintains that First Amendment rights do not apply to non-citizens outside the United States, while immigration advocates argue that constitutional protections extend to everyone on US soil, regardless of immigration status.“A lot of this administration’s activities infringe on constitutional rights and do need to be resolved, ultimately, in courts,” said Ruby Robinson, senior managing attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, in an interview with AP.The Associated Press noted that this change is part of a broader shift in immigration policies dating back to the Trump administration, which introduced:“This is what was elected. They’re allowed to interpret the rules the way they want,” Jonathan Grode, managing partner at Green and Spiegel immigration law firm, told AP. “The policy always to them is to shrink the strike zone. The law is still the same.”For H-1B workers—many of them Indian nationals facing decades-long green card waits—this new ideological review could create an additional obstacle. A single misinterpreted statement might delay or derail permanent residency applications, experts told AP.Immigration lawyers warned AP that companies sponsoring foreign employees should counsel staff on social media behavior. Posts critical of US policy, political commentary, or controversial hashtags could be misconstrued during background checks.Foreign employees participating in protests or public debates on US policies could unintentionally jeopardize immigration benefits under this rule. Attorneys told AP they recommend caution when engaging in politically sensitive discourse online or offline.Tech companies that rely on global talent may see longer processing times and unexpected denials, affecting workforce planning. Legal experts advised AP that employers should strengthen compliance processes and prepare for additional documentation requests.“People need to understand that we have a different system today,” said immigration attorney Jaime Diez, according to AP. “A lot more things that apply to US citizens are not going to apply to somebody who’s trying to enter the United States.”The Associated Press concluded that the policy represents a major shift in US immigration vetting, one that goes beyond criminal history or security risks and into the realm of personal beliefs. For skilled foreign workers, especially those navigating long immigration timelines, this could mean greater uncertainty and the need for extra vigilance in how they present themselves—online and offline.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced Tuesday that officers will now assess whether applicants have “endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused” anti-American, terrorist, or antisemitic views.

Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali has made a bold prediction about the India versus Pakistan Asia Cup clash on September 14.The eight-nation Asia Cup will be the first major event in the build-up to next year's T20 World Cup in India in February and March. The Asia Cup will begin on September 9 with defending champions India set to face hosts United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai in the eight-nation tournament.India and arch-rivals Pakistan have been clubbed in Group A and clash on September 14.Basit was furious about the way Pakistan Cricket Board is functioning in the recent years.A couple of days ago, Pakistan Cricket Board has downgraded deals for Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan in the latest list of 30 centrally contracted players announced.Both Babar and Rizwan were in category A but have been relegated to join Abrar Ahmed, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi in category B.Pakistan finished at the bottom of the ICC World Test Championship and the PCB has demoted its test captain Shan Masood from category B to category D.Fast bowler Naseem Shah, who was also dropped for the upcoming T20 tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, was dropped from the second tier to the third tier of contracted players.Wickekeeper-batter Usman Khan, who chose to play for Pakistan over the UAE, was among the eight international players who didn’t get a central contract.While some key Pakistan cricketers were demoted, legs-pinner Ahmed, fast bowler Rauf, opening batter Ayub, T20 captain Agha and legspinner Shadab Khan were all upgraded from C to B category contracts.The contracts run through June 30, 2026.Basit has called the entire saga about the contract a ""joke.""He then further stated: "".(One more joke will happen when India faces Pakistan on September 14.

NEW DELHI: Delhi schools faced another wave of panic on Thursday after at least five institutions, including BGS International Public School in Dwarka Sector 5, reported receiving bomb threats.According to officials, Delhi Police and Fire Department teams rushed to the spots immediately, cordoning off the premises and launching thorough searches with bomb disposal squads, sniffer dogs and advanced detection equipment.Ambulances and fire tenders were stationed outside the schools as a precautionary measure.The fresh alerts come barely a day after over 60 schools in the capital received near-identical hoax threats that forced emergency evacuations and widespread checks.Officials said the latest threat emails bore a resemblance to Wednesday’s messages, which were traced to a sender using a VPN to mask identity.Police sources revealed that the original email, received late Tuesday night by over 380 IDs, had demanded $2,000 in cryptocurrency (Ethereum) and claimed bombs were planted across schools.The sender, identifying as “Terrorizers 111 group,” threatened to trigger high-yield explosives if the payment was not made.Investigators are working with the Cyber Crime Unit and intelligence agencies to track the origin of the threats. Authorities, however, stressed that all schools targeted so far have been declared safe.“Though these seem to be hoax threats, we cannot take chances when children’s safety is involved. All response protocols have been activated again today,” a senior police officer said.This marks the third major bomb scare in Delhi schools within a week, raising questions over cybersecurity and the psychological impact on students and parents.Earlier on Monday, similar threats were sent to around 32 schools, which were later confirmed to be hoaxes.","At least five schools in Delhi received bomb threats on Thursday.

You’ll say PM Modi was still tolerable back then, but this Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is intolerable.""Explaining his remarks, Kishor said, ""The reference of the statement which is being given in that statement I have tried to explain the evolution of BJP's leadership. If you compare Vajpayee and Advani, then Vajpayee is considered as mascot of soft Hindutva while Advani was a hardliner. But in today's context if you compare Advani and Modi, people who use think Advani as a hardliner will consider him soft in comparison to Modi.He warned that this trajectory could continue, ""So I tried to explain that with upcoming time trajectory of BJP's leadership will keep getting of hardliner.

NEW DELHI: In a show of solidarity, Congress and TMC leaders accompanied the opposition’s Vice Presidential candidate former Supreme Court judge B Sudarshan Reddy to the residence of AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal who assured his party’s full support.Though AAP has disengaged from the bloc it joins hands with INDIA bloc members on issues where it deems fit and Sanjay Singh from the party was present when Reddy filed his nomination in the presence of top opposition leaders earlier in the day.AAP has three MPs in Lok Sabha and out of its 10 MP posts in Rajya Sabha currently it has nine MPs including the estranged Swati Maliwal. One seat fell vacant after MP Sanjeev Arora won the Ludhiana West assembly bypoll in June.Congress’s Pramod Tiwari and Syed Naseer Hussain and TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee were present at the meeting at Kejriwal’s residence. ""Justice Reddy's judicial career is very impressive. He gave many unbiased judgments in favour of the country. I request everyone to vote for him, keeping party affiliations aside,"" Kejriwal said. Noting that Justice Reddy is from Andhra Pradesh where NDA ally TDP is in power, Kejriwal said “we expect parties from AP and Telangana to rise above partisan politics and vote for Telugu pride and national interest. ”With 781 members in the electoral college and 391 required for a majority, the ruling alliance has a clear numerical advantage.",Opposition's vice-presidential candidate B Sudarshan Reddy meets Arvind Kejriwal.

SRINAGAR: The unhurried rhythm of a shikara gliding through the Dal is one of Kashmir's oldest inheritances.On Thursday, a 17-year-old Kashmiri boy swapped the oars of his shikara for a kayak paddle and whipped up a frenzy generations of his family hadn't known – shouts of ""Mohsin! Shabhash, Mohsin!"" from the banks of the lake as he neared the finish line of a 1000m kayaking competition to give J&K the first gold of the ongoing Khelo India Water Sports Festival.""I am so happy. I defeated kayakers who have competed in China and Europe. This is a big thing for me,"" said Mohsin, moments after stepping out of his kayak into the waiting arms of his coach Bilquis Mir, a former international and an Olympic judge.Mohsin, a Class 12 student at Srinagar's SP Higher Secondary School, takes tourists on shikara rides after school almost every day to earn some money that goes into supplementing his diet. It helps that he lives in Kand Mohalla, next to the lake.Mohsin credits his carpenter father Fida Hussain with encouraging him to excel in sport.

Row Over Attack On Delhi CM Rekha Gupta, BJP Suspects Political Conspiracy By Rivals

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party 's state president Saurabh Bhardwaj on Thursday alleged that Delhi Police is withholding crucial CCTV footage related to the recent attack on chief minister Rekha Gupta during a public hearing at her Civil Lines camp office.Addressing reporters, the AAP leader said that while police promptly registered an FIR in Gupta’s case, similar seriousness was missing in earlier attacks on former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ""We are glad that in Rekha Gupta's case, the police have registered an FIR, but I believe that the police are hiding the CCTV footage of the incident to cover up their failure,"" Bhardwaj said.He further recalled earlier incidents where Kejriwal was physically attacked during public events. “Before this, several attacks have been made on Arvind Kejriwal… While we haven’t seen CCTV footage of an attack on Rekha Gupta yet, attacks on Arvind Kejriwal were recorded and streamed everywhere.”The AAP leader alleged that police failed in their duty by not registering earlier attacks on Kejriwal as cases of attempt to murder and by not taking the accused into custody. According to him, those incidents were deliberately handled weakly, with lax security, and dismissed as acts of public anger — unlike the swift action taken in Gupta’s case.A day earlier, Bhardwaj had also expressed disappointment over the incident, stressing that violence has no place in society and goes against the principles of Mahatma Gandhi . He questioned the forces “patronising” violence, pointing out that it is not limited to attacks on political leaders but also includes instances where the police took violent action against SSC students and teachers.He also referred to a past incident when a BJP supporter attacked Arvind Kejriwal during an election campaign. At the time, Bhardwaj said, BJP leaders dismissed the attack as the act of a citizen upset with Kejriwal.""During an election program, a BJP supporter had attacked Arvind Kejriwal. At the time, the BJP said that the person was a civil defence volunteer who was upset with Arvind Kejriwal. Whenever there was an attack on Arvind Kejriwal, the BJP said that the people of Delhi were upset with him. We won't say that people of Delhi are upset with Rekha Gupta ji, and this is why an attack happened. An attack on anyone is wrong. We are supporting the BJP at this time as we believe that, in principle, violence is wrong, and all parties should condemn such an act,"" he said in a video message.The attack on Gupta took place on Wednesday morning during her weekly Jan Sunwai session. According to the Delhi CMO, the assault appeared to be part of a “well-planned conspiracy to kill her.” She was taken to hospital for a medical examination and later discharged.Police officials identified the accused as Rajesh Sakriya Khimjibhai, 41, a resident of Rajkot in Gujarat. He has been remanded to five-day police custody, with the Special Cell, Intelligence Bureau and local police jointly probing the case. Investigators are examining his phone and social media activity for possible links.","Aam Aadmi Party's state president Saurabh Bhardwaj alleged that Delhi Police is withholding crucial CCTV footage related to the recent attack on chief minister Rekha Gupta.

'No Big Deal If He is Tamil': DMK Blasts BJP's VP Choice CP Radhakrishnan As Political Appointment



A show of strength in Madurai:

Criticism of DMK government:

.



Tragedy on the way to the rally:

NEW DELHI: Actor-turned-politician and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) president Vijay on Thursday declared that he would contest the 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections from Madurai East, launching a fiery attack on the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and asserting that his party would emerge as the principal challenger in the polls.Addressing the party’s second state conference in Madurai, Vijay likened himself to a lion marking its territory. “A lion knows how to live in a crowd and also knows how to live alone. It remains unique. A lion comes out only to hunt, not for entertainment. It always hunts only living prey...,” he said, drawing massive support from thousands of party workers who had gathered for the rally.Vijay, who formed TVK in 2024, positioned the party as an alternative to both the DMK and the opposition AIADMK , but singled out the ruling party as his main political rival. “Our only ideological enemy is BJP, our only political enemy is DMK...TVK is not a party that was started just for some political benefits...” he said.The TVK chief asserted that his party was not just another entrant in Tamil Nadu politics but a force with a distinct mission. “TVK is not a political game; it is an ideology. This is not a speech for publicity. This is a warning to those who are in power. TVK is here to dominate.Crores of people are with us. The 2026 election is a fight between TVK and DMK,” he said.""TVK is not a party that makes underground deals, forges alliances, and cheats the people. We are not afraid of anyone. The people of Tamil Nadu, the women and the youth stand with us,"" he added.He also pledged that his party would champion larger Tamil causes, vowing to “free Katchatheevu island from Sri Lanka,” a long-standing political demand in the state.Referring to repeated clashes between Tamil Nadu fishermen and the Sri Lankan Navy, he said, “800 Tamil Nadu fishermen have been attacked by the Sri Lankan Navy. To ensure the safety of our fishermen, retrieve Katchatheevu (islands) and give them to us.”The Madurai rally was billed as TVK’s biggest political mobilisation yet, with party workers thronging the venue from across the state. This conference marks the party’s second since its inception and signals Vijay’s intent to enter the 2026 elections as a serious contender.The actor-politician has repeatedly compared the upcoming polls to the historic elections of 1967 and 1977, when newcomers—DMK under CN Annadurai and AIADMK under MG Ramachandran rose to power by defeating entrenched parties. Vijay, however, differs from these leaders as he has only recently entered active politics, despite being a popular figure since 2004.Last week, he launched the “Now TVK” mobile application to drive membership across Tamil Nadu. At the launch, he urged his cadre to follow Annadurai’s principle of living with the people, learning from them and planning with them.Vijay said the party’s priority is the safety of women, elders and children, adding that a TVK government would focus on supporting groups needing special attention, such as farmers, youth, transgender people, the elderly without care, and the physically challenged.He also stressed that TVK would not engage in secret deals, opportunistic alliances, or attempts to mislead the public. According to him, the party is unafraid of challenges and enjoys strong support from the people of Tamil Nadu, particularly women and youth.TVK president also accused DMK of having a secret alliance with the BJP. ""DMK has a secret alliance with the BJP, but does drama as if they are opposing the BJP,"" he said.Slamming the Centre, Vijay pointed out on the NEET issue. He said, ""Due of your stubbornness, you continue to impose the NEET exam, and it pains me to even speak about what is happening here because of it. NEET must be abolished. Will you do this? You will never give us what we want or do what is right for us.”Directly referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he asked: “Revoke NEET! Can you do it, Narendra Modi avargal?”Vijay has in recent months sharpened his criticism of chief minister MK Stalin ’s government. In a recent post on X, he condemned the arrest of sanitation workers protesting for their rights in Chennai, calling the action “inhumane and anarchic.” He alleged that the government was acting in a “fascist” manner against ordinary people.""Condemn the fascist DMK government for arresting sanitation workers, who have been peacefully fighting for their rights, in an inhumane and anarchic manner in the dead of night!"" Vijay wrote in a post on X.Even as the rally showcased TVK’s strength, it was marred by tragedy. Prabhakaran, a 33-year-old TVK worker from Chennai, collapsed on his way to Madurai to attend the event. He had travelled overnight with friends in a van and reportedly collapsed after stepping out near Chakkimangalam.His friends rushed him to the Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. The hospital dean confirmed that he was brought in an unconscious state and was later declared dead.",Actor-turned-politician Vijay declares he will contest 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections from Madurai East.

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months. Her family's decision to get her married to a revenue official was purportedly the last straw.","Archana Tiwari, 27, was reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.

First uncrewed Gaganyaan mission launch likely in December: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-uncrewed-gaganyaan-mission-launch-likely-in-december-isro-chief/articleshow/123441574.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI The first uncrewed mission of the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme is ready to launch with a robot and the liftoff is expected in December, said Isro chairman V Narayanan here on Thursday.“The first uncrewed mission, G1, is going to lift off by this year's end, maybe close to December. And in that, the Vyommitra, the half-humanoid, is going to fly,” Narayanan said.Addressing the media in the presence of space minister Jitendra Singh and astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, the Isro chief lauded Shux for his successful mission to the International Space Station (ISS) — the first ever by an Indian. His experience of piloting the Axiom-4 mission is set to be crucial for the Gaganyaan mission Narayanan said SpaceX had probably taken “lightly” the liquid oxygen leak in the Falcon-9 rocket that launched the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS, putting at risk the lives of the four astronauts, including Shukla. “If with a crack the rocket lifts off, with the vibrations, it will give way the moment it lifts off. Once it gives way, it will be a catastrophic situation, nothing else,"" he said.Shux, who achieved the ISS feat on June 26, called it the “mission of an entire nation”.“I would like to thank every citizen of this country who behaved in a way that made it feel like they actually owned this mission. I truly felt that this was a mission for the entire nation,” he said. Shukla said being on the space station “is very different from what you learn on the ground. It was an unbelievable experience”.“We have been able to achieve all our technical objectives,” he said. ""We had seven different experiments to conduct, ranging from stem cell research to growing sprouts on the space station. Some of them started showing results while we were there. The results were very encouraging”.“Crew Dragon is one of the three vehicles that can currently take humans to space. We were also fortunate to have training on the Soyuz, which launches from Russia, besides Crew Dragon. The ISS, as you know, is an orbiting laboratory that has been operational since 2000. It has been conducting cutting-edge science and is a perfect example of international collaboration,” he added.Narayanan said Isro has had a lot of accomplishments in the last four months. “The entire Isro programme is the result of teamwork of 20,000 employees, 450 industrial partners and 300 academia partners. Today, we also have the Gaganyatris for our programmes”. Mentioning various Isro programmes, he said, ""There is telemedicine, tele-education, television broadcasting, and real-time connectivity for around 8,600 trains and 21,000 shipping vessels”.“A total of 13 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals are being supported by Isro,” the Isro chairman said, while also listing the space agency’s other achievements like the Aditya L1 Sun mission and the NISAR mission. “We have made a major breakthrough in cryogenic engine technology. The tests are going very well, and a lot of indigenisation activities are progressing well. Coming to the Aditya L1, this year we have released 13 terabit data,” he said.“In two to three months, we are also going to launch a 6,500-kg communication satellite of the US, on our launch vehicle. To date, 433 satellites of 34 countries have been launched from India,"" Narayanan said.","The first uncrewed mission of the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme is ready to launch with a robot.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday blamed disruptions in Parliament on ""insecurities"" of a few politicians who fear getting outshone by younger MPs and are organising protests to nip the threat to their own position.At the customary informal meeting of members of different parties in LS Speaker Om Birla's office after the House was adjourned sine die, the PM reportedly said opposition's protests were bereft of merit.He said these protests were an outcome of 'insecurities' among a few opposition members - seen as a swipe at Rahul Gandhi - that they orchestrate protests and disrupt proceedings so that the young and talented are denied a chance to emerge, sources said. Modi refrained from taking names.Opposition kept away from the get together. With them skipping the meeting, one of the participants in the get together is learnt to have remarked that it has become increasingly difficult to bring Congress on board as few of its members, who govt interacts with regularly, can influence the party's decision.Modi said monsoon session covered several important bills and regretted that they could not be discussed in Parliament.On opposition parties keeping away from the meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju took a swipe at them saying they might have been too ""embarrassed"" with their conduct.","PM Narendra Modi blamed disruptions in Parliament on ""insecurities"" of a few politicians.

NEW DELHI: The Centre did not have to labour to persuade a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Thursday to recognise an apparent constitutional fallacy in the two-judge bench's April 8 virtual directive to the President to seek SC's opinion on constitutional validity of a bill reserved for her consideration by a governor.The constitution bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar appeared convinced by solicitor general Tushar Mehta's argument that the two-judge bench could not have used SC's Article 142 powers to step into the governor's shoes and grant deemed assent to 10 bills of Tamil Nadu.""These two directions - the President to seek opinion of SC and deemed assent - are fundamentally flawed and unconstitutional,"" Mehta said. SC fallaciously assumed that the President, the highest constitutional authority of India, lacks ability or wherewithal to ascertain constitutional validity of bills, which have been passed by an assembly but reserved for her consideration by the governor, he argued.CJI Gavai responded to his argument about such directions being hazardous for the stone-carved constitutional doctrine of separation of powers by saying, ""If all the bills reserved for the President's consideration become part of Presidential Reference, SC will do no other judicial work except giving advisory opinions as each Reference has to be addressed by a bench of minimum five judges.""A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan had on Apr 9 said whenever a bill is reserved for the President's consideration on the ground of its patent unconstitutionality, ""the President must be guided by the fact that it is the constitutional courts which have been entrusted with the responsibility of adjudicating upon the questions of constitutionality and legality of an executive or legislative action. Therefore, as a measure of prudence, the President ought to make a reference to this court in exercise of powers under Article 143 of the Constitution (and seek SC's opinion)"".Mehta told the bench to take example of a case where the President obtains such opinion from SC on the constitutional validity of a bill and grants assent. With bill thus becoming an Act, as in the case of the Tamil Nadu bills which have been published in the gazette mentioning that SC has granted deemed assent, how would an HC or SC adjudicate its validity given the fact that it has become a law after the SC had already vetted its constitutionally validity?Steering clear of the maze of consequential constitutional complications that would emerge if SC engaged in pre-law stage vetting of validity of bills, the CJI said, ""Whether the President would seek advisory opinion of SC under Article 143 is her sole prerogative.""Mehta said Article 142 powers, exclusively given to SC to do complete justice by acting within the constitutional and statutory parameters, cannot be used to assume the role of another coordinate constitutional authority like governor. He said the Constitution wherever needed has provided the 'deemed' provision, and hence, it prohibits SC from reading in 'deemed assent' provision into the Constitution using the powers it enjoys under Article 142.On the President's last question - whether states could invoke Article 32 right to directly move SC seeking a mandamus to governor, Mehta said any federal dispute involving Centre and state(s); or state(s) and state(s), must be resolved politically or in the alternative, a suit under Article 131 can be filed in SC.However, he said he would take instructions from the President, whether she would still press for an opinion from SC on this issue and inform the bench on Tuesday.",Five-judge bench of the Supreme Court appears to recognise apparent constitutional fallacy.

CJI calls for restraint, says judicial activism should not become judicial adventurism or judicial terrorism



NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday asserted that a governor's action on a bill passed by an assembly - withhold assent, return it to assembly or reserve it for President's consideration - is non-justiciable and the governor-state impasse over such issues must be resolved not in the Supreme Court but through the political mechanism, leading the apex court to ask should it remain passive if a governor fails to discharge his constitutional obligation.On the third day of the hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that there are hundreds of aspects that a governor examines while taking a decision on a bill and SC does not have the wherewithal to examine the validity of such considerations while arriving at a decision.This led the CJI to ask, ""If a governor does not do what the Constitution mandates him to do and sits over a bill without taking a decision for years, should courts be powerless to examine such inaction? What will happen to the federal democratic set-up? What happens to the will of the people? And, what does an elected govt in a state do?""Justices Kant and Narasimha, also part of the five-judge bench, said, “The court may not go into the aspect of why a governor takes a particular action on a bill. But if the governor does not take any action for a very long period, can the situation be remediless? If the aggrieved state moves SC, should it keep silent? There cannot be a vacuum in the Constitution.”Mehta said mere justification (on the grounds of a governor’s inaction) does not give jurisdiction to the court to tinker with the Constitution and amend its provisions to provide a timeframe for a governor to mandatorily act.“There had been such impasses between governors and states. They were resolved through political statesmanship of the CM concerned, the PM and the President. Solutions have been found in the political set-up. If a timeframe is required to be prescribed for a governor to act on a bill, Parliament will decide,” he said. “Every problem of the country need not have to be resolved by SC. The political set-up and heads of the other branches of governance are equally capable of resolving political issues through a collaborative exercise,” the SG said.The CJI asked, “If SC, as custodian of the Constitution, finds a constitutional functionary refusing to discharge his/her functions without valid reasons, should it be powerless to act?” He, however, also emphasized the need for judicial restraint. “Judicial activism should not become judicial adventurism or judicial terrorism. I have always said separation of powers must be respected,” Gavai said.Mehta said SC can interpret the Constitution and its provisions, but it cannot insert a timeline for governors to act on bills, which is impermissible given the rigid separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary. He said the constitutional heads of each of the three organs must have deference to each other’s core constitutional functions. He asked, “If a trial in a criminal case is pending for decades and a person approaches the President saying justice has been denied to his son, should the President declare him innocent and end the trial? Can the legislature fix a timeline for the judiciary to complete a trial in a case?”“Whether the governor should grant assent, withhold, return the bill to assembly or reserve it for President’s consideration are all actions which are non-justiciable. There are no judicial standards by which the SC can test the validity of governor’s action on Bills. SC does not have the wherewithal to decide the validity of political decisions,” the SG said.Mehta said India follows the principle of constitutional supremacy and the supremacy is neither with the legislature, executive or judiciary, all three operating in distinct spheres governed by the principles of separation of power. “The National Judicial Appointments Commission was unanimously passed by Parliament and ratified by two-thirds of the state and yet it was struck down by SC terming the presence of a single member from the executive in the panel for selection of judges as an interference in judicial independence,” he said.Every organ has the freedom to operate independently in their respective core constitutional functions, Mehta said, adding that if the presence of one executive member was interference in judiciary, could SC have fixed a timeframe for a governor to take a decision on a bill when the Constitution was silent on it, he further argued. Mehta cited several provisions of the Constitution where the text provided for a time frame for taking action by constitutional authorities and concluded his arguments saying the silence of the Constitution on the deadline for a governor to take a call on legislations was deliberate and cannot be tinkered with by SC.","CJI calls for restraint, says judicial activism should not become judicial adventurism or judicial terrorism.

Foreign minister S Jaishankar Thursday defended India's energy imports from Russia, saying the US (former Biden administration) wanted India to do ""everything to stabilise the world energy markets, including buying oil from Russia"".After meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow, Jaishankar said, ""Incidentally, we also buy oil from America and that amount has been increasing. So, quite honestly, we are very perplexed at the logic of this argument that is referred to"". He was replying to a question on President Trump slapping an additional 25% tariff on India, accusing it of profiteering from Russian oil and bankrolling Russia's war on Ukraine.Jaishankar pointed out that China, not India, is the biggest buyer of oil from Moscow. ""We aren't a country that has (had) the biggest trade surge with Russia after 2022 (start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict),"" he said.Jaishankar also called on President Vladimir Putin. ""Appreciate his sharing perspectives on the global situation and recent developments on Ukraine,"" he said on X, adding preparations for the Modi-Putin summit towards the end of the year are well underway.Jaishankar said he and Lavrov discussed possible outcomes from India-Russia annual summit that will have Putin visiting India towards the end of the year. “We’ve looked at energy, including not just fossil fuel energy but also nuclear energy where we have a very strong history of cooperation with Russia...very good discussions on fertilizer supply,” he said.Jaishankar and Lavrov discussed issues related to Ukraine war, West Asia and reform of global governance, while taking stock of bilateral relations. On terrorism, Jaishankar said he conveyed India’s strong resolve to adopt a zero-tolerance policy against terrorism and its sovereign right to defend citizens against cross-border terrorism.He also raised the issue of Indians serving in the Russian Army, expressing hope that the Russian side would expeditiously resolve these matters.“We believe relations between India and Russia have been among the steadiest of the major relationships in the world after the Second World War. Geo-political convergence, leadership contacts and popular sentiment remain its key drivers,” he said. “Our defence and military-technical cooperation also remains robust. Russia supports India’s Make in India goals, including through joint production and technology transfer,” Jaishankar said.On global and multilateral cooperation, both sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to reform of global governance. “We underlined the imperative to expand and energise the UN Security Council to reflect contemporary realities. Our collaboration in G20, Brics and the SCO remains deep-rooted and forward looking,” Jaishankar said, adding on conflicts India’s approach continues to emphasise dialogue and diplomacy as essential to resolving it.","Foreign minister S Jaishankar said the US wanted India to do ""everything to stabilise the world energy markets, including buying oil from Russia"" He was replying to a question on President Trump slapping an additional 25% tariff on India, accusing it of profiteering from Russian oil.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123440837,imgsize-899121,width-400,resizemode-4/123440837.jpg"

Scrutiny of cellphone records indicated that Andrabi had been in touch with terror operatives across the border.Andrabi’s counsel submitted that he was a political activist who had been falsely implicated after his release from preventive detention in 2019, and there was no direct evidence against him. Citing that he had been behind bars for around half a decade, the defence sought parity with co-accused persons who were granted bail.Representing NIA, the prosecution — deputy solicitor general of India Vishal Sharma, along with special public prosecutor Chandan Kumar Singh — opposed the bail petition, arguing that Andrabi was found to have direct links with Pakistan-based handlers of terror outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen and was part of the narco-terror syndicate.Despite acknowledging that Andrabi had spent almost five years incarcerated, HC held that the seriousness of the charges and evidence on record outweighed his request for parole.

NEW DELHI: Exactly a month after he resigned, on the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament, Trinamool Congress raised the issue of former vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar’s disappearance from public life, and Communist Party of India wrote to Dhankhar expressing grave concern over his sudden resignation and his silence and withdrawal from the public domain since then.On Wednesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had raised similar concerns as he asked, “where has the old VP gone?”As the Parliament session came to an end on Thursday, TMC’s Derek O’ Brien reflected on the state of affairs under the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. “No byte, no video, no trace...,” he said referring to Dhankhar’s disappearance since Aug 21 evening, when he submitted his resignation, citing health reasons.The TMC leader also took a dig at BJP for failing to elect a party president yet. “No candidate, no face, no consensus....,” he said.Meanwhile, CPI MP and leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha, P Sandosh Kumar, in his letter to Dhankhar, said that his resignation a month ago, citing “health reasons,” came as a shock to Parliament and the entire country. “While differences during his tenure in the Chair were natural, the dignity of the office he held was always respected,” he said.What has caused greater anxiety, the letter noted, is Dhankhar’s complete absence from the public domain since his resignation. The CPI MP observed that Dhankhar has not addressed the press, nor appeared in public, with even his pre scheduled events being cancelled. “Such silence and withdrawal, after citing health reasons, has understandably created deep concern among fellow parliamentarians and citizens regarding his well-being,” Kumar said.The letter urged Dhankhar to respond and reassure Parliament and the public about his well-being at the earliest. Kumar said that while the process to elect his successor is already underway, clarity and reassurance from Dhankhar himself would help “dispel speculation, unease, and unanswered questions that continue to surround his unprecedented resignation”.","Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned on August 21, citing health reasons.

"Electricity bill as per commercial charges makes holes in resources of rural libraries, want bill as per domestic charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/electricity-bill-as-per-commercial-charges-makes-holes-in-resources-of-rural-libraries-want-bill-as-per-domestic-charges/articleshow/123438515.cms,"Bathinda: The philanthropists and those at forefront in promoting book culture by opening libraries in rural areas of Punjab, are facing a costly affair. The good Samaritans somehow set up libraries through their own resources without any support from the state government, have to pay electricity bills as per commercial charges. The commercial charges are nearly 50% more than the domestic under various slabs as the units of electricity consumed in any billing cycle, which makes a big hole in their meager resources. They feel if the electricity bills are charged as per domestic charges, it could provide them with a much-needed relief. Those running such libraries have been making this demand for a long time.Under domestic connection, there are no charges for consuming up to 600 units in two months and the bill is generated bimonthly but under domestic connection, there is no free unit, and the bill is generated every month.There are dozens of libraries set up either by village panchayats, youth clubs or individuals in the villages of Malwa Region, and all are facing this financial hardship.“We have set up libraries by collecting meager donations from villagers, acquittances, and well-wishers. We have to pay a big part of the resources for purchasing books and other infrastructure apart from paying newspaper bills. After spending a lot on it, we are left with very small amounts to pay the electricity bills, that too on commercial rates.We have been demanding for a long time that libraries should be charged as per domestic rates and for it we approached AAP Bathinda district president Jatinder Bhalla on Wednesday to raise the matter with chief minister Bhagwant Mann”, said Santosh Rishi and Kewal Krishan, who respectively represents libraries at Khiva Kalan village in district Mansa and Shaheed Bhagat Singh library at Jeeda village in Bathinda.Shaheed Bhagat Singh Library is one of the most prominent libraries in the Malwa region for which some philanthropists donated money with which the library committee nicely refurbished the library but with not much regular income it too faces hardships in paying electricity bills on commercial charges.Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann had inaugurated a number of libraries in the past and claims to be a promoter of book culture. He should look into the demand, they said.","There are dozens of libraries set up either by village panchayats, youth clubs or individuals in the villages of Malwa Region.

Central Administrative Tribunal seeks Punjab's response on IPS officer's daughter plea for dues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/central-administrative-tribunal-seeks-punjabs-response-on-ips-officers-daughter-plea-for-dues/articleshow/123437779.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

The Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), New Delhi, has asked the Punjab government to respond on a plea filed by Shabri Prasad, daughter of Punjab cadre IPS officer Late R C Prasad, seeking payment of statutory interest on her delayed pension arrears.Shabri, an unmarried daughter of the 1976-batch Punjab cadre IPS officer who died in service in December 2003, has been a legitimate recipient of family pension under Rule 54 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972. However, her pension was abruptly discontinued when she turned 25 years old, despite government orders clarifying that unmarried daughters above that age are eligible for continued family pension if they remain unmarried and dependent.Her pension was restored only in 2020 after she pursued repeated representations, following which she received arrears aggregating to Rs 43.61 lakh in three installments. However, the arrears were paid without the statutory interest mandated under Rule 65(2) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, which requires payment of interest in cases of delay attributable to administrative lapses.The unpaid interest on delayed payments has been tentatively calculated at around Rs 43.21 lakh at 9 per cent per annum.In her plea before the principal bench of CAT, she has submitted that despite several representations — including letters dated September 2024 and emails to senior Punjab officials — no action was taken to release the interest component. The denial of statutory interest is in violation of Rule 65(2) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, she has submitted before the tribunal.The matter was last heard on July 14, 2025, when the Tribunal fixed it for August 27 asking the Punjab government to respond.For Shabri Prasad, the matter is not merely financial but also symbolic of a long struggle against bureaucratic indifference. “My father served the Punjab Police with dedication. After his death, I have had to fight every step of the way to secure what is rightfully mine,” she has stated in her representations.","The Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), New Delhi, has asked the Punjab government to respond on a plea filed by Shabri Prasad, daughter of a Punjab cadre IPS officer.

Bureaucrats to civil society: Renewed call for separate capital and high court for Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bureaucrats-to-civil-society-renewed-call-for-separate-capital-and-high-court-for-haryana/articleshow/123437632.cms,".

CHANDIGARH: Demanding a separate capital and an independent high court for Haryana, a large gathering of bureaucrats, academicians, lawyers, and civil society members from the state converged in Chandigarh on Thursday for the 'Haryana Banao' Abhiyan. They were of the view that it has been 58 years since Haryana was separated from Punjab , but unfortunately, the region has still not been granted the status of a fully autonomous state.Sharing his thoughts, M S Chopra, Former Deputy Secretary, Govt of India, said that the people of Haryana lack a central place to preserve and promote their heritage and to celebrate modern economic progress and achievements. ""Haryana may have come into existence, but its prosperous identity could not develop. It has yet to achieve completeness and special recognition. Building a modern capital at an appropriate location will accelerate the development of underdeveloped areas of the state and strengthen its economy,"" he added.Former Chief Secretary of Haryana, S C Chaudhary, said that the creation of 22 districts from the original 7 districts was indirectly justified to provide administrative and judicial services closer to the people.But as the capital lies in one corner of the state, most people from far-off regions have to travel long distances and pay thousands of rupees in tolls to reach administrative offices and the high court. Due to lakhs of pending cases in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the people of Haryana face long delays in justice, which also proves costly.Former Vice-Chancellor Radheshyam Sharma highlighted that the most serious problem in Haryana is unemployment, and the construction of a new state capital will play a crucial role in solving this issue.Padma Shri Haryanvi folk singer Mahavir Guddu pointed out that the fact that not even a single member from Haryana is included in the North Zone Cultural Centre (NZCC) is a direct example of injustice towards the state.Advocate Ranbir Singh Badhran, former Chairman of the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana, said that lawyers are also demanding a separate Bar for Haryana and substantial budgetary provisions for the welfare of advocates in the Haryana state budget. They are also demanding that retirement benefits under the Advocate Welfare Fund Act be implemented through a separate Bar Council for Haryana.According to records, more than 14,25,047 cases are pending before Haryana’s district and subordinate courts, and over 4,50,000 cases are pending before the high court. In addition, lakhs of cases are pending before various commissions, tribunals, and other authorities. It is estimated that over 45 lakh people in Haryana are involved in litigation, and most litigants suffer due to delays in case disposal. Quick resolution of cases is of utmost importance for both litigants and advocates of Haryana. To solve this issue, both Haryana and Punjab need separate high courts.Retired IGP, Ishwar Singh Duhan, Dr RR Malik, former Principal, Sunil Katyal former Commissioner, Right to Service Commission (RTS), Haryana), Bimla Chaudhary (social worker), Randhir Singh Saroha (co-convener, Haryana Banao Abhiyan), retired Principal RR Malik, Advocate Lalit Barada, Yadvinder Singh, Ravikant Sain, Advocate Riya Malik, Deepal Tamang, Anukriti (Advocate, Punjab & Haryana High Court), and other social workers including Sanjeev Nehra, Sadiq Chauhan, Agnivesh Nara, Labh Singh, Ashok Dadupur, Sanjeev Kumar, Ishwar Goyat, Pooja, etc. were also present on the occasion and shared their views.","A large gathering of bureaucrats, academicians, lawyers, and civil society members from the state converged in Chandigarh on Thursday for the 'Haryana Banao' Abhiyan.

India Shuts Airspace For Pak-run Flights, Military Aircraft | Big Move Before Pahalgam 'Revenge'

Poll Are tit-for-tat airspace bans an effective strategy in international relations? Yes, it shows strength. No, it leads to more conflict.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Wednesday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft until September 23, prolonging the restrictions for another month amid continuing tensions between the two countries.The Pakistan Airports Authority confirmed the move in a fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), stating, “All aircraft operated by Indian airlines will not be allowed to use Pakistani airspace. The ban also remains in place for military and civilian aircraft that are Indian-owned or leased.”The restrictions were first imposed on April 23 for one month following the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India retaliated on April 30 by announcing a reciprocal closure of its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and airlines.Since then, both sides have repeatedly extended the curbs. On May 23, Pakistan prolonged its ban after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. Another NOTAM later extended the closure from June 23 to July 24, stating, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The tit-for-tat measures have left carriers from both countries barred from flying over each other’s territory, with every extension keeping the restrictions in place.",Pakistan on Wednesday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft until September 23.

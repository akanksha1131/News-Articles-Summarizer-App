The accused, identified as Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar of Batkote and Bashir Ahmad Jothar of Pahalgam, are accused of providing food, shelter and logistical support to the attackers, officials said.During questioning, the two men disclosed that the attackers were Pakistani nationals linked to the banned terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).The three terrorists were later killed by security forces in an encounter on July 28 on the outskirts of Srinagar under operation code-named ""Operation Mahadev"".The April 22 strike at Baisaran was the deadliest terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama attack.In response to the attack, Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes on May 7 under "" Operation Sindoor "", targeting terror hideouts in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

'Anti-party activities': Congress expels ex-Odisha MLA; Mouqim had written to Sonia Gandhi over party leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-party-activities-congress-expels-ex-odisha-mla-mouqim-had-written-to-sonia-gandhi-over-party-leadership/articleshow/125968775.cms,"What the letter said



Moquim’s past controversies



NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Monday expelled former MLA Mohammed Moquim from the party days after he wrote to Sonia Gandhi urging the removal of party president Mallikarjun Kharge on the grounds that “age is not on his side. ” Congress cited ""anti-party activities"" as the reason behind his expulsion, however, it refrained from specifying such acts.""This is for the information of all concerned that AICC has approved the proposal for the expulsion of Sri Md. Moquim from the primary membership of the party, due to anti-party activities,"" the notice issued by Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) said.Moquim had written to Sonia, urging her that the party should consider bringing forward ""young leaders"", adding that the Grand Old Party was going through a ""difficult phase"".""I have written a letter to Sonia Gandhi stating that the party is going through a difficult phase and needs her advice and new leadership... Age is not on AICC President Mallikarjun Kharge's side... We should bring forward young leaders. I know that Sonia ji and the CWC members will definitely discuss this.... Nuapada by-elections were concerning,"" he had said.The 60-year-old received criticism for the letter as OPCC chief Bhakta Das went on to equate his remarks as one aligned with the BJP.“Those who challenge the party leadership should immediately join the BJP,” he said on Sunday.Addressed to Sonia Gandhi, Moquim’s letter pointed out party’s recent electoral defeats in Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Kashmir and blamed a ""series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices"".""The recent outcomes in Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Kashmir, where our defeats were by staggering margins, are not just electoral setbacks; they reflect a deeper organisational disconnect,"" the letter said.""A series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices, and the continued concentration of responsibility in the wrong hands have weakened the Party from within. Rather than correcting these errors, we appear to be repeating them and the consequences are now visible to the entire nation,"" the letter added.The letter further questioned whether the ""responsibilities being entrusted to the right people"".""Painful questions are being raised: Are decisions being made with seriousness? Are responsibilities being entrusted to the right people? Does the leadership fully grasp the gravity of this crisis, or are we allowing the Party's decline to continue unchecked, with decisions remaining in the wrong hands?"" he questioned.The Bharatiya Janata Party was quick to react to the ""internal rift"" with Shehzad Poonawalla saying, ""Team Priyanka vs team Rahul out in the open now Internal rift in Congress out! Senior Congress leader from Odisha Writes to Sonia Gandhi: Says Kharge Hatao ,Priyanka Lao;Hits out at state and central leadership Odisha leader Mohammed Moquim has questioned the leadership crisis nationally and called for deep structural, organisational and ideological renewal for the party’s revival. He notes a “deep and growing disconnect” between the Congress leadership and Indian youth, saying that under the current leadership of Mallikarjun Kharge, who is 83, the party has been unable to resonate with the youth.""This was not Moquim’s first brush with controversy. He was suspended on July 15, 2023, for questioning Pattanaik’s leadership, a decision that was later withdrawn on January 23, 2024, ahead of the simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.Earlier, he had received a show-cause notice for cross-voting in support of NDA presidential candidate Droupadi Murmu in July 2022. The former Barabati–Cuttack MLA, who was elected for the first time and whose seat is now held by his daughter Sofia Firdous, was disqualified from contesting the 2024 elections after being convicted in a state vigilance case on September 29, 2022.","Congress cites ""anti-party activities"" as the reason behind his expulsion.

Bill proposes Rs 2 crore fine on illegal universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-proposes-2cr-fine-on-illegal-univsities/articleshow/125968660.cms,"NEW DELHI: Any university or higher education institution established without approval of Central or state govt would face a penalty of at least Rs 2 crore and immediate closure, as per the new higher education bill — Viksit Bharat Adhishthan Bill — which is likely to be introduced in Lok Sabha on Monday.The bill circulated to MPs on Sunday evening also proposes that higher education institutions will be required to disclose financial details, audits, infrastructure, faculty information, courses, outcomes and accreditation status on a public portal maintained by the regulatory council as well as on their own websites. The disclosed data will form the basis for accreditation and regulatory oversight.TOI has learnt that govt is also likely to introduce a bill to replace the rural employment guarantee law, MGNREGA, on Monday. Sources said that though the Cabinet had last week approved the Pujya Bapu Gramin Rozgar Guarantee Bill, the acronym of the bill may be changed when it’s introduced in the House. The Bill proposes to guarantee 125 workdays per household as against 100 provided under the present law and would focus more on creating tangible assets in rural areas.As per the proposed Viksit Bharat Adhishthan Bill, there would be a common regulator for higher education, including universities, IITs and IIMs — Viksit Bharat Shiksha Viniyaman Parishad — having 14 members headed by a president.Its mandate would be to ensure coordination, maintenance of standards, and compliance with regulatory provisions across universities and higher educational institutions (HEIs).The regulatory council will promote a “light but tight” regulatory approach, emphasising transparency, accountability and autonomy. The bill proposes that all higher educational institutions would be required to achieve full accreditation in a graded manner, enabling them to become autonomous, multidisciplinary institutions offering high-quality education, research, vocational training and skilling programmes.The bill proposes to empower the regulatory council to take corrective action within 60 days in cases of misrepresentation, financial impropriety or administrative lapses. It proposes a robust grievance redressal mechanism for students and other stakeholders, ensuring fair and transparent handling of complaints.To enforce compliance, the bill proposes a graded penalty system. It says that for the first contravention of the Act or related rules, the regulatory council may issue a written notice seeking clarification and rectification. If the institution fails to fix the lapse within the specified period, it would face a penalty of at least Rs 10 lakh. In case of a repeated violation, the council would impose a penalty of at least Rs 30 lakh and may also recommend removal of officials concerned, review or downgrade the institution’s academic and administrative autonomy, or withhold govt grants until compliance is achieved.For persistent or continuing violations, the penalty would be at least Rs 75 lakh, and the institution may face suspension of degree-awarding powers, loss of affiliation or even closure, with such recommendations being placed in the public domain.","Any university or higher education institution established without approval of Central or state govt would face a penalty of at least Rs 2 crore and immediate closure.

"Army to get 3 Apache attack copters, Navy to induct Seahawks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-to-get-3-apache-attack-copters-navy-to-induct-seahawks/articleshow/125968313.cms,"Representational photo

NEW DELHI: In a boost to India’s rotary wing combat capabilities, the Army is now finally set to get delivery of its three remaining Apache AH-64 attack helicopters from the US, while the Navy will also commission its second squadron of MH-60R Seahawk submarine-hunting choppers this week.The induction of these much-delayed American helicopters will plug existing operational gaps but the real punch will come when the Army and IAF hopefully begin getting 156 indigenous `Prachand’ light combat helicopters from 2028 onwards.Overall, the armed forces want over 1,000 new helicopters of different types in the next 10-15 years to make up for major deficiencies as well as replace obsolete Cheetah and Chetak fleets. They include 484 light utility helicopters in the 3.5-tonne class and 419 Indian multi-role helicopters in the 10-15-tonne class, but there have been huge delays in these projects being executed by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The three Apache gunships, dubbed “tanks in the air” since they are armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets, will touch down in India “within a couple of days”, defence officials told TOI.India had ordered six heavy-duty Apaches for the Army in a Rs 5,691 crore deal with the US in Feb 2020, under which the first three were delivered in July after a huge delay due to supply chain problems faced by Boeing.These six Apaches will add to the 22 such choppers inducted by IAF in 2019-2020 under a Rs 13,952 crore deal with the US in Sept 2015. The Army Apaches will be deployed at Jodhpur, where a squadron was raised in March last year to cater for the western front with Pakistan.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, in turn, will commission the second squadron of Seahawks, armed with Hellfire missiles, MK-54 torpedoes and precision-kill rockets as well as advanced sensors, at INS Hansa in Goa on Dec 17. The first squadron was raised at INS Garuda in Kochi in March 2024.The US has so far delivered 15 of the 24 Seahawks, which are manufactured by Sikorsky-Lockheed Martin, under a Rs 15,157 crore contract in Feb 2020. Incidentally, the defence ministry last month inked another Rs 7,955 crore contract with the US for follow-on support and spares for the multi-mission helicopters.While quite expensive, the Seahawks are crucial because the 140-warship Navy is currently grappling with just a handful of old Sea King and Kamov-28 anti-submarine warfare helicopters at a time when the presence of Chinese submarines is only going to further increase in the Indian Ocean Region.HAL has to deliver the Prachand light combat helicopters -- 90 for Army and 66 for IAF -- in the 2028-2033 timeframe under the mega Rs 62,700 crore contract inked in March this year.The Prachand helicopters will be armed with 20mm turret guns, 70mm rocket systems and air-to-air missiles for offensive operations and precision-strikes in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Siachen Glacier on the borders with China and Pakistan.The 156 highly-agile Prachand helicopters, each weighing 5.8 tonne, will add to the 15 such choppers (10 IAF and 5 Army) already inducted under a Rs 3,887 crore contract in 2022.","The Army is finally set to get delivery of its three remaining Apache AH-64 attack helicopters from the US.

SC: Employment on compassionate ground no ladder for promotion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-employment-on-compassionate-ground-no-ladder-for-promotion/articleshow/125966593.cms,"SC: Recruitment for other posts governed by rules applicable for all

New Delhi: In an important ruling, Supreme Court has said that a person employed on compassionate grounds to alleviate family difficulties because of death of a parent in harness cannot seek appointment to higher posts merely because they have the requisite qualifications for the same.A bench of Justices Rajesh Bindal and Manmohan on Friday reversed a Madras HC judgment directing Tami Nadu govt to promote two persons initially appointed as sweepers on compassionate grounds, due to death of their fathers, as Junior Assistants as they had the requisite qualifications for that post at the time of their appointment in 2007 and 2012. Both had approached the HC in 2015.The bench said employment is provided on compassionate grounds to the eligible kin of an employee who dies in harness to enable the family of the deceased to tide over difficult times. ""Such appointment which is arising out of exceptional circumstances cannot be used as a ladder to climb up in seniority by claiming a higher post merely on the basis that he/she is eligible for such post,"" it said. Justice Bindal said once the dependent of a deceased employee is offered employment on a compassionate basis, their right stands exercised. ""Thereafter, no question arises for seeking appointment to a higher post.Otherwise, it would be a case of 'endless compassion',"" he said.The bench said compassionate appointment is a relief against financial hardship caused by the sudden and unforeseen loss of the earning member of a family, and employment to the kin of the deceased is provided under such circumstances to ensure that the family members do not face impoverishment.The SC said recruitment for other posts are governed by rules and regulations which apply to all eligible candidates. Thus, it would be impermissible to allow a person who has entered employment through compassionate grounds to bypass the process of recruitment and get promoted to a higher post, it said.""An applicant for the post on a compassionate basis may be eligible for any higher post, but that does not mean he has the right to be appointed on that post. This depends on the rules and the policy applicable and also the number of vacancies to be offered in that category. In fact, this is not an additional source of recruitment, rather an exception to the general rule of providing equal opportunities to all for recruitment in government jobs,"" SC said.","Supreme Court reverses Madras HC judgment directing Tami Nadu govt to promote two persons initially appointed as sweepers on compassionate grounds, due to death of their fathers.

New Delhi: The three-member inquiry committee headed by Supreme Court Judge Aravind Kumar has asked Justice Yashwant Varma, facing removal motion in the Lok Sabha in the aftermath of discovery of wads of burnt and unaccounted currency notes from his official residence, to respond to the memo of charges against him.In its Dec 5 proceedings, Justice Varma sought eight more weeks to respond to the charges of misconduct framed against him by the committee - comprising Justice Kumar, Madras HC Chief Justice M M Srivastava and senior advocate B V Acharya - that was constituted under the Judges (Inquiry) Act on Aug 12 by LS Speaker Om Birla pursuant to a removal motion signed by 146 MPs.The committee granted Justice Varma six more weeks to file a detailed response to the charges and said no further time would be granted to him for this purpose. The proceedings are scheduled to resume in the last week of Jan.The inquiry panel has supplied the memo of charges along with evidence, mainly comprising videos of the burning cash recorded by Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel on the night of March 14-15 while dousing a fire in a room inside the judge's Lutyens Zone bungalow and statements of witnesses recorded by the in-house inquiry conducted by another three-member panel set up by former CJI Sanjiv Khanna.During the proceedings before the inquiry panel, constituted by the LS speaker, Justice Varma will have the opportunity to counter the charges, produce witnesses in support of his innocence and can cross examine witnesses supporting the memo of charges against him. A week after the discovery of the cash on his residential premises, Justice Varma was transferred from Delhi HC to his parent HC at Allahabad. He has been stripped of judicial work since then.On March 22, then CJI Khanna set up a three-member in-house inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Chief Justice G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman. This panel had submitted its report dated May 3 to the CJI on May 5.The in-house panel had rejected Justice Varma's defence that the cash had been planted to defame and discredit him, and said that it ""has no hesitation in holding that in the backdrop of direct as well as electronic evidence of unimpeachable character, further corroborated by the evidence of the experts, the issue of presence of cash in the storeroom situated within 30, Tughlaq Crescent, New Delhi, is established. "" It had recorded that the electronic evidence, mainly comprising videos and still photographs taken by the first responders, were found to be authentic by the Central Forensic Laboratory, Chandigarh.The panel's 64-page report had recorded that wads of half-burnt 500 currency notes in Justice Varma's official residence storeroom were cleaned up in the early hours of March 15 by ""trusted servants"" under the supervision of his private secretary after he talked on phone with the judge, who was out of station.","Justice Yashwant Varma is facing removal motion in the Lok Sabha in the aftermath of discovery of wads of burnt and unaccounted currency notes from his official residence.

Work-from-home and transport restrictions

Schools across Delhi shifted to hybrid classes for students from Classes 1 to 9 and Class 11 with immediate effect as air quality deteriorated to severe levels and authorities enforced stricter measures under the Graded Response Action Plan, stage IV.The Directorate of Education issued directions to all government, government-aided and unaided recognised private schools, as well as institutions run by NDMC, MCD and the Delhi Cantonment Board, to allow both physical and online attendance wherever feasible.The order stated that schools must conduct classes in a hybrid mode, combining in-person teaching with online lessons, for children up to Class IX and Class XI, while Classes X and XII were excluded from the arrangement.In the circular, the Directorate clarified that the option to attend online classes, where available, would rest with students and their guardians, and schools were instructed to immediately inform parents of the change.District and zonal education officers were directed to visit schools under their jurisdiction to ensure proper compliance with the instructions, according to officials quoted by the TNN in the report.Delhi recorded its worst air quality of the year, with the 24-hour average AQI standing at 431, while readings later crossed 450, pushing pollution into the severe plus category, officials said in statements cited by the TNN.The Commission for Air Quality Management imposed stage III measures earlier in the day before escalating to stage IV as conditions worsened, citing unfavourable meteorological factors, calm winds and pollutant accumulation, according to details shared with the TNN.Alongside school measures, the Delhi government ordered all public and private offices to operate with no more than 50 per cent staff physically present, while the remaining employees were required to work from home.The restrictions also included a ban on construction and demolition activities, limits on non-essential truck entry, and prohibitions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, while essential services such as hospitals, public transport and utilities were exempted, officials told the TNN.Officials said the measures were aimed at preventing further deterioration in air quality, advising children, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses to avoid outdoor activities until pollution levels show sustained improvement, according to advisories referenced by the TNN.Authorities stated that all stages of GRAP remain in force across Delhi-NCR, and enforcement agencies have been instructed to ensure strict implementation of the curbs until further orders, a senior official said in conversation with the TNN. No timeline for easing restrictions was indicated in the communication issued to concerned departments.","Delhi recorded its worst air quality of the year, with the 24-hour average AQI standing at 431, while readings later crossed 450.

'I arrived late because of my visa': An Indian student shares the early challenges of studying in Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/i-arrived-late-because-of-my-visa-an-indian-student-shares-the-early-challenges-of-studying-in-australia/articleshow/125959642.cms,"What nobody told her about studying in Australia | Monash design student story

Arriving late and learning to catch up





Adjusting to a different academic system





Working alongside studying





Understanding the real cost of living





Building a social circle slowly





What she wishes she had known earlier





For many Indian students, the decision to study abroad is shaped by trial, revision, and uncertainty. For Anvitha Reddy, now pursuing a Bachelor of Design at Monash University in Australia, the journey began with keeping every option open, exploring multiple universities and courses before finally finding the program that best aligned with her passion and career aspirations.“Initially, I applied to around 15 universities and I was keeping my options open,” she says. Over time, her focus narrowed. Australia stood out, and she began concentrating on institutions known for design education, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.The application process itself demanded persistence. “I was literally spending days and nights rewriting my SOPs, deleting, editing, and starting all over again,” she recalls. As a design applicant, she also had to prepare a portfolio, which added another layer of work. Once she shortlisted universities, she ensured she met all course requirements comfortably, not marginally, to strengthen her chances.After research and guidance from counsellors, she narrowed her final choices to the University of Melbourne and Monash University. “I eventually got accepted into Monash, and that’s where I decided to go,” she says.Her transition to Australia did not begin smoothly. A visa delay meant she arrived after the academic process had already started. “I was quite lost on how to enrol in classes and navigate through the university portal,” she says.Support from the university became essential at this stage. The University's support team helped her understand enrolment, systems and timelines. With her first semester nearing completion, she reflects on the experience with relief. “It’s been a learning experience, but also a very fulfilling one.”Studying in Australia required an adjustment from the structured routine she was used to in India. “In India, school or college means five days a week, 9 to 4, and a very fixed routine,” she explains.In contrast, the Australian system offered flexibility. Students could choose their classes and schedules. Anvitha attends university three days a week from 9 am to 2 pm, which allows her time to work part-time. This flexibility, she says, is one of the aspects she values most.Anvitha currently works part-time at a digital marketing company called Traffic Radius. She works three days a week, from Wednesday to Friday, and earns around 600 dollars per month. “This really helps me improve in my skill and manage my finances,” she says.She points out that finding field-specific roles can be difficult for students initially, while retail jobs are more accessible. Students also use many platforms to find work.Her advice is practical rather than aspirational. Part-time work can help, but students need to understand the limits of what they can manage alongside academic commitments.Tuition fees and rent form the bulk of Anvitha’s expenses. She lives in a student accommodation that provides all three meals. This arrangement, she says, saves time and reduces daily stress. “This helps me skip my cooking part,” she explains, allowing her to focus on coursework and exploring the city.Student accommodation in Australia typically costs between 400 and 900 dollars per week, depending on services. Anvitha pays 650 dollars per week, which includes food and laundry.She stays at Scape, a centrally located student accommodation. The facility includes shared spaces such as study areas, laundry rooms and dining halls. For her, the biggest benefit has been consistency in daily routines and access to meals. “Zero stress and this actually helps me focus on uni and enjoying the city,” she says.Social adjustment did not happen immediately. “I made no friends for like a week of landing here,” Anvitha admits. The turning point came through her accommodation’s common dining area. Seeing new people daily encouraged her to start conversations. “I made sure I speak to at least one person some how,” she says.Making friends at university was slower. As a design student, she found many classmates focused on individual work. Over time, group projects and peer assignments created space for interaction and connection. Universities also hosted cultural events, which helped her feel more settled.Looking back, Anvitha believes uncertainty is a normal part of the process. “It’s completely normal to feel lost in the beginning,” she says. She also challenges the idea that studying abroad is only about travel and enjoyment. According to her, it comes with responsibility, including managing time, finances, studies and work together.Her advice to future international students is clear. Start early, research courses carefully and ask for help when needed. “People are much more supportive than you’d expect,” she says.For Anvitha, the journey has been about learning to adapt rather than achieving instant comfort. The adjustment took time, but the process shaped how she studies, works and lives abroad.","Anvitha Reddy is pursuing a Bachelor of Design at Monash University in Australia.

Accreditation for standalone teacher training institutes

Single regulator to replace existing authorities

Legislative process and scope

The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill 2025 is set to be introduced in Parliament next week after receiving clearance from the Union Cabinet. The bill, earlier known as the HECI Bill, has now been renamed the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan (VBSA) Bill. It aims to establish a single regulator for higher education, replacing the University Grants Commission (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE).The legislation seeks to facilitate the independence and self-governance of universities and other higher educational institutions. Under the proposed framework, institutions will have a common benchmark for regulation, accreditation, and learning standards. Accreditation will become a key function of the new body, ensuring uniformity across all types of higher education institutions.According to media reports, the VBSA Bill may bring standalone teacher training institutes, such as B.Ed colleges, under an official accreditation framework for the first time. These institutes, which were previously outside the scope of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), will now be evaluated and approved based on standardised criteria.This move aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasises the transformation of teacher education into multidisciplinary institutions through the Integrated Teachers Education Programme (ITEP). Institutions have been given until 2030 to complete this transition.The VBSA Bill will establish a chairperson-led commission to oversee regulation, accreditation, and the setting of learning standards. While the new body will not hold the funding powers of UGC or AICTE, it will provide a unified regulatory framework. The UGC previously oversaw general higher education, AICTE managed technical education, and NCTE handled teacher training. With a single regulator, processes are expected to be more streamlined, reducing duplication and creating consistency in compliance requirements across universities and colleges.The bill is likely to be tabled in Parliament next week during the ongoing winter session. Earlier, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on education requested that the legislation be sent to the panel for review. Medical and legal education remain outside the ambit of HECI. Once enacted, the commission will set standards for regulation, accreditation, and learning outcomes, aiming for light but effective oversight.The VBSA Bill 2025 represents a significant restructuring of India’s higher education regulatory system. By introducing accreditation for standalone teacher training institutes and consolidating regulatory authorities, the legislation seeks to implement a uniform and comprehensive framework for higher education institutions across the country.","The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill 2025 is set to be introduced in Parliament next week.

NEW DELHI: With air quality worsening sharply across the Delhi-NCR, authorities on Saturday invoked the strictest restrictions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan, triggering emergency curbs across the region. This comes hours after implementation of GRAP stage III measured in the national capital region.The Commission for Air Quality Management said its GRAP sub-committee had decided to enforce all measures under Stage IV or ‘Severe+’ air quality with immediate effect after pollution levels crossed critical thresholds. In an official statement, the panel said, “Keeping in view the prevailing trend of air quality and in an effort to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the region, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP decides to invoke all actions as envisaged under Stage-IV of the extant GRAP ‘Severe+’ Air Quality (DELHI AQI > 450), with immediate effect, in the entire NCR. ” It added that these steps would be in addition to restrictions already in force under Stages I, II and III.In an official order, the government directed that all administrative secretaries and heads of departments shall attend office regularly, with no more than 50 per cent staff strength physically present.""The remaining 50 per cent staff shall work from home, provided that the Administrative Secretaries and Heads of Departments can call officers/officials to the office, as required to ensure uninterrupted delivery of essential and emergency public services,"" the order read.Likewise, the order stipulated that all private offices operating within Delhi shall function with no more than 50 per cent staff physically attending the workplace.""The remaining staff shall mandatorily work from home,"" it added. The order also urged all private entities to implement staggered working hours where feasible. Furthermore, private offices have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with work-from-home norms and minimise vehicular movement related to office commutes.""Hospitals and other public/private health establishments, Fire Services, Prisons, Public Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation and related municipal services, disaster management and related services, forest and environment departments/agencies engaged in air pollution control, monitoring, and enforcement activities (like teams deployed to curb biomass burning, dust control, GRAP measures, etc. ), and other essential/emergency services shall be exempted from these directions,"" the order said.The decision came hours after Delhi slipped back into the ‘severe’ category, prompting the reimposition of Stage III curbs earlier in the day. According to official data, the city’s Air Quality Index, which stood at 349 on Friday evening, surged overnight and was recorded at 401 by Saturday morning due to slow wind speeds, a stable atmosphere and unfavourable meteorological conditions that hampered the dispersion of pollutants.According to news agency ANI, As of 7.00 PM, AQI readings were 488 in Anand Vihar, 434 in Ashok Vihar, 496 in Bawana, 457 in Burari, 479 in Chandini Chowk, 394 in IGI Airport, and 445 in Okhla Phase-2.Also read: Delhi AQI turns 'severe': GRAP Stage III reimposed across NCR; what's allowed & what's not A dense layer of smog enveloped the capital on Saturday morning, reducing visibility and intensifying health concerns.

Student loan forgiveness landscape growing narrower

With inputs from Forbes

Student loan borrowers in the United States scored a major legal victory this week after a federal judge refused to grant the US Department of Education additional time to process long-pending student loan forgiveness claims under the landmark Sweet v. Cardona settlement, providing hope for thousands of borrowers who have been waiting months, and in some cases years, for relief.As reported by, the ruling affects more than 200,000 borrowers who applied for loan discharge under the Borrower Defense to Repayment programme and have been waiting for years for a decision. The court’s refusal to allow an 18-month delay reinforces a hard January 2026 deadline for relief and sends a strong message on government accountability in student loan administration.Thecase originated as a class action lawsuit filed by student loan borrowers against the first Trump administration. Borrowers alleged that the US Department of Education, under then Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, had unlawfully stalled or arbitrarily denied Borrower Defense to Repayment applications—sometimes leaving claims unresolved for years.Borrower Defense to Repayment allows federal student loan borrowers to seek loan cancellation if their educational institution engaged in misconduct, including misleading claims about job prospects, earnings potential, admissions standards, credit transferability, or the true cost of programmes.After prolonged litigation, the case was resolved in 2022 under the Biden–Harris administration through a binding settlement agreement designed to apply regardless of future political changes.Under the Sweet settlement, borrowers fall into different groups depending on when they submitted their Borrower Defense applications. Those who applied by June 2022 were eligible for automatic or expedited relief. Another group—known as “Post-Class Applicants”—submitted claims between June and November 2022.As per the settlement terms, Post-Class Applicants are entitled to full loan forgiveness if the Education Department fails to process their applications by January 28, 2026. It was this deadline that the department attempted to push back.Last month, the department argued in court that limited staffing and administrative resources made it impossible to review the remaining 200,000 applications on time, and requested an 18-month extension.The court overseeing the settlement firmly rejected the request. In a bench ruling on Thursday, US District Judge William Alsup declined to modify the settlement timeline, siding with borrowers and their legal representatives.“The student loan has been hanging over their head for how many years, how many decades, wrecking their credit,” Judge Alsup said during the hearing, according to. “It’s just not right.”Legal advocates for borrowers welcomed the decision. Eileen Connor, President and Executive Director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending (PPSL), which represents borrowers in the case, said the ruling reaffirmed borrowers’ right to timely justice after years of uncertainty.Following the court’s decision, the Department of Education must adhere to strict timelines. Borrower Defense claims from Post-Class Applicants who attended institutions on a court-approved list must be processed by January 28, 2026. If the department fails to meet this deadline, affected borrowers will automatically qualify for full settlement relief, including cancellation of eligible federal student loans and refunds of past payments.The department has until April 15, 2026, to complete reviews of all remaining Post-Class applications.The ruling comes at a time when federal student loan forgiveness options in the US are becoming more limited. As noted by, recent legislative and regulatory changes backed by congressional Republicans have weakened borrower-friendly rules governing the Borrower Defense programme.In addition, the Education Department has entered into a separate settlement that will eliminate the SAVE income-driven repayment plan, a Biden-era initiative designed to reduce monthly payments and accelerate loan forgiveness for eligible borrowers.Against this backdrop, the Sweet settlement remains one of the most consequential avenues for relief—making the court’s refusal to delay its implementation especially significant for hundreds of thousands of borrowers still awaiting resolution.","Federal court rejects US student loan forgiveness delay, clearing the way for relief to over 200,000 borrowers under the Sweet settlement.

He told cops that he wanted to kill the priest, Mahesh Sharma, as the latter harboured ""malicious intent"" towards his family.Sharma, who was away at the time of the murder, rubbished the claim, adding that he had received death threats around two weeks ago.His family said that a long-drawn property dispute over the temple might have been the motive behind the attack. A police officer said the dispute has been pending in court for several years. Cops sought a response from the Authority regarding the ownership status of the temple.Sharma, a resident of Ramnagar in Mansarovar Park, told police that he informed his wife, Kusum (48) at 11.30 am that he was going to perform a puja at the house of a resident of the society. ""I told her to come along, and she said that she would join me in a few minutes.""Ten minutes later, I received a phone call from a man who was painting the temple.He told me that my wife had been attacked with a chopper. She was struck on the head and other parts of the body,"" Sharma said.Kusum was rushed to the nearby GTB Hospital, but had died by then.According to Sharma, three to four people were present inside the temple when the man approached a woman and asked about Sharma's whereabouts. When she told him that Sharma was away, the man asked where Kusum was. As soon as the woman pointed towards her, the man pounced on Kusum. ""The woman picked up a stick and tried to stop him, but she was also attacked and sustained injuries. She received stitches on her head,"" Sharma said.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Prashant Priya Gautam said that the man, who is being questioned, was detained along with the weapon of murder.A case was registered under Section 103 (murder) of BNS.

The Chhattisgarh test



East in Focus



A Familiar transition tool



The Bharatiya Janata Party has once again sprung a surprise. In a significant organisational move, the BJP parliamentary board has appointed Bihar minister and five-time MLA Nitin Nabin as the party’s Working National President, making him the youngest leader to occupy the post in the party’s history.The elevation underlines the BJP’s reliance on quiet strategists as it recalibrates its national political and organisational strategy. The importance of the move underlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who described Nitin Nabin as a hardworking karyakarta with strong organisational roots.At 45, Nitin Nabin represents the BJP’s younger leadership tier, but his political career has been built on experience rather than speed. A five-time MLA, he has served multiple terms as a minister in the Bihar government, combining administrative responsibility with sustained organisational engagement.Within the party, Nabin is known more as an organisation man than a mass leader. His long association with the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and his exposure to booth-level mobilisation and cadre management align closely with the BJP’s election-winning model.During Anurag Thakur’s tenure as BJYM national president, Nabin served as a general secretary, handling inter-state coordination and campaign execution — a phase that gave him early exposure to national-level organisation.Nabin’s organisational credentials were reinforced during the 2023 Chhattisgarh Assembly elections. At a time when most exit polls were predicting a BJP loss and the return of a Congress government under Bhupesh Baghel, the party delivered a decisive victory.As the BJP’s in-charge for the state, Nabin worked largely behind the scenes, focusing on micro-planning, candidate coordination and organisational discipline. The result confounded pollsters and strengthened his reputation within the party as a quiet but effective election manager.The elevation of a leader from Bihar is also politically significant. Bihar remains central to the BJP’s medium and long-term electoral strategy. By bringing a leader from the state into the national organisational leadership, the party is signalling a sharper focus on eastern India.Nitin Nabin’s rise also sends a clear message to party workers- organisational work and loyalty continue to matter.The BJP has used the working president model earlier during leadership transitions. In 2019, J P Nadda was appointed working president when Amit Shah was party president and later inducted into the Union cabinet as home minister.Seen in that context, Nitin Nabin is viewed within the party as a reliable, non-controversial choice, focused on execution rather than factional politics.",The elevation underlines the BJP’s reliance on quiet strategists as it recalibrates its national political and organisational strategy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Nitin Nabin as a hardworking karyakarta with strong organisational roots.

What is Pink Tax ?



It may sound like a trivial question, but the answer points to a deeper issue: the Pink Tax

.

The Pink Tax shows up across everyday life:

Personal care products:

Fashion and accessories:

Cosmetic procedures:

Healthcare

:

How marketing makes femininity costlier



The safety tax: Paying to feel safe



Housing: Where safety overrides affordability



The unpaid labour tax



Healthcare and fertility pressure



The pay gap makes the burden heavier



The ‘career loss’ tax



Does simply existing as a woman cost more?



Does society acknowledge how expensive womanhood is?



I don’t think society fully acknowledges how expensive womanhood is because many of these costs are normalised and invisible. They’re framed as ‘choices’, not necessities. Until we recognise these expenses as structural rather than personal, women will continue to bear them quietly, without much conversation. Priyanka Mukherjee

Is safety treated as a luxury rather than a right?



The bill may be invisible, but it’s paid daily.

What is luxury?For a woman, simply being able to take a walk at night is often considered a luxury. But this freedom isn't free. It comes at a cost most people never see, the extra money, effort and emotional labour women pay every day just to exist.Every rupee women spend is backed by labour, yet when it comes to buying everyday essentials, its value seems to shrink. Every morning, as I get ready for office, I inevitably spend more than a man would and not because I am extravagant, but because of the hidden taxes I pay every time I buy something.Why? Because a moisturiser packaged in lavender tones, promising ""smooth skin"" , costs more than a man’s basic black bottle offering the same function. When I calculated my spending on personal care, clothing, services and daily necessities, the pattern became impossible to ignore.How? Because women consistently pay more year after year simply because products are marketed to them. And no, this isn’t just a Western problem. India isn’t exempt.It is not a government levy or an official surcharge. Instead, it is the invisible premium women pay for products and services marketed ""for women"" , even when they are nearly identical to men’s versions.Simply put, it’s the cost of being a woman. Many everyday products aimed at women are priced higher than their male counterparts despite serving the same purpose.""I think most people have little idea of the extra costs a woman has to bear simply to exist. There is a concept of ‘Pink Tax’ that few men are aware of, as it mainly involves women’s personal care products. Beyond the monetary aspect, there is also a safety angle to all this,"" said Aashish Saxena.That’s the Pink Tax — and that’s why a pink razor costs more than a man’s black one.Women’s shampoos, conditioners and moisturisers routinely cost more than men’s, even when the difference is limited to packaging or colour.Women’s formalwear and accessories are often priced higher despite similar materials and construction. The markup is usually explained away as ""fashion"" or ""finishing"" .Aggressively marketed to women, adding to the financial burden.Gynaecological check-ups, fertility consultations and reproductive healthcare come with higher recurring costs.""If you book a full comprehensive check-up for men on the health/medical app, it costs Rs 4,999, but for women, it costs Rs 5,999,"" said Pallavi, pointing to the hidden cost.Women are often seen as less price-sensitive when it comes to personal care, not because they want to be, but because many of these products are framed as necessities. Companies exploit this shift. What was once optional is now presented as baseline: SPF, retinol, serums, AM/PM routines, laser treatments, Botox, hair removal, marketed as ""permanent"" solutions that never truly end.""If we look at the market, the range of products available for women the variants and the overall maintenance and is far wider compared to men. The skincare industry largely targets women, giving men limited space under the idea of toughness,"" said Vijaya Srivastava.Pallavi also points to fashion as another quiet contributor to the hidden tax. ""Why can’t I have jeans with normal-sized pockets that can fit today’s phones?"" she asks.""Men can just slip their phones into their pockets and walk freely. Why do we have to carry a handbag just to hold a phone? Because we don’t have pockets."" Her frustration reflects how design choices, driven by fashion norms and commercial interests, create yet another invisible cost: one paid in convenience, money and everyday freedom.Beyond products, women quietly absorb another cost, the safety tax! In urban India, women often pay a premium simply to move through the city. Public transport that is cheaper for men is not always an option. Cabs, safer buses or higher travel classes become necessities, not luxuries.Ignoring buses, trains and shared autos ""just to feel safe"" is common and expensive. ""While men don’t have to think twice about getting into a crowded metro or bus, a woman might opt for a far more expensive cab just to avoid harassment,"" said Aashish.Aastha Jha explains the cost she absorbs every month. ""I pay Rs 6,000 for travel to office every month. I haven’t used shared autos, buses or the metro enough to even compare. My area is quite secluded with poor connectivity, so sharing doesn’t feel safe.""She adds that this expense isn’t consciously planned. ""I don’t budget for it deliberately, but I’ve been doing it subconsciously for years.""While men may think about safety during odd hours, Aastha notes the difference during the day. ""Men my age think about safety late at night. During normal hours, they don’t have to factor it in.""For women, even basic freedoms come with anxiety. ""Being able to take a walk at night feels like a luxury. Whether you live in a gated society or a secluded area, you never really know who could harm you.""Her colleague Vivek Dubey agrees. ""Safety matters to everyone, but not in the same way. I can book a cab at midnight without much thought. My main concern is the driver’s driving, not my personal safety.""He admits this is a privilege men often overlook. ""I can take a bike taxi because it’s cheaper. I wouldn’t recommend the same to my female friends because of harassment risks.""Safety also dictates where women live.""When I came to New Delhi, my priorities were safety and security,"" recalls Jyoti, a college student. ""I looked at high-rise societies with rents far above my budget, but I had no choice,"" she said.Natasha Singh adds, ""Safety plays a huge role in evaluating cost of living."" After a robbery at her home, she and her flatmate were more concerned about security than stolen items. ""When my flatmate was not in town, I used to travel all the way from Noida to Gurgaon to live with my parents because I didn’t feel safe living alone.""Women also bear the burden of unpaid domestic and emotional labour: cooking, cleaning, caregiving and emotional management, the work that doesn’t show up in GDP calculations.Menstrual products are unavoidable expenses men do not face. Beyond that, women incur ongoing costs linked to reproductive health, PCOS, fertility testing, supplements and preventive check-ups.""Women experience more frequent health milestones and transitions, which leads to higher spending on routine medical care and supplements — costs that are rarely framed as healthcare burdens,"" said Priyanka Mukherjee.""The biggest hidden tax that I pay, I think, is healthcare tax. Firstly, female health is the least talked about. And because of that, even the most basic tests cost thousands. And I am just talking about tests, have not even started on medication, consultation,"" said Aastha.Period poverty adds another layer. Despite GST removal on sanitary pads in 2018, one in ten girls under 21 in rural areas still cannot afford menstrual products.Women earn less but pay more.In India, women earn approximately Rs 40 for every Rs 100 earned by men. The country ranks 131 out of 148 in the Global Gender Gap Report 2025.""Yes, I do believe women are often paid less than male colleagues with similar experience or output, though the gap is not always obvious on paper. It shows up in slower growth, fewer leadership opportunities, or being expected to ""prove"" consistency over time,"" said Priyanka reflecting on the disparity that only makes the burden of the Pink Tax feel heavier.Vijaya highlighted what she sees as one of the biggest hidden taxes women pay at work. ""I’ve had colleagues with the same or even less work experience earn a higher CTC than me. I’ve also seen my female colleagues having to switch jobs more frequently than men simply because companies don’t make retention offers to them,"" she said.""Men, on the other hand, are often retained. There’s never been an official declaration, but the pattern is quite evident. Having to repeatedly adjust to new environments is another hidden tax I’ve noticed,"" she added.The Pink Tax doesn’t just hurt wallets — it reinforces inequality!Safety concerns also push many women out of high-paying night shifts or demanding roles altogether. A budding journalist, Oshin, said she considered quitting because late working hours didn’t feel feasible for her.Living far from work, she didn’t want to take on the additional financial and emotional burden of arranging safety every night.Smriti Jain believes it does. ""Simply being a woman comes with higher, unavoidable expenses. While awareness is growing, the true economic impact is still not fully acknowledged,"" she said.Natasha echoed the sentiment, saying, ""From daily transport to monthly periods, our lives are forced to be comparatively more expensive. Whether it is shopping for toiletries or simply getting a haircut, everything is more costly, marketed as a better lifestyle choice.""Priyanka, speaking candidly, agreed. ""Honestly, yes. Simply existing as a woman costs more — financially, emotionally and mentally. From safety planning and health spending to clothing choices shaped by social scrutiny, there are constant micro-costs attached to being cautious, prepared and presentable,"" she said.She added that one of the biggest hidden taxes rarely discussed is mental bandwidth. ""The cost of constantly thinking ahead. ‘Is this safe?’ ‘Should I stay late?’ ‘Do I need a cab?’ ‘Will this be misread?’ That constant vigilance has an economic value we never calculate.""""For many women, safety often feels like something you have to plan and pay for, rather than something that simply exists,"" she added.Vivek acknowledged the disparity. ""Yes, I do think simply existing as a woman costs more, financially, mentally and emotionally. But I don’t think society truly acknowledges it. There’s a kind of collective blindness around this issue. It’s almost as if society has accepted that it’s expensive to be a woman and decided this is just how things are,"" he said.Rajeev Singh another male colleague of Vivek also agreed. ""Men generally have greater flexibility to compromise on comfort or safety. Social norms, lower levels of harassment and fewer restrictions on movement allow men to accept risks that would be unreasonable or dangerous for women. Womanhood does appear costly — even if you subtract safety-related expenses,"" he said.Aastha believes the issue is deeply structural. ""Absolutely. Society itself has made womanhood expensive by keeping research and technological development that could genuinely benefit women scarce,"" she said.""An HPV vaccine that could prevent cervical cancer costs thousands. These are exactly the areas that should be mass-produced, considering women make up nearly half the country’s population,"" she added.Priyanka, however, feels the burden remains largely invisible.Natasha believes it is. ""It's a known fact that women feel more restricted even if it’s self-imposed, after a safety incident occurs in their vicinity. When a DU student was harassed outside a girls’ college, the response was to put up posters listing ‘dos and don’ts’ for women. That tells you everything. Our safety is treated like a joke, not a basic right,"" she said.Vivek added that meaningful change requires structural effort.""Real change would require going back to the basics, changing policies, enforcing laws, redesigning public spaces, and challenging everyday behaviour. That takes effort and intent. And perhaps that’s why the issue is often ignored, even though it affects the dignity and daily lives of nearly half the population,"" he said.Taken together, these everyday choices where women live, how they travel, the work they take on and the risks they avoid rarely show up as line items in budgets or policy discussions.Yet they quietly shape women’s freedom, mobility and opportunities in ways that are easy to overlook but hard to escape.","Every rupee women spend is backed by labour, yet when it comes to buying everyday essentials, its value seems to shrink. Every morning, as I get ready for office, I inevitably spend more than a man would and not because I am extravagant, but because of the hidden taxes I pay every time I buy something.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125962672,imgsize-12650,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

A hill that carries centuries of coexistence

Living together on sacred stone - The people of the hills



Who owns the hill?



When devotees moved to court for sacred lamp



A new legal question built on old legislative stones



the 1920 decree gave the temple ownership of the hill and thus rights over ritual space;

no judicial order specifically prohibited lighting the lamp at Deepathoon;

refusal to even consider the location violated fairness and procedure.

The flame meets politics



When the debate reached Parliament



The three axes of the conflict

Judicial authority and constitutional limits

State discretion in preventing potential unrest

Devotee autonomy in ritual practice

Rising at the edge of Madurai, Thiruparankundram in Tamil Nadu 's Madurai has served as sanctuary, landmark, battlefield, shrine and memory for centuries. First to Jain monks who chiselled beds into its stone nearly 2,300 years ago, later to poets of the Sangam age who immortalised it as Murugan Kundram, and eventually to monarchs, pilgrims and mendicants who left inscriptions and belief layered into its slopes.Across centuries, the hill took on meanings that were never singular. It became a sacred space for Murugan devotees, a site associated with the god’s divine wedding, a spiritual retreat that bore Jain inscriptions in early Tamil script, and by the 14th century, a place of significance for followers of Sikandar Shah, whose memorial evolved into the Sikander Badusha Dargah. As rituals shifted and dynasties changed, Thiruparankundram continued to absorb new customs into its landscape.For generations of residents, the hill's story was not interpreted through boundaries or separations, but through the shared steps people climbed and the shared festivals they observed.Today, that long history forms the backdrop against which new questions are being posed about space, symbolism and tradition. A debate that has become a flashpoint between devotees in courtrooms and a stage for fresh DMK vs BJP.Thiruparankundram occupies a singular place in Tamil Nadu's cultural and religious landscape. Recognised as one of the Arupadai Veedu, the six sacred abodes of Lord Murugan, it is revered as the site associated with the divine wedding of Murugan and Deivanai, a narrative deeply embedded in Tamil devotional literature and temple ritual.References to the hill appear in Sangam-era texts such as 'Akananuru' and 'Thirumurugatrupadai', indicating that its sanctity has been acknowledged for well over two millennia. Archaeological evidence traces the hill's significance even further back: around 2,300 years ago, Jain monks carved stone beds with Tamizhi-era inscriptions along its slopes, marking it as a place of spiritual retreat long before the temple infrastructure seen today.By the sixth century, the site appears in the 'Tevaram' hymns as 'Parankundram' and over time it evolved into a complex centre of worship. In the eighth century, Pandya ruler Parantaka Varagu and General Santhan Ganapathy commissioned a rock-cut temple dedicated to Soma Skanda, depicting Shiva, Parvati and Murugan together.The temple houses shrines for Vishnu , Vinayaka, Durga, Jyeshta Devi and others, representing the Panchayatana tradition of multiple deities within a single sacred complex.Inscriptions from the period, including one from 773 CE referencing the worship of Jyeshta Devi, showcase a layered ritual ecosystem that adapted and expanded with dynastic rule and regional belief.The history of the hill took another turn in the 14th century.During the Madurai Sultanate, following the invasion led by Alauddin Khilji's general Malik Kafur, the region came under the rule of ten Muslim sultans. The last among them, Sikandar Shah, is believed to have sought refuge in the hills before being killed. A memorial to him eventually transformed into the Sikkander Badusha Dargah, developing into a site of devotion where followers regarded him as a Sufi saint.According to researchers and local oral histories, including interpretations cited by the Thiruparankundram Jamath, a Pandya ruler is said to have sanctioned a prayer site out of repentance, a narrative symbolising reconciliation rather than conflict.Over centuries, religious practices have evolved on this hill through shared participation.One such tradition is 'kandoori', a practice involving offering and sharing of meat as thanksgiving, described by the Jamath as conceptually similar to nerthi kadan in Hindu customs where vows are fulfilled through food or offerings. Members of the Muslim community note that Hindus have historically participated in kandoori rituals, while Muslims join in temple festivals, tonsuring infants’ heads and celebrating street processions.Local residents often describe the hill's identity not through the lens of division but through shared spaces and shared customs. C Santhalingam, a former officer of the Tamil Nadu archaeology department told TOI that Thiruparankundram is ""among the most unique as it is a place where histories and faiths intersect."" He emphasises that the hill ""has never belonged to one community,"" pointing out not only the temple and the dargah but also the Jain beds with inscriptions, evidence of its long and diverse spiritual heritage.However, Santhalingam and others note that in recent months, debates surrounding religious practice have begun overshadowing this legacy of coexistence. A disagreement over a signboard referring to facilities for kandoori rituals triggered a fresh set of tensions in February this year, leading to protests, petitions and involvement from political stakeholders.""Kandoori is not an orthodox Muslim practice,"" M Arif, secretary of Thiruparankundram Jamath told TOI in February. ""It is closer to gurbani, where meat is shared after an animal is butchered. In kandoori, a person makes a wish, cooks food, and shares it, which is like the Hindu practice of nerthi kadan (offering food or some valuables as a vow).""Jamath member A Abudahir said even Hindus in the area followed kandoori and offered prayers at dargahs. ""We are not outsiders. We are Tamil Nadu's people. It's just that we have some unique customs. Even today, we tonsure our newborns' heads like they do in Hindu rituals before we offer kandoori at the hilltop dargah,"" he said.Sathya Seelan, a third-generation hairdresser, said that for generations, his family has been tonsuring the heads of those who participate in the kandoori ritual. ""A decade ago, some people earned money by carrying goats and cooking materials up the hill for this ritual,"" he said. During the annual Santhakoodu festival, much like a temple car festival, a decorated dome placed on a cart is drawn through streets, said Abudahir. ""People apply sandalwood paste to the dome in memory of Sikandar Shah. All Hindus participate and we have never had any issue. We also enjoy the temple car festival.""The dispute over lighting the Karthigai deepam is seen by many locals as part of a broader shift, where questions of space, symbolism and historical rights have become increasingly contested.For much of its past, the hill held room for many traditions at once, and its rituals adjusted to the rhythms of diverse communities. The current debates, both legal and political, revisit unresolved questions from earlier decades, but they also reflect contemporary anxieties over identity, culture and authority. As many long-time residents reiterate, conflict is not the oldest story of Thiruparankundram; coexistence is.Today, this hill is the focus point of DMK vs BJP in Tamil Nadu. The issue has echoed from Parliament o Supreme Court.However, legal disputes around ownership and ritual usage of the hill began in the early 20th century, long before the current political and administrative controversy surrounding the Karthigai deepam ritual.In the 1920s, both the temple administration and the dargah trustees approached the courts seeking recognition over sections of the hill. The case travelled through the colonial judiciary, and the Privy Council eventually upheld the temple’s ownership of the hill. It also recognised a small but significant portion of land to the dargah.Although the judgment settled ownership, it did not address ritual traditions or determine exclusive religious rights at various points on the hill. That space later became ground for differing interpretations.For decades following this verdict, the Karthigai deepam festival proceeded without becoming a symbol of territorial claim. The lamp was lit at the Uchipillaiyar temple mandapam, a practice widely recognised and rarely challenged. The serenity broke only in the 1990s, when the first petition asked that deepam be shifted upward to Deepathoon.In 1994, a devotee approached the Madras high court demanding the lamp be lit at the hilltop pillar instead of the Uchipillaiyar mandapam.In 1996, the court responded by affirming the mandapam as the ""traditional spot"". This was the first time the spot for lighting the flame was confirmed, keeping it at a safe distance from the dargah.It was an order rooted in practicality but written with ambiguity. It left the door open for a possible change in the future.Almost two decades later in 2014, another petition revived the same demand. The court rejected the plea again, asserting that devotees cannot enforce ritual preferences in court and that judges must not intervene in spiritual practices unless administrative failures are proven.In 2017, a division bench upheld that reasoning. Temple management, the court reiterated, retains autonomy over rituals, locations and modalities. These pronouncements seemed settled law. But the Karthigai deepam debate is yet far from its final chapter.In 2024, Hindu Tamilar Katchi founder Rama Ravikumar filed a fresh petition. His argument rested on three pillars:On December 1, Justice GR Swaminathan agreed with the petitioner and directed that the lamp be lit at the hilltop pillar. When the order was not implemented on the festival day, the judge concluded that the breach was clear and he permitted the petitioner and ten others to light the lamp themselves, with Central Industrial Security Force protection.However, the administration blocked the access to the hill citing prohibitory orders, a pending appeal, safety concerns and the need to maintain communal harmony. The police prevented even personnel of a central security force from proceeding, and the unlit deepam became a headline.What could have been a closed legal loop immediately expanded into a political spiral.Dispute over deepam ritual matter because they turn abstract ideology, Dravidian vs Hindutva, into a tangible battle over who speaks for Tamil Hindus, on temple steps and hilltops both parties cannot afford to lose.The symbolism is powerful: a flame, a hill, a shared sacred space. The BJP sees opportunity; the DMK sees risk.DMK has alleged that BJP is trying to use the deepam issue to create an Ayodhya-like situation (Babri masjid) in Tirupparankundram.Tamil Nadu BJP president Nainar Nagendran accused the Stalin government of indulging in vote-bank politics, claiming there was no Muslim opposition to the ritual and framing the controversy as a ""manufactured hurdle"". He has also retorted that ""Ayodhya is in India, not in England or Europe. There is nothing wrong in Tirupparankundram becoming Ayodhya. We have heard the greatness of Ram Rajya and want to implement it here. ""BJP MP Tejasvi Surya escalated the rhetoric by calling the DMK administration ""undemocratic and fascist"" for failing to enforce a judicial order. Union Minister L Murugan added that the state was ""denying the right to worship"" and acting in contempt of the law.The VHP called the situation an ""attack on constitutional rights of Hindus"", urging central intervention and judicial cognisance.The DMK government countered with a narrative rooted in continuity and caution. Chief minister MK Stalin said the deepam was lit ""at the right place at the right time"" according to age-old practice, and argued that those insisting on the hilltop location were attempting to turn a spiritual tradition into a divisive exercise.He described such efforts as ""cheap politics of the worst kind"" and reassured that Tamil Nadu remained a place where people of all religions lived ""like relatives"", protected by the light of equality lit by Periyar’s reformist ideals.The Left parties alleged that there were attempts to whip up communal tensions in Tamil Nadu by manufacturing a controversy around the religious sites. In a joint statement, the CPI(M), CPI, CPI(ML), RSP, and AIFB condemned the targeting of Madurai MP Su Venkatesan over the issue.""The Left parties strongly condemn the attempts by the BJP and other Hindutva communal forces to whip up communal tensions in Tamil Nadu by manufacturing a controversy around the religious sites situated on Tirupparankundram Hill in Madurai district, with a sinister eye on political gain,"" the statement read.The AIADMK meanwhile passed resolutions condemning interference in the judiciary and sought projection of its leader as a future chief minister. While its criticism converged with BJP’s, its rhetoric positioned itself as a defender of judicial independence rather than explicitly labeling the issue as anti-Hindu.As DMK MPs protested in Parliament this week during Winter session demanding the issue be raised, the Lok Sabha was adjourned. When remarks were made against the judge behind the order, reactions from ministers were swift, reminding members that criticism of the judiciary crosses constitutional boundaries. Outside the courts, the Madras high court division bench warned against demoralising the institution and cautioned that the judiciary’s patience must not be tested.At the same time, the INDIA bloc initiated steps for impeachment of Justice Swaminathan, alleging judicial overreach and potential disturbance to communal harmony. Impeachment motions against judges are rare, politically consequential and historically treated as measures of last resort.The Karthigai deepam row cannot be read purely as a religious issue. Three themes intersect at the hill:Meanwhile, the question of coexistence, an unwritten social contract honoured for centuries, hangs in the background.","Thiruparankundram in Tamil Nadu's Madurai has served as sanctuary, landmark, battlefield, shrine and memory for centuries. It became a sacred space for Murugan devotees, a site associated with the god’s divine wedding, a spiritual retreat that bore Jain inscriptions in early Tamil script.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125959462,imgsize-1337222,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-generated-image-for-representation-only.jpg"

How Bangladesh’s Feb 12 Vote Could Reshape India’s Northeast Access And Regional Power Balance

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said his party stood with “satya” (truth) and pledged to oust the “Narendra Modi-RSS government” from power.Addressing the Congress party ’s ‘Vote Chor Gaddi Chhod’ rally at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha launched a sharp attack on the Election Commission He named Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and Election Commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, alleging that they were working in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party.“We will stand with ‘satya’ (truth) and will remove the Narendra Modi-RSS government from power. They have ‘satta’ (power), and they indulge in ‘vote chori’,” Gandhi said.He claimed that the BJP transferred Rs 10,000 during elections but alleged that the poll panel failed to take action. “In this fight between truth and untruth, the Election Commission is working with the BJP government,” Gandhi said.Gandhi further alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had brought in a new law granting immunity to the Election Commission and said it would be changed. “(Prime Minister Narendra) Modi brought a new law to give immunity to EC; we will change this law retroactively and act against election commissioners,” he said.Asserting that truth would ultimately prevail, even if it took time, Gandhi added, “We’ll work with truth and non-violence to defeat Modi and (Amit) Shah.”Alleging that the ideology of the Manusmriti, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will ""destroy the nation"", Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday pitched that it is only the ideology of the opposition party which will ultimately save the country's Constitution from being destroyed.""Only Congress party's ideology can save the nation; ideology of (Mohan) Bhagwat, (Madhav Rao) Gowalkar Guruji, or the Manusmriti will not save the nation, but destroy it.

Celebrating small wins

This Energy Conservation Day: Don’t waste what you don’t use.

Every month, millions of Indian households pay for electricity they never actually use. The lights might be off, the fans switched down, but hidden leaks quietly drain energy, inflate bills, and add to the country’s carbon footprint. Unlike water dripping from a tap, electricity leaks have no sound, no puddle, no visible cue. So, it goes unnoticed and we don’t react. From chargers left in sockets to old appliances that hum non-stop, these silent drains often called “phantom loads” cost families thousands of rupees each year and contribute millions of tonnes of avoidable CO₂ emissions nationally.Meet Urja,On the surface, she seems like the poster child for energy consciousness. She turns off lights before leaving a room, switches off fans, monitors unnecessary usage, and genuinely believes she's doing more than her part. She even scolds her younger brother for leaving the kitchen light on. But the truth sits quietly in the corners of her home long after she’s stopped noticing.When you zoom in, cracks appear. Urja’s refrigerator, a sturdy 12-year-old unit that has probably watched her grow from a child to a working adult, gulps far more electricity than she imagines.She recently bought a new AC, but to save money, she picked a three-star model instead of the more efficient four- or five-star options. Her chargers, laptop, phone, tablet,and Wi-Fi stay permanently plugged into the socket because “it’s too much effort” to unplug them. The fridge door remains open while she chats about work gossip. Her microwave glows like a digital clock. And the TV? That one never gets unplugged, just in case she wants to switch it on “for background noise” while doomscrolling.Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? These are the small, invisible slips that quietly drain energy, money, and the planet.A problem cannot be solved without acknowledging that it exists in the first place. Habits cannot be unlearned without awareness of their silent effects. And wastage cannot be curbed in our homes and offices until we recognise the leaks, the ones hiding in our everyday appliances tthat urgently need fixing.Environmentalist Kavita Ashok calls these hidden electricity leaks “vampire energy” — the silent drain that happens even when appliances appear to be off.“Energy drains in homes have an interesting name —. I call it the phantom power used by household appliances when they’re left plugged in even when we aren’t using them. This is serious for our environment, as the CO₂ emissions from this alone account for nearly 1% of total emissions. It also reduces the lifespan of domestic appliances due to constant wear and tear More so the electricity bill shoots up by 5-10% by this unnecessary power consumption”Every year on December 14 , India observes National Energy Conservation Day , a moment meant not just to raise awareness but to remind citizens that energy efficiency is a shared responsibility. Introduced in 1991 and championed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) , the day reflects India’s commitment to reducing unnecessary consumption and promoting sustainable practices and that is not possible without energy conservation which is the cornerstone of sustainable development.Energy conservation isn’t merely a matter of turning off lights. It’s about recognising deeper patterns in the devices we buy, how long we use them, how we maintain them, and the behaviours we normalise in our homes and institutions. The day calls for introspection: Are we actually conserving energy, or just feeling like we are?Because the hidden truth is that much of India’s electricity is wasted long before it lights a bulb or cools a room.A large part of India’s electricity silently disappears into what experts call “invisible drains” — electricity we pay for but never actually use. Somesh Kumar, partner and leader, Power & Utilities, EY India, explains that this loss can be grouped into three major categories: Phantom Loads, Inefficiency Losses, and Structural Leakage.Often termed “ghost power,” this refers to electricity drawn by appliances even when switched off. Set-top boxes, Wi-Fi routers, TVs, gaming consoles, and chargers continue consuming power silently to maintain internal clocks or remain ready for remote-control operation.This alone accounts for 5–10% of household electricity consumption , costing families Rs1,500–Rs3,000 annually and adding up to nearly Rs 200 billion nationally .Old or poorly maintained appliances such as air conditioners, refrigerators, fans, washing machines become energy-hungry over time. Dust-clogged filters, worn-out seals, and aging motors force them to work harder, increasing consumption by 10–15% in many households.Faulty wiring, old circuits, and leakage currents can silently inflate household electricity bills by around 9% . In offices and institutions, mis-calibrated systems, aging motors, and refrigerant leaks can push waste up to 12% of total consumption. All this occurs without any visible sign which makes it particularly dangerous.These quiet leaks are far more serious when placed in context with India’s power generation mix.In 2024, fossil fuels, primarily coal, still contributed 78% of India’s electricity. Every watt wasted at home directly translates into:When phantom loads, old appliances, and wiring losses across millions of households are added together, they contribute millions of tonnes of avoidable CO₂ emissions every year. Energy wastage isn’t just a household problem, it's a climate problem.A quick survey conducted among a small group of people revealed a pattern that most people were willing to adopt cost-effective energy measures and cared about the environmental impact of hidden energy drains, which highlights that most energy waste isn’t because people don’t care. It’s mostly because:But it does, especially when multiplied by India’s millions of households..Another reason revealed was lack of awareness. Many people didn’t even know that standby consumption exists and what actually is the star rating that we see on appliances.Ishita Mahapatra, 23, said “Honestly, I never checked star ratings before buying any appliance. I was curious about what they meant, but I assumed it was just some pricing gimmick. I usually focus more on features and how the product looks, and wasn't aware or particularly concerned about how much electricity it might consume or waste while buying”.The State Energy Efficiency Index 2024 shows that the domestic sector accounts for nearly one-third of India’s electricity consumption, highlighting how crucial household actions are.Even those aware often don’t have the time or motivation to unplug devices, maintain appliances, or check wiring.Many households opt for cheaper, old-tech or low-star appliances because they cannot afford more efficient models. Ironically, this results in higher electricity bills, a long-term penalty for a short-term saving.On being asked why he thinks energy wastage continues to happen in his home, Shivendra Singh, 26, said, “We’ve all heard and seen energy-saving campaigns, but I think the problem is that we’ve never really experienced electricity scarcity firsthand.”“There’s no visible consequence when we waste power. So we underestimate the harm. Because the impact isn’t immediate or personal, it’s easy to ignore it in daily life”, he added.Somesh Kumar, Partner and Leader, Power & Utilities, EY India explained how Urban households waste more energy overall because of higher appliance density — ACs, large fridges, multiple TVs, routers, smart devices. Cooling inefficiencies and standby loads dominate their silent losses.Rural homes, though consuming less power, surprisingly waste more per device due to:“With 86% of rural households historically dependent on biomass, electrification is growing rapidly. If rural India adopts low-efficiency appliances now, these could remain in use for 10–15 years, locking in long-term inefficiency. Cities waste more because they use more. Villages risk wasting more because their choices today shape consumption for a decade” said Somesh Kumar.Your smartphone scrolling, cloud backup, digital payments, streaming all depend on massive data centres. These energy-intensive facilities require extensive cooling, magnifying their consumption. If the digital economy grows faster than renewable energy integration, India's coal dependency will deepen. Digital convenience, too, comes with a rising environmental price.Satnam Singh, Senior Practice Leader & Director at Crisil Intelligence, underscores the scale of household inefficiency at a time when India’s energy demand is soaring and the country is trying to shift to cleaner, more efficient systems. He explains that despite advances in technology and policy, the biggest energy losses often occur inside our own homes—long before electricity is put to any productive use.“As India pushes toward cleaner energy and smarter consumption, a surprising amount of electricity is still being lost inside our own homes—long before it reaches any productive use. Old refrigerators, air conditioners, fans and TVs consume far more power than modern models… often using 40–60% more electricity.Many devices never fully switch off… This standby load can account for up to 10% of a household’s consumption. Every unit wasted at home means more fuel burned for power generation… Cutting this invisible consumption is one of the fastest, lowest-cost ways to reduce emissions. This Energy Conservation Day, remember: the cleanest energy is the energy we never waste.”Even the smallest habits like leaving a charger plugged in, a microwave display glowing, a router humming nonstopextract costs from both the environment and the household wallet.Many of these steps cost nothing but save 5–12% on bills.India’s energy efficiency performance varies significantly across states, according to the State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI) 2024 released by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in association with the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy. The index evaluates 36 states and union territories across seven sectors including buildings, industry, transport, agriculture, municipal services and DISCOMs using 66 indicators to assess how effectively regions are implementing energy‑saving measures. In the latest rankings, Maharashtra topped the list overall , followed closely by Andhra Pradesh , while Assam and Tripura led in their respective energy‑use groups based on total consumption. Five states Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu were classified as “front runners” for scoring above 60% on the index. States such as Assam and Kerala made it into the “achiever” category, showing solid implementation, while several others including Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh were placed in the “contender” group, highlighting room for stronger action. These varied performances reflect not just differing consumption patterns but also how state‑level policies and on‑ground execution shape energy efficiency outcomes.Just like we cut a cake to celebrate joy, perhaps we can celebrate Energy Conservation Day every day by cutting down energy wastage. Small, mindful acts — unplugging a charger, turning off a router at night, closing a fridge door promptly, can collectively move India towards a greener, more efficient future.Energy conservation isn’t just a national mission. It’s a household habit that can significantly contribute to India’s energy conservation goals for the years to come.The story of energy waste is invisible, but the solutions are tangible, low-cost, and achievable. All it takes is awareness, a shift in habits, and a little daily mindfulness.","Every month, millions of Indian households pay for electricity they never actually use.

‘Didn’t Go For Son’s Operation’: Kharge Lauds Rahul Gandhi In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally, Calls BJP ‘Gaddar’

NEW DELHI: As the Congress held a mega rally protesting the nationwide special intensive revision (SIR) and ""vote-chori"", party president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday said he skipped his son’s operation in Bengaluru to attend the rally at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He called it more important “to save 140 crore people.”""Didn't go for son's operation to Bengaluru, came here as I have to save 140 crore people,"" said Kharge while addressing the gathering.Kharge also launched a scathing attack on the BJP , accusing those involved in “vote chori” of being “gaddars” who need to be removed from power to protect the voting rights and the Constitution. “The BJP people are 'gaddars' (traitors) and 'dramebaaz' (indulge in theatrics). They need to be removed from power,” he said.Alleging that the ideology of the Manusmriti, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the BJP will “destroy the nation,” Kharge claimed that only Congress’s ideology can safeguard India’s Constitution. “Only Congress party's ideology can save the nation; ideology of (Mohan) Bhagwat, (Madhav Rao) Gowalkar Guruji, or the Manusmriti will not save the nation, but destroy it.The path the BJP, PM Modi is going, slowly and steadily, they are trying to finish the Constitution,” he said.Kharge praised Rahul Gandhi for leading the fight to “save the country” and urged citizens to strengthen Congress’s ideology. “Rahul Gandhi is fighting for the country, and to strengthen that fight is the responsibility of us all, that is what I want to request you all. If you do strengthen those ideas then it is your loss, the country's loss, not his loss. If you want to save the country, if you want to save your vote, protect it, if you want to save the Constitution, then you can work for yourself. The work of bringing forward our ideology, ideas, is being done by Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, today Priyanka is also doing,” he said.Kharge also accused the BJP of trying to “enslave people under the guise of Hinduism.” “Everyone is there under the Hindu religion, but under the guise of Hinduism, they want to enslave people. If you want to be a slave, if you give up your self-respect, then you will be finished. The freedom we got (from the Britishers) was given by Congress. Did Modi give it? Modi was not even born then. Amit Shah was just a kid then. These people talk against Nehru, Gandhi, and Ambedkar,” he said.He added, “They want to pretend that Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were fighting, and on the other hand, they do vote chori. These are traitors; you have to remove these traitors. If you want to protect your rights and become stronger, remove these traitors. On that issue too, Rahul Gandhi walked 800 kilometres.”The rally comes amid heightened political activity surrounding Congress’s campaign against alleged electoral irregularities, including “vote chori” and the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) issue. Party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, also addressed the gathering, with Priyanka accusing the BJP of avoiding real issues such as inflation and pollution, choosing instead to debate the origins of the song Vande Mataram.","Mallikarjun Kharge said he skipped his son's operation to attend the rally.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday held a mega rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital, intensifying its campaign over alleged “vote chori” and the special intensive revision of electoral rolls. The protest, held under the banner “Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod”, comes days after sharp exchanges between the government and the Opposition in Parliament over electoral integrity.Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""The leaders of the BJP only do drama...Some BJP leaders were questioning whether, after the Parliament session, Rahul Gandhi is going abroad. During the Parliament session, PM Modi never attends the session but goes abroad...They are all sitting in power after doing vote chori, we will have to remove these traitors from power...""Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the government of undermining democratic institutions and questioned the conduct of elections, as she addressed the party’s ‘Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor’ rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital.Addressing a large gathering of party workers and supporters, Priyanka Gandhi said elections in the country were no longer being conducted fairly and that suspicion now surrounded every stage of the process.“Elections not being conducted properly, there is suspicion at every step,” she said, alleging systematic erosion of democratic norms.Recalling the constitutional vision of India, she stressed the centrality of the right to vote. “Our voice should reach the PM’s residence. It’s very important to understand that your vote plays an important role. Nehru ji said that the people of India, every single son and daughter of India, are all a part of Mother India. This very thought shaped our constitution. This Constitution gave you the right to vote,” Priyanka Gandhi said.She also alleged that constitutional bodies were being pressured to function in line with the government’s interests. “All institutions in country being made to bend before govt,” she said, while addressing the rally against what the Congress has termed “vote theft”.Priyanka Gandhi further accused the Election Commission of ignoring alleged violations during polls and questioned the integrity of the electoral process. “EC shutting its eyes to Rs 10,000 being paid during election process; is this poll not 'vote chori'?” she asked, referring to alleged inducements during elections. She urged party workers not to be demoralised by electoral defeats, particularly in Bihar, claiming that outcomes were manipulated. “You should not lose heart over losing Bihar, entire country knows BJP wins through 'vote theft',” she said.""In the Parliament hardly there are one or two debates in a session.When Rahul ji raised the issue, Kharge ji raised the issue that we want to debate on the way votes are being stolen through the EVMs, they got scared. They didn't agree. Finally, how did they agree? They said we will even discuss Vande Mataram...I challenge them to fight a fair election. Let them fight on the ballot paper, and they themselves know that they will never win. Today, you don't need to be disappointed that you lost the Bihar election. Because the whole country is watching that they win through theft,"" Priyanka said.The rally also follows Rahul Gandhi’s recent remarks in Parliament, where he termed alleged vote theft as a serious threat to democracy, triggering a political confrontation with the ruling BJP.Addressing the party’s ‘Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor’ rally at Ramlila Maidan, Lok Sabha Leader of the Opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi launched a sharp attack on the BJP, the RSS and the Election Commission of India, alleging “vote chori” and institutional capture.""...Listen to RSS Chief Dr Mohan Bhagwat's statement, the world doesn't look at truth, it looks at power. Whoever has power is respected. This is Mohan Bhagwat's thinking. This ideology belongs to the RSS. Our ideology, the ideology of India, the ideology of Hinduism, the ideology of every religion in the world says that truth is the most important thing. Mohan Bhagwat says that truth is meaningless, power is important. ..I guarantee you from this stage, you will see, by upholding the truth, by standing behind the truth, we will remove Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the RSS government, from India""Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of manipulating elections and alleged collusion between the ruling party and the Election Commission.""They (BJP) do 'vote chori'. Rs 10 thousand were given during the elections...Election Commission of India is working in collusion with the BJP...PM Narendra Modi changed the law to ensure that no action can be taken against the Election Commissioner, no matter what he does""He further warned the Election Commission against acting in the interests of the ruling party.“EC should not forget they are country's EC not of Modi,” Rahul Gandhi said, adding that the Congress would act to restore accountability.Addressing party workers, he said the Congress would repeal legal changes made by the Modi government to shield election officials.“PM Modi brought a new law to give immunity to EC; we will change that and act against Election Commissioners.”Rahul Gandhi said the fight against the BJP and the RSS would be based on truth and non-violence.“It may take time, but truth will ultimately win; we'll work with truth, non-violence to defeat Modi, Shah,” he said.Several senior Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, K C Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh and Sachin Pilot, attended the rally. Former party president Sonia Gandhi was also likely to be present. Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy joined the event as well.“Our party has organised the 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod' rally at Ramlila Maidan. The Congress party has taken a step towards a decisive battle, and a large number of people will attend this rally,” Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel was quoted as saying by ANI.According to party sources, Congress units from multiple states mobilised supporters for the rally. A party spokesperson said 1,027 Congress leaders and activists set out from Jammu on Saturday, raising slogans of “vote chore, gaddi chhore” and “Delhi chalo” while travelling to the capital.Jharkhand Congress president Keshav Mahto Kamlesh said the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee made extensive preparations for the programme. Calling the rally historic, he said party leaders, workers and representatives from across Jharkhand had already reached Delhi in large numbers.Congress MP K C Venugopal on Saturday targeted the Election Commission of India, alleging institutional bias and warning of consequences for democracy.""We are lacking a neutral umpire in this country for conducting elections. This is actually very dangerous to democracy. That is why we are going completely for a campaign and movement. The five-crore signature has to be submitted to the President of India. We are seeking an appointment... In Parliament, we also discussed this vote chori issue. Our LoP has given straightforward suggestions. Not only criticising, but we are also providing clear suggestions. ..There are a lot of complaints about the machines, the EVMs. Lakhs of people will participate in that... This is an internal party program,"" Venugopal was quoted as saying by ANI.Venugopal claimed the Congress has collected over five crore signatures nationwide to flag alleged vote theft. He alleged the presence of bogus and duplicate votes, said Rahul Gandhi’s press conferences had exposed irregularities benefiting the BJP, and accused the Election Commission of ignoring Congress complaints while acting against the party.Addressing the rally, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of misleading Parliament and alleged that electoral mandates had been stolen in multiple states.""Answering in Parliament is one thing, but they (Home Minister Amit Shah) did not answer our questions; they gave answers from their own minds. They provided incorrect information in Parliament. We had asked how and in what way votes were stolen, and Rahul Gandhi spoke about this with evidence... We want to tell the people that the governments in power in Anand, Maharashtra and Haryana have come to power by stealing votes. .. The people sitting in power today have not been elected by the people...""Congress leader Sachin Pilot said concerns over institutional fairness were being raised across the country. He said ""Across the country today, this question has arisen that fairness and transparency are disappearing from institutions. The attitude adopted by the Election Commission is very unfortunate... The Election Commission should work with fairness and honesty, rising above leaders, ideologies, or parties, which they are not doing. .. The Election Commission is unable to answer... Unfortunately, when we ask questions to the Election Commission, the answers are given by BJP spokespersons.""""Today we are organising a mega rally in Delhi, where workers from across the country will gather and, becoming the voice of the people, will ask the question why the Election Commission is not working impartially?,"" Pilot added.Reacting to the rally, BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the Congress of using abusive language and promoting disorder.“In the rally held at Ramlila Maidan by the anti-Ram Congress, abusive language and insults were once again used against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Videos have surfaced showing their workers once again chanting slogans wishing for Modi's death. This shows that the Congress party is now becoming a platform for anarchy instead of a political party, operating under a Muslim League-Maoist agenda. You want to praise Rahul Gandhi? Go ahead. But the use of such abusive language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has been done before, is utterly reprehensible. Although there is no comparison.”The rally marks a fresh escalation in the political battle between the Congress and the BJP, with electoral processes and the role of constitutional institutions now at the centre of the confrontation.BJP MP Sambit Patra said, ""Today the Congress party is holding a rally against vote theft at Ramlila Maidan. It is being said that people are also coming from other states ruled by Congress. Surprisingly, even after the discussion in the House, the Congress party is holding this rally. This same Congress party had submitted an application in the House for a discussion on SIR. Everyone in the House expressed their thoughts, and the Union Home Minister also responded to them. .. A person who always wears a T-shirt gives a lecture on khadi that day... and from that, their true form is revealed, and they fabricated a story about SIR... They made up the entire story, and when the Home Minister gave point-by-point responses one by one... The Congress party heard about all the issues. When they won in Telangana, Himachal, Karnataka, there was no vote theft, but where the BJP won, there was vote theft... When the Home Minister mentioned infiltrators, that the Congress party is trying to protect the infiltrators, then they created a deadlock and walked out; this clearly shows that this rally against SIR that is happening is an effort by the Congress party to protect the infiltrators...""","Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the government of undermining democratic institutions and questioned the conduct of elections. She urged party workers not to be demoralised by electoral defeats, particularly in Bihar, claiming that outcomes were manipulated.

SHANTI likely to boost India’s nuclear power capacity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shanti-likely-to-boost-indias-nuclear-power-capacity/articleshow/125966404.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Union cabinet’s approval for Atomic Energy Bill, officially titled the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, which is set to be tabled in the winter session of Parliament, signals a huge policy shift in India’s atomic sector that is expected to accelerate civil nuclear energy production in the country.Proposed amendments to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 and later in liability laws aim to attract private and foreign investment and overcome obstacles in the 2008 Indo-US Nuclear Deal by easing supplier liability concerns (CLNDA), potentially unlocking stalled US projects like Kovvada. Till now, the key stumbling block to US investment in India has been CLNDA, which allows operators to seek recourse from suppliers, deterring US firms like Westinghouse. Legal amendments are expected to address these issues, potentially creating a framework for insurance or govt indemnification and making projects viable for US companies.The amendments are designed to finally implement the stalled Indo-US nuclear agreement, which has led to little progress beyond fuel imports due to liability issues, and enable US reactor construction in India. These nuclear reforms are linked to broader Indo-US trade talks, aimed at boosting bilateral trade and investment, with nuclear cooperation as one of its key pillars.The bill will open up the sector to private players (up to 49% equity) and foreign companies, breaking the long-standing govt monopoly in the sector. It will also consolidate existing laws into a single, comprehensive statute to enhance regulatory clarity and investor confidence and will help India fulfil its goal of creating 100 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. The SHANTI Bill will break the domination of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in core activities such as atomic mineral exploration, fuel fabrication, equipment manufacturing and, potentially, certain aspects of plant operations.The trigger for these drastic changes in the legal framework in the nuclear sector was the slow expansion of nuclear power capacity as the technology development phase had to go through an international embargo and technology denial regime, besides facing limited availability of resources. Though India operates the sixth largest nuclear reactor fleet in the world, the present installed capacity of nuclear power is just 8.78 GW (excluding RAPS-1, 100 MW). The share of nuclear power in total electricity generation in the country in 2024-25 was about 3.1%, the govt said in a statement.The indigenous pressurised heavy-water reactor (PHWR) technology has now matured for larger size reactors (700 MW). With the deployment of indigenous 700 MW reactors and 1,000 MW reactors with international cooperation, the present capacity will increase to 22.38 GW (excluding RAPS-1, 100 MW) by 2031-32 on completion of projects at various stages of implementation.The preferred small modular reactor (SMR) technology is the light water reactor-based pressurised water technology. Based on PWR technology, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), a constituent unit of DAE, has initiated design and development of 200 MWe Bharat Small Modular Reactor and 55 MWe Small Modular Reactor, for the repurposing of retiring fossil fuel-based power plants, captive plants for energy intensive industries -- such as steel, cement and process industries -- and off-grid applications for remote locations. BARC is also developing up to 5 MWth (Megawatt thermal) high temperature gas cooled reactor for hydrogen generation.","Proposed amendments to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 and later in liability laws aim to attract private and foreign investment.

‘Didn’t Go For Son’s Operation’: Kharge Lauds Rahul Gandhi In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally, Calls BJP ‘Gaddar’

NEW DELHI: Taking his months-long campaign of ""vote chori"" to its climax, Congress's Rahul Gandhi on Sunday led a packed Ramlila Maidan rally to raise the slogan of ""vote chor, gaddi chhod"", as he claimed that the Modi-led BJP is winning elections by stealing votes but ""Narendra Modi-RSS govt"" would ultimately be evicted from power.Rahul said ""vote chori"" is principally BJP's attack on Ambedkar's Constitution that has enshrined the right to vote. He said BJP's DNA has ""vote chori"" just as truth is Congress's DNA, and accused Election Commission of working at BJP's behest.Interacting with the party workers who had poured in from across the country for the rally, Rahul said PM Narendra Modi has lost his confidence which is reflected on his face, just like Amit Shah's hands were trembling in Lok Sabha when he challenged the home minister to a debate on his press conferences about ""rigged"" elections.""You look at Modi's face carefully. Have you seen it? It is so because he knows his 'vote chori' has been caught, and the country would know their reality in the coming time,"" he said, referring to a point made by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her speech.Planned as a mass gathering to mark the conclusion of the party's nationwide signature campaign on ""vote chori"", the dais featured the Congress brass of Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Sonia Gandhi, CMs Siddaramaiah, Sukhwinder Sukhu and Revanth Reddy, CWC members Ajay Maken, KC Venugopal, Sachin Pilot, Abhishek Singhvi, Gaurav Gogoi and P Chidambaram, among others.In framing the argument made by speakers who linked ""vote chori"" to BJP's desire for victory at all costs, Rahul started his speech by referring to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's reported statement in Andamans that ""world recognises power, not truth"". ""Hindu religion, and ideology of world religions, says that truth is most important, but Bhagwat says truth means nothing and power is important. That is the crux of the ongoing battle in India. It is a fight between 'satya and asatya',"" he said, mentioning ""Satyam Shivam Sundaram"" and ""Satyamev Jayate"".Rahul, as also Priyanka, kept the poll panel in their crosshairs, even leading the crowd in repeating the names of CEC Gyanesh Kumar and ECs SS Sandhu and Vivek Joshi. ""Remember the names,"" they said to the crowd in their separate speeches. Rahul said Congress govt will retrospectively remove the immunity provided to the ECs by the law brought by Modi in 2023, and would act against them, repeating the chilling warning he made during the debate in LS. ""You are India's EC, not Modi's EC,"" he said.","Rahul Gandhi led a packed Ramlila Maidan rally to raise the slogan of ""vote chor, gaddi chhod"" He claimed that the Modi-led BJP is winning elections by stealing votes but ""Narendra Modi-RSS govt"" would ultimately be evicted from power.

NEW DELHI: In the middle of Laxmi Nagar market is a single room, easy to miss in the chaos, that holds a few chairs. Seated are young men and women from Delhi, UP and Haryana, busy polishing 'Ikura desu ka' and 'tetsudatte kuremasu ka', Japanese phrases that translate, respectively, to 'how much is this' and 'can you help me'.Some labour on the 'u', only to be reminded by the teacher not to dwell on it. ""Not ikoora. Suppress u, stress ra.""It's not an easy lesson for this group of native Hindi speakers but motivation is strong, so they keep at it. Getting spoken Japanese right will earn them a ticket to a job that will pay more than anything they are likely to get here.With curbs on immigration rising in the West, Indians have in Japan been presented with a destination in the east that has a high demand for young workers, especially in caregiving and blue-collar occupations like plumbers and electricians. In Aug this year, the Indian and Japanese governments signed a pact for potential exchange of 5 lakh personnel in five years, including 50,000 skilled workers.And with jobs beckoning, Japanese language teaching has taken off in NCR, not just in physical classrooms like the one in Laxmi Nagar but in online listings of tutors saying 'Konichiwa' to not just Japan job seekers but also those preparing for JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) and anime fans as they promise proficiency tailored to the learner's need.According to data with Japan Foundation on language education abroad, the number of Japanese learners in India went from 5,446 in 2003 to 52,946 in 2024. The total number of teachers - at primary, secondary and higher education levels - has risen from 256 to 5,446 in the corresponding period.Owing to its ageing population, Japan needs caregivers at hospitals and for eldercare. Salaries in these jobs, converted to INR, begin at about Rs 80,000 a month. A nursing qualification is not mandatory; basic proficiency in the language - which is the N4 level - is enough.Sudha Rotili has already secured a job and will be flying to Hokkaido soon. While pursuing a master's in maths from a Delhi University college, she felt her degrees might not be enough to get a good job abroad and enrolled in a Japanese course earlier this year. ""My friend, who is a nurse, learnt it last year and now works in Japan as a caregiver. I thought this was something I could do. It would also give me a headstart abroad,"" Sudha says, adding she will make a saving that will also let her remit money back home.Japanese has three scripts - Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. Though it has almost no similarity to languages widely spoken in India, some teachers say it comes easier to native Hindi speakers because the grammar is similar. ""They do not have to first think of translating to English and then Japanese, they can do a Hindi to Japanese translation in their minds,"" says a teacher.Anushka, a 21-year-old nursing graduate learning Japanese at a centre in Okhla, doesn't know if that worked to her advantage, but is confident about holding a basic conversation in Japanese. ""Watashi wo namae wa Anushka. Hajimemashite (My name is Anushka. Nice to meet you),"" is how she introduces herself to make her point.Anushka says her lack of fluency in English made her apprehensive about attempting to take on Japanese. But once she dived in, she began enjoying herself, downloading an app to practise and watching Japanese TV shows.Jaspreet Kaur, a first-year political science student, says she is ready to take up any job in Japan for the exposure. She enrolled at the Okhla centre this year and will start applying for jobs soon.Divesh Birla, who has been teaching Japanese since 2007, says he gets two kinds of students - schoolkids who want to pick up a language early, and of late, adults who are learning for the purpose of employment. Birla, who teaches at Govt Polytechnic College in Haryana, says many students are coming from lower-income backgrounds. ""They feel like a job in Japan will be their family's ticket to a good life,"" he says. Ambica Gupta, who runs Masaru Institute for Japanese language in Faridabad, says though she has been teaching for the last 12 years, it's only in the last four that she has seen a boom in interest. ""I used to have just two-three students per class, but from 2021, every batch has 10-15 students. I don't want to make the classes bigger, but there are more people expressing interest. Every batch is full,"" she says.Shrishti Arora, who started NEC Institute in Lajpat Nagar seven years ago, adds: ""I've noticed that people who come to us are not just interested in learning the language, they are serious about the opportunities it can get them. They inquire about jobs and higher studies.""(Additional reporting by Ayantika Pal)","With curbs on immigration rising in the West, Indians have in Japan been presented with a destination in the east that has a high demand for young workers.

Bihar Minister Nitin Nabin Appointed National Working President Of BJP

New Delhi: As far as dark horses go, Nitin Nabin 's elevation in the BJP organisation was as big a surprise as they come. The BJP parliamentary board on Sunday named the 45-year-old minister in the Bihar govt its working president, putting him on track to become the youngest to helm the party, though with considerable experience as a five-term MLA.His appointment is being seen as a precursor to his eventual election as the party's national president in place of JP Nadda once the polling process is unveiled. The generous praise heaped on him by its brass, led by PM Narendra Modi, made it all but certain.Nabin's rise bears an unmistakable imprint of Modi, who is known for his out-of-box approach on weighty issues of governance and politics, and Amit Shah , and marks another generational change at the apex of BJP's organisation, which underwent its first round of transformation after Modi's elevation as the party's mascot in 2013, with Shah in 2014 and Nadda in 2020 being entrusted with the organisational leadership.Modi praised him on X, saying, ""Nitin Nabin has made his distinct identity as a dedicated worker. He is a young and hardworking leader who has a considerable organisational experience. His work as an MLA and minister in Bihar has been very effective, and he has worked with complete dedication to fulfil people's aspirations. He is known for his humble nature and grassroots work.""","Bihar Minister Nitin Nabin appointed National Working President of BJP.

New Delhi: Delhiites could see poison in the air on Sunday. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to ‘severe-plus’ category for the first time this year.The city’s 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec — 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.","The city’s 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months.

NEW DELHI: In every organisation, be it government or private, increment in an employee’s salary is an annual affair. Not in Supreme Court, where CJIs, on the eve of retirement and irrespective of length of tenure, used discretionary powers to sanction multiple increments to a select few employees.Those who had been Chief Justice of India for a short tenure, too, granted two or three increments in addition to the annual one in salaries to employees — mainly the chief justice’s personal staff or those who had performed exceptionally well and displayed organisational skills.While all 2,000-odd employees received at least two to three additional increments in their pay scale in the last four years, there were some lucky ones in CJIs’ good books who earned as many as six additional increments to get 150% of what should have been their salaries in the normal course.To correct the anomaly in pay scales and salaries of employees caused by discretionary sanctioning of increments, former CJI B R Gavai had called a full court meeting of all judges to discuss the issue. Most judges felt neither was SC a kingdom nor CJI a king to distribute increment largesse to a select few.After a detailed deliberation, the full court decided to stop this practice and withdraw discretionary increments given to employees in the last few years.It was also decided that discretionary allotment of increments would henceforth be decided in the full court, sources told TOI.Those who had got additional increments, apart from annual increments given every year, suddenly discovered their salaries had been reduced considerably. It came as a shock to those who had planned their budgets based on the increased salary — like taking house or vehicle loans that had to be repaid through EMIs.Some of those who had put in additional work and performed exceptionally well to get the increments said their monthly salaries were reduced considerably, in some cases up to Rs 40,000, and vented their ire against one or two registrars who, according to them, briefed the then CJI incorrectly on the issue.TOI spoke to a cross-section of employees, the majority of whom said that it would have been better had SC adjusted the additional increments against future annual increments. That would have kept their salaries intact and enabled them to maintain household budgets and investments in houses or vehicles.","Some lucky ones in CJIs’ good books earned as many as six additional increments to get 150% of what should have been their salaries in the normal course.

Reflecting the state's culture and democratic values, the building, he said, would stand as a symbol of both heritage and progress.Using an analogy from Jashpur's archery tradition and the Mahabharata, Sai said Chhattisgarh now has a single-minded focus. ""Like Arjuna's eye on the bird, our target is a developed Chhattisgarh,"" he said, adding that the state has a clear and achievable plan to reach that goal.Work on the vision document began soon after the government took office, Sai said.It was prepared through wide public participation, involving farmers, youth, women, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders. Describing it as carrying the ""fragrance of the soil,"" he said the plan reflects the spirit of Antyodaya — development for the last person in the queue.The document identifies 13 priority sectors and 10 key missions, with good governance at the core. According to the CM, over 400 governance reforms implemented in the past two years have already made administration more transparent and citizen-friendly.Taking a political swipe at the previous Congress regime, the Chief Minister alleged that while his government has a vision for development till 2047, the Congress's five-year rule was marked by ""systematic loot"" through an organised syndicate. He claimed central agencies have placed concrete evidence of financial irregularities before courts and said the public has understood the ""true character"" of the opposition.Sai highlighted major gains in road, rail and air connectivity, expansion of premier institutions like IIT, IIM and NIT, and growth in medical education, with medical colleges increasing from 10 to 15, in addition to AIIMS.A new industrial policy and a single-window clearance system have helped attract investment proposals worth over Rs 7.5 lakh crore, he said.On energy, Sai said Chhattisgarh ranks second nationally in power generation and aims to top the list by 2030, with a strong push towards renewable energy, including large-scale solar projects and rooftop solar with double subsidies. He also underlined opportunities in agriculture, forest-based economy, mineral resources and tourism. Concluding, Sai expressed confidence that the goals outlined in the Anjor Vision 2047 would be realised from the new Assembly building and called upon all members to work together to translate the vision of a developed Chhattisgarh into reality.Congress boycottsAssemblyCongress boycotted the Assembly on the first day of the winter session, held on Dec 14, in protest against the government's decision to dedicate the entire sitting exclusively to a discussion on ""Vision 2047.""

Leader of Opposition Charandas Mahant described the presentation as misleading, arguing that it focused heavily on long-term plans and promises while ignoring pressing day-to-day issues faced by the people, such as unemployment, delays in paddy procurement, crimes against women, potholes, lack of tap water, and electricity billing problems.He accused the government of using the session to project a futuristic agenda without addressing current grievances, and termed the vision document ""heavy on claims but weak on substance.""Mahant said the Congress's boycott was a way to protest the sidelining of ordinary legislative business and highlight the government's neglect of immediate public concerns.","Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai unveils ""Anjor Vision 2047"" in the Assembly.

However, in its assessment of the recommendations, DoT asked Trai to have a re-look, saying that spectrum charges for BSNL may continue to be levied at 1% of AGR as it is “mainly providing services for strategic purposes. ”Trai has now refused to accept this suggestion and has rather said that it will be discriminatory for other new entrants to the satellite sector who may also provide services similar to what BSNL is providing today.“… the Authority does not agree with the DoT’s view that for Global Satellite Phone Service or GSPS license of BSNL, spectrum charges may continue to be levied at 1% of AGR,” the regulator said, a view that is not being seen favourably by top officials at DoT.Trai said it will be “unfair and unreasonable” to seek 1% AGR charge for BSNL just on the premise that it is providing services for strategic purposes. “DoT’s proposal provides for lesser spectrum charges to a specific service provider i.e. BSNL, a PSU which would be discriminatory in the scenario of multiple service providers for MSS (Mobile Satellite Service).”It also raised objections to the grounds of “strategic purposes” being ascribed just to BSNL. It said that other telecom service providers may also provide services for strategic use, besides commercial use. “However, presently there is no scheme for differential charging of lesser spectrum charges across services and across service providers for providing services for strategic purposes. On this count also such a preferential treatment would be discriminatory. ”Trai said that the 1% spectrum charge for BSNL’s satellite services had been recommended in December 2018 under ‘sui-generis’ category as there was only one single operator then. “Global Satellite Phone Service was majorly being used by the govt agencies and that was the only way to avail telecom connectivity in far-flung areas and water bodies. At that time, this service was not considered as a premium service but was akin to emergency services. ”However, in May 2022, DoT had given orders to expand the scope of the ‘sui-generis’ license granted to BSNL for satellite-based services to provide satellite-based data connectivity to IoT devices/ aggregator devices.Trai says that the industry’s dynamics have changed since. “… significant developments have taken place in the Indian telecom landscape, evolving satellite service technologies and changing market dynamics.”It said that in its reference on satellite communication of July 2024, DoT had itself asked Trai to account for “level playing field” with terrestrial access services for GSO/ NGSO-based Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) providing voice, text, data, and internet services (besides NGSO based Fixed Satellite Services).",The standoff between the department of telecom (DoT) and regulator Trai regarding recommendations for satellite spectrum is intensifying.

NEW DELHI: President Draupadi Murmu on Sunday emphasised the need to use electricity wisely and efficiently and said it not only leads to energy conservation but also reduces carbon emissions Speaking at the National Energy Conservation Awards 2025 at the capital’s Vigyan Bhawan, the President said that energy conservation was not just an option but was crucial for a balanced ecosystem. She said that every unit of energy saved was a symbol of responsibility towards nature, and behavioural change was crucial for bringing energy efficiency to all sectors.“Saving energy doesn't simply mean using less, but rather utilising energy wisely, responsibly, and efficiently. When we avoid unnecessary use of electrical appliances, adopt energy-efficient devices, utilise natural light and ventilation in our homes and workplaces, or embrace solar and renewable energy options, we not only save energy but also reduce carbon emissions,” President Murmu said.

'Going to do Vipassana is not called running away': Arvind Kejriwal replies to Delhi CM's jibe at AAP over pollution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/going-to-do-vipassana-is-not-called-running-away-arvind-kejriwal-replies-to-delhi-cms-jibe-at-aap-over-pollution/articleshow/125962392.cms,"'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday criticised Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, saying that it is not appropriate to mock anyone taking a ""Vipassana,"" despite both of them having political differences over the handling of the pollution crisis in the national capital region.""You (Rekha Gupta) harbor political enmity towards me. Due to this, it does not behove you to mock the divine Vipassana meditation method taught by Lord Buddha in this manner. You too should certainly try Vipassana once. You will like it a lot, and you will experience boundless peace. Going to do Vipassana is not called ""running away."" Only those with great fortune are blessed with Vipassana,"" Kejriwal wrote on X, replying to an earlier post by CM Gupta.The AAP leader's comments come a day after CM Gupta alleged that while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are trying to fight pollution by staying in Delhi, Kejriwal simply abandons Delhi by taking a Vipassana every six months.""We are finding solutions to the pollution problem in Delhi by living in Delhi itself. We are not like them who abandon Delhi to its fate and run off for Vipassana every 6 months. My Delhi, My Responsibility-we are working with this sentiment.The problem is here too, and the solution will also emerge from here...for Delhi, by staying in Delhi,"" the Delhi CM said.Meanwhile, AAP's Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj also hit out at the Delhi government for the illnesses people are getting due to increased pollution.He criticised CM Rekha Gupta over the worsening air quality in the national capital, stating that she is unaware of the air quality index (AQI) and its parameters, adding that she must leave the pollution problem for the experts to deal with.Speaking to ANI, Bharadwaj said, ""This government has been in power for almost a year. Nowhere in this country are there incidents of stubble burning. The condition of pollution is that even inside a closed room, we can see smog. The CM of Delhi doesn't know what AQI is? She says any instrument can measure AQI. She can't even properly pronounce AQI. What will the people of Delhi expect from the chief minister for the next 4 years?""""I think experts should come in front and the Chief Minister should take a step back,"" he added.Residents of Delhi on Sunday expressed deep concern over deteriorating air quality as the city's AQI surged to 497, remaining in the 'severe' category, according to the central pollution control board (CPCB).In response to the severe pollution, the Delhi Government's Directorate of Education on Saturday directed that schools conduct classes for grades IX and XI in hybrid mode. This decision followed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoking Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) as AQI levels approached the 'severe' mark.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday criticised Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday attacked the BJP and the Election Commission , alleging “vote chori” and irregularities in the electoral process, asserting that democratic institutions were being “crushed” and daring the ruling party to contest elections on ballot paper.Addressing the Congress’s ‘Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor’ rally at Ramlila Maidan, Priyanka said, “When we see every institution being crushed, all Indians should rise against it,” and alleged that “all institutions in the country” were being made to “bend before the government”.Targeting the poll process, she claimed there was suspicion at every stage.“Elections not being conducted properly, there is suspicion at every step,” she said, questioning the Election Commission’s role. “EC shutting its eyes to Rs 10,000 being paid during the election process; is this not ‘vote chori’?” she asked.Priyanka also challenged the BJP to fight elections without electronic voting machines. “I challenge BJP to contest polls on ballot paper, they know they will never win,” she said, adding, “I challenge them to fight a fair election. Let them fight on the ballot paper, and they themselves know that they will never win.”Referring to the recent electoral outcome in Bihar, she told party workers, “You should not lose heart over losing Bihar, the entire country knows BJP wins through ‘vote theft’.”Speaking about Parliament sessions, Priyanka said the Opposition’s demand for a debate on electoral issues was resisted and a discussion was agreed only when we agreed to a debate on Vande Mataram, while ignoring all the other pressing issues which affect you.“In the Parliament hardly there are one or two debates in a session. When Rahul ji raised the issue, Kharge ji raised the issue that we want to debate on the way votes are being stolen through the EVMs, they got scared. They didn't agree,” she said.Emphasising the importance of voting rights, she said, “Our voice should reach the PM’s residence. It’s very important to understand that your vote plays an important role,” and recalled Jawaharlal Nehru’s vision of universal participation that shaped the Constitution and the right to vote.“Nehru ji said that the people of India, every single son and daughter of India, are all a part of Mother India. This very thought shaped our constitution. This Constitution gave you the right to vote,” she added.The rally comes days after sharp exchanges between the government and the Opposition in Parliament over electoral integrity and the special intensive revision of electoral rolls.","Priyanka Gandhi Vadra challenged the BJP to fight elections without electronic voting machines. “I challenge them to fight a fair election.

I am 25 years old. Last year, I went to Bengaluru for my studies, where I didn’t have many people to talk to or hang out with. I am an extrovert, but after going there, I felt quite lonely. The course too was very tough. There were 14 students, and all of them were Hindi-speaking. I was the only Tamil. Apart from that, the girls in my class also used to talk behind my back very badly. I tried to be friends with them but they saw me as an alien. This led to the development of

self-esteem issues

in me. Now, this stress is making me depressed and I often shout at people in my house and also become very aggressive. I don’t have a job and I am also worried about unemployment. I am trying to fix my sleep schedule, but not being able to. Please help.

When people talk to me, I am often unable to express myself. I like to be alone but sometimes I feel very lonely as nobody is there to talk to freely and with whom I share my problems. I don’t understand whom to trust. Please help.

I am a 50-year-old IT professional struggling with restlessness, overthinking, and anxiety. I often find myself disconnected from the present, lost in my thoughts or worried about incidents that did not meet my expectations.For example, I often dwell on arguments with co-workers or my boss. When I don’t meet a goal, I overthink about how I will handle challenging future assignments. These feelings intensify during periods of work-related stress or conflict. At home, my restless mind causes me to speak loudly, which frustrates my family. I also tend to engage in a lot of self-talk, replaying scenarios in my mind and imagining how I could have acted differently or better or given a better response when people have pinned me down. How can I manage these challenges in a better manner?It’s understandable to feel restless and consumed by thoughts, especially when work stress and expectations weigh heavily. Your mind is trying to protect you by replaying past situations and preparing for future challenges, but this overactivity is leaving you drained and disconnected. Acknowledging this struggle is the first step towards managing it. Try grounding yourself in the present to break the cycle of overthinking. A simple technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 method: notice five things you see, four you feel, three sounds, two scents, and one taste. This pulls you back from mental loops. When self-talk becomes overwhelming, schedule “worry time” — set aside 10 to 15 minutes daily to reflect, then redirect your focus. At home, practice pausing before responding, consciously lowering your voice. This can create a calmer atmosphere for both you and your family. If these thoughts feel too consuming, professional guidance can provide tailored strategies. Small and mindful adjustments can create a lasting difference.Feeling isolated, unaccepted, and struggling with self-worth is painful, especially when you’re naturally social. It makes sense that this experience left a lasting impact. Being in a space where you feel excluded and judged can shake anyone’s confidence. Now, with job uncertainty and disrupted sleep, it’s understandable that frustration is spilling over at home. Start by regaining control where you can. Structure your day — wake up at a set time, engage in small productive tasks, and set short-term job-search goals. Even sending one application or improving your resume daily is progress. For self-esteem, focus on people who uplift you. Reconnect with those who make you feel seen. Remind yourself that rejection from a few doesn’t define your worth. When anger rises, pause and breathe before responding. If sleep is an issue, reduce screen time before bed and try winding down with music or a book. If these feelings persist, talking to someone (professionally or personally) can help. You’re not alone in this, and things can improve with small steps.It sounds like you’re carrying a lot inside, and that can feel heavy. Wanting to express yourself but struggling to do so can be frustrating, and loneliness only makes it harder. It’s okay to feel this way, you’re not alone. Many people experience this and it doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. Start by giving yourself space to process. Writing down your thoughts or expressing them through art or music can be a gentle first step. If conversations feel difficult, try sharing small thoughts with someone you trust. Trust is built over time, not overnight. Loneliness doesn’t always mean a lack of people but rather a lack of connection. Seek small and meaningful interactions in safe spaces. Maybe a hobby, an online community or even a support group can help. You don’t have to do this alone. If it feels overwhelming, talking to a mental health care professional can help you navigate these emotions in a supportive and non-judgemental way. Remember that you deserve to be heard. Start small, and over a period of time, connections will follow.","To help readers cope with their anxieties in these stressful times, TOI has launched Talk it Out, a series in which expert counsellors answer your mental health queries.

Army gearing up to induct more heavy-duty drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-gearing-up-to-induct-more-heavy-duty-drones/articleshow/117847274.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army is chalking out a long-term roadmap to expand its fleet of heavy-duty drones for ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) as well as precision-strike missions, with their sheer operational utility being reinforced by the Russia-Ukraine and Armenia-Azerbaijan conflicts amid the ongoing shift towards unmanned and autonomous technologies in modern warfare.The force is basically looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions, fly at altitudes over 30,000-feet to evade detection, and have an endurance of over 24 hours at a stretch, top sources told TOI on Thursday.As per estimates, China has well over 2,000 top-notch UAVs, which includes combat drones like the Cai Hong-4, CH-5, CH-7, Wing Loong-II and the stealthy Hongdu GJ-11 `Sharp Sword’.China is also the world’s largest exporter of military UAVs , and has stepped up supply of the armed CH-4 and Wing Loong-II drones to Pakistan, which in turn has around 150-200 drones, including the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and Akinci drones.The Indian Army, in contrast, has only around 50 Israeli-origin Heron Mark-I and Mark-II as well as Searcher-II medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drones. Amid the military standoff with China, the force inducted four new satcom-enabled Heron Mark-II drones to boost surveillance along the Line of Actual Control.While the Army Aviation Corps operates these fighter-size UAVs for surveillance and precision-targeting, infantry battalions use a wide array of smaller drones for tactical reconnaissance, logistics and other tasks.While IAF and Navy have their own UAV fleets, there is an overall requirement of at least 150 new MALE drones for the three Services. Towards this end, the Army is focusing on indigenous development of MALE drones by DRDO as well as private sector companies, including through collaboration with friendly countries.DRDO has developed the Rustom series of UAVs, including the Tapas-BH-201 drone but it failed to fully meet operational military requirements, as was first reported by TOI. “Efforts are now underway to enhance the capabilities of Tapas,” a source said.The first flight of Archer-NG, a weaponised MALE drone developed by DRDO, in turn, is expected soon. With a maximum altitude of 30,000-feet, the UAV can carry 300 kg of payload, including anti-tank guided missiles and smart anti-airfield weapons. “With a 1,000-km range, Archer-NG is designed for ISR missions, target acquisition and precision-strikes,” he added.In the arena of the much more capable high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) drones, the armed forces of course will get 31 armed MQ-9B `Predators’ under the Rs 32,350 crore contract inked with the US last Oct. The delivery of these drones, armed with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs and other weapons, will begin in 2029.“The Army also needs advanced MALE drones because of the two long `active’ borders with China and Pakistan, both of which require continuous real-time intelligence-gathering and monitoring,” another source said.“UAVs and RPA systems reduce risk to soldiers, allow longer operational endurance and provide precision-strike capabilities. They also enhance counter-terrorism operations by tracking cross-border infiltrations and carrying out strikes on terrorist hideouts,” he added.","The force is looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions.

In contrast, the Rabindra Bharati University (BT Road) monitoring station, which previously boasted the best air quality in the city, recorded a deterioration to ‘moderate' (AQI: 101-200), along with Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH), which was found to be the worst polluted zone in the city, said a PCB official.Hourly AQI readings reflected these trends. At 5 am, Ballygunge had an AQI of 84, which improved slightly to 81 by 11 am and remained steady through the afternoon before rising marginally to 83 by 7 pm.Salt Lake recorded an AQI of 76 at 5 am, improving to 68 by 11 am and maintaining that level throughout the day. Fort William's AQI remained consistently below 100, while Jadavpur showed a slight improvement from 90 at 5 am to 88 at 1 pm before stabilising.RBU (BT Road) showed a moderate AQI trend, starting at 102 and gradually worsening to 104 by 7 pm. Rabindra Sarobar displayed steady improvement, moving from 79 at 5 am to 72 by 7 pm.However, Victoria Memorial Hall stood out as the worst-affected area, with pollution levels worsening from 156 at 5 am to 164 by 7 pm, maintaining a ‘moderate' status throughout the day.While most of Kolkata saw an encouraging trend, the worsening pollution at Victoria Memorial and RBU is largely driven by automobile emissions and construction and demolition activities, respectively, said sources.","Kolkata saw an extraordinary recovery in air quality on the last day of Jan.

NEW DELHI: Eight Aam Aadmi Party MLAs on Saturday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party , a day after resigning from AAP, dealing a fresh blow to the party as it gears up for the February 5 elections.The resignations came after the legislators were denied tickets to contest the upcoming elections.In their resignation letters, they accused AAP of straying from its founding ideals of transparency and corruption-free governance.They alleged the party had become centralised, opaque, and lacking internal democracy .Among those who resigned were Naresh Yadav (Mehrauli), Rohit Kumar (Trilokpuri), Madan Lal (Kasturba Nagar), Rajesh Rishi (Janakpuri), Bhavna Gaud (Palam), Bhupinder Singh Joon (Bijwasan), Pawan Kumar Sharma (Adarsh Nagar), and Girish Soni (Madipur).Madan Lal and Bhavna Gaud stated they had ""lost faith"" in AAP and its leader Arvind Kejriwal . Rohit Kumar, who represented the Dalit-dominated Trilokpuri constituency, accused AAP of exploiting the Dalit/Valmiki community for votes while failing to deliver on promises, such as ending contractual employment and regularising temporary workers.Naresh Yadav, once a strong supporter of AAP’s rise to power, expressed disappointment over the suppression of internal voices, while Rajesh Rishi accused the party of abandoning its commitment to transparency and accountability.Pawan Kumar Sharma, resigning from Adarsh Nagar, said, ""The party has deviated from the honest ideology on which it was formed. I am deeply saddened by AAP’s current state.""Bhupinder Singh Joon also cited a ""significant deviation"" from AAP’s original values, stating that the party, once envisioned as a people-centric movement against corruption, had become increasingly autocratic.The high-profile exits come at a crucial time for AAP, which is locked in a fierce electoral battle with the BJP. The Delhi Assembly elections will be held on February 5, with votes set to be counted on February 8.","The resignations came after the legislators were denied tickets to contest the upcoming elections.

Many in govt feel affection of middle class and poor should be reciprocated

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Friday sought ""special blessings"" of Goddess Lakshmi for the middle class and poor, fuelling expectations that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman may give relief to taxpayers and announce more welfare measures for the needy.""Today, at the beginning of the Budget session, I bow to Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. And on such occasions, for centuries, we have been remembering (her) virtues.Ma Lakshmi gives us success and wisdom, prosperity and well-being. I pray to (her) that every poor and middle-class community of the country should be blessed..."" Modi said.The hope of Sitharaman announcing such special measures was raised afterwards by President Droupadi Murmu in her address to a joint sitting of Parliament. ""The economic progress of a nation like India is defined by the aspirations of the middle class and fulfilment of those aspirations,"" she said.The bigger the dreams of the middle class, the higher the nation soars. It is my govt that has, for the first time, openly acknowledged and appreciated contributions of the middle class on every occasion,"" President Droupadi Murmu said as she listed welfare measures taken by Modi govt since 2014. The President's address is seen as a declaration of govt's intent.The middle class and a chunk of the poor have largely stood by Modi. Although his govt, as Murmu stressed, has reduced the tax burden and has also widened and deepened the welfare net, there seems to be a feeling in govt that the affection of the two constituencies needed to be reciprocated. This ties in with the opinion of many economists that relief to the middle and new-middle classes will help govt's effort to accelerate growth by boosting consumption.Murmu flagged the recent decision to constitute 8th Pay Commission for central govt employees.""Govt employees are significant representatives of the middle class. So, this decision will lay the foundation for substantial salary increases for govt employees in the coming years,"" she said.""Centre has decided to provide 50% assured pension to lakhs of employees under Unified Pension Scheme, which is widely welcomed. My govt is committed to fulfilling the middle class's dream of owning a home. Laws like RERA have been introduced to safeguard their dreams. Subsidies on home loans are being provided,"" she added.

Pannun used Sikhs for Justice role as cover to inflict war on India: Tribunal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-used-sfj-role-as-cover-to-inflict-war-on-india-tribunal/articleshow/117790552.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), banned as an “unlawful association” under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act , is a frontal organisation of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , who as the outfit’s legal adviser is using his “juristic identity” as a cover to perpetrate war upon India in league with other agencies and state-and non-state actors of foreign countries, a tribunal led by Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta ruled while upholding the ban on the pro-Khalistani outfit earlier this month.The background note submitted by the government to the tribunal, detailing the activities of SFJ, states that the all activities of the outfit are usually carried out from offices of Pannun, an attempt on whose life in the US, allegedly involving a former Indian government officer, had become an irritant in Indo-US tied until they agreed to cooperate on the case, with a panel set up by India recently recommending “legal action” against the “individual”.The government of India’s background note on SFJ and Pannun, submitted before the tribunal, records that the outfit has repeatedly threatened India’s political leaders, government officers including the police, diplomats, judiciary and even their family members and families abroad. These include Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, chief minister and minister of Punjab, national security adviser, and RAW chief. The note reveals that SFJ organises protests and filing of baseless cases against visiting Indian dignitaries abroad, particularly in Europe, Canada and US, to defame them and to fan anti-India sentiments among the Sikh diaspora.Stating that SFJ has been organising anti-India protests outside Indian embassies or consulates, where its activists have raised Khalistan flags and even dishonoured the Indian flag and indulged in violence and vandalisation of the premises, the documents filed with the tribunal reveal that many of the protests had the active support of Pakistani missions and were in tandem with multiple ISI-backed Pakistani diaspora outfits and Kashmiri diaspora. They also said Hindu temples in Canada and Australia were defaced with Khalistani graffiti and ISIS exhorted by SFJ after the deadly ISIS attack on Gurdwara Kart-e-Parwan in Kabul, Afghanistan, to target the Indian embassies rather than gurdwaras.The note directly names Pannun for having instigated the Indian farmers protesting against the three farm bills to arm themselves and fight against the Indian forces with weapons that would reach them from across the border (Pakistan). It said he has conspired with other Khalistani leaders like UK-based Babbar Khalsa International leader Paramjit Singh Pamma as well as Canada based terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in 2023, to revive terrorism in Punjab.SFJ, according to the government’s submission, has been inciting Sikh personnel to desert the Army and police forces.

NEW DELHI: The opposition on Saturday criticised the Union Budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and claimed that the government missed the opportunity to cut slacks for several groups.Congress MP and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi accused the government of putting a ""band-aid for bullet wounds"" and claimed that the Centre is bankrupt of ideas.Taking to X, Rahul said, "" A band-aid for bullet wounds! Amid global uncertainty, solving our economic crisis demanded a paradigm shift.""""But this government is bankrupt of ideas,"" he added.Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal attacked the government for not waiving off home loans and vehicle loans of the middle class and farmers.Taking to X, Kejriwal said, ""A large part of the country's treasury is spent on waiving off the loans of a few rich billionaires. I had demanded that it be announced in the budget that from now on, the loans of any billionaire will not be waived off.""""With the money saved from this middle class home loans and vehicle loans should be waived off; farmers' loans should be waived off and Income tax and GST tax rates should be halved.

As you know that there are elections in Bihar this year, so keeping that in mind, the budget has been presented for Bihar.

For us, the data of people who died in the stampede in Maha Kumbh is more important than the budget data. The government is not able to tell how many people died, went missing or got injured.

Last year, the Centre had announced development projects worth Rs 58,900 crore, including road projects, a 2,400MW power plant, and flood management initiatives.The finance minister also unveiled plans to establish daycare cancer centres in district hospitals, add 10,000 seats in medical colleges, and provide broadband connectivity to government secondary schools and primary healthcare centres.","Congress MP and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi accused the government of putting a ""band-aid for bullet wounds"" and claimed that the Centre is bankrupt of ideas.

The siblings, identified as C Ravali , 25, and C Yashwitha , 22, told the police that their mother, C Lalitha, 45, died on January 23.Seeing her dead, they slipped into depression, collapsed, and fell unconscious.During these ten days, they gained consciousness a couple of times but could not come out of the home or inform anyone about their mother’s death as they were weak physically and mentally, the girls told the cops on Friday. They survived only on water, the women told the cops.Police shifted the body for PME and started an investigation. “At this moment, there does not seem to be any foul play behind the death, but the exact cause of death would be known from the PME report,” said R Saidulu, Station House Officer, Warasiguda.

Increased Public Awareness and Education Improved Surveillance and Detection

MUMBAI: As 18 of 140 patients with the debilitating neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), are on ventilator support in Pune, there is some cold comfort in knowing this isn't the worst outbreak in the world - yet. It could, however, be considered one of the largest GBS outbreaks as medical literature classified 30 to 50 cases as an outbreak until 2019 when Peru registered the worst flare-up.The South American country had 1,120 cases in 2019, with 683 cases reported in two months.Its annual caseload stood at 59 in 2017 and rose to 262 in 2018 before peaking in 2019. Cases were recorded from across the country, but there is little data on deaths. The story didn't end there; Peru witnessed an outbreak again in 2023, when 130 suspected cases were reported between June 10 and July 15.The problem with GBS, as a professor of medicine in a medical college in Mumbai said, is that it is an autoimmune condition that technically doesn't seem like an epidemic-causing condition. ""GBS has been seen as an independent disorder that is sporadically seen across the country, but we now need to change our mindset and accept it can emerge as an outbreak and study it epidemiologically to look for links between the patients,"" he said.The only link between Peru and Pune is microbe Campylobacter jejuni . Smaller studies from across the world show GBS following this infection is linked with higher disability and mortality rates.GBS has been so rare - India has a reported annual incidence of 1.75 to 2 per lakh population - that there are few in-depth studies. The first-ever detailed analysis of the prevalence and disability burden of GBS was conducted in 2021. Using data between 1990 and 2019, the analysis showed that Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, South Korea, the US and Mexico had much higher than expected burdens, while countries and territories such as China, Fiji, Taiwan, and Guam had much lower than expected burdens.","18 of 140 patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome are on ventilator support in Pune.

There was a huge crowd of advocates for an important case preceding my case. I struggled through the crowd and reached the front row to seek a Passover. But my vocal cord failed me. I struggled to make the request to the CJI,” he said.Apart from his legal acumen, he was known for his lighter vein comments to diffuse tense debates inside the courtroom, especially in sensitive and important issues before constitution benches. So much so that, CJI D Y Chandrachud always gave him the opportunity to speak the last word, which invariably was a joke rhyming with the issue.CJI Khanna modified Sibal’s statement that Justice Roy was a complete judge. The CJi said Justice Roy was a complete man, as apart from legal knowledge, reasonableness and a sense of justice, he was an allrounder being a voracious reader and golfer. Justice Kumar said Justice Roy was a champion hockey player and a footballer for DPS during his school days. Justice Roy was appointed a judge of Gauhati HC in Oct 2006 and as judge of SC on Sep 23, 2019.","CJI Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Sanjay Kumar, attorney general R Venkataramani, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, SCBA president Kapil Sibal and SCAORA president Vipin Nair had a word of praise for his ever-smiling demeanour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117812953,imgsize-532042,width-400,resizemode-4/117812953.jpg"

His beaming face, glossy polyester shirt and bright red vermilion tilak running right up to the hairline meant that the ""visa god"" had smiled upon him. Ashok got his passport stamped with H-1B a day earlier and was at the temple to show his gratitude.He leaves for his new tech job in New Jersey in April.There were many Ashoks in the sea of people chanting 'Govinda, Govinda' as they walked around the deity at the temple, less than a fortnight after Donald Trump took over as the 47th President of the US. Since taking office, Trump has threatened to send back ""millions and millions of criminal aliens"", send troops to the southern border, and has even ordered the revoking of citizenship status for children of temporary visa holders. The announcements have sent a chill down the spine of the immigrant community, both within the US and among those anxious to go there.Indians dreaming of a new life in the US are now clinging to faith in the hope of a miracle - whether it is the Chilkur Balaji temple near Hyderabad, the Chamatkari Hanuman temple at Ahmedabad or the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir in Delhi. ""Eleven of us had applied last year,"" says Ashok, after completing his 108th pradakshina (circumambulation) of the temple dedicated to an avatar of Vishnu. ""I am the only one who got the visa. It is only because of Lord Balaji,"" adds the IT executive. He had prayed at the temple after submitting his visa papers in June 2024.Ahmedabad's Chamatkari Hanuman temple, also called 'Visa Hanuman', has swelling crowds during the weekend, with just two prayers on their lips. Either it's ""Lord, please grant me a visa"" or it's ""Lord, thank you for the visa."" The 300-year-old temple has earned a ""visa friendly"" reputation, drawing devotees from as far as J&K and Meghalaya.Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa after the pujari. The applicant is also asked to visit any Hanuman temple once a week and repeat the Hanuman Chalisa. ""It's all about one's 'shraddha'. If there is faith, all things are possible. If doubts creep into one's mind, then one is bound to face disappointment,"" says the priest, adding that he has been witness to instances where a visa has been secured within an hour of conducting the ritual, even after three or four visa denials. One such Ahmedabad resident whose US visa has been rejected once, got to know from friends that praying at the Chamatkari Hanuman temple will work wonders. ""I have complete faith that I will be granted a US visa in my next interview,"" he says, before going through the temple rituals.Down a dusty lane filled with hardware shops stands the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir at Delhi's Neb Sarai. Pandit Narayan Mishra, who has been officiating at the mandir for the last five years, says people give up meat, alcohol, onion and garlic for 41 days in their quest for the elusive visa stamp. ""They write their manokamna (wish) on a piece of paper. We take the slip of paper and make the idol 'read it' and chant the mantras. It is then placed in a box next to the deity,"" Mishra says.But what makes people come from across the country to the temple? ""Perhaps because Hanuman is considered the first god to have travelled outside the country to Lanka without any paperwork,"" he adds with a smile. Folklore or an attempt at humour, people in the area attest to the ""magical powers"" of the shrine. ""People come in a very disturbed state of mind. This is their last resort, and we usually find that their wishes do come true. Just last week, an applicant who got his US visa in only two weeks came to the temple for a puja to thank God,"" shares Mishra.Though Andhra software engineer Chandana C confesses to being crestfallen after Trump's success in the elections, she is now hopeful that her 25 visits to the Hyderabad temple in the last 25 months will not go in vain. ""I have been coming here every month since I applied for the visa through a local consultancy. I know things aren't looking bright right now, but I have faith I will eventually get it,"" says the 26-year-old desperate to realise her American dream, just like all her other relatives did.Not just for themselves, some even go through the ritual motions for their beloved kin. Kaushik R, on his 56th pradakshina, says that he is there to pray for his older brother living in North Carolina. ""I am praying that his name is selected in the lottery process, and he gets his H-1B. If all goes well, I will also join the University of Cincinnati for a MS programme later this year,"" says the freshly-minted engineering graduate - pinning his hopes on his talent and Lord Balaji in equal measure. ""But I will pray for myself later. This is for my brother,"" Kaushik adds, before quickly returning to his place in the queue. Right behind him is Ravindra R, who has landed himself his dream job in Texas. There's just one step for him to clear now: the visa interview. ""When I go for it, I know I will have Lord Balaji's blessings with me. Nothing can stop me,"" the IT professional says.With additional reporting from Meghdoot Sharon in Ahmedabad(Applicants' names changed on request)","Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa.

Infighting in Karnataka Congress intensifies after senior MLA resigns as CM's political adviser,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infighting-in-karnataka-congress-intensifies-after-senior-mla-resigns-as-cms-political-adviser/articleshow/117841636.cms,"BENGALURU/KALABURAGI: Senior Congress MLA B R Patil created quite a flutter in Karnataka's political circles on Saturday as he resigned from his position as chief minister Siddaramaiah political adviser .

I don't need any post.""Patil, who has been a legislator since 1983, is the only MLA in the current assembly who consistently wears the Gandhi cap. Known for his outspoken nature, he had previously opposed govt's proposal to grant new liquor shop licences, and was quite vocal about his dissatisfaction with certain other govt policies and decisions.Sources said he was unhappy with current scenario within Congress state unit, although Patil refrained from citing any specific reason for his resignation.His resignation has reignited discontent among senior party legislators who were overlooked for ministerial positions after Siddaramaiah govt took office in May 2023. In fact, to placate some of these disgruntled elements, govt had last year assigned special roles to them: Basavaraj Rayareddy was appointed as CM's economic adviser, Patil as political adviser, and RV Deshpande as the chairman of Administrative Reforms Commission.Despite holding an advisory position, Patil had time and again expressed dissatisfaction with the party's functioning.The MLA from Aland in Kalaburagi had even written to Congress state leadership about his concerns.A long-time Siddaramaiah loyalist, Patil had aspired for a ministerial berth, but reportedly faced resistance from Priyank and Sharanprakash Patil from within Kalaburagi district.As a compromise, he was appointed as the CM's adviser with a cabinet rank. However, disillusioned with district politics and factionalism, he finally decided to step down.",Senior Congress MLA B R Patil created quite a flutter in Karnataka's political circles on Saturday as he resigned from his position as chief minister Siddaramaiah political adviser.

"Assam reports 1st Guillain-Barre Syndrome death, Maharashtra tally climbs to 5",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-reports-1st-guillain-barre-syndrome-death-maharashtra-tally-climbs-to-5/articleshow/117841253.cms,"PUNE/GUWAHATI: Maharashtra reported its fifth death linked to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and Assam its first on Saturday as a continued uptick in hospitalisations across Pune took the metropolitan region's caseload to 149, up by nine overnight.A 60-year-old man from Nanded Gaon treated at Pune's Sassoon Hospital since Jan 16 died around 12.30am, hours before a 17-year-old girl admitted to Guwahati's privately-run Pratiksha Hospital on Jan 21 became the first confirmed GBS death outside Maharashtra since the outbreak there.The teenager was on ventilator support for 11 days.Two suspected GBS casualties in Kolkata last week - both boys, 10 and 17 - are still to be officially confirmed.Concern over the Pune cluster's continued growth was exacerbated by an increase in the number of patients in a critical condition. Health department data showed ICU admissions spiking from 45 until Friday to 83. The number of patients on ventilator support stood at 28, up from 18 the previous day.This was offset by some encouraging news in the form of hospitals discharging 38 GBS patients. GBS, which triggers a range of challenging but treatable neurological and other complications, generally doesn't occur in clusters like the one in Pune.The city's latest casualty in the outbreak succumbed to respiratory failure with autonomic dysfunction and quadriplegia - both complications arising from GBS - along with hypertension, an official at Sassoon Hospital said. ""The patient was from Khadakwasla, one of the areas in Nanded Gaon that has reported several GBS cases. He had diarrhoea for seven days before coming to the hospital. By the time he arrived, he was in a critical condition with quadriplegia (paralysis of the arms and legs),"" the official said.The deceased had sought treatment at smaller hospitals before coming to Sassoon in a critical condition.BJ Medical College and Sassoon Hospital's dean, Dr Eknath Pawar, said, ""We discharged five GBS patients on Saturday. Sassoon has 27 GBS patients. Over the next 2-3 days, another 10 patients are likely to be discharged.""Villages newly added to the Pune Municipal Corporation belt have been affected the most, accounting for 82 GBS cases so far. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has 17 patients.The search for what triggered the outbreak hit a hurdle when water samples tested for Campylobacter jejuni, found in stool samples of at least five patients, were found free of the bacterium. On Friday, 15 samples collected from private tankers that supply water to neighbourhoods reporting GBS cases were found to have high levels of coliform and E. coli contamination. Fourteen of the samples tested positive for E.coli, with counts exceeding 16 per 100ml. Safe drinking water should ideally have zero E.coli.",A 60-year-old man from Nanded Gaon treated at Pune's Sassoon Hospital since Jan 16 died around 12.30am on Saturday.

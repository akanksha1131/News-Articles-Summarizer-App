Robert Vadra's remark on Pahalgam attack

NEW DELHI: Businessman Robert Vadra , husband of Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra , on Monday issued a clarification regarding his recent remark on the Pahalgam terrorist attack . In a Facebook post, he said people had ""misinterpreted"" his intentions.Vadra had earlier said the Pahalgam terrorists killed people after checking their IDs, ""because they think that Muslims are being suppressed.""Vadra wrote in his clarification post, ""My intentions have been misinterpreted. I am committed to clarifying myself with honesty, transparency, and respect. I decided to wait in silence for a few days, but this should not be construed as silence, indifference or lack of patriotism. In fact, it is because of my deep love for my country, my deep respect for truth and my commitment to dedication that I took the time to reflect before speaking. Silence is the stage where responsibility matures, emotions calm down and words can be chosen carefully rather than impulsively.""He added, ""I strongly condemn the terrorist attack in Pahalgam that took the lives of innocent people and shattered their families. I stand with India and will always do so. There is no argument - political, religious or ideological - that can be used to stop this attack. Violence against innocent and unarmed people cannot be condoned.""Also, the industrialist called terrorism an ""attack on the soul of humanity"" and stated that ""no reason or logic"" can justify killing of innocent people.Vadra's post further read, ""I mourn for all those whose lives were lost, whose future was taken away, whose hearts were filled with unimaginable grief, and I urge everyone to remember the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi - he said that non-violence is the courageous choice. The suffering of our countrymen is our own suffering. Today, in this hour of grief, I express my commitment to build a world where no child, no family, no community lives under the shadow of terror.""On April 23, a day after the attack, Vadra said, ""When this terrorist act took place, they (terrorists) were looking at IDs...non-Muslims were attacked and messages were given to the prime minister. Why is this happening? Because they (terrorists) feel Muslims are being mistreated in our country.""Hitting back at Vadra, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli accused Vadra of using the ""same language that terrorists always use to justify their terrorism.""Kohli said, ""It's clear from Vadra's remarks that he wants to do politics on such a gruesome terror attack when the entire country is united against it.""","Robert Vadra had earlier said the Pahalgam terrorists killed people after checking their IDs, ""because they think that Muslims are being suppressed"" Vadra wrote in his clarification post, ""My intentions have been misinterpreted.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Udit Raj on Sunday strongly criticised his party colleague Shashi Tharoor for his remarks over the Pahalgam terror attack , questioning Tharoor's loyalty to the party.Speaking to ANI, Raj asked, ""Is Shashi Tharoor in the Congress party or the BJP? Is he trying to become a super-BJP man?"" He further challenged Tharoor to question the BJP government about their plans regarding PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) and questioned whether he had become ""the BJP's advocate.""“I want to ask him which terrorist attack occurred in America after 9/11? Has the BJP made him its spokesperson?"" Raj asked.Shashi Tharoor on Sunday had said that the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack may have resulted from an intelligence failure, comparing it to the October 7, 2023, Hamas strike that caught Israel — known for its robust intelligence network — by surprise.Speaking to ANI, Tharoor had said, ""Obviously, there was no full proof intelligence. There was some failure... But we have got the example of Israel, the world's best intelligence services according to everybody, which were taken by surprise on October 7, just two years ago. It seems to me, just as Israel is waiting till the end of the war before they demand accountability, similarly, I think we too should see the present crisis through and then demand accountability from the government. No country can ever have a foolproof 100 per cent intelligence.""Tharoor also added that while successful prevention of terror attacks often goes unnoticed, failures tend to attract greater attention.""We will never know about the various terror attacks that were successfully thwarted. We only learn about the ones that we failed to thwart. This is normal in any nation. There were failures, I agree, but that should not be our main focus right now...,"" the Congress leader said.The April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, targeted tourists, leaving 26 people dead.

CHENNAI: The DMK govt in Tamil Nadu got two controversial cabinet members to resign Sunday - electricity and excise minister V Senthil Balaji , whom Supreme Court gave an ultimatum last week to either exit or forfeit bail in a money laundering case, and forest minister K Ponmudy, in the dock for his purportedly disparaging remarks about women and Hindu symbols.Both ministers handed their resignation letters to governor R N Ravi, who accepted these immediately. Raj Bhavan issued a statement soon after, saying CM M K Stalin had recommended to the governor that their resignations be accepted.While Balaji was censured by SC last Wednesday, Ponmudy's remarks about women and symbols raised the hackles of Madras HC, which asked police to file an FIR against him.Housing minister S Muthusamy has been assigned the additional portfolios of excise and prohibition that Balaji used to handle. Muthusamy had been overseeing both when Balaji was sent to prison in 2023.The latter got them back on being reinstated as minister soon after coming out on bail.Transport minister S S Sivasankar has been given additional charge of the electricity department, while dairy development minister R S Rajakannappan will handle the forest portfolio. This is the third change in portfolio for Rajakannappan, as he had been shifted from the transport ministry to backward classes and then to dairy department.Former dairy development minister T Manothangaraj, who was removed from the cabinet last year, was re-inducted into the cabinet without a portfolio. Mano Thangaraj is the other minister to be brought back. Last year, minorities welfare minister S M Nasar returned to the cabinet.

He was arrested following multiple raids across Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, sources said on Sunday.On the night of April 23, Gulfam Ali, 27 - who worked at Shahid Ali Chicken Biryani, owned by his cousin - was closing the shop when three men arrived on a scooter. Two of them approached and greeted him before one of them shot him in the chest. His co-worker Saif Ali, 25, suffered minor injuries in the attack. The assailants escaped after the shooting.Hours later, a video circulated online showing Manoj Chaudhary, with pistols tucked in his jeans, alleging he was from Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal and taking responsibility for the murder. He claimed that he will avenge the killing of 26 - in an apparent reference to the Pahalgam incident - with 2600.Police had earlier dismissed the link of the murder to any operational Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal unit in Agra, adding that the video was ""likely a publicity stunt"".

NEW DELHI: Amid growing signs of an imminent retaliation against Pakistan over the Pahalgam terror attack , Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.“It is now your duty to strengthen the nation’s economy; it is your duty to strengthen the country’s internal security; it is your duty to develop modern infrastructure; and it is your duty to bring about fundamental improvements in the lives of workers,” he said on Saturday while distributing employment letters to little over 51,000 new recruits at a virtual event.The exhortation came days after the PM publicly declared his determination to avenge the terror attack by “tracking and pursuing” the perpetrators and the masterminds of the plot until the “end of earth” to hand them a punishment they could not have imagined. It was being seen as an attempt to rally people for any eventuality.The PM said he was confident of the new recruits discharging their responsibilities with utmost devotion.In his address, Modi said govt is taking several steps to create new opportunities for employment and self-employment. He added that it’s time for unprecedented opportunities for youngsters while mentioning that the International Monetary Fund has said India will remain the fastest-growing major economy.The PM said in recent times, the production and exports have achieved new milestones, particularly in the automobile and footwear industries, sectors that provide substantial employment to young people. Highlighting the achievement in transportation of cargo through inland waterways, Modi said goods transport through inland water transport has surged to 145 million tonnes (MTs) from 18 MTs before 2014.On women taking the lead in every field, Modi cited the recent UPSC results where the top two positions were secured by female candidates, and three out of the top five toppers were women. “Women are reaching new heights in fields ranging from bureaucracy to space and science. Our govt is focused on empowering rural women through initiatives like self-help groups, Bima Sakhis, Bank Sakhis, and Krishi Sakhis, which have created new opportunities,” he said.Earlier, personnel minister Jitendra Singh said that nearly 28% of the new recruits (14,796) are women.","PM Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.

LUCKNOW: Barely a few paces from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly in Lucknow, fearless touts at an Aadhaar Seva Kendra (ASK) promise and deliver anything for a price. They even conjure up a name uncannily similar to that of deputy CM Brajesh Pathak .When this reporter visited the Vidhan Sabha Marg-based Ratan square complex to test a widely rumoured tout racket, he was in for many surprises. The crowded Aadhaar Kendra had touts lurking everywhere, among them three young women in their mid-20s who were also part of the syndicate.One such tout, who identified himself as Rajesh, approached this reporter. ""I'm from Bakshi Ka Talab area and a huge admirer of deputy CM Brajesh Pathak. I wish to change my name from Brijesh Pathak to Brajesh Pathak, but there are no documents to support this,"" the reporter dropped the bait. ""Ho jayega (it will be done),"" Rajesh nodded.The tout got down to work. He pulled out his phone, downloaded a real voter ID (EPIC) of another Brajesh Pathak from Badaun, pasted the reporter's photo on it, and added a fake barcode. Within minutes, he booked an instant Aadhaar update appointment - at 12:50 pm - the same day. ""Go straight to the verifier. No questions will be asked,"" Rajesh assured, pocketing Rs 1,500 via UPI.Inside the Aadhaar Seva Kendra, the script unfolded exactly as promised. The verifier at counter-5 barely glanced at the forged documents. At 2 pm, ""Brajesh Pathak"", along with nearly 20 others who sought touts' help, was called - ahead of genuine applicants. The reporter was directed to counter-22, where a young woman operator mechanically processed the update, taking his iris scan. In less than an hour, a fake identity was born. The reporter was embedded in a team of officials who had gone to carry out checks at the ASK after reports swirled about IDs being fabricated.For the last five years, the ASK in question has been operated by Smart Chip Private Limited , the Indian subsidiary of French multinational IDEMIA group.After the successful sting operation, TOI contacted the group's officials for comment on the rigged system at Lucknow centre. But after waiting for a day, an official IDEMIA source said: ""Since we are under contract of UIDAI (govt agency which issues Aadhaar), we cannot comment."" However, the source acknowledged that there were indeed a few staff at Ratan Square ASK allegedly involved in malpractices. But still, Smart Chip Private Limited has no mandate to check documents.A day earlier, the UIDAI regional office of Lucknow, too, had sent at least two decoys to the Ratan Square ASK, and found that touts in connivance with Smart Chip Private Limited staff were involved in malpractices.Speaking to TOI, Prashant Kumar Singh, deputy DG of UIDAI (Lucknow region), acknowledged the matter. ""A recent surprise inspection at ASK Ratan Square revealed irregularities, prompting a decoy operation on April 21 that uncovered the modus operandi.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party came under intense criticism on Sunday as Karnataka minister TB Thimmapur said he ""personally didn't think"" terrorists ascertained the religion of the victims before killing them in Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22.Despite the family members of the victims claiming that terrorists opened fire at those who were Hindus, the Congress leader said religious colour was given to the massacre to ""cover up intelligence failure"".""I personally don't think the assailants would have asked the name and religion of the tourists...It is not just to add religious colour to cover up an intelligence failure,"" Thimmapur was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The BJP unleashed a piercing attack on the Congress over the minister's remark, saying the party has been ""playing good cop, bad cop"" and that Thimmapur's comment was an ""insult to the victims"".""Congress is playing 'good cop, bad cop'. On one hand, in the all-party meeting, they say that they will fully support. On the other hand, they make their leaders give statements which insult the victims and give cover fire to Pakistan. They all know that the terror masters of Pakistan have carried out this terrorist attack in Pahalgam... Congress leaders of Karnataka say that the terrorists did not ask about religion. This is an insult to the statements of the victim,"" said BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari.Bhandari further alleged that Congress was trying to give a clean chit to Pakistan like it did after the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai.""All this proves that just like after 26/11, the Congress party was trying every possible way to give a clean chit to Pakistan, under the same policy, today they are trying to give a clean chit to Pakistan... This is not the time for politics, this is the time when the country has to be united... The country is united and it knows that under the leadership of PM Modi, we will give a befitting reply to Pakistan,"" Bhandari said.Earlier in the day, Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah clarified his remarks suggesting there was ""no need for war"" with Pakistan following the deadly Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.""I mentioned that war is inevitable but must be with Pakistan. I did not say there should be no war at all. It is the central government’s responsibility to ensure security. In the Pahalgam incident, 26 people lost their lives. I only said there should not be an immediate war,"" Siddaramaiah told ANI.The controversy erupted after Siddaramaiah, while speaking in Mysuru on Saturday, stated that India should not rush into war with Pakistan and instead focus on strengthening security measures.","Karnataka minister TB Thimmapur said he ""personally didn't think"" terrorists ascertained the religion of the victims before killing them in Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22.

The judge directed the initiation of proceedings as the Tamil Nadu police failed to register an FIR against the minister, as suggested by the high court last week.According to the court, as per the Supreme Court order, police are mandated to register a case against such hate speech even in the absence of a formal complaint.",Senthil Balaji and K Ponmudy quit the chief minister MK Stalin-led Cabinet.

The people of Kashmir have come out openly against terrorism. It’s time to build on this support and avoid any misplaced action that alienates people,” Omar said.Earlier, National Conference MP Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi alleged on X, “Kashmir and Kashmiris are being given collective punishment.”Mehbooba said the Union govt should tread carefully and avoid alienating innocent people while acting against terrorists. “There are reports of thousands being arrested and scores of houses of common Kashmiris being demolished along with those of militants.”She urged the Centre to direct the authorities to ensure that innocent people are not made to bear the brunt, as alienation aids terrorists' goals of division and fear.Lone said that using “collectiveness to define criminality or terrorism is a curse and will never allow reconciliation and social introspection.”“The mass protests against the Pahalgam killings were a rare occurrence, a first of its kind in the last 78 years. It showed a shift in mindset — from a society in which some significant sections may have accorded social sanctity to the concept of violence, to a society which marched in thousands across villages and towns condemning violence, thereby signifying the social stigmatisation of violence,” he said.“This is a monumental shift, a milestone. But at the same time, a fragile shift. I hope those in charge of law and order do understand the significance of the shift and don’t do anything erroneously that impedes the shift or facilitates a return to the earlier mindset.”He said there is a general feeling across the Valley that entire families are being punished for the actions of one person.","Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti and People’s Conference chief Sajad Lone have warned amid a massive crackdown on terrorists.

He also reassured them that PM Narendra Modi would ""100% take revenge on Pakistan"" for the April 22 Pahalgam attack.Sawant said that unlike Pakistan, where the population of Hindus had been declining, India's Muslim community was growing.""Muslims stayed back in India after Partition and we have since seen their population increasing. We have no issues with them. We are a secular country.

The revisions, aligning with NEP 2020, aim to incorporate Indian traditions and philosophies, featuring Indian writers and themes in English textbooks while also highlighting government initiatives and constitutional rights.

Revisions aim at including Indian traditions into school curriculum



Poll Do you agree with the removal of Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate references from the NCERT textbook? No, it should be included. Yes, it's a necessary change.

NEW DELHI: All references to Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate have been removed from Class VII NCERT social science textbook. NCERT officials indicated that the released book - ' Exploring Society: India and Beyond ' - only represents the first part of the revised syllabus, with the second part expected in the coming months. However, they refrained from commenting on whether the omitted content would be part of the yet-to-be-released second part.In the English textbook 'Poorvi', out of 15 stories, poems and narratives, 9 are by Indian writers or feature Indian themes, with contributions from figures like Rabindranath Tagore, APJ Abdul Kalam and Ruskin Bond.This marks a shift from the previous textbook 'Honeycomb', which had only four Indian writers among its 17 authors.The new books, which were released this week, introduce a variety of changes, including addition of chapters on Indian dynasties, ""sacred geography"", govt initiatives and other cultural aspects, aligning with the vision outlined in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCFSE) 2023.These revisions aim at incorporating Indian traditions, philosophies and local knowledge systems into the school curriculum.The move follows earlier efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic to streamline the syllabus, where sections on Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate, including detailed accounts of dynasties like those of Tughlaq, Khalji, Mamluk, and Lodi, were trimmed. In the most recent update, all references to these historical periods have been completely removed from the social science textbook.Instead, the revised social science textbook 'Exploring Society: India and Beyond' introduces fresh chapters on ancient Indian dynasties such as the Magadha, Maurya, Shunga, and Satavahanas, with a strong emphasis on ""Indian ethos"". One notable addition is a chapter titled 'How the Land Becomes Sacred', which explores the significance of sacred places across India and the world, touching on major pilgrimage sites associated with various religions, including Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Sikhism.The chapter delves into concepts like ""sacred geography"", describing networks of revered locations such as the 12 jyotirlingas, the Char Dham Yatra, and the shakti pithas, as well as sacred mountains, rivers, and forests. A quote from Jawaharlal Nehru about India being a land of pilgrimages further underscores this theme.The revised curriculum also discusses the 'varna-jati' system, noting its role in providing societal stability initially, but highlighting how it became rigid over time, particularly under British colonial rule, leading to inequalities.In addition, the Maha Kumbh Mela, which attracted around 660 million people in Prayagraj this year, is mentioned, though the tragic stampede that resulted in the loss of 30 lives is not referenced. The book also introduces content related to modern-day India, including references to govt initiatives like 'Make in India', 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' and the Atal Tunnel.A chapter on the Constitution emphasises the importance of national flag, recounting a landmark moment in 2004 when a citizen challenged the restriction on flying the national flag at home. SC's ruling affirmed that flying the tricolour is part of Fundamental Right to Freedom of Expression.","All references to Mughals and Delhi Sultanate have been removed from Class VII NCERT social science textbook.

Thus, all Pakistani citizens in India on these visas were required to time their exits accordingly.Sources in agencies manning the Attari ICP told TOI that 191 Pakistani nationals had returned to their home country on April 25 by crossing over to Wagah, followed by 81 Pakistanis on April 26 and 237 the day after.The deadlines for 13 or the 14 categories of visas issued by India to Pakistanis expired by Sunday.

Some Pakistanis may have returned home through the air route via a third country, given that no direct flights currently operate between India and Pakistan, but no data in this regard was immediately available.The home ministry had last week asked all the states - both through phone calls from home minister Amit Shah to the chief ministers and during a video-conference chaired by Union home secretary Govind Mohan with the state/UT chief secretaries and DGPs - to identify all Pakistani visitors within their jurisdiction and ensure that they exit India within the set deadlines. The states/UTs were also told to ensure suitable action against Pakistanis who fail to adhere to the deadlines, which sources said may include deportation and proceedings under the Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025.Under the Immigration and Foreigners Act, any foreigner who overstays the period for which a visa was issued to him, could face up to three years in jail and/or up to Rs 3 lakh fine.","As many as 509 Pakistani nationals exited India via the Attari integrated check post between April 25 and 27. 744 Indian nationals returned from Pakistan via Wagah in the same period.

They are likely to come into play, along with other stand-off weapons, when the Indian govt decides to exercise the military option of limited punitive strikes against Pakistan, which could range from concentrated fire assaults without crossing the LoC to deeper precision strikes by fighter jets, as reported by TOI earlier.""Both PM Narendra Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh have made it quite clear that there will deadly retribution for not only the perpetrators of the Pahalgam massacre, but also their masters pulling the strings from behind the scenes,"" a senior officer said.Along the LoC, the Army said several Pakistan Army posts had again ""initiated unprovoked firing"" with small arms like rifles and light machine guns at Indian positions in several areas, like Tutmari Gali, Rampur, Uri, Gurez and Sunderbani sectors, late on Saturday night.""Our troops responded in double measure effectively with appropriate small arms fire.

Dengue vaccine 'Qdenga' to launch in India next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dengue-vaccine-qdenga-to-launch-in-india-next-year/articleshow/120676872.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Japanese major Takeda plans to launch its dengue vaccine, Qdenga, in India next year, partnering with Hyderabad-based Biological E (Bio E) to align with the ‘Make-in-India’ initiative.Having recognised dengue as a “global health challenge,” the over $23 bn company will adopt a “tiered pricing model for its first global vaccine to maximise access"", Derek Wallace, president, global vaccine business unit, Takeda, told TOI in an exclusive interview.The company, with focus on oncology, rare diseases and gastroenterology, negotiates lower prices for centralised government procurement on a country-by-country basis, and a similar strategy will be implemented in India, he said.Elaborating on the regulatory process, he said, it ""is ongoing and on track’’, with clinical trials underway to generate local safety data. ""We've already submitted a comprehensive data package that supported registration in 40 countries and we anticipate the vaccine will be licensed in India in 2026’’, he added.""We plan to introduce the vaccine in both private and public sectors simultaneously. Like in many other countries, India's National Immunisation Program is very pediatric-focused. The initial conversation aligns with WHO guidelines for implementing public programs for the pediatric population. However, we are introducing the vaccine in the private sector for both pediatric and adult populations"", Wallace added.While Takeda has a 240-year legacy and over 70 years in vaccines (primarily pediatric) in Japan, Qdenga is the company’s first globally developed and marketed vaccine. It is a tetravalent live-attenuated vaccine targeting all four dengue serotypes, and has a two-dose regimen with a three-month interval. Since the launch in 2023, the vaccine has sold over 10m doses.Further, the rollout will be in partnership with its strategic partner, Bio E. ""Given that dengue threatens half the world’s population, ensuring a sufficient vaccine supply is critical. Not only does this partnership enable local manufacturing in India, but it also expands our global footprint. Our goal is to produce 100 million doses annually by the end of the decade, with Bio E contributing half. Additionally, Bio E will be our sole manufacturer of multi-dose vials’’.Currently, the company’s German facility produces single-dose vials, while Bio E will produce both single and multi-dose formats. Multi-dose vials are preferred in public health programs because they reduce costs, optimise storage, and simplify distribution.Significantly, the biggie plans to establish the entire value chain in India. ""Our goal is to manufacture 100% of the doses in India, but this will happen in phases'', he noted.Over the past 20 years, dengue cases have surged eightfold due to climate change, urbanisation, and globalisation. There were nearly three lakh reported cases of dengue in India last year. ""Before launching in India, it’s crucial to build trust with government stakeholders and establish partnerships. For maximum impact, public-private partnerships are essential. This visit allows me to engage with senior public health and government officials. Understanding the roadmap for public programs and generating the necessary supporting data is a key part of our approach. Our focus is on making the vaccine accessible to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible’’, he said.Tracing the R&D of a dengue vaccine, he said, globally, research began in the 1980s, with early work in Thailand and later with the CDC in the US. We started in 2012, conducting one of our largest trials globally-- the TIDES study, involving 20,000 children across eight endemic countries, and later a four-and-a-half-year follow-up.""In Japan, we sell primarily childhood vaccines, including measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). We also have agreements with the government for pandemic flu preparedness and continue to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts. We distributed Moderna’s vaccine and continue to manufacture Novavax’s vaccine"", Wallace said.","Japanese major Takeda plans to launch its dengue vaccine, Qdenga, in India next year.

After Roche declined to share information on the cost of clinical trials, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), a US-based non-profit working on access to affordable medicines, calculated the costs and pegged them at about $50 million.Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.In response to the calculations sent to it by KEI, Roche stated: ""Only a small fraction of projects make it 'from bench to bedside' and we have to absorb the cost of failing projects as well, while your calculation only addresses successful development. Similarly, our dedication to innovation extends to the continuous development of next-generation therapies-a commitment clearly reflected in our ongoing development work of new treatments in SMA.""The three risdiplam trials cited in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and four earlier clinical trials involved 587 participants.KEI estimated per patient cost of conducting the trial by combining several data sources on the cost of conducting clinical trials.The US provides a tax credit for qualifying clinical trials for rare diseases. After KEI applied the tax credit to the trial cost, the net cost ranged from $11 million to $25 million. Clinical trials typically constitute 60-70% of drug development costs.Roche was also awarded a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) in Aug 2020. The PRV is an incentive designed to encourage development of drugs and biologics for serious or life-threatening diseases.The PRV can be sold to third parties. In 2020, the market value of a PRV was roughly $100 million, more than the Roche outlays on trials, pointed out KEI.Since 2003, when it was established, Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation (SMAF) has invested $100 million to develop drugs for this condition. Roche paid $30 million dollars to get an exclusive worldwide license to PTC Therapeutics' SMA programme, which PTC had developed in collaboration with SMAF.Roche's costs of manufacturing the drug are not significant, with a year of treatment requiring less than 2 grams of risdiplam, which can probably be manufactured by Roche at less than $50,000 per kilo, or $50 per gram, estimated KEI.In India, the treatment with risdiplam typically costs Rs 72 lakh per adult patient per year which is unaffordable for most.According to Roche's response to TOI, as of Oct 2024, of the 168 patients receiving Roche's treatment for SMA, 56 continued to be treated for free under the company's Compassionate User Program (CUP), 53 were covered under various govt policies - Central Government Health Scheme, Defence, Employee State Insurance (ESI) and Railways - and the remaining 59 purchased the drug under Roche's Patient Access Program, launched in 2021, ""under which Roche provides free bottles of the treatment for every bottle that is purchased"".Cure SMA, a trust formed by parents of children with SMA, has 1,800 patients registered and the govt portal for rare disease has 700 SMA patients registered.","Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.

Poll Do you think the child's initial silence about the abuse is common in such cases? No, it should be reported immediately Yes, it's a common reaction

CHENNAI: A child's trauma at being sexually abused by her father, a mother's initial attempt to protect her without reporting the crime, a phone call from an aunt in Singapore that led to the ghastly secret inadvertently tumbling out, and a long, bumpy road to justice.Seven years of silence, fear, doubt, blackmail and legal complexities culminated recently in a Pocso trial court verdict that sent the convicted offender - a Chennai builder - to 20 years in jail. The abuse had started in April 2018, with the father targeting his then five-year-old daughter on the pretext of bathing her. When the child complained to her mother about what she was being subjected to, it led to regular fights between husband and wife.The child, already traumatised, further withdrew into her shell when she saw her parents quarrel. The abuse continued, but she would no longer complain lest the domestic situation worsen. The mother purportedly saw in her daughter's eyes what she couldn't express, so she sent the child to a relative's house in Thiruvarur district, 300km from Chennai.The crime might have been buried forever had the survivor's maternal aunt not called the relative's house one day and asked to speak to her niece.During the conversation, the child confided in her aunt that she was ""finally happy"" as she no longer faced ""torture"". Some prodding led to the survivor narrating her ordeal and naming her father as the culprit.The aunt flew down to Tamil Nadu within days and took her niece to a hospital, where medical tests confirmed injuries indicating sexual abuse .Based on the medical findings, a Pocso case was filed, and the father was arrested. In 2023, the girl's mother moved Madras high court and secured custody of her daughter. This coincided with the trial court denying bail to the father, citing his daughter's testimony.Over the next year, the mother allegedly tutored the child to retract her statements about being abused by her father. Although the court allowed the girl weekly visits to her aunt, her mother retained custody.At a hearing last week, the survivor told the court that no abuse of the kind she had previously detailed ever happened and that she wished for her family to live together. Despite the child denying she was abused, Pocso court judge M Rajalakshmi relied on her original statement - backed by her medical report - to deliver the verdict the girl's determined aunt and the prosecution were waiting to hear. The convict was also fined Rs 1 lakh.","Child was sexually abused by her father for seven years. Her mother sent her to a relative's house in Thiruvarur district, 300km from Chennai.

They train, travel and participate with excitement. What we offered them was an obstacle race instead of a world-class experience. We were hosting a Gold Label event, certified by the World Athletics body with athletes from around the world. What image did we portray of our city? Is it so difficult to ensure a bare minimum - pothole-free, clean roads at least for one of the city’s premier events? Every road of the city looks like a construction site - dusty, potholed and lifeless,"" Tejasvi Surya said, urging the two respondents to take the matter seriously.","BJP MP for Bangalore South, Tejasvi Surya chided Bengaluru in-charge minister DK Shivakumar and BBMP chief commissioner Tushar Giri Nath over poor roads and public infrastructure in the CBD area. He said that not a single stretch was free of potholes and that the city's unforgiving infrastructure proved an impediment to wheelchair users.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120682863,imgsize-1795732,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/BJP-MP-Tejasvi-Surya-flag-off-the-TCS-World-10K-in-Bengaluru-photo-credits-Tejasvi-Surya/X.jpg"

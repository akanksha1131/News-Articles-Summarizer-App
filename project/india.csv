Responding to this, additional solicitor general K M Nataraj told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh that such a request should be made either to the concerned trial court or the High Court.On the treatment meted out to the accused, the ASG said, “We know how to deal with notorious criminals.” The bench told Sibal that his client should make the request to the trial court or the HC for attending court proceedings through video conference facility from the jail.The bench however sought UP govt’s response to Ansari’s petition seeking bail in an FIR registered in Chitrakoot under the UP Gangster Act. The petitioner alleged that mala fides of police is writ large as the allegation of him running a gang is outlandish as he was in jail at the relevant time. “How can he run a gang from jail,” asked Sibal.Advocate Nizamuddin Pasha told the court that the UP police have registered as many as 11 cases against Abbas Ansari, of which he has been either granted bail or protected against arrest in 10 cases.

Pune GBS outbreak could be one of the largest in world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pune-gbs-outbreak-could-be-one-of-the-largest-in-world/articleshow/117811903.cms,"MUMBAI: As 18 of 140 patients with the debilitating neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), are on ventilator support in Pune, there is some cold comfort in knowing this isn't the worst outbreak in the world - yet. It could, however, be considered one of the largest GBS outbreaks as medical literature classified 30 to 50 cases as an outbreak until 2019 when Peru registered the worst flare-up.The South American country had 1,120 cases in 2019, with 683 cases reported in two months. Its annual caseload stood at 59 in 2017 and rose to 262 in 2018 before peaking in 2019. Cases were recorded from across the country, but there is little data on deaths. The story didn't end there; Peru witnessed an outbreak again in 2023, when 130 suspected cases were reported between June 10 and July 15.The problem with GBS, as a professor of medicine in a medical college in Mumbai said, is that it is an autoimmune condition that technically doesn't seem like an epidemic-causing condition. ""GBS has been seen as an independent disorder that is sporadically seen across the country, but we now need to change our mindset and accept it can emerge as an outbreak and study it epidemiologically to look for links between the patients,"" he said.The only link between Peru and Pune is microbe Campylobacter jejuni . Smaller studies from across the world show GBS following this infection is linked with higher disability and mortality rates.GBS has been so rare - India has a reported annual incidence of 1.75 to 2 per lakh population - that there are few in-depth studies. The first-ever detailed analysis of the prevalence and disability burden of GBS was conducted in 2021. Using data between 1990 and 2019, the analysis showed that Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, South Korea, the US and Mexico had much higher than expected burdens, while countries and territories such as China, Fiji, Taiwan, and Guam had much lower than expected burdens.","18 of 140 patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome are on ventilator support in Pune.

Will this Budget make TDS less tedious for businesses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-this-budget-make-tds-less-tedious-for-businesses/articleshow/117810066.cms,"Confusion Galore:

In its first full Budget on July 23, 2024, the re-elected govt had announced a revamp of the Income-Tax Act to make it simpler and easier to understand. This exercise has commenced, and with Budget 2025 almost here, businesses are expecting simplification of the tax deduction at source (TDS) provisions as part of the Budget itself, as govt is stated to be committed to easing tax compliance .The TDS system, a pivotal instrument for govt to pre-emptively collect taxes and gather transactional data, has become quite cumbersome over the years. A beginning to ease TDS compliance was made in Budget 2024 and one hopes this initiative continues in the coming Budget also.The present TDS framework has been criticised for its complexity and the administrative burden it imposes on both tax deductors and deductees. In Budget 2024, govt took steps towards simplification by harmonising TDS rates to a uniform 2% for certain transactions and decriminalising delays in TDS payment up to the due date of filing the statement. However, there are several other complexities and there is a call for further simplification.The current labyrinth of TDS rates with 30-plus sections prescribing rates ranging from 0.1% to 30% has been a source of confusion for taxpayers. The current regime still contains multiple rates such as 0.1% (on sale of goods), 1%/ 2% (on contract payments), 5% (on insurance commission), 10% (on dividend and interest) and 30% on lottery winnings and cryptocurrency gains), to illustrate a few. TDS rates may vary depending on the payee's status (company or non-company) and the nature of the payment. Thresholds also differ according to provisions, leading to a cumbersome process for payers.The rate differential also leads to classification challenges. For example, a rate of 2% is prescribed for fees for technical services while the same section provides for a rate of 10% on fees for professional services. As a result, payers tend to follow a conservative approach to avoid any tax challenges (such as disallowance of expenditure for short deduction of tax, and levy of penalty) and deduct tax at a higher rate in case of doubt.The Solution: Simplification could involve rationalisation of TDS rates and reducing the existing multi-tier rate structure to just 3-4 rates. This, coupled with eliminating redundant provisions, would alleviate administrative burden, allowing businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, to focus on growth and innovation.Some of the TDS provisions were introduced by govt as a primary tool to collect information about the taxpayers such as TDS of sale of goods. With technological advancements and exchange of data between various departments such as with GST authorities, enough data is available with the government. In fact, due to the receipt of data in multiple formats and from multiple sources, there are often challenges in reporting at the tax department's end as well (such as disclosures in annual information statements). Hence, doing away with such TDS (introduced with the aim of data collation) can be considered.The Income-Tax Act has provisions for prosecution in case of wilful default in paying TDS. At present, however, there are no timelines prescribed for initiation and completion of such proceedings. Introducing time limits can lead to the proceedings being completed in a time bound manner and companies or directors will not have a sword hanging over them.The upcoming Budget is a good opportunity for govt to kickstart more simplification initiatives. A reduced compliance burden could translate into significant cost savings and operational efficiencies for businesses. The hope is that Budget 2025 will usher in a new era for the TDS system, making it more equitable, efficient, and straightforward.(The writer is director, tax & regulatory services, EY India.

"Kolkata weather: AQI improves as temperature rises, 5 of 7 stations in ‘satisfactory’ zone",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/temp-rises-aqi-improves-5-of-7-stns-in-satisfactory-zone/articleshow/117795741.cms,"KOLKATA: The city witnessed an extraordinary recovery in air quality on the last day of Jan, with five out of seven automatic air quality monitoring stations in the city registering ‘satisfactory' levels, marked by a light green AQI band (AQI: 51-100) for the first time this winter.This improvement was driven by a rise in the minimum temperature by 6 degrees Celsius, which largely negated the effects of thermal inversion that typically worsen air pollution during winter.Thermal inversion restricts vertical wind movement due to lower radiative temperatures at the ground level, creating calm wind conditions that prevent pollutants from dispersing, thereby leading to a spike in pollution levels.However, with the warming trend, dispersal mechanisms became more effective, allowing air quality to recover significantly across the city.Salt Lake, where the International Kolkata Book Fair is currently being held, emerged as the cleanest air zone, much to the relief of book lovers and visitors, as the air quality gradually improved throughout the day.Meanwhile, Ballygunge, which was the most polluted zone in recent days, showed the most significant recovery, returning to a ‘satisfactory' AQI level. In contrast, the Rabindra Bharati University (BT Road) monitoring station, which previously boasted the best air quality in the city, recorded a deterioration to ‘moderate' (AQI: 101-200), along with Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH), which was found to be the worst polluted zone in the city, said a PCB official.Hourly AQI readings reflected these trends. At 5 am, Ballygunge had an AQI of 84, which improved slightly to 81 by 11 am and remained steady through the afternoon before rising marginally to 83 by 7 pm.Salt Lake recorded an AQI of 76 at 5 am, improving to 68 by 11 am and maintaining that level throughout the day. Fort William's AQI remained consistently below 100, while Jadavpur showed a slight improvement from 90 at 5 am to 88 at 1 pm before stabilising.RBU (BT Road) showed a moderate AQI trend, starting at 102 and gradually worsening to 104 by 7 pm. Rabindra Sarobar displayed steady improvement, moving from 79 at 5 am to 72 by 7 pm.However, Victoria Memorial Hall stood out as the worst-affected area, with pollution levels worsening from 156 at 5 am to 164 by 7 pm, maintaining a ‘moderate' status throughout the day.While most of Kolkata saw an encouraging trend, the worsening pollution at Victoria Memorial and RBU is largely driven by automobile emissions and construction and demolition activities, respectively, said sources.","Kolkata saw an extraordinary recovery in air quality on the last day of Jan.

""While Goa, Maharashtra and Kerala have passed some rules and directives, the efforts have been patchy,"" he added.Karnataka's health and family welfare minister Dinesh Gundu Rao told TOI that the decision ""will be beneficial to both doctors as well as family of the patients"" who have no chances of recovery.The minister clarified that the decision is not to be confused with euthanasia, and ""is applicable only to those who are on life support system and non-responsive to life-sustaining treatment"".Rao pointed out that Karnataka has also come out with an advance medical directive (AMD) which is like a living will whereby patients can even record their wishes about their medical treatment in future. ""As part of AMD, the patient must also nominate two people to take healthcare decisions on his or her behalf in case they lose their decision-making capacity.

""Rashtrapati Bhavan would like to clarify that nothing could be farther from the truth. The President was not tired at any point. Indeed, she has believed that speaking up for the marginalised communities, for women and farmers, as she was doing during the course of her address, can never be tiring.

In any case, such comments are in poor taste, unfortunate and entirely avoidable,"" press secretary to the President Ajay Kumar Singh said.While addressing a public meeting, Modi reacted to comments by Sonia: ""These Congress people think they are the masters of the country. The arrogance of the Congress royal family has once again been exposed. Today, our President, Droupadi Murmu ji, addressed Parliament.

So, this decision will lay the foundation for substantial salary increases for govt employees in the coming years,"" she said.""Centre has decided to provide 50% assured pension to lakhs of employees under Unified Pension Scheme, which is widely welcomed.

Pannun used Sikhs for Justice role as cover to inflict war on India: Tribunal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-used-sfj-role-as-cover-to-inflict-war-on-india-tribunal/articleshow/117790552.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), banned as an “unlawful association” under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act , is a frontal organisation of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , who as the outfit’s legal adviser is using his “juristic identity” as a cover to perpetrate war upon India in league with other agencies and state-and non-state actors of foreign countries, a tribunal led by Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta ruled while upholding the ban on the pro-Khalistani outfit earlier this month.The background note submitted by the government to the tribunal, detailing the activities of SFJ, states that the all activities of the outfit are usually carried out from offices of Pannun, an attempt on whose life in the US, allegedly involving a former Indian government officer, had become an irritant in Indo-US tied until they agreed to cooperate on the case, with a panel set up by India recently recommending “legal action” against the “individual”.The government of India’s background note on SFJ and Pannun, submitted before the tribunal, records that the outfit has repeatedly threatened India’s political leaders, government officers including the police, diplomats, judiciary and even their family members and families abroad. These include Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, chief minister and minister of Punjab, national security adviser, and RAW chief. The note reveals that SFJ organises protests and filing of baseless cases against visiting Indian dignitaries abroad, particularly in Europe, Canada and US, to defame them and to fan anti-India sentiments among the Sikh diaspora.Stating that SFJ has been organising anti-India protests outside Indian embassies or consulates, where its activists have raised Khalistan flags and even dishonoured the Indian flag and indulged in violence and vandalisation of the premises, the documents filed with the tribunal reveal that many of the protests had the active support of Pakistani missions and were in tandem with multiple ISI-backed Pakistani diaspora outfits and Kashmiri diaspora. They also said Hindu temples in Canada and Australia were defaced with Khalistani graffiti and ISIS exhorted by SFJ after the deadly ISIS attack on Gurdwara Kart-e-Parwan in Kabul, Afghanistan, to target the Indian embassies rather than gurdwaras.The note directly names Pannun for having instigated the Indian farmers protesting against the three farm bills to arm themselves and fight against the Indian forces with weapons that would reach them from across the border (Pakistan). It said he has conspired with other Khalistani leaders like UK-based Babbar Khalsa International leader Paramjit Singh Pamma as well as Canada based terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in 2023, to revive terrorism in Punjab.SFJ, according to the government’s submission, has been inciting Sikh personnel to desert the Army and police forces. He had urged Sikh Soldiers to join the SFJ movement and offered them Rs 5000 more than the salary given by the Indian government. He also tried to provoke the Sikh soldiers posted in Ladakh to not to fight for India against Chinese aggression.SFJ has also been colluding with the gangsters, terrorists and other radical elements including Kashmir separatists. Not only this, it has been inciting non-Sikh communities including Muslims and Tamils, as also Christians in Manipur to secede from India.As many as 104 cases have been registered against SFJ elements, including 96 by various state police and 8 by NIA.“Vitriolic speeches made by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun glorifying militants such as Bhinderwalan & Nijjar, making calls to assassinate Constitutional functionaries of the country, calling for a referendum which is nothing but a plebiscite, taken jointly or individually... constitute “sufficient cause” for confirming the decision of the Union of India to extend the declaration of SFJ as unlawful association for a further period of five years,” the tribunal stated while upholding the ban on January 3 this year.","Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) banned as an “unlawful association’ under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. The outfit is a frontal organisation of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the legal adviser of SFJ.

But in the past, marriages took place at a very young age. So, we included them to cover any such cases that might still exist today.""As per the Act, individuals seeking to marry or enter a live-in relation within these categories must obtain a certificate from their religious clergy confirming that such unions are permitted under their customs. UCC defines clergy as ""any person who conducts marriage ceremonies in accordance with customs and practices of the community concerned.""Gaur said even with a religious certificate, the registrar may still reject such applications if they violate public policy and morality.UCC rules explicitly state that a registrar can refuse to register a relationship if the applicants are closely related by blood or family ties and their marriage is either not permitted by their customs or, even if allowed, contradicts public policy and moral standards, he said, adding, applicants can appeal against such decisions before the registrar general within 30 days.Archana Pal, assistant professor of sociology at DAV college, said exceptions listed under the Act ""undermine its purpose of bringing uniformity.""

Poll What’s Most Important When Choosing Election Candidates? Their Integrity and Honesty Their Policies and Plans for the Future

NEW DELHI: Several prominent members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have resigned from their positions as Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), citing dissatisfaction with the party's decision to not grant them tickets for the upcoming elections.The resignations include Rohit Mehraulia, MLA from Trilokpuri, Madan Lal from Kasturba Nagar, Rajesh Rishi from Janakpuri, and Bhavna Gaur from Palam. Additionally, Bhupinder Singh Joon, the MLA from Bijwasan, and Pawan Kumar Sharma, the MLA from Adarsh Nagar, Madipur MLA Girish Soni have also stepped down from their posts.The AAP has not provided tickets to these six MLAs for the next election cycle, a move that has led to their departure from the party. Sources close to the resigned members suggest that the decision to exclude them from the list of candidates was a key factor in their decision to leave.In another major development, Naresh Yadav, the MLA from Mehrauli, also resigned from the party. Yadav, who had served as an MLA for two consecutive terms, was initially fielded as the AAP candidate for a third term. However, after allegations related to a sacrilege case were proven, Yadav voluntarily returned his ticket. Subsequently, AAP decided to field another candidate for the Mehrauli constituency.The party has yet to issue an official statement regarding the resignations.","The resignations include Rohit Mehraulia, MLA from Trilokpuri, Madan Lal from Kasturba Nagar, Rajesh Rishi from Janakpuri and Bhavna Gaur from Palam.

AAP hits back

Internal rift or political strategy?

BJP eyes opportunity

In a blow to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, eight outgoing MLAs resigned on Friday, accusing the party of corruption and neglect. The move comes just five days before the polls, raising questions about internal dissent within the ruling party.Among those who quit were Madan Lal (Kasturba Nagar), Bhavna Gaur (Palam), Naresh Yadav (Mehrauli), Rohit Mehraulia (Trilokpuri), Pawan Sharma (Adarsh Nagar), B S Joon (Bijwasan), Rajesh Rishi (Janakpuri) and Girish Soni (Madipur). Many of them posted their resignation letters on social media, openly criticizing AAP’s leadership.Gaur, a two-time MLA, wrote to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, stating, ""I have lost faith in you and the party."" Meanwhile, Mehraulia took aim at AAP’s ideology, claiming, ""They only need a photo of Baba Saheb, not his ideology.""AAP’s national spokesperson Reena Gupta dismissed the allegations, revealing that a party survey found these MLAs were inaccessible to the public, which led to them being denied tickets.""They were replaced due to poor feedback. Their resignations and shift to another party only prove their opportunism,"" Gupta said.AAP also defended its candidate selection, emphasizing that it has prioritized ""ordinary individuals from humble backgrounds"" in its ticket distribution.While Naresh Yadav was initially given a ticket, AAP revoked it following his conviction in a 2016 religious desecration case. His replacement by Mahender Chaudhary fueled speculation about selective candidate screening.Meanwhile, some AAP leaders criticized the defectors, with Kirari MLA Rituraj Jha accusing them of betraying the party. ""History will never forgive them,"" he said, reaffirming loyalty to Kejriwal.With AAP battling to retain power for a third consecutive term, the BJP sees a chance to break its 25-year exile from Delhi’s governance. The resignations could provide the opposition with ammunition to question Kejriwal’s leadership ahead of the February 5 polls.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is facing a major crisis ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections.

She, the mother, feels happier—much more than when he was born,

When scholars acknowledge his intellect

Indian wives who are pregnant in the US are hurrying to maternity clinics with their husbands, seeking consultations with gynaecologists about pre-term births. Why must the natural rhythm of pregnancy be interrupted with early C-sections? The answer lies in US President Donald Trump ’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, effective Feb 20.I arrived in California on the day Trump was sworn in. The immigrant communities—a tapestry of hopes and dreams—were soon gripped by anxiety as the President signed an executive order altering the very essence of their aspirations. According to the order, children born in the US before Feb 19 would remain American citizens. Those born after would lose the automatic privilege of citizenship by birth .Legal experts argue that the executive order is unconstitutional, and lawsuits challenging its validity are already underway. Amid the legal tussle, the most vulnerable remain the unborn children, caught in the crossfire of politics and parental aspirations.For thousands of Indians working in the US on temporary H-1B and L1 visas, this announcement struck a deeply personal chord. Many are enduring the long wait for green cards, a process that can take 15 years or more. For these families, the birth of a child on American soil had always represented a gateway to stability and security.Doctors shared stories of frantic calls from expectant mothers, some of whom are only seven months into their pregnancies. Studies reveal that from as early as 24 weeks, a foetus can sense maternal stress, a silent dialogue that begins long before birth. Pre-term babies often face challenges like underdeveloped organs, low birth weight, and associated complications. Yet, some parents choose this precarious path to secure the coveted status of US citizenship for their child.Is this an act of love or desperation? An expectant mother I spoke to justified her choice with conviction. “We’re not even green card holders yet,” she explained. “My first child was born here and is a citizen. If I don’t opt for an early C-section, my children might face completely different national identities. I’m doing this for the sake of parity between them.” Her words left me silent, grappling with the weight of her predicament.In the Thirukkural, Valluvar speaks of a mother’s joy. Her happiness may surpass even the ecstasy of childbirth, if her child’s intellect is acknowledged by scholars:Valluvar portrays a mother who celebrates the intellect of her child and the acknowledgement of the same by scholars. Time and situations have placed some parents to find greater happiness in the label of “American citizen” than in the health, intellect, and well-being of their child. What Thiruvalluvar envisioned as the highest joy of motherhood—the acknowledgment of a child’s intellect—has, in some cases, been replaced by the pursuit of a passport.This dilemma reminds me of a story from the Mahabharata. Kadru and Vinata, daughters of Daksha Prajapati, married Rishi Kashyapa. Kadru wished for 1,000 serpent sons; Vinata desired two powerful sons. Kadru’s eggs hatched quickly, but Vinata’s remained dormant. Impatient, she cracked one prematurely, giving birth to Aruna, who was born with underdeveloped limbs. Aruna reproached her lack of patience and cursed her to become a slave to her sister, but he also advised her remission to be given by his sibling who was yet to be born. In time, Garuda was born, a divine bird, who liberated his mother from servitude.Timeless tales resonate in different ways with our lives. A mother’s most distinguished virtue is her patience and penance. Today, these virtues are being tested in unprecedented ways as parents wrestle with the tension between securing a future for their child and honouring the natural course of life.As I reflect on this complex reality, I wish for safe deliveries for all babies, for immigration laws that align with the dreams of parents, and for a world where the joy of parenthood is measured not by geo-political or economic considerations but by the health and happiness of every child.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117793046,imgsize-65476,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/117793046.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has directed registration of FIR against the former SHO of Jyoti Nagar police station in the case of a group of men being forced to sing the national anthem and Vande Mataram while lying injured during the 2020 Delhi riots. The court said the cops had ""engaged themselves in hate crimes"", reports Vineet Upadhyay.The court also asked complainant Mohammad Waseem to approach the MP/MLA court to seek registration of an FIR against BJP's Kapil Mishra who had been identified by him on Feb 24, 2020, as allegedly leading an unlawful assembly. The court said the action taken report was silent about the former MLA and either the investigating officer had failed to conduct an inquiry against him or had tried to cover up the allegations.The alleged accused no.3 (Kapil Mishra) is in public eye and is prone to more scrutiny; such persons in society direct the course/mood of the public at large and, thus, responsible behaviour within the ambit of Constitution of India is expected from such persons.""Mishra has been fielded from Karawal Nagar constituency in north-east Delhi by BJP for the assembly elections this month.""Clearly, the SHO PS Jyoti Nagar, Tomar (complete name not provided) and other unknown police officials engaged themselves in hate crimes against the complainant/victim and they cannot be protected under the garb of sanction as alleged offences committed by them cannot be said to have been committed while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duty,"" said the court.The directions from Udbhav Kumar Jain, judicial magistrate first class, came in an order dated Jan 18 while hearing the complaint filed by Waseem. It had sought filing of FIRs against Mishra, the then SHO and others involved in the alleged crimes committed against him and others.The court observed that the action taken report filed by the IO merely denied the allegations but had failed to enlist any substantive steps taken for conducting a preliminary inquiry.""The ATR is also silent on the aspect of CCTV footage pertaining to the date of the alleged incident, which should have been inquired by the IO. Thus, the inquiry pertaining to the alleged acts/offences against the complainant has not been conducted properly,"" said the court.The court directed the current SHO of Jyoti Nagar police station to depute a responsible officer not below the rank of inspector to conduct an investigation in the matter and probe the role of other unknown police officials involved in the commission of the alleged offences.The court said that the FIR should be registered against the former SHO for offences under Section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code, 1860.Delhi HC had in August 2024 transferred the probe into the death of 23-year-old Faizan who was part of the group to CBI. It has been alleged that Faizan died due to custodial torture by policemen at the Jyoti Nagar police station.The incident relates to a video shot during the 2020 Delhi riots that had gone viral on social media. It showed some Delhi Police personnel beating up the men and forcing them to sing the national anthem and Vande Mataram to prove their patriotism. The policemen were also heard hurling communal slurs. Delhi Police had in July last year initiated departmental inquiries against two policemen in the case.","A Delhi court has directed registration of FIR against the former SHO of Jyoti Nagar police station.

The next crucial step should have been to confirm whether Campylobacter jejuni , a bacterium commonly linked to GBS outbreaks, was the cause. This detection takes 48 hours.On day 2, Dr John said, health officials should have promptly verified potability of water and tested it for E coli. On the same day, an alert should've been issued warning the public of a possible contamination in the drinking water and urging them to boil it before consumption.By day 3, if the results were confirmed, he said, the municipal corporation should have implemented a hyperchlorination process to disinfect the water and identify the contaminated branches of the water supply.On day 4, with increasing GBS cases from different hospitals, health officials should have created a spot map, declared an outbreak, and announced that the water supply had been cleaned.Once these measures were implemented, Dr John noted, the outbreak would have likely subsided. ""This is how it happens in developed countries. We need to answer now if India has this protocol - that is what a robust public health system is.""A former disease surveillance officer said, ""The surveillance systems are well established, but they need to be fine-tuned to take into account the urban area's growing population. In this case, the health department took the necessary steps early on. However, there are many factors beyond the scope of the health department, such as the quality of water supplied in the city.""He said the outbreak was particularly complex, as GBS itself is not an infectious disease but rather a condition triggered by infectious agents.","Guillain-Barre Syndrome outbreak in Pune could have been controlled in four days.

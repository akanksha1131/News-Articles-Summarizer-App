"Jan Vishwas Bill introduced in LS, sent to panel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jan-vishwas-bill-introduced-in-ls-sent-to-panel/articleshow/123377181.cms,"Union minister Piyush Goyal introducing the bill

NEW DELHI: The govt Monday introduced the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2025, in Lok Sabha to decriminalise 288 provisions relating to minor offences under different central laws, in its bid to expand the reform agenda of ease of living and doing business. In several cases, it proposes to introduce ""improvement notices"" for first-time violations, replacing fines with penalties and giving violators an opportunity to rectify their non-compliance.Introducing the bill, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said it seeks to enhance trust-based governance for ease of doing business. The bill was referred to the select committee of LS for scrutiny, which is to submit its report by the first day of the next session of Parliament.The Bill seeks to simplify 355 provisions - decriminalising 288 provisions and amending 67. It uses the term ""contraventions"" instead of ""offence"" to give an opportunity to violators to mend their ways. It proposes to rationalise penalties for repeat violations.Officials said the bill reflects a shift from the earlier approach of ""penalise on first detection"" to a ""warning-correct-penalise"" model, which would promote voluntary compliance.For deterrence, a steep hike in penalties has been proposed for second and subsequent violations in several cases.For example, in the Central Silk Board Act, 1948, the bill proposes to replace the provision of imprisonment of up to one year and up to Rs 1,000 fine to ""warning"" for first contravention while for subsequent violations the proposed penalty has been hiked manifold (Rs 25,000-1 lakh) for furnishing any false statement. Similarly, the proposed penalty for manufacturing and sale of Ayurvedic, Siddha or Unani drugs in contravention to the provision of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is three times more. As per the bill, the provision of up to six months' jail and fine of at least Rs 10,000 would be replaced with only fine of at least Rs 30,000.The bill proposes to amend provisions related to sectors such as agriculture export, industries, transport, electricity, municipal services, textile and coir. It states that the fear of imprisonment for minor offences is a ""major factor"" hampering the business ecosystem and individual confidence.The legislation proposes to amend 20 provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act to provide relaxation and clarity in compliance, including statewide vehicle registration instead of jurisdiction-specific; driving licence (DL) renewal effective from date of renewal if applied after expiry; 30 days grace period after licence expiry; reporting period for vehicle registration cancellation extended to 30 days from 14; and insurer intimation period on transfer of insurance certificate extended to 30 days from 14.However, for stricter action against air-pollution, the bill proposes Rs 10,000 fine and disqualification to hold DL for first offence while jail and penalty for subsequent offence. This proposes to set a 12-month timeline for claims tribunals to dispose of accident related cases.","The Bill seeks to simplify 355 provisions - decriminalising 288 provisions and amending 67.

Poll Who do you think had the upper hand in the rivalry between Irfan Pathan and Shahid Afridi? Irfan Pathan Shahid Afridi It was evenly matched Not sure

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing Irfan Pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with Shahid Afridi , calling out the former Pakistan captain for resorting to personal attacks.Pathan, who enjoyed considerable success against Pakistan — with 67 wickets and 807 runs in Indo-Pak clashes — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking to Lallantop, the former India all-rounder recalled how the rivalry turned bitter after Afridi mocked his identity in an interview.“Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere walid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe,” Pathan revealed. “So whenever I had the ball in hand, I made sure I dismissed him. I have shown him 11 times who the real Pathan is — in big moments, in series deciders, and in the World Cup final.”Kaneria, Afridi’s former teammate, echoed Pathan’s claims in a scathing social media post. “Irfan @IrfanPathan bhai, you’re absolutely right.He always resorts to personal attacks — be it on someone’s family or their religion. Class and decency clearly aren’t his strengths,” Kaneria wrote while sharing the interview clip.Pathan also recalled off-field flashpoints, including a fiery mid-air spat during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’… Later, I told him, ‘He has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, he couldn’t reply.”For Pathan, Afridi’s taunts only served as fuel. “On the field, my performances were the perfect answer. I showed him who the real Pathan is.”Kaneria’s intervention has reignited an already fiery debate, bringing back to spotlight one of cricket’s most infamous rivalries.","Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has backed Irfan Pathan's claims about his rivalry with Shahid Afridi.

Their relationship, and enduring bond, was once seen as unconventional but soon became one of Indian cricket’s most admired partnerships.Arjun, born on September 24, 1999, has been steadily carving out his career in cricket.A left-arm pacer and lower-order batter, he made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians in 2023. While his career is still in its early stages, his personal life has already taken a decisive turn with his engagement.Sanniya Chandhok, born on June 23, 1998, is a year older than Arjun.Reports suggest the couple celebrated their engagement in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family.Interestingly, Arjun himself is younger than his sister Sara Tendulkar, who is two years older, making the age dynamic within the family a familiar one.Much like his father, Arjun seems unfazed by societal expectations around age gaps in relationships.The Tendulkar family, long admired for its grounded approach to fame, appears set to welcome a new member with warmth and celebration.As Arjun balances the demands of cricket and prepares for a new phase off the field, the parallel with Sachin’s own life journey is hard to miss.Once again, a Tendulkar son seems ready to walk in his father’s footsteps, this time, in love.","The 25-year-old has reportedly got engaged to Sanniya Chandhok, 26, on August 13, 2025.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has introduced the Delhi School Education (Transparency in Fixation and Regulation of Fees) Bill, 2025, aiming to regulate fees in all private schools across the city. Education Minister Ashish Sood stated that the law seeks to end arbitrary fee hikes and increase transparency by involving parents in the decision-making process.The bill, passed in the Monsoon Session of the Delhi Assembly, extends fee regulation to all 1,700 private schools, closing a loophole from the 1973 rules which covered only 300 schools. It introduces committees comprising parents, teachers, school management, and government representatives to oversee fee fixation and grievance redressal, as reported byAccording to the bill, fee proposals must be approved by school-level committees by July 15, district-level committees by July 30, and finalised by September. If no consensus is reached within 45 days, an appellate committee will intervene. Schools raising fees without government approval face fines ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, with double penalties if excess fees are not refunded, as stated by the education minister in areport.The bill grants the Director of Education powers akin to a sub-divisional magistrate, enabling uniform enforcement and action against violations. This includes the authority to take suo motu action when necessary.The law formalises parental involvement in fee fixation, giving them veto power over fee increases. Ashish Sood explained in an interview with) that the bill addresses concerns about individual parents holding schools hostage by requiring at least 15% parental support to file complaints. He described this as a necessary balance to prevent institutional paralysis, as quoted bySood highlighted that for the first time, parents have a clear channel to raise concerns not only about fees but also about infrastructure and school facilities. ""Parents couldn't raise concerns about the lack of lab facilities, poor services, or absence of playgrounds. Now, for the first time, parents have been given that voice,"" he said.Despite these provisions, parent groups like the United Parents' Voice (UPV) have protested against the bill, alleging it was enacted without adequate public consultation. UPV staged a demonstration at Jantar Mantar, submitting a memorandum to the government demanding a rollback of unapproved fee hikes and independent audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General and forensic experts, as reported byParents also criticised the bill's requirement for formal parental representation and the limit on individual complaints, claiming it restricts their ability to raise grievances. They called for monthly fee collection systems and transparency through government portals to ease financial burdens, and sought government-supervised elections for parent-teacher associations.Critics have argued that the bill limits recourse to civil courts for fee disputes. However, Sood pointed out to TOI that Delhi has 600 civil courts but questioned whether any fee-related disputes have reached them, arguing that the bill's three-tier grievance redressal system is adequate. The Director of Education can receive complaints directly and escalate unresolved issues further.The bill resets the fee structure from April 1, 2025, treating existing fees as proposed fees to be reviewed by the committees. If a hike is deemed excessive, it will be rolled back; if justified, it may be permitted. Schools that fail to comply with these processes face penalties.The 2025 bill represents a significant step towards regulating private school fees and involving parents in governance, aiming to address longstanding issues of arbitrary fee increases and lack of transparency. While the government maintains that the bill balances interests of all stakeholders, some parent groups remain sceptical, continuing to call for greater accountability and inclusive decision-making.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Poll Which player from the Class of 2023 do you think will be missed the most in the 2025 squad? Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: With the Indian selectors expected to unveil the squad for the Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, August 19, speculation is mounting over who will make the cut for the continental T20I event. India, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will feature in the tournament scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28.This edition will be played in the T20I format, aligning with the T20 World Cup cycle next year. The last edition in 2023, however, was an ODI competition jointly hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. That squad, led by Rohit Sharma, lifted the trophy, but much has changed in the two years since.From the Class of 2023, three stalwarts — Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja — have retired from T20Is, drawing curtains on their illustrious careers in the shortest format. Their absence has created both a leadership vacuum and opportunities for the next generation.Several others who featured two years ago have drifted away from India's T20 set-up. Ishan Kishan, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Shami, and Shardul Thakur have not been part of the scheme in recent times, either due to form, fitness, or selection dynamics.That leaves a solid core of players still very much in contention for the Class of 2025. Suryakumar Yadav , now India's T20I captain, heads the list, with Hardik Pandya , Jasprit Bumrah, and Shubman Gill expected to play central roles.

Poll Do you think India's space program will advance significantly with missions like Axiom-4? Yes, absolutely! No, it will take time.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , pilot of the Axiom-4 Space Mission to the International Space Station (ISS), at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence. PM Modi welcomed Shukla with a warm hug and walked alongside him with his arm on the astronaut’s shoulder, highlighting the significance of the moment.During the meeting, Shukla presented the Axiom-4 mission patch to the Prime Minister and shared photographs of the Earth taken from the ISS. Shukla, who returned to India early Sunday, had received a rousing welcome at the Delhi airport.After the meeting, PM Modi took to X and posted, “Had a great interaction with Shubhanshu Shukla. We discussed a wide range of subjects including his experiences in space, progress in science & technology as well as India’s ambitious Gaganyaan mission. India is proud of his feat.”Earlier in the day, Shukla was honoured in the Lok Sabha during a special discussion celebrating his milestone mission.Shukla completed an 18-day Axiom-4 mission on July 15, conducting over 60 experiments with three other crew members aboard the ISS—a key step towards India’s human spaceflight ambitions under the Gaganyaan programme.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said the special discussion in the House was aimed at celebrating Shukla’s achievements and India’s growing space capabilities.“Our hero astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla has returned home after a successful mission to the ISS. Parliament will honour him with a special discussion on his historic milestone and India’s journey towards Viksit Bharat,” Rijiju posted on X. He urged Opposition MPs to participate in the debate in the same spirit as they had during Operation Sindoor, though they chose to boycott, causing repeated disruptions.Breaking ranks, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor praised Shukla on social media. “Since the Opposition are not participating in the special discussion, let me say how proud all Indians are of the recent mission of Commander Shubhanshu Shukla to the ISS. It served as a stepping stone to our nation’s human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan,” Tharoor wrote.PM Modi had earlier lauded Shukla in his Independence Day address, reiterating India’s plan to build its own space station. ISRO Chairman V Narayanan said the first module is expected to be placed in orbit by 2028, with the station fully operational by 2035.Union MoS for science and technology Jitendra Singh criticised Opposition MPs for not acknowledging the achievement. “Your anger can be with the government and the BJP, but it is surprising you can be angry with an astronaut. He is not linked to any political party. You are angry with the earth, you are angry with the sky and today you seem to be angry with space as well,” Singh said.Shukla’s journey included nearly a year of intensive training in the US before being selected for the Axiom-4 mission. On his return, he expressed gratitude to the nation and said he would share his experiences with students and scientists across India. He is also set to attend National Space Day events later this month.","PM Narendra Modi met Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence.

MUMBAI: India, said Fields medallist Manjul Bhargava, must fall in love with mathematics again. Not as a ""drudgery of formulae"" but as an act of ""exploration"".Bhargava, Canadian by nationality but of Indian origin, believes classrooms need an overhaul-""experimental, playful,"" he said, with teachers ""trained"" to spark curiosity. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the Lodha Mathematical Sciences Institute (LMSI), he added: ""I'm happy with the new textbooks and the changes brought in them. But they will only show impact in a few years.""On the scientific advisory council of LMSI, Bhargava will lead sessions on arithmetic statistics, its new developments, and future directions. State cabinet minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha called it a school ""not for an individual, not for a business, but for the nation that always prioritised knowledge over all and for India that gave so much math to the world.""Entirely devoted to post-doctoral research, LMSI is India's first privately funded mathematics institute, backed by Lodha Foundation with a Rs 20,000 crore endowment. ""We realised that for any nation to become strong, we ought to have original thinking and promote innovation,"" said Abhishek Lodha, CEO and MD of Lodha Developers. The privately funded mathematics research institute in the country is completely free, he added.Founding director V Kumar Murthy-who earlier led Toronto's Fields Institute-described math as the hidden scaffolding of modern life: the foundation for finance, engineering, and technology. Economist Nachiket Mor, also on the advisory panel, noted that models built in the West often collapse in India because they rarely account for ""unique characteristics"" like limited liquidity and higher viscosity of adjustment. ""This reality makes it all the more urgent for us to build deep capacity mathematics,"" he said.Murthy explained that LMSI would begin not with students but with teachers. Ten senior number theorists have been chosen to seed the effort. As president, Murthy said he plans to travel across the country, meeting mathematicians firsthand and mapping who is doing what. The aim is to build a network where the ""brightest minds"" are spotted early, handpicked, and nurtured.By Dec 2026, LMSI will host the first Indian Congress of Mathematicians, showcasing contributions of Indian-origin mathematicians worldwide."," Fields medallist Manjul Bhargava says India must fall in love with mathematics again.

With the Indian Ports Bill, 2025, India is not just playing catch-up but laying the foundation to become a global maritime leader by 2047,” he said before the Bill was passed by a voice vote.Prior to the discussion on the Bill, the Oppn’s demand for a debate on SIR was rejected by Chair Sasmit Patra, on the grounds that the matter was sub-judice and not related to the listed business. Leader of the House J P Nadda accused the Opposition of having no interest in discussion and wasting over 69 hours of House’s time with its irresponsible behaviour.“The Opposition only believes in anarchism and obstruction,” said Nadda.Once the Opposition benches were empty, it was smooth sailing for the Indian Ports Bill. Almost all speakers — Mokaria Ram Bhai, Rekha Sharma, M Thambidurai, Sunetra Ajit Pawar, Praful Patel, B P Baishya, etc — emphasised the need to replace the archaic 1908 law with a modern piece of legislation that promotes port connectivity, environment-friendly port operations and adherence to international maritime norms.When Thambi Durai alleged movement of contraband through state govt-managed ports in Tamil Nadu, DMK MPs led by Tiruchi Siva, who had walked out earlier, stormed back into the House to counter him. This led BJP MP Ram Chander Jangra to cite violation of the rule that an MP should pay respect to the chair while entering and leaving the House. “This is not a saraay (guest house),” he complained.Sonowal, while replying to the debate, said that unlike the Congress regime that had no policy relating to ports and shipping, the Narendra Modi govt had in the past 11 years passed 11 laws in this sector.“In 2013-14, during the UPA regime, our cargo handling capacity was 5 million metric tonnes (MMT). In the last 10 years, it has gone up to 855 MMT,” he said.","The Rajya Sabha on Monday passed the Indian Ports Bill, 2025.

To this, CJI Gavai asked, ""To what extent does the SC have the competence to go beyond legislation enacted by states for selection of DGPs?

Husband taking part in selection of AMU's 1st woman VC not proper: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/husband-taking-part-in-selection-of-amus-1st-woman-vc-not-proper-sc/articleshow/123375855.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday made adverse comments on the selection process that led to the appointment of Naima Khatoon as the first woman vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), saying the participation of her husband Mohd Gulrez, the officiating vice-chancellor, in the process was not proper.A bench of CJI Bhushan R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria said, ""Certainly, the husband's participation in the selection process is not proper when his wife is a candidate. He should have recused and made his deputy participate in it. The selection process should not only be fair but also appear to be fair"".The remarks came on appeals filed against a judgment of Allahabad HC, which too had disapproved of the participation of Khatoon's husband in the selection process, but upheld her selection by the President, who is the visitor of the university, as the vice-chancellor of AMU.Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal explained how voting in the executive council was tailored to insert Khatoon's name into the panel of five names - Faizan Mustafa, Qayyum Husain, Muzaffar Uruj Rabbani and Furqan Qamar were the other candidates - for the purpose. When these names were placed before the AMU Court (Senate), Rabbani got 61 votes, Mustafa, 50 votes, and Khatoon, 50 votes. These three names were sent to the President of India, who chose Khatoon as VC, and she was appointed to the post in Apr last year.Despite the CJI's adverse comments, the court adjourned the hearing as Justice Chandran recused himself, on the ground that as chancellor he had recommended the appointment of Faizan Mustafa as the VC of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Justice Chandran need not recuse himself as the parties had full faith in him. He held that Gulrez's participation in the selection process did not affect the sanctity of Prof Khatoon's appointment as AMU VC as her name was included in the panel of three names by the AMU Court.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the bench that the selection process had followed the rules and regulations scrupulously and that the high court, after examining the allegations, had upheld her appointment as the AMU vice-chancellor.Sibal said he had no issues with the Visitor's choice, but if the allegations of manipulation were examined and found true, then Khatoon's name would not have figured on the list of five names forwarded to the AMU court by the executive council.",Naima Khatoon is the first woman vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University. Supreme Court made adverse comments on the selection process. Court said participation of her husband Mohd Gulrez in the process was not proper.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop.She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital.

Intent to drive a person to death must for abetment conviction: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intent-to-drive-a-person-to-death-must-for-abetment-conviction-sc/articleshow/123375600.cms,"New DELHI: A person cannot be accused of abetment of suicide if there is no conscious deliberate intention on their part to drive another person to suicidal death, no matter how harsh or severe the harassment they meted out, the Supreme Court said on Monday while upholding Bombay high court's decision to quash the abetment of suicide case over the death by suicide of former MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli constituency Mohan Delkar.Delkar, a seven-time MP, died by suicide on Feb 22, 2021, leaving behind a suicide note which named persons, both in the administration and police, who he said had conspired to defame, degrade and demean him, to end his political career and ruin his social standing.But a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said the court could not place absolute reliance on the suicide note to initiate the proceedings in absence of any other evidence. The court noted that police had still not grasped what constitutes abetment of suicide despite a slew of SC verdicts and ""FIRs are registered, investigation carried out and for reason of abject ignorance or on tainted instigation or at times deliberate design, the alleged perpetrator is even taken into custody without examining the existence of mens rea (intention of accused)"".Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Chandran said that merely because the victim was continuously harassed and at one point, they succumbed to the extreme act of taking their life cannot by itself result in finding positive instigation that constitutes abetment and mens rea cannot be gleaned merely by what goes on in the mind of the victim.""True, a person unable to bear the pressure or withstand a humiliation or unable to oppose, may succumb to the extreme act of ending his own life, in desperation; but that would not necessarily mean that the alleged perpetrator had an intention to lead the victim to eventual death by his own or her own hands,"" the bench said.It said many people stand up, some fight back, a few run away in the face of adversity and certain people crumble and, at times, take the extreme step of suicide. ""To put the blame on the pressure imposed and the person responsible for it, at all times, without something more to clearly discern an intention, would not be the proper application of the penal provisions under Section 306 (abetment),"" the court said.""The victim may have felt that there was no alternative or option, but to take his life, because of what another person did or said; which cannot lead to a finding of mens rea and resultant abetment on that other person. What constitutes mens rea is the intention and purpose of the alleged perpetrator as discernible from the conscious acts or words and the attendant circumstances, which in all probability could lead to such an end. The real intention of the accused and whether he intended by his action to at least possibly drive the victim to suicide, is the sure test. Did the thought of goading the victim to suicide occur in the mind of the accused or whether it can be inferred from the facts and circumstances arising in the case, as the true test of mens rea would depend on the facts of each case,"" it said.","Mohan Delkar, a seven-time MP, died by suicide on Feb 22, 2021. He left behind a suicide note which named persons, both in the administration and police.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing EC-opposition clash, INDIA bloc on Monday floated the possibility of moving for impeachment of chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, whom it accused of acting like a ""BJP spokesman"" and intimidating opposition parties. It said Election Commission is no longer capable of ensuring a level playing field and, instead, is led by officers who thwart any attempt at probing voter fraud.While the proposal to move for Kumar's removal was discussed briefly in a coordination meeting of opposition parties and is not final, the INDIA bloc chose to amplify it by confirming that the impeachment notice was brainstormed by the allies and drew wide consensus. ""We have all the parliamentary, legal options before us, and we will use them. There has been an erosion of faith in the EC,"" RJD MP Manoj Jha said.Lok Sabha dy LOP Gaurav Gogoi said, ""The impeachment was discussed with large backing from leaders.

When it was suggested that impeachment was the only option for his removal, there was support for the proposal.Sources said the impeachment talk at present is just a ""threat"" but may be considered again in future. That impeachment is even being discussed marks a major escalation in the already vitiating relationship between the CEC and the opposition.

Addressed by Gogoi, Jha, Tiruchi Siva (DMK), Naseer Hussain (Cong), Mahua Moitra (TMC), Arvind Sawant (Shiv ena), Sanjay Singh (AAP) among others, the opposition said the CEC failed to clarify on the Supreme Court's order of August 14 which ""rejected all the EC's arguments seeking to prevent the release of basic data of the 65 lakh voters deleted in Bihar"" and directed the EC to publish their names and the reasons for their deletion. It said the CEC had also not clarified on why it embarked on a hasty SIR in Bihar and gave no clarification on Rahul Gandhi's allegations about voter fraud in Mahadevapura in Bengaluru.Though AAP has disengaged itself from INDIA bloc, its representative Sanjay Singh addressed the presser.Slamming the SIR, Mahua Moitra said, ""Is the list on which the 2024 Lok Sabha election was done fraudulent?

'Historic': Indian Military's First Women Cadets Battle Ready; 'Doors Now Open'

It will be difficult to accommodate injured cadets within force: ASG to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said on Monday that defence services cadets who are not inducted into the force because of injury during training should not be left high and dry as it would dishearten people joining the forces and favoured that the govt extend a helping hand bearing their medical expenditure and also rehabilitating them in other jobs. The apex court took suo motu cognisance and issued notice to the Centre and chiefs of Army, Navy, and Air Force seeking their response on how to help them out.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the govt should consider granting insurance cover to all cadets joining training so that financial assistance could be provided in case of injury or death during training. It also suggested that the injured cadets could be given desk jobs with the defence forces or they could be rehabilitated in alternative jobs after requisite training. It said helping such injured cadets is an act of social justice and asked the govt to come up with a scheme by Sept 4.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Centre, submitted that she will have a discussion with the relevant authorities regarding the issue and come up with a solution on the next date of hearing. She, however, told the court that the military does not have non-combatant roles even for desk jobs and hinted that it would be difficult to accommodate injured cadets within the force.""During the discussion, this court pointed out whether there could be an increase in medical expenditure payable per month to the cadets. Whether there could be insurance coverage for the trainee cadets to beat any such contingencies of death or disablement.

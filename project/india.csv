Bihar assembly elections: Two more parties join Mahagathbandhan; seat-sharing deal to get complex?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-elections-two-more-parties-join-mahagathbandhan-seat-sharing-deal-to-get-complex/articleshow/123756184.cms,"PM Modi’s 'Kosi' Jibe at Opposition Ignites Bihar Election Heat During MP Flats Inauguration

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind.

‘Phulera-style governance in Delhi’: AAP hits out at Rekha Gupta; questions husband’s presence in official meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/phulera-style-governance-in-delhi-aap-hits-out-at-rekha-gupta-questions-husbands-presence-in-official-meetings/articleshow/123756059.cms,"Delhi CM Rekha Gupta with her husband Manish Gupta (Image: X/Saurabh_MLAgk)

Row Over Attack On Delhi CM Rekha Gupta, BJP Suspects Political Conspiracy By Rivals

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday hit out at Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, comparing her administration to the popular web series Panchayat. It alleged that the CM’s husband, Manish Gupta was being allowed to play an active role in government functioning.The party said the situation resembled the series, where the elected sarpanch serves largely as a figurehead while administrative work is handled by her husband.In a post on X, AAP questioned, “Is the government of Phulera's Panchayat currently running in Delhi?”AAP leader and former health minister Saurabh Bhardwaj also launched a scathing attack on Delhi CM.In a post on X, he said: ""Just as in Phulera's panchayat, where the woman sarpanch's husband acted as the sarpanch, today in Delhi, the CM's husband is sitting in official meetings.""Bhardwaj said the move was completely unconstitutional, adding that in the nation’s capital both democracy and the constitutional system were being mocked. He accused the BJP of indulging in the very dynastic politics for which it frequently criticises the Congress.“This is completely unconstitutional. In the nation’s capital, democracy and the constitutional system are being mocked. The BJP, which often attacks the Congress over dynastic politics, must answer whether this is not the same,” Bhardwaj wrote.He further questioned why a family member was being given such authority, asking: “Does the CM of the world’s largest party have no worker left whom she can trust? What is that work which only a family member can do?”The AAP leader asked what the reasons were for the chief minister to establish her husband’s authority. He further questioned why her husband was being made a part of the government’s administrative system in this way.He also posted photographs showing her husband seated beside the chief minister in official meetings.The criticism comes after photos of Manish Gupta attending official meetings appeared both on Rekha Gupta’s personal Instagram account and the official handle of the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO).The controversy has evoked comparisons with Panchayat, a web series by TVF on Amazon Prime set in the fictional village of Phulera, Uttar Pradesh.The show depicts Manju Devi (played by Neena Gupta) as the elected sarpanch, but it is her husband Brij Bhushan Dubey (played by Raghubir Yadav) who effectively handles all administrative responsibilities.","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday hit out at Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta.

While India has some tariffs, the U.S. has a trade surplus with it in services. US also continues to import certain commodities from Russia which is hypocritical.”On X, Community Notes are written by contributors to add context to posts that may be misleading. When enough contributors with differing perspectives rate a note as useful, it is made visible to the public.Navarro has repeatedly attacked India over its trade ties with Russia, accusing it of profiting from the war and undermining peace efforts. India has dismissed his remarks as misleading and emphasized its commitment to advancing bilateral relations on the basis of mutual respect and shared interests.","White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said ""Indian special interests"" were trying to ""interfere"" in the US domestic dialogue with ""lies about India buying Russian oil"" This came after he slammed Elon Musk after his social media platform put up a fact-check note on Navarro's post regarding India's purchase of oil from Moscow.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123755965,imgsize-993047,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

MUMBAI: In one of the biggest drug seizures in the country this year, the Anti-Narcotics Cell and Crime Branch of the Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar police have busted a massive cartel operating through a chemical manufacturing factory in Telangana, seizing mephedrone (MD) worth an estimated Rs 12,000 crore.Mephedrone, also called “meow meow,” “meph,” “m-cat,” and “miaow,” is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy. According to sources, this is among the largest narcotics seizures in recent years.The probe began with the arrest of a 12 person including a foreign national and seizure of 100 grams of MD along with Rs 25 lakh in cash. Further interrogation revealed links to an interstate network engaged in large-scale production and supply of mephedrone. The investigation eventually led officers to Telangana, where the cartel was using a chemical factory as a cover for drug manufacturing.“In a bid to get to the roots of the factory, we infiltrated our men in the gang. After weeks of risky efforts, we were able to bust the cartel,” a senior officer said.The factory, located in the Cherlapally industrial area near Hyderabad and operating under the name Waghdevi Labs, appeared legitimate from the outside but was allegedly producing narcotics on a large scale.During the raid, police seized sophisticated chemical equipment, drug production units, and a massive cache of raw materials, including nearly 32,000 litres of precursor chemicals.The factory’s owner and chemical expert, Srinivas Valotty, along with associate Tanaji Pate, were taken into custody. In total, 12 persons have been arrested so far, including the foreign national caught in the initial operation.Police described the bust as a major blow to the narcotics supply chain across Maharashtra and other states. The factory has been sealed, and further raids are being conducted to trace the cartel’s wider distribution network.Commissioner of MBVV Niket Kaushik confirmed the drug seizure and said their investigation has led them to drug cartel to other states.","Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested the man who allegedly issued a bomb threat to the city’s traffic department. The accused, identified as Ashwin Kumar Supra (50), was traced and detained from Noida.Officials said Supra, originally a resident of Bihar, had sent the threat message using a mobile phone and SIM card, both of which have been seized by investigators.The accused is being brought to Mumbai for further questioning. Crime Branch officers said they are probing the motive behind the threat and whether others were involved in the incident.The arrest came after the Mumbai Traffic Police’s WhatsApp helpline received a threatening message on Thursday, claiming that 14 terrorists had entered the city with 400 kg of RDX planted in 34 vehicles. The message arrived on Thursday while police were preparing security arrangements for Anant Chaturdashi , the final day of the Ganesh festival, scheduled for Saturday.Also read: 'Lashkar-e-Jihadi' warns Mumbai police, 14 Pakistani terrorists cited The sender identified their organization as 'Lashkar-e-Jihadi' in the threatening message.

The police are taking maximum precautions due to the expected high footfall during the festival.More than 21,000 police personnel will be deployed across Mumbai to maintain law and order during the idol immersions. Lakhs of people are expected to participate in the immersion of Lord Ganesh idols in the sea, other water bodies, and artificial ponds on Saturday.The police are particularly vigilant as the threat coincides with Anant Chaturdashi, the 10th day of the Ganesh festival, when large crowds gather for the final immersion ceremonies.","Ashwin Kumar Supra, 50, was traced and detained from Noida.

Also See:





US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.The move covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday.

VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday directed that health officials take a serious note on continuous deaths in Turakapalem of Guntur district and declare a health emergency in the village. He ordered that all the people suffering with unexplained illness should be admitted to hospital.Naidu conducted a review meeting on death of around 20 people in Turakapalem village in the past two months with unknown disease. He said health camps should be conducted in the village on Saturday and Sunday and medical tests should be conducted to all and prepare health profile of everyone.He advised the health officials to take the assistance of AIIMS Mangalagiri and if necessary international medical experts. He directed the officials to supply protected drinking water in the village. He made it clear no new case should be reported hereafter.""Officials should be vigilant 24X7 as there is a high possibility for the spread of the suspected bacterial disease through drinking water, food items, and through air.Meanwhile, the state govt constituted a high-level committee, led by Director of Secondary Health (DSH) Dr A Siri, to identify the officials responsible for failing to apprise higher authorities in time about the sudden spike in deaths in Turakapalem village.The committee will also make recommendations on measures to ensure that health department officials are immediately informed in case of a large number of deaths due to any illness in any region of the state in the future. This was announced by Health Minister Y Satya Kumar Yadav on Friday during his visit to Turakapalem village.Stating that stern action would be taken against all those officials for their inaction in reporting the deaths to the health authorities, Satya Kumar Yadav warned that no official will be spared and appropriate action will be taken against all the officials once the probe report is submitted by the high-level committee, which was ordered to complete in a week's time.Speaking to reporters, Satya Kumar Yadav said it is unfortunate on the part of the healthcare personnel working at the field level that they did not apprise the higher officials despite 23 people dying in the past two months. He said that the mean age of the deceased is 55, while around seven deceased were aged above 70 years.Dismissing media reports linking Melioidosis as the reason behind the deaths, the health minister said that the blood test reports have not confirmed the Melioidosis bacteria and that chemical and biological tests are also being done to determine the exact cause.The minister toured Turakapalem village, visiting the victims' households, enquiring about their health condition, and consoling the bereaved family members, besides taking a first-hand review of the medical services being provided to the villagers at the special medical camp set up in the village.Meanwhile, Guntur DMHO Dr Vijaya Lakshmi informed that the blood culture test results of the blood samples collected from individuals showing fever symptoms will arrive on Saturday.",Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday directed that health officials take a serious note on continuous deaths in Turakapalem of Guntur district.

Carlos Alcaraz completed his post-match TV interviews after defeating Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the U.S. Open semifinals on Friday.Before beginning the interviews, Alcaraz paused to check his phone for updates on Jannik Sinner's semifinal match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, which was still in its first set.Sinner later secured his place in the final with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Auger-Aliassime. This set up a historic US Open final between No. 1 Sinner and No. 2 Alcaraz, marking the first time two players will face each other in three consecutive Grand Slam finals in one season.""These two players are the best in the world right now,"" said Djokovic, a 24-time major champion.The duo has dominated men's tennis, splitting the past eight major trophies and claiming 10 of the past 13. Alcaraz currently holds five Slam titles, while Sinner has four.The upcoming final will also determine the No. 1 ranking, with President Donald Trump expected to attend.The rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner has intensified throughout the year, with Alcaraz winning at the French Open in June and Sinner prevailing at Wimbledon in July.Sinner aims to become the first repeat men's champion in New York since Roger Federer's five consecutive victories from 2004 to 2008. He has reached five straight Grand Slam finals since his US Open appearance last year.Alcaraz has maintained a perfect record without dropping a set as he pursues his sixth major title and second at Flushing Meadows.Since April, Alcaraz has dominated with a 44-2 record, reaching finals in his last eight tour-level events.""It's something that I'm working on, just the consistency on the matches, on the tournaments, on the year, in general. Just not having up-and-downs in (a) match. Probably, I'm just getting mature, just getting to know myself much better, what I need on, off the court,"" the Spaniard said.Sinner's record against Alcaraz in 2024 stands at 1-6, while maintaining an impressive 109-4 record against all other opponents.""We have played quite a lot this year. So we know each other very well,"" Sinner said.Alcaraz had previously lost to Djokovic in their last two encounters - the Paris Olympics gold-medal final and the Australian Open quarterfinals. ""It's not easy playing against him, to be honest. I'm thinking about the legend; what he has achieved in his career. It's difficult not to think about it,"" Alcaraz added.Djokovic, at 38, showed signs of fatigue by the match's end. He reached semifinals in all four Slams this season but was eliminated each time, with three losses to either Alcaraz or Sinner.""It's frustrating on the court when you are not able to keep up with that level physically, but at the same time, it's something also expected, I guess. It comes with time and with age,"" the veteran admitted.""I still want to play ... (a) full Grand Slam season next year. Let's see whether that's going to happen or not, but ... Slams are Slams. They are just different from any other tournament. They are the pillars of our sport, the most important tournaments we have. But I do fancy my chances a bit more in best-of-three.""Despite leading 3-0 in the second set, Djokovic couldn't maintain his advantage against Alcaraz.""Today, I'd say, it wasn't the best level of the tournament for me, but I just kept a cool level (from) the beginning until the last point,"" he explained.Alcaraz appeared in a pink sleeveless shirt, sporting regrown hair after a recent buzz cut necessitated by his brother's failed attempt at being a barber.When asked about maintaining his new look if victorious on Sunday, Alcaraz responded: ""Even better. You will see. ... Surprise, surprise.""","Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the U.S. Open semifinals.

Taliban back upgrade in ties as India explores ministerial visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/taliban-back-upgrade-in-ties-as-india-explores-ministerial-visit/articleshow/123751546.cms,"MEA Spokesperson Says India Maintains Contact With Afghan Authorities Amid Taliban Rule

NEW DELHI: The Taliban have backed high-level engagement with India, amid efforts by the Indian government to host Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi despite the travel ban imposed on him by the UNSC. India remains in touch with the Taliban for an early visit by Muttaqi.The Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI there’s a need for both countries to upgrade and strengthen their ties.“For that, high level visits of the foreign ministers’ level is a need. It will pave the way for exploring various fields of cooperation including trade between the two countries,” said Shaheen, who this week urged the UN to give Afghanistan’s seat to the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate.India is likely to approach the UNSC with a request to waive the travel ban on Muttaqi to allow him to visit the country, once the dates for the visit are finalised.The Afghan media had reported late last month that the visit was called off after the Security Council denied him waiver. However, it’s learnt that while dates were discussed for a visit by Muttaqi in August last week, these eventually didn’t work out.TOI had reported on August 28 that Muttaqi was likely to travel to India soon, for what would be the first such high-level visit from Afghanistan to India since the Taliban took control of Kabul in August, 2021.India’s ties with the Taliban have improved dramatically in the past few years with the Taliban fully appreciating India’s continued humanitarian assistance, consistent with its historical relations and friendship with the Afghan people. India sent more humanitarian aid to Afghanistan last week after the country was hit by a 6.0 magnitude earthquake.With Taliban not wavering in its security guarantees to India, including assurances that it won’t allow Pakistan-based terror groups to use Afghanistan for anti-India activities, India believes it’s now time to further expand its footprint in the country, despite remaining in consonance with the international community on the issue of recognition.India had already upgraded its engagement with the Taliban as foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai this year and external affairs Jaishankar spoke to him twice. The visit by Muttaqi will still be a landmark event, as it will signal India’s intention to take the development partnership, which includes over 500 projects spread across the country in critical sectors, to the next level.","The Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI there’s a need for both countries to upgrade and strengthen their ties.

"Focus on trade, counterterrorism & Indo-Pacific as India-EU ramp up ties; high-level visits lined up to boost FTA talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/focus-on-trade-counterterrorism-indo-pacific-as-india-eu-ramp-up-ties-high-level-visits-lined-up-to-boost-fta-talks/articleshow/123751801.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the renewed push by both sides to scale up ties, the EU will unveil its vision for a new strategic agenda with India on September 17. And as both sides intensify efforts to finalise a game-changing free trade agreement (FTA) by the year-end, the 13th round of negotiations will be held this week in Delhi, followed by the next round in Brussels in October.The EU’s vision document - which is expected to reinforce strategic partnership in areas like technology, trade, mobility and defence and security - will be a precursor to the joint strategic agenda that will be formalised at the next India-EU summit here early next year. Ahead of the summit, a series of high-level engagements have been planned to boost cooperation in areas ranging from trade to counterterrorism and the Indo-Pacific.The FTA is also expected to be formally signed at the summit. As external affairs minister S Jaishankar said last week, the India-EU FTA can help stabilise the global economy. In PM Narendra Modi’s joint call with European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, both sides stressed immediate progress to achieve the agreement this year.The leaders had also discussed the Russia-Ukraine war with the EU saying India has an important role to play in bringing the war to an end.Unlike the Americans though, the EU is not looking to punish India for purchasing, or even “profiteering” from, Russian crude. Its main objective, as official sources said on condition of anonymity, is to prevent such products from reaching Europe. As Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul said last week, the purpose is to not allow Russia “detours” to slip in Russian refined crude products into Europe.On the FTA, while only 12 of the 24 chapters - including SMEs, transparency, dispute settlement and customs and trade facilitation - have been closed till now, both sides are confident a lot of ground will be covered in the next couple of rounds. To impart some urgency into the negotiations this week, European commissioners for trade and agriculture, Maroš Šefčovič and Christophe Hansen, will also visit India this week.“There has been progress in all rounds and now momentum is there to meet the year-end deadline,’’ said an official, adding there’s new thrust in the relationship and that India-EU ties are not determined by others.The next round of counterterrorism dialogue is also expected to take place again this week in Brussels. The meeting will address issues like cross-border and state sponsored terrorism, while intensifying counterterrorism cooperation through exchange of information and capacity building. India is expected to bring up the role of Pakistan-based The Resistance Front (TRF) in carrying out the Pahalgam terrorist attack. The EU political and security committee is also expected to visit India this week.Jaishankar is also expected to visit Brussels for the EU Indo-Pacific ministerial on November 20-21, the 4th such meeting since the EU launched its Indo-Pacific strategy in 2021.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas will also travel to India ahead of the India-EU summit. A meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC), an important forum for deepening cooperation in strategic technologies like reliable AI and semiconductors, is also scheduled for this fall. The meetings will focus on possible deliverables for the summit.","The EU will unveil its vision for a new strategic agenda with India on September 17.

""""I don't think we have anything to say sorry about at all. India has behaved with a great deal of maturity on all of this,"" Tharoor told ANI, noting that even past US administrations had ""encouraged"" New Delhi to buy Russian oil in order to ""stabilise global prices.""Tharoor's remarks came in response to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who claimed that ""India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry and eventually strike a deal with US President Donald Trump.""Countering Lutnick's claim, Tharoor pointed out that larger economies were more deeply tied to Moscow than India.""China buys more Russian oil and gas than we do. Turkey buys more Russian oil and gas than we do. Europe doesn't buy oil and gas, but they buy other Russian items, so they're putting more billions of dollars into Russia's kitty than we do. It seems bizarre that we are alone being singled out for allegedly financing the Russian war effort when others are doing far more than we are,"" he said.Calling it a ""mistake in American policy,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said such criticism of India was ""not warranted or justified.""""I think Mr Lutnick has to understand that we are a sovereign nation, just as they are. They can take their own sovereign decisions, we will take our own sovereign decisions,"" he added.Lutnick on Friday took a cue from Trump’s hardline tariff stance warning India to ""stop buying Russian oil, stop being a part of BRICS, and support the United States and the dollar or face a 50% tariff"" even likening India’s position to Canada’s retreat after economic pressure.""In a month or two months, I think India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry, and they're going to try to make a deal with Donald Trump and it will be on Donald Trump's desk how he wants to deal with Modi, and we leave that to him. That's why he's the president,"" Lutnick said.He also labelled India as ""the vowel between Russia and China"" in BRICS, saying, ""If that's who you want to be, go, be it... ....and let's see how long this lasts.""Lutnick's remarks came after Trump himself softened his tone on his social media post, calling India-US ties ""very special"" and affirming his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after the SCO summit in Tianjin.Trump said, ""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.""""But India and the United States have a very special relationship. There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Following Trump’s statement, PM Modi responded warmly on Saturday, saying he ""deeply appreciates and fully reciprocates President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.""Tharoor also urged caution over PM Modi’s warm response to Trump’s remarks on India-US ties saying, ""The Prime Minister was very quick to respond, and the foreign minister has also underscored the importance of the basic relationship that is a comprehensive global strategic partnership, which is still there. And that message is an important message for us to give. I don't think we can just completely forget either the 50% tariffs or the insults that have accompanied it from both the President and his staff. ""The Congress MP further warned that Trump's ""mercurial temperament"" and the ""real consequences"" of punitive tariffs demanded caution.""One can't just forget and forgive so quickly because there are real consequences that Indians are facing on the ground and those consequences need to be overcome,"" he added.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that India has ""nothing to say sorry about"" as it has acted with ""a great deal of maturity"" He also criticised the US for unfairly singling out New Delhi and pointing out that ""Europe is putting more billions of dollars into Russia's kitty than we do""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123749861,imgsize-39250,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

BHUBANESWAR: Police on Sunday served a notice to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), seeking details of its financial records and foreign contributions, in connection with a case registered earlier this year in Jharsuguda against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged “anti-national” remarks.Police said notice has been issued under section 94 of BNSS. The foundation director has been summoned by the police as well. Police have sought a range of documents, including year-wise foreign contributions since the foundation’s inception in 1991, details of bank accounts, authorized signatories, names and contacts of auditors, a copy of the FCRA license, and clarifications on specific donations.Jharsuguda police have specifically asked the foundation if it has brought foreign donations from controversial preacher Zakir Naik and the Chinese government.Additionally, an explanation has been sought regarding the alleged diversion of the PM relief fund during the UPA era. “Failure to comply with the notice could result in penal action under Section 210 of the BNSS,” a police officer said.An FIR had been lodged on February 7 against Gandhi in Jharsuguda after his speech at the inauguration of the new Congress headquarters in Delhi on January 15, where he accused the BJP and RSS of capturing national institutions and stated, “We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS, and the Indian State itself”.The complaint was filed by local BJP units and allied organizations, alleging that Gandhi's remarks incited subversive activities and undermined India's sovereignty.Inspector General (Northern Range) Himanshu Lal said, “Police are well within their scope to investigate the case. The case is progressing well”.This case is notable as it is one of the first high-profile cases under the BNSS, which replaced the Indian Penal Code in July 2024, marking a significant shift in legal proceedings related to national security and public order.","Odisha cops serve notice to Rajiv Foundation seeking foreign contribution details.

J&K police have not confirmed any numbers since the vandalism Friday afternoon.“No one has been formally arrested so far, but some people are being questioned,” PTI quoted a senior police officer as saying, adding that women allegedly involved will face legal action but minors will not be proceeded against.Authorities tightened security around the shrine, which houses a relic of Prophet Muhammad, after the plaque was vandalised and removed following Friday prayers. Police had checked phone videos and CCTV footage before picking up dozens. No fresh disturbances have been reported.NC said an open FIR was registered and accused the LG-led administration of heavy-handedness. “I’m deeply anguished to learn that nearly 30 people have been detained by police,” NC MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi said, calling the detentions “operational retribution” and warning against misrepresenting “an expression of collective hurt as anti-national”.He urged release of detainees and said the idea of India rests on respect for religious sentiment.NC president Farooq Abdullah called the installation of the Ashoka emblem a mistake. “There was no need to install the plaque. They put it up and people did not like it. When the Hazratbal shrine was constructed no board was placed there because it was dedicated to Allah and His Prophet,” he said. “We are peace-loving people and this shouldn’t have been done.”CM Omar Abdullah said Waqf Board should apologise, contending that the national emblem is for govt offices, not mosques.PDP, CPM and Peoples Conference demanded action against Waqf Board chairperson Darakhshan Andrabi, a BJP appointee, who had overseen the plaque’s placement Thursday as part of what she described as remodelling on Turkish lines.Opposition politicians called the plaque “provocative” and “blasphemous”, saying symbols are forbidden inside mosques. BJP said the defacement was an attempt to revive terrorism and separatism in J&K.BJP defended Andrabi’s role and alleged NC was exploiting the controversy. “This is an act of terrorism. Andrabi had every right to place the emblem. NC doesn’t like her and is using the emblem to create unrest in Kashmir Valley,” party spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.Andrabi demanded those who vandalised the plaque be booked under Public Safety Act.",National Conference (NC) put the figure at 30 and BJP’s Altaf Thakur said 26.

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

Poll Do you think the positive remarks between PM Modi and Trump will improve US-India relations? Yes, it will help strengthen ties No, tensions over tariffs remain

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday responded to US President Donald Trump ’s recent remarks describing him as a “great Prime Minister” and a “friend” amid tensions over tariff row. PM Modi said he “deeply appreciate and fully reciprocates” Trump’s sentiments.The remarks by the two leaders come at a time of strained bilateral ties, following Washington’s move to impose a 50% tariff on India.Reciprocating the sentiment, PM Modi wrote in a post on X: “Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties. India and the US have a very positive and forward-looking Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership.”Hours earlier, speaking to reporters at the Oval Office, Trump underlined the strength of the relationship. “I always will. I’ll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He’s a great Prime Minister. I’ll always be friends, but I just don’t like what he is doing at this particular moment.

Kejriwal dares PM Modi to impose 75% tariff on US imports to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwal-dares-pm-modi-to-impose-75-tariff-on-us-imports-to-india/articleshow/123747608.cms,"Kejriwal Demands PM Modi Hit Back at US With 75% Tariff on Cotton and Other Imports

RAJKOT: Aam Aadmi Party's convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""show some courage"" and impose 75 per cent tariff on imports from the US in response to its 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports.At a press conference here, Kejriwal claimed the Centre's decision to exempt 11 per cent duty on cotton imports from the US till December 31, 2025 would hurt the Indian cotton farmers. It will make the US farmers rich and Gujarat cultivators poor, he added.India currently has an import duty exemption for raw cotton until December 31 this year to support the textile industry and lower input costs.Kejriwal said, ""We demand from the prime minister to show courage, the whole country is standing behind you. America has imposed 50 per cent tariff on exports from India. You impose 75 per cent tariff on imports coming from America, the country is ready to bear it. Just impose it. Then see if Trump bows down or not.""He also demanded 11 per cent duty on cotton imported from the US, fixing Minimum Support Price and procurement of cotton at Rs 2,100 per 20 kg, as well as subsidy on fertilizers and seeds to help the Indian farmers.The former Delhi chief minister claimed USA's 50 per cent tariff on India has also affected diamond workers because the Modi government has ""fallen on its knees"" in front of President Donald Trump The Centre last month said its decision to extend the import duty exemption on cotton until December 31 will strengthen India's position in export markets, reviving orders for small and medium enterprises as well as export-oriented units.The move comes at a time when the steep 50 per cent tariffs imposed on Indian goods by the US come into effect, with America being the largest export market for the country's textile and apparel exports.Kejriwal was in Gujarat to attend 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' at Chotila in Surendranagar district, which was adjourned due to heavy rains.When Trump imposed 50 per cent tariff on India, Modi did not increase it in return but reduced it (on cotton imports from the US) by 11 per cent, Kejriwal said and questioned why the PM ""bowed down"" and became weak.India is the world's biggest market and people here stand behind Modi, the AAP leader pointed out.""The whole country is standing behind Modiji. He (Trump) imposed 50 per cent tariff, Modiji should have imposed 100 per cent tariff on cotton. Trump would have had to bow down. Trump is a coward, a timid person. He had to bow down to all countries that defied him. Shut down four American companies and they will be in trouble,"" he claimed.Due to India's policy decision to remove 11 per cent duty on cotton imported from the US, the produce of Indian farmers will not be sold when they take it to the market in October-November, Kejriwal said.""When cotton from the US will arrive (in India), farmers here will get less than Rs 900 in the market. This is what is happening with the farmers -- their (US) farmers are being made rich and the farmers of Gujarat are being made poor,"" he further claimed.The central government first removed this duty for 40 days - from August 19 to September 30. But now it has been extended and removed till December 31, Kejriwal said.""Now, farmers of our country have no way to sell their cotton. The farmer of our country has bought seeds and fertilizers by taking a loan, has paid money to (farm) labourers, now how will he repay the loan? He will have no option left except to commit suicide,"" the AAP convener claimed.He also questioned India's ""helplessness"" in front of America.""Under Trump's pressure, our central government forced farmers of the country to commit suicide, by removing the 11 per cent duty,"" he charged.The other countries on which Trump imposed tariffs responded strongly and the US president had to ""bow down"" and remove tariff, but India did not take any action, Kejriwal claimed.","Aam Aadmi Party's convener Arvind Kejriwal urges PM Narendra Modi to impose 75% tariff on imports from the US. He also demands 11% duty on cotton imported from the U.S., fixing Minimum Support Price and procurement of cotton at Rs 2,100 per 20 kg, as well as subsidy on fertilizers and seeds.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123747626,imgsize-1729663,width-400,resizemode-4/arvind-kejriwal.jpg"
"Pro-Khalistan outfits getting funds from Canada, its govt says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pro-khalistan-outfits-getting-funds-from-canada-its-govt-says/articleshow/123740696.cms,"From Charities To Crypto: Canadian Funds Fuel Khalistani Terror, Explosive Report Reveals Truth

Pro-Khalistan terror outfits like Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation are receiving financial support within Canada, according to the Canadian govt's official report 'Assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risks', which acknowledges that the extremist groups are resorting to ""violent means to establish an independent state within Punjab, India"".The report, however, said that the monetary support for the pro-Khalistan groups has now shrunk and is confined to small pockets of supporters. ""These groups previously had an extensive fundraising network in Canada but now appear to consist of smaller pockets of individuals with allegiance to the cause,"" it noted.Khalistani violent extremist groups have also been known to use networks to solicit donations from diaspora communities to raise and move funds, including through non-profit organisations,"" the Canadian govt's report noted. The acknowledgment of the use of violent means is in contrast to the description of their activities as ""democratic freedoms"" earlier.The report lists BKI and ISYF, along with Hamas and Hezbollah, in the ""politically motivated violent extremism"" category who have been able to generate funds in Canada.These groups, it said, used diverse funding methods to sustain their operations, including the abuse of the money services businesses and banking sectors; use of cryptocurrencies; state financing; abuse of the charitable and NPO sector; and criminal activity.The report covers all violent groups on how they were able to sustain themselves by finding resources within Canada. Self-financing methods were observed in two prominent terrorist attacks in Canada conducted by lone actors radicalised by ideologically motivated violent extremism.It cited the 2020 incident of a 17-year-old male radicalised by the incel (involuntary celibacy) movement who killed a woman and injured another at a massage parlour in Toronto, using only a sword to conduct the attack. Another case cited was from 2021, in which four members of a Muslim family were killed when an individual drove a pickup truck onto a pedestrian crosswalk in London, Ontario. In 2024, the individual was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder and attempted murder amounting to terrorism.The report also mentions Canada's financial sector may be exposed to risks emanating from correspondent banking relationships with institutions known or suspected of servicing Hezbollah or Hamas.Cross-border networks and organised IMVE groups differ from lone actors in their financing, it noted. ""Organised groups often rely on online communities and cross-border networks to raise funds and have been observed to rely on a host of financing methods, including commercial activities, such as merchandise sales; hosting paid events, such as talks and concerts; crowdfunding; charging membership fees; and accepting donations,"" it said. ""Some groups have also been known to engage in drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and theft to fund their operations,"" the report added.","Pro-Khalistan terror outfits like Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation are receiving financial support within Canada.

‘Crap Note’: Navarro Slams Musk After His X Post On India’s Russian Oil Purchases Gets Fact-Checked

Navarro targets India on oil trade



X's fact-check pushback



The US runs a trade surplus with India in services.

The US itself continues to import billions in Russian goods, including uranium, despite its criticism of India, exposing what they called a ""clear double standard.""

India did not breach international law with its sovereign decisions on energy imports.

Navarro hits back — and blasts Musk



Tariff war strains ties



PM Modi's measured response



US President Donald Trump's senior trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has renewed his attacks on India, accusing New Delhi of profiteering from Russian oil imports, only to be publicly fact-checked by X, which flagged his claims as misleading and ""hypocritical. ""The episode is the latest flare-up in Washington's tense trade and foreign policy standoff with India, following Trump's decision to impose punitive secondary tariffs of over 50 per cent on Indian exports.In his latest post, Navarro accused India of driving Moscow's war machine by importing discounted Russian crude.""FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins,"" Navarro wrote in a late-night post.Navarro, a longtime hawk on global trade, has made India a frequent target in recent weeks, labeling the Russia-Ukraine war ""Modi's war"" and accusing New Delhi of running a ""laundromat for the Kremlin."" He has gone so far as to call Prime Minister Narendra Modi the ""Maharaj of tariffs"" and, in one controversial outburst, invoked caste to allege Indian refiners were ""Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people.But this time, Navarro's claims didn't go unchallenged. X appended multiple community notes under his post, correcting his assertions.The fact-checks stressed that India's Russian oil purchases are made for ""energy security"" and do not violate any international sanctions. They also highlighted that:""Navarro's claims are hypocritical,"" one note bluntly said.The Trump aide was quick to fire back, accusing Elon Musk of allowing ""propaganda"" into the platform's fact-check system.""Wow. @elonmusk is letting propaganda into people's posts. That crap note below is just that. Crap. India buys Russian oil solely to profiteer. It didn't buy any before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indian govt spin machine moving high tilt. Stop killing Ukrainians. Stop taking American jobs,"" Navarro wrote.The back-and-forth comes amid deteriorating India-US trade relations. Hours after Trump's new tariffs took effect, Navarro blamed New Delhi for fueling Russia's invasion and accused it of ""profiteering"" at the expense of the West.Recently, PM Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin, China. In widely circulated images, PM Modi was seen warmly greeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a moment that underscored the shifting balance as Trump tightened trade screws on India.Days later, Trump appeared to second-guess his own hard line. He initially claimed the US had ""lost India to China"" but quickly walked it back.""I don't think we have (lost India),"" Trump said. ""I've been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India — 50 per cent, a very high tariff. I get along very well with PM Modi, as you know. He was here a couple of months ago, in fact we went to the Rose Garden and had a press conference.""Trump added that India-US ties remain ""a very special relationship"" and stressed he and PM Modi would ""always be friends.""Responding to Trump's comments, PM Modi struck a conciliatory note.""Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,” he explained.","Rekha Ram Kalbelia, 55, from Rajasthan's Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.

'Let's reiterate commitment to spread Bhupen Da's message',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-reiterate-commitment-to-spread-bhupen-das-message/articleshow/123755138.cms,"Today, 8th September, is a very special day for all those who are passionate about Indian culture and music. It is particularly more special for my sisters and brothers of Assam. After all, it is the birth anniversary of Bhupen Hazarika, one of the most extraordinary voices India has ever known. As you are all aware, this year marks the beginning of his birth centenary celebrations. It is an occasion to revisit his monumental contributions to Indian artistic expression and public consciousness.What Bhupen Da gave us extends far beyond music. His works embodied emotions that transcended melody. More than just a voice, he was the heartbeat of the people. Generations have grown up listening to his songs, each word resonating with themes of kindness, social justice, unity and deep-rooted belonging.From Assam emerged a voice that flowed like a timeless river, crossing borders and cultures, carrying with it the spirit of humanity. Bhupen Da travelled the globe, rubbed shoulders with the who's who across all spectrums of society, but he remained deeply connected to his roots in Assam. The rich oral traditions, folk melodies and community storytelling practices of Assam deeply shaped his early childhood. These experiences formed the bedrock of his artistic vocabulary.He always carried the spirit of Assam's indigenous identity and the ethos of its people.Brilliance came to Bhupen Da at a very young age. At the age of just five, he sang at a public event and quickly caught the attention of none other than Lakshminath Bezbaruah, the pioneering figure of Assamese literature. By the time he was a teenager, he had recorded his first song. But music was only one part of his personality. Bhupen Da was as much an intellectual at heart... curious, articulate and driven by an insatiable desire to understand the world. Cultural legends like Jyoti Prasad Agarwala and Bishnu Prasad Rabha left a deep impression on his mind and also deepened his spirit of enquiry. It was also this desire to learn that made him excel at Cotton College, Banaras Hindu University and took him to the United States, where he interacted with leading academics, thinkers and musicians of those times. He met Paul Robeson, the legendary artist and civil rights leader. Robeson's song ""Ol' Man River"" became the inspiration for Bhupen Da's iconic composition 'Bistirno Parore.' The much-admired former American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt awarded him a Gold Medal for his performances of Indian folk music.Bhupen Da had the option of remaining in the US, but he returned to India and immersed himself in music. From radio to theatre, films to educational documentaries, he was well-versed in each of these media. Wherever he went, he emphasised supporting young talent. His works combined lyrical flair and also gave social messages, touching upon justice for the poor, rural development, strength of common citizens, to name a few. Through his music, he gave voice to the aspirations of boatmen, tea garden workers, women, farmers, etc. In addition to being nostalgic, Bhupen Da's works also became a powerful lens to view modernity. A lot of people, especially from the socially backward classes like him, derived strength and hope from his music.The spirit of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' found powerful expression in Bhupen Hazarika's life journey. His works transcended linguistic and regional boundaries to unite people across the country. He composed for films in Assamese, Bengali and Hindi. He made Assam visible and audible to the rest of India. It is no exaggeration to say that he helped shape the cultural identity of modern Assam, both for those within the state and for the Assamese diaspora across the globe.Bhupen Da, although not really a political person, did remain connected to the world of public service as well. In 1967, he was elected as an independent MLA from Nauboicha constituency in Assam, demonstrating how deeply his public persona was rooted in the people's trust. Though he never became a career politician, his passion for serving others was highly impactful.The people and Government of India have recognised his enormous contributions over the years. He was conferred with several awards, including the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Dadasaheb Phalke Award and more. In 2019, it was an honour for me personally and for the NDA government that the Bharat Ratna was conferred upon him during our tenure. People from across the world, especially those from Assam and the Northeast, expressed joy that this honour was conferred upon him. This honour celebrated the principles that Bhupen Da held dear to his heart - that music, when grounded in truth, can transcend all barriers. That a song can carry the weight of a people's dreams and move hearts across the world.I remember the time Bhupen Da passed away in 2011. I had seen on television how lakhs of people attended his funeral. Every eye was moist that time. Even in death, like in his illustrious life, he brought people together. It was thus fitting that he was cremated at the Jalukbari hillock overlooking the Brahmaputra, the very river that had been the lifeline of his music, metaphors and memories. It is gladdening that the Assam Government has supported the work of the Bhupen Hazarika Cultural Trust, which is working to popularise his life journey among youngsters.Bhupen Hazarika's life teaches us the power of empathy, of listening to people and of staying rooted. His songs continue to be sung by young and old alike. His music teaches us to be compassionate and courageous. It asks us to remember our rivers, our labourers, our tea workers, our Nari Shakti and our Yuva Shakti. It encourages us to believe in unity in diversity.Bharat is blessed to have Bhupen Hazarika. As we celebrate the beginning of his centenary year, let us reiterate our commitment to spreading his message far and wide. May it also inspire us to keep working to support music, art and culture, to encourage young talent and make India a nurturing ground for creativity and artistic excellence.It is only fitting that one of India's most significant infrastructure projects, the bridge connecting Dhola and Sadiya, bears the name of Bhupen Hazarika. Just as his songs connected hearts across regions, this bridge connects lands and people.The author is the Prime Minister of India",This year marks the beginning of Bhupen Hazarika's birth centenary celebrations. His works transcended linguistic and regional boundaries to unite people across the country. He made Assam visible and audible to the rest of India.

In a remark that could provide fresh ammunition to the opposition, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's wife Amruta Fadnavis on Wednesday said Hindi should be taught in schools, as it helps connect with people across the country.Her statement came three days after the BJP-led government withdrew a government resolution (GR) which introduced Hindi as a third language from Classes 1 to 5.""Marathi is number one (language) for Maharashtra, no doubt about it. To communicate at the global level, English is useful. But for connecting with people across the country, from North to South and East to West, I personally feel Hindi could be included in the curriculum,"" Amruta Fadnavis told reporters here.Students should have the freedom to choose from available language options, she said, adding, ""It will help in promoting inclusivity. Students should get options to learn (languages) and they can choose,"" she added.The Fadnavis government had initially announced in April that Hindi would be introduced as a third language from Class 1, triggering criticism from opposition parties who accused the BJP of trying to `impose' Hindi at the cost of Marathi.The government then said it was putting the decision on hold, but a fresh GR clarified that Hindi could still be taught as an optional third language.The move drew even stronger backlash, and opposition parties and groups such as the Marathi Abhyas Kendra mounted pressure on the government, forcing it to withdraw the two GRs and announce the formation of a committee to review the policy.",Amruta Fadnavis said Hindi should be taught in schools as it helps connect with people across the country.

Jaishankar Reveals US Role in India-Pak Ceasefire During Op Sindoor, Debunks Trump Trade Deal Claim

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday called out the West for not backing New Delhi's stance on terror, and reiterated that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was negotiated between the DGMOs of the two countries.At a press conference in Washington DC, Jaishankar said there are often countries that do not take a position when some other countries are victims of terrorism.""It is a fact that often countries do not take a position when some other countries are victims of terrorism, which they would do when they themselves are.

Did producer-director Sujoy Ghosh violate copyright?

NEW DELHI: Is there a ‘Sabak’ (lesson) in the film 'Kahani-2' for producer-director Sanjay Ghosh? The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to adjudicate Ghosh’s petition against criminal proceedings initiated against him in a Hazaribagh court by one Umesh Prasad Mehta, who accused Ghosh of lifting from his literary work “Sabak’.The entire case is a classic example of snail paced three-tiered justice delivery system in India – a simple question whether Ghosh has lifted from Umesh’s work ‘Sabak’ and used it in the script of his film “Kahani-2” has already consumed six years since the Hazaribagh magistrate found a prima facie case and issued summons to Ghosh in 2018. And there is no finality yet to the entire controversy.Ghosh challenged the magistrate’s order before the Jharkhand HC in 2018, and his plea was rejected by the HC only on Apr 22 this year, after nearly seven years. Arguing his appeal against the HC order, senior advocate Siddharth Dave told a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and R Mahadevan that the magistrate, without watching Kahani-2 film, has formed an erroneous prima facie opinion and issued summons to Ghosh.The bench said that it could be proved only in a trial whether the content of ‘Sabak’ has been plagiarised in the script of ‘Kahani-2’. However, it refused to stay the trial proceedings before the Hazaribagh court while exempting Ghosh’s personal appearance before the magistrate.Umesh had alleged that he had given the script of ‘Sabak’ to Ghosh for assistance in obtaining copyright over it. Ghosh later produced ‘Kahani-2” and after watching it at Hazaribagh, Umesh filed a complaint before the trial court alleging that “Ghosh has violated his copyright by committing theft of the script to produce ‘Kahani-2’ film”.The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hazaribagh, found a prima facie case for the offence punishable under Section 63 of Copyright Act, 1957 and issued summons to Ghosh.",The entire case is a classic example of snail paced three-tiered justice delivery system in India.

Isro is deeply appreciative of the partnership and camaraderie shown by our counterparts around the world.”Reiterating that the mission was conceptualised during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in 2023, Isro said the PM’s leadership continues to shape India’s future in space as one that is collaborative, confident, and committed to peaceful exploration.Ax-4 is expected to provide useful operational inputs for Isro’s Gaganyaan programme , particularly in areas such as astronaut health telemetry, crew-ground coordination, multi-agency integration, and experiment execution in space conditions.“These insights will directly influence mission planning, safety validation, and astronaut readiness for India’s first indigenous human spaceflight mission,” Isro said.Onboard the ISS, a set of Indian scientific experiments is being conducted as part of the Ax-04 mission. These cover life sciences, fluid dynamics, health monitoring, and Earth observation.“Redwire Space, US, is coordinating the payload integration activities. Redwire facilitated key steps, including technical validation and compliance with ISS payload requirements. Each experiment is packaged into flight-ready payload containers. Redwire is also supporting the development of hardware handling protocols, ensuring that the Indian experiments could be safely deployed and operated onboard ISS, thereby enabling meaningful scientific outcomes for India’s research community,” Isro said.Pointing out how the launch was rescheduled multiple times due to issues such as a harness problem in Dragon, weather in the ascent corridor, leakage in the Falcon-9 booster stage, and leakage in the Zvezda Module of the ISS, the space agency said: “The Isro delegation played a constructive role in resolving all the issues. It made its stand clear that all problems should be resolved before clearing the launch for lift-off, considering the mission risks and safety of the crew. ”The Indian astronauts —Shukla and his backup Group Captain Prashanth B Nair — have trained in spacecraft systems, microgravity operations, emergency protocols, space medicine, and experiment handling.

Can we control comps with just thoughts? Shubhanshu Shukla & crew may find out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-we-control-comps-with-just-thoughts-shubhanshu-shukla-crew-may-find-out/articleshow/122215910.cms,"Will aid people On Earth



Can human thought — unaided by muscle or speech — be used to control machines? That’s the bold question the Ax-4 crew, including Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, are probing at the International Space Station (ISS).Wearing a specialised headset that tracks blood flow in the brain, the astronauts participated in “PhotonGrav”, a European Space Agency (ESA) and Polish Space Agency (POLSA) experiment exploring whether brain signals alone could one day operate computers and spacecraft systems.The headset uses near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor attention levels and detect logical errors, capturing neural activity without any physical movement. If successful, this research could revolutionise how astronauts interact with onboard systems — especially in high-stress or hands-free conditions — by turning thought into action.While the crew kicked off the study on day four of their stay at the ISS, the project led by Slawosz Uznanski is expected to continue through their stint there. As space missions grow longer and more complex, projects like PhotonGrav could lay the groundwork for more seamless, intuitive interfaces — maybe even bringing science fiction a step closer to everyday use.While the experiment is being trialled in orbit, its real-world impact could be profound, as per ESA and Axiom Space. On Earth, the same brain-computer interface technology could power new assistive tools for people with mobility or communication challenges, and offer breakthroughs in neurorehabilitation.Shux, who had begun his research at ISS with myogenesis study, which could uncover how microgravity contributes to muscle loss before moving on to his microalgae study, continued the operations for myogenesis in the Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG) of the ISS.The study, by identifying the molecular pathways behind skeletal muscle dysfunction, could lead to targeted therapies to prevent atrophy during long-duration spaceflight. These insights may also translate to improved treatments for muscle-wasting conditions on Earth, including those linked to aging and immobility.“Finally, the crew documented activities for the Astronaut Mental Health study, contributing to research on cognitive well-being in space. This project can benefit others on Earth by developing remote technologies for diagnosing and treating mental disorders, particularly for individuals in isolated or challenging environments where access to mental health care is limited,” Axiom Space said.An ultrasound scan was conducted as part of the “Telemetric Health AI” study, which merges biometric data with mission analytics to better understand how spaceflight affects cardiovascular and balance systems. “Using advanced data science, the project aims to enable smarter, real-time health monitoring for astronauts with potential applications for remote health care on Earth,” Axiom said.","The Ax-4 crew, including Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, are probing at the International Space Station (ISS) Wearing a specialised headset that tracks blood flow in the brain, the astronauts participated in ‘PhotonGrav’, a European Space Agency and Polish Space Agency experiment.

Want to sound more confident, clear, and professional in your writing? Whether you're writing an academic paper, crafting a resume, or sending a simple message, grammar shapes the way others perceive your ideas. Start applying these small shifts in your writing, and you’ll notice a big difference in how confidently you communicate.These seven practical grammar techniques will help you write with precision, polish, and impact — without sounding robotic or overly formal.Active voice makes your writing direct and dynamic. Instead of focusing on what was donesomething, you highlight who’s doing the action. This creates clearer, more powerful sentences that keep the reader engaged.For example, instead of saying,tryIt’s shorter, sharper, and places the subject up front. While passive voice is sometimes useful — like when the doer is unknown — overusing it can make your writing feel weak or indirect.A common mistake in student writing is using long-winded phrases that don’t add value. Phrases likeorcan often be replaced with shorter, clearer alternatives.Instead of writing,tryBeing concise doesn’t mean losing meaning — it means getting to the point without wasting words.Modifiers are words or phrases that describe something, but if you place them in the wrong spot, your sentence can become confusing or even unintentionally funny.Take this sentence:This suggests the rain was walking to class. A clearer version would be:Always keep your modifiers close to the words they’re meant to describe.Parallelism is about maintaining consistent structure when listing items or ideas. It makes your writing smoother and easier to read. When a sentence has mismatched structures, it can feel clunky or awkward.For instance,breaks the flow. A more polished version would be:Keeping your lists grammatically aligned improves rhythm and clarity.The humble comma is one of the most misused punctuation marks. Use it to separate elements in a list, break up independent clauses joined by conjunctions, or add clarity to a sentence. However, placing a comma in the wrong place can lead to confusion or even change the meaning entirely.Compare these two:vs.The first invites Grandma to dinner; the second turns her into the meal. Learn the basic comma rules, and your writing will instantly become more readable.Instead of stacking up adjectives and adverbs, try using precise, strong verbs. Verbs carry the weight of action, and a well-chosen verb can eliminate the need for extra words.Rather than writing,sayOne word paints a clearer picture and improves the sentence’s rhythm. Good grammar isn’t just about correctness — it’s about choosing the most effective expression.Two of the most common grammar pitfalls are run-on sentences and sentence fragments. A run-on happens when two complete sentences are joined without proper punctuation or a conjunction, while a fragment lacks a subject or a verb.For example, a run-on might be:To fix it, you can say:On the other hand, a fragment might look like:It leaves the reader hanging. Complete it with:Clean sentence construction keeps your ideas clear and professional.",Use active voice for a stronger tone and avoid redundant phrases. Use parallel structure for flow and balance in your writing. Master the basic comma rules to make your writing more readable. Use strong verbs instead of adjectives to carry the weight of action.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122143112,imgsize-153922,width-400,resizemode-4/122143112.jpg"

Buddhists from across world wrote to Dalai over continuation of institution

KULLU: Ahead of his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama on Wednesday said the institution of the Dalai Lama would continue, and that Gaden Phodrang Trust, founded by him, has the sole authority to recognise the future reincarnation.In a message to China, which has been insisting that it would choose the successor, the 14th Dalai Lama said ""no one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter"".""When the time comes, His Holiness will reincarnate, and any adult or a person from any gender can be recognised as his reincarnation,"" said Samdhong Rinpoche, a member of the Trust, at a press conference in McLeodganj. ""It's not necessary that the next Dalai Lama will be from Tibet,"" Rinpoche said.A PTI report from Beijing quoted the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman rejecting this succession plan. At a media briefing, Mao Ning insisted any future heir to the Dalai Lama ""must follow the principles of domestic (Chinese) recognition - the 'Golden Urn' process - and approval by the central govt (Beijing) in line with Chinese religious traditions and laws"".In a recorded video statement shown on Wednesday, the first day of the three-day 15th Tibetan Religious Conference that started in McLeodganj, the 14th Dalai Lama said responsibility for choosing his successor rests exclusively with the members of the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit foundation established by him in 2015.Gaden Phodrang members should carry out the search for his successor in accordance with tradition, he said.""They (the members) should consult the various heads of Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. The members should carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition,"" said the Dalai Lama.The Dalai Lama recalled that he had asked, during a meeting with the heads of Tibetan spiritual traditions on Sept 24, 2011, whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue, and mentioned then that as far back as 1969 he had made it clear that the ""people concerned should decide whether the Dalai Lama's reincarnations should continue in the future"".""I also said during the meeting in 2011 that when I am about 90, I will consult the high lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, Tibetan public, and other concerned people who follow Tibetan Buddhism, to re-evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue,"" he said.The Dalai Lama also said that he has had no public discussions on this issue in the last 14 years. However, members of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile, members of the Central Tibetan Administration, NGOs, Buddhists from the Himalayan region, Mongolia, Buddhist republics of the Russian Federation, and Buddhists in Asia, including from mainland China, have written to him with reasons, earnestly requesting that the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue.""In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,"" said the Dalai Lama.Trust member Rinpoche said there wouldn't be any other message from the Dalai Lama regarding his successor in the coming days. ""Whatever instructions he will give now will be meant for the Gaden Phodrang Trust only.""It's not necessary that the Dalai Lama's reincarnation would be from Tibet only, he remarked. ""There are no restrictions or limitations of geographical boundaries when it comes to the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. In the past, the Dalai Lamas have taken birth in different countries,"" he said.In response to a question on the future of the Tibetan freedom movement, Penpa Tsering, head of the Tibetan govt-in-exile, said Tibetans would continue to follow the ""middle way policy"". ""It was proposed by the Dalai Lama and approved by a majority of Tibetans in 1996, and unanimously adopted by the Tibetan govt-in-exile. This policy cannot be changed by one person and will continue in future as well. There will have to be a referendum to change our policy,"" said Tsering.","The 14th Dalai Lama says responsibility for choosing his successor rests exclusively with the members of the Gaden Phodrang Trust.

MEA Gives Trump Reality Check On MEDIATING India-Pak Ceasefire | 'No Nuclear Angle Or Trade Threat'

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday voiced deep concern over the abduction of three of its nationals in Mali, a country grappling with a fresh wave of terrorist attacks.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said the Indian workers, employed at the Diamond Cement Factory in Kayes, were taken hostage during a coordinated armed assault on the factory premises on July 1.A day after the incident, India formally called upon the Mali government to take “all necessary measures” to ensure their “safe and expeditious” release.“The incident occurred on July 1, when a group of armed assailants carried out a coordinated attack at the factory premises and forcibly took three Indian nationals as hostages,” the MEA said.While no group has claimed responsibility for the abduction so far, Al-Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) claimed responsibility for multiple coordinated attacks across Mali on the same day.The Indian embassy in Bamako, according to the MEA, is in “close and constant” touch with local authorities, law enforcement agencies, and the management of Diamond Cement Factory. It is also in contact with the families of those kidnapped.“The government of India unequivocally condemns this deplorable act of violence and calls upon the government of the Republic of Mali to take all necessary measures to secure the safe and expeditious release of the abducted Indian nationals,” the MEA said in a statement.It added, “Senior officials of the ministry are closely monitoring the evolving situation and remain engaged at various levels to facilitate safe and early release of Indian nationals.”The government has also advised all Indian citizens currently residing in Mali to “exercise utmost caution, remain vigilant and stay in close contact with the embassy in Bamako for regular updates and necessary assistance.”The MEA reiterated that it “remains committed to ensuring the safe return of the abducted Indian nationals at the earliest” and will provide “all possible support” to them and their families.",India voiced deep concern over the abduction of three of its nationals in Mali.

It also urged all UN States to cooperate with “all relevant authorities” in this regard, without naming Pakistan or India.In his opening remarks at the meeting in Washington, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had said India expected Quad – a strategic grouping of leading maritime nations committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific – to understand and appreciate India’s right to defend its citizens from cross-border terrorism. This was the first Quad ministerial since the April 22 Pahalgam attack and the subsequent India-Pakistan conflict that ended with India’s bombing of Pakistan air bases.“We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen, while injuring several others,” said the Quad statement, expressing deepest condolences to the families of the victims.The UN Security Council (UNSC) statement condemning the attack in April seemed to have acted as a template for the Quad, the former having urged UN States to cooperate with all relevant authorities – without specifically mentioning India - in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSC resolutions. Like with the UNSC condemnation, there was also no mention of the perpetrator group – The Resistance Front (TRF) – in the Quad statement. As a non-permanent Council member, Pakistan had worked to water down the UNSC statement with support from Beijing.“We call for the perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay and urge all UN Member States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSCRs, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities in this regard,” added the Quad statement.Like in the past, the Quad ministerial unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism, renewing commitment to counterterrorism cooperation.Apart from India, Quad comprises the US, Australia and Japan, all of which had separately condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India, however, was keen that Quad do so in a joint statement for a more impactful response to Pakistan’s role in the attack and its support for cross-border terrorism.It was a fair expectation, given Quad’s strong condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the past too, like after the foreign ministers’ meeting in Tokyo last year in July. On that occasion, Quad had strongly condemned 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks, calling for bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice without delay, and naming UN-proscribed groups including Pakistan-based JeM and LeT for concerted action against them by the international community. There was no mention this time of any Pakistan terror group or the Mumbai and Pathankot attacks in the Quad statement.","The Quad foreign ministers strongly condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack in a joint statement.

He even offered her the post of the college union's general secretary - supposedly his ""final bait"" - before planning the alleged assault inside the campus security guard's room on June 25 with law students Zaib and Pramit.""Zaib and Pramit said that at least two days before the crime, Monojit informed them that the survivor would be on campus to submit an exam form.

He and Zaib also called several college seniors, some with political links, pleading for help.

Complainant drove rashly, broke rules before car toppled

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday said insurance companies are not bound to pay compensation to the kin of drivers who die due to their own mistake during daredevil stunts or on account of rash and negligent driving, in an extreme message to speed addicts and those who seek to hog eyeballs by performing stunts, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Justices P S Narasimha and R Mahadevan refused to give relief to the wife, son and parents of a man who died while driving a car at high speed in a rash and negligent act which ended with the vehicle toppling over.Dismissing the claim petition of his kin, who demanded Rs 80 lakh as compensation from United India Insurance Company, the bench said that family members cannot demand an insurance payout when death is caused due to a mistake on part of the deceased without involvement of any extraneous factors. The SC upheld the decision of Karnataka HC on Nov 23 last year rejecting their claim for compensation.On June 18, 2014, one N S Ravisha was driving a Fiat Linea from Mallasandra village to Arasikere town, with his father, sister and her children as co-passengers. He drove rashly and at a high speed and broke traffic rules before losing control of the vehicle near Mylanahalli gate, Arasikere. The car toppled over and rolled on the road.Ravisha succumbed to injuries sustained in the accident. His wife, son and parents claimed compensation of Rs 80 lakh on the grounds that he was a busy contractor earning Rs 3 lakh per month. The police filed a chargesheet claiming that the accident occurred because of Ravisha's rash and negligent driving. The Motor Accident Tribunal rejected the family's claim.Hearing an appeal, Karnataka HC rejected the claim of Ravisha's kin that the accident was caused due to a tyre burst and said, ""when a claim is made by legal representatives of the deceased, it has to be proved that the deceased was not himself responsible for the accident by his rash and negligent driving and it would also be necessary to prove that the deceased would be covered under the policy so as to make the insurance company liable to make payment to the legal heirs. "" The court added, ""In the instant case, admittedly the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the deceased himself and he being a self-tortfeasor, the legal heirs cannot claim any compensation for his death"".","Justices P S Narasimha and R Mahadevan refused to give relief to the wife, son and parents of a man who died while driving a car at high speed.

NEW DELHI: Consumption of protein rich food in India has inched up in over a decade but fat intake has risen at a faster pace. Latest data released Wednesday showed cereals continue to be the most important source of protein among the five major food groups.The data released by the statistics office showed an increasing trend in daily intake of protein by individuals in urban as well as rural India since 2009-10 and trend was evident in most major states. Rajasthan, Haryana, Maharashtra and UP, however, showed a marginal decline in average protein intake. In urban areas, daily per capita intake of protein rose from 58.8 gms 2009-10 to 63.4 gms per day in 2023-24, an increase of 8%, while in rural areas, it rose at a slower pace, from 59.3 gms a day in 2009-10 to 61.8 gms in 2023-24.Pulses consumption in rural areas rose marginally, while it dipped in urban centres. In both areas, egg, meat and fish consumption saw the steepest rise. In the case of fat intake, there is an unmistakable rising trend, with every major state showing an increase, according to the Nutritional Intake report released by the statistics ministry based on the Household Consumption Expenditure survey of 2022-23 and 2023-24.At the all-India level, the rise has been from 43.1 gms per person per day in 2009-10 for the rural population to 60.4 gms in 2023-24 and from 53.0 gms to 69.8 gms for the urban - a rise of more than 15 gms in both segments. All the major states show a rise in per capita per day intake of fat across rural and urban segments, the data showed.The data showed that cereals accounted for 46-47% of the share of protein in rural areas among the five major food groups, which include pulses, milk and milk products, eggs, meat and fish and other food category. In urban areas, it was about 39% for 2022-23 and 2023-24. The report showed that the contribution of cereals to protein intake has fallen by about 14% in rural India and nearly 12% in urban India from 2009-10. The fall in the share of cereals has been balanced by rise in the share of egg, fish and meat, other food and milk and milk products, the data showed.","Cereals continue to be the most important source of protein among the five major food groups.

EC yet to hear from oppn after Cong plea for 'urgent' meet

NEW DELHI: Netas of the INDIA bloc met the Election Commission on Wednesday to question the timing of the special intensive revision (SIR) of the Bihar electoral roll, saying it comes too close to the ensuing assembly poll. They also complained that EC's guidelines, including only those who are 'ordinarily resident' in a constituency, may affect migrants who form a significant part of the Bihar electorate.The opposition told EC that SIR could be ""disastrous"" as it could lead to the deletion of ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially those on the margins. Eleven opposition parties that met EC comprised Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, NCP-SP, Shiv Sena (UBT), CPI(M), CPI and CPI(ML) Liberation.Congress had approached the Election Commission on June 30 seeking an ""urgent"" meeting ""any time after 4 pm on July 2"" between the poll panel and a delegation comprising 10 opposition parties to discuss the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of rolls in Bihar. However, EC, despite promptly writing back to each of the 10 parties to indicate availability of their representatives at 5 pm on July 2, is yet to hear from them.EC sources said the ""July 2"" meeting with the multi-party opposition delegation thus stood deferred as no confirmations were received.Sources told TOI that while the mail received from a legal counsel of the All India Congress Committee for the multi-party delegation's appointment with EC was unilateral - with no similar email received from the remaining nine parties or the AICC mail marked to them - the panel in its response sent the same day to each party - Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, NCP, JMM, CPI, CPM and CPI(ML) Liberation - welcoming their request and seeking their confirmations for a meeting at 5 pm on July 2. However, not one of the parties, Congress included, had responded to EC's mail till late Tuesday, said EC sources.Even so, a TMC delegation met EC on Tuesday as part of its consultation with parties on all poll-related issues.","EC yet to hear from oppn after Cong plea for 'urgent' meet on July 2.

We have faith in our Baba Amarnath-ji and the forces.” Ram Prasad, another UP devotee, said terrorist threats will never shake their spiritual resolve.J&K deputy CM Surinder Choudhary welcomed pilgrims at Banihal and raised the political pitch by expressing hope that “the next Amarnath Yatra would take place in a full-fledged state”. He claimed LG Sinha performed a special puja praying for the restoration of statehood — though BJP did not immediately comment.At Baltal base camp, BJP spokesperson and J&K Waqf Board chairperson Darakhshan Andrabi reviewed facilities and met officials and service providers. “The yatra is a powerful symbol of communal harmony in Kashmir,” she said. “It represents Hindu-Muslim unity, and we are all committed to strengthening that bond.”","The pilgrimage, running from July 3 to Aug 9, is taking place amid heightened security following the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26, mostly tourists.

Hafiz plotting India attacks using Bangladesh as launchpad: Intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hafiz-plotting-india-attacks-using-bangladesh-as-launchpad-intel/articleshow/125212841.cms,"Hafiz Saeed

NEW DELHI: Alarming new intelligence suggests that Pakistan-based terrorists, led by designated global terrorist Hafiz Saeed, are actively plotting to open new fronts for attacks on India, with Bangladesh being cultivated as a new launchpad.The revelation comes directly from a video recording of a rally held in Khairpur Tamewali, Pakistan, on Oct 30, where senior LeT commander Saifullah Saif made a dangerous disclosure. Saifullah explicitly said that “Hafiz Saeed was not sitting idle; he was preparing to attack India through Bangladesh”.He claimed that Laskar-e-Taiba operatives were already active in “East Pakistan (ie Bangladesh)” and were prepared to “answer India (for Operation Sindoor)”.Further information indicates that Saeed has dispatched a close associate to Bangladesh to radicalise local youth under the pretext of ‘jihad’ and provide them with terrorist training.The video also shows Saif openly instigating people to wage war against India. Disturbingly, the event was attended by children, clearly demonstrating that terrorist organisations are attempting to exploit and indoctrinate minors for the purpose of ‘jihad’ against India.The inflammatory rhetoric and visible presence of children highlight the profound threat of radicalisation being orchestrated from Pakistani soil.Adding a geopolitical dimension to his dangerous claims, Saif also falsely praised the Pakistani military, mentioning an alleged response after what he termed “India’s Operation Sindoor” on the night of May 9-10.He further claimed a shift in international alignments, saying, “Now, America is with us, and Bangladesh is also getting closer to Pakistan again.” These claims of shifting alliances appeared intended to boost morale among the attendees while confirming the concerted efforts by LeT to activate and utilise a new operational theatre right on India’s eastern border.Security agencies are now on alert regarding this new, complex threat emanating from the Bangladesh-Pakistan nexus, sources said. Surveillance has been intensified on infiltration from Bangladesh.","Alarming new intelligence suggests that Pakistan-based terrorists are actively plotting to open new fronts for attacks on India.

DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday sharply reacted to defence minister Rajnath Singh ’s remarks accusing chief adviser Muhammad Yunus of making provocative statements, saying they were “incorrect” and “not respectful of propriety and diplomatic nicety”.During an interview, Singh was asked about Yunus’s recent “provocative statements” and gifting a book to a senior Pakistani military official that showed “some areas of northeast India as part of Bangladesh”. “It is very unfortunate.

Rainmakers at work: Decoding the hope and hype of cloud seeding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rainmakers-at-work-decoding-the-hope-and-hype-of-cloud-seeding/articleshow/125211967.cms,".

Delhi’s ₹3.2 Crore Cloud Seeding Mission Falls Flat, Experts Cite Low Moisture and Weak Clouds

In Hindu mythology, mortals prayed and performed elaborate rituals to please Indra, the god of rain. Legend has it that musician Tansen's melodious voice could summon showers from cloudless skies. Ordinary mortals, however, have neither the Ashvamedha yagna nor Tansen's tenor. In modern India, a new kind of rainmaker relies on science, not song to coax moisture from the sky. While Dilliwalas' hopes of a downpour may have dried up after this week's failed experiment, this handful of rainmakers remain convinced that the science of cloud seeding works - when used the right way.Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification that involves dispersing particles like silver iodide or calcium chloride into moisture-bearing clouds to stimulate rainfall. Research has shown that it can enhance rain by 18-46% and help prevent drought, water scarcity and related problems. It has been used with varying degrees of success across the world, particularly in China and the US. In India, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, has conducted cloud seeding experiments and research since the 1970s, but it was only in 2003 that states began on-ground experiments in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for rain enhancement.This is the first time cloud seeding has been used to tackle pollution.Bengaluru-based Agni Aero Sports Adventure Academy has worked with Maharashtra, Andhra and Rajasthan for rain enhancement since 2003. Its founder Arvind Sharma, a trained microlight aviator, says the Delhi experiment may have done more harm than good. ""Cloud seeding cannot create rain. It can enhance rain under specific weather conditions including cloud formation and moisture. It is no surprise that the project has failed,"" he says.Helmed by Sharma, the company has run projects in rain-shadow areas of Andhra and Maharashtra that come with their own set of challenges. ""Pilots are trained to stay away from turbulence to protect passengers and the craft. In cloud seeding, we not only go seeking turbulence but also go right into the clouds,"" Sharma says, explaining how the plane needs to be at close range to inject the clouds with the chemical.Prakash Koliwad, founder of Kyathi Climate, which has run projects with IITM Pune and worked on several missions in Maharashtra and Karnataka between 2015 and 2019, says there has been 30 years of research in the field, establishing it as sound science. He argues that if used well, it is not as exorbitant as it is being made out to be. ""The Maharashtra govt spends Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in drought relief every year and must combat problems like farmer distress and suicide. If they spend 0.1-0.2% of that amount at the beginning of the monsoon season to enhance rainfall, they will no longer have to face angry farmers or distress,"" he says.So why has this technique not become more popular? Suman Akkaraju, CEO of Siri Aviations, attributes it to lack of awareness. ""Cloud seeding is still viewed as an experimental approach by many. Awareness, regulatory clearances, and public understanding take time. But with more proven outcomes and better data, adoption is slowly increasing.""The Delhi govt is reported to have spent Rs 65 lakh a day, while projects that run for several months can cost Rs 30-40 crore. A more cost-effective method was recently deployed by Rajasthan, billed as India's first drone-based cloud seeding. However, that too, has a patchy track record. In Aug-Sept this year, the govt used drones to create artificial rain to revive Ramgarh lake with no success.Though a bit of a damp (or dry) squib in India, the technology has found favour abroad. The first pioneering attempt was documented by Vincent Schaefer in 1946, who used dry ice to increase snowfall. The US has used cloud seeding in mountainous areas since the 1950s to increase snowfall and even deployed it in Operation Popeye, a secret five-year US military programme during the Vietnam War, meant to lengthen the monsoon season and disrupt enemy movement. Cloud seeding was also used at the 1980 Moscow and 2008 Beijing Olympics, though it wasn't to make it rain but to prevent it. It was reportedly used even at the 2012 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. China and UAE have invested heavily to tackle drought.Back home, environmental experts have dismissed the cloud seeding exercise as ""theatrics"" that fail to address the root causes of air pollution. Gufran Beig, of the National Institute of Advanced Studies and founder-director of SAFAR, says cloud seeding is a highly specialised scientific project that must be executed with care. ""Even in the most favourable conditions, the probability of success is 50-60%, which is before and post-monsoon season. The probability at this time of year goes down to 10%,"" he says.","Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification.

Experts: Deaths due to chronic diseases can be prevented,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-deaths-due-to-chronic-diseases-can-be-prevented/articleshow/125211894.cms,".

Chronic diseases account for nearly three-fourths of all global deaths. Experts say many of these deaths can be prevented, with lifestyle changes, timely diagnosis and management, and in many cases, preventive vaccination.While childhood vaccination has increased significantly, experts say, there are still few takers for adult vaccination.According to Lauriane Harrington, medical director, global medical affairs of GSK - one of the world's leading biopharma companies - vaccines are available to prevent diseases like influenza, RSV, shingles and pneumococcal pneumonia but their uptake is low.RSV or Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms. However, Harrington said, it can lead to serious lung infections, especially in infants and older adults, whereas shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful condition caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox.""Prevention is the best investment - for people, health systems, societies, and economies,"" Kristina Ostertag, head of global communications and govt affairs, commercial vaccines at GSK, added.She was speaking at GSK's Global Media Days at Wavre site in Belgium.""Vaccination is one of the most effective tools we have to protect older adults, yet adult immunisation remains under-prioritised,"" Otavio Cintra, regional medical affairs Lead at GSK, said.He added that govts and health systems needed to integrate adult vaccination into broader public health strategies. GSK, he said, is also investing in next-generation vaccine technologies, including mRNA and MAPS platforms, to address evolving health threats.","Vaccines are available to prevent diseases like influenza, RSV, shingles and pneumococcal pneumonia but uptake is low.

Bengal's first World Cup-winning cricketer Richa Ghosh received multiple honors at Eden Gardens on Saturday. The ceremony brought together cricket legends Sourav Ganguly, Jhulan Goswami , and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batter from Siliguri received the Banga Bhushan award and was appointed Deputy Superintendent of Police. The West Bengal government also presented her with a gold chain.The Cricket Association of Bengal awarded her Rs 34 lakh, calculated at Rs 1 lakh for each run she scored in the final match.""The World Cup triumph is a special, special win and only Richa can tell us what that feels like.

JNU Clash: Student Union President Among 28 Detained, 6 Cops Injured During Protest Against ABVP





NEW DELHI: In a decisive victory, the Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday, with Aditi Mishra of AISA becoming the university's first woman president since Aishe Ghosh in 2019. The results mark a strong comeback for the Left, which had lost one post to ABVP in the delayed 2024-25 polls this April.Mishra, a PhD student from Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory, secured 1,937 votes, defeating ABVP's Vikas Patel, who polled 1,488 votes. The margin of 449 votes is up from 272 recorded in the April poll.The presidential candidate of Progressive Students' Association (PSA), Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, who gained traction among voters with her fiery presidential speech targeting both left and right politics on the campus, took away 1,276 votes while NSUI trailed with 419 votes.In the vice-presidential race, Left's K Gopika Babu from SFI registered the highest tally across all posts, winning by a massive margin of 1,314, up from 34 in the April poll. She secured 3,101 votes while ABVP's Tanya Kumari got 1,787 and NSUI's Shaikh Shahnawaz Alam 370.For the post of general secretary, Left's Sunil Yadav from DSF won by 104 votes, a little dip from April's 114, polling 2,005 votes against ABVP's Rajeshwar Kant Dubey's 1,901.The joint secretary's post was also clinched by Left, with Danish Ali securing 2,083 votes and defeating ABVP's Anuj Damra (1,797) by a margin of 286 votes. In the previous poll, ABVP had bagged this post with a margin of 45.This year's election saw 20 candidates in the fray for the four central panel posts, including six woman candidates, reflecting an increase in women's participation in the campus politics.During the early rounds of counting, when about 4,300 votes were tallied, ABVP was leading on two seats — general secretary and joint secretary. However, once votes from School of Social Sciences and School of Languages were opened, Left secured the lead on all posts. Both these centres have historically voted overwhelmingly for Left candidates.The day-long counting unfolded amid high-decibel sloganeering, drum beats and bursts of celebration as each round was declared. Late at night, tensions briefly flared when a group of students carrying Palestine flags clashed with ABVP supporters. Students alleged that ABVP members tore a flag while ABVP denied the charge, claiming the group had raised anti-govt slogans.Observers say the results reaffirm the united Left's dominance on the campus. The outcome also signals that while new entrants like PSA have injected energy into the campus discourse, the traditional Left remains the primary force shaping student politics at JNU, they add.",The Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday.

Hundreds of cops resign ahead of Zohran Mamdani’s term in NYC: ‘How do you work for a mayor who wants to defund police?’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-cops-resign-ahead-of-zohran-mamdanis-term-in-nyc-how-do-you-work-for-a-mayor-who-wants-to-defund-police/articleshow/125193007.cms,"‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED

Workforce in numbers







New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop asked.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police?

What is the Green Card lottery?









The US State Department announced that they are implementing certain changes to the Green Card lottery, also known as the Diversity Visa entry process. ""We will announce the start date for the DV-2027 registration period as soon as practicable, as well as the date that DV-2027 selection results may become available through the Entry Status Check (ESC). These changes will not affect the visa application period for individuals selected for DV-2027, which will remain October 1, 2026, to September 30, 2027,"" the department said.Owing to these changes, the lottery has been delayed. The department said that they are aware that there are some fraudulent claims that DV-2027 is open.""The Diversity Visa (DV) 2027 entry registration period is not open at this time. We are aware of reports of fraudulent claims that DV-2027 entry is open and of individuals and services falsely claiming they can increase your chances of selection. This is not true. DV-2027 registration dates and details about changes to this year's process will be announced by the Department of State when available,"" the department said.This program offers thousands of individuals from countries with historically low US immigration rates a chance to obtain permanent residency. The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program was established by Congress in 1990 and signed into law by former President George H.W.Bush. It is limited to 55,000 visas annually. Applicants must meet statutory eligibility requirements, including a high school education or two years of qualifying work experience, among other criteria.The DV Program’s 2026 cycle excluded applicants from the following countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China (mainland and Hong Kong), Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Venezuela and Vietnam.",US State Department said they will announce the changes to Green Card lottery 2027 and the registration has not yet begun.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.

Chennai: At least 136 MBBS seats in the state, including 22 in govt medical colleges and nine seats in AIIMS-Madurai, were vacant after three rounds of counselling by Centre's medical counselling committee, as students who were allotted seats did not join the respective institutions. The committee has said that 802 MBBS seats across India are vacant.""These seats are in the seat matrix for the stray round. They are likely to be filled as the penalty for not joining the seats allotted in the stray round is higher,"" said a senior official of the counselling committee. The committee holds online counselling for admissions to Central medical institutions, 15% all India quota seats in state-run medical colleges and deemed universities. Seats are allotted based on merit. Yet, at the end of three rounds of counselling, 389 seats under all-India quota, 334 seats in deemed universities, and 38 seats in Central institutions, besides seats under quotas from Jain minorities, NRIs, and children/widows of armed forces, were vacant.Experts say faulty rules lead to delayed medical admissions almost every year. ""All seats were allotted in the third round.A student is allotted a college only when he or she opts for it,"" said student counsellor Manickavel Arumugam. In the first round, students are allowed to exit (not join colleges) and apply for the second round. ""In the third round, the penalty for not joining the allotted colleges is 10,000 for govt institutions and 2 lakh for deemed universities.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

Also read:

The city woke up to a chilly Saturday covered in a blanket of smog on Saturday as the air quality deteriorated to 'very poor' levels, with several areas slipping into the 'severe' category and many others on the verge. It was also Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal. The capital's overall AQI stood at 337 at 9am, rising to 343 by noon. By 4pm, it settled at 361 - among the worst readings this season - and was 380 by 8pm. So far this season, the worst average AQI the city recorded was 371 on October 31.Residents grappled with burning eyes, sore throats, and itchy noses amid a thick, choking haze. By late afternoon, more areas had entered the severe category, including Nehru Nagar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Bawana and Burari. The air quality is very likely to stay in the very poor category till November 11.However, Delhi Pollution Control Committee said the city's air quality this Nov has, so far, remained better than the corresponding period last year. Officials said that for six out of seven days, the AQI was lower than last year's readings, adding that unlike last year, when emergency restrictions under Grap 3 were invoked on Nov 13, this year the govt has initiated mitigation steps much earlier.Grap 3 is yet to be implemented this year as CAQM officials state it will only kick in once the AQI turns 400 or worse.Residents have been urged to avoid burning biomass, waste, or wood, especially as temperatures fall and such practices become common for heating. Large housing societies have been advised to replace coal or wood-fired heaters for security guards with electric ones. Construction sites have been asked to ensure anti-smog guns are installed and operational, particularly at projects above five floors, till at least Nov 29. DPCC also said that staggered office timings should continue. CM Rekha Gupta announced that the govt will soon extend Ujjwala benefits to slums, enabling them to switch to clean cooking fuel. The govt has also instructed departments to step up road cleaning, dust suppression and pavement repair.Itchy eyes, sore throat, choked lungs: Air quality takes a toll on residents | page 4Noida: Smog continued to choke Noida on Saturday, with several neighbourhoods waking up to a burning sensation in the eyes, sore throats, and increasing breathing discomfort. As the Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in 'very poor' category, residents said they have stopped early-morning walks, jogging, cycling, and other outdoor activities because of the thick layer of haze that blankets the skyline.CPCB data showed Noida's overall AQI rose to 354, up from 306 a day earlier.""It's impossible to step out for walks anymore. Even five minutes outdoors leaves the eyes and throat burning,"" said Pramila Dhar of Sector 78. ""Parks across high-rise clusters that are usually crowded on weekend mornings remained near-empty today.""Ghaziabad fared no better, with air quality sliding further to 339 from Friday's 314, while Greater Noida slipped from 'poor' to 'very poor', reaching 336 compared to 284.Station-level readings presented a grim picture for Noida. Sector 116 - which covers the 7x sectors - recorded the highest AQI at 357, followed by Sector 125 at 347, Sector 62 at 345, and Sector 1 at 341, all in the very poor range.Nisha Rai, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Noida's Sector 77, said people in the area have been facing respiratory problems. ""People in the area are suffering from sore throats and breathing difficulties. We don't see water sprinkling being done, and the sky remains grey. We have also stopped outdoor activities,"" she said.Shreya Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Pratishtha in Sector 75, said the AOA has started sprinkling water on its own. ""There is rampant construction in the neighbourhood, and trucks and dumpers carrying materials create dust. However, there is no official check on such activities. We have advised children to stay indoors during morning and evening hours when pollution levels are high,"" she said.In Greater Noida, Knowledge Park V recorded an AQI of 322 and Knowledge Park III 328, both in the same category.Manish Kumar, a resident of Supertech Eco Village 1, said most roads in the area are covered in dust. ""There is no mechanical sweeping in Greater Noida West, and construction materials are transported and stored uncovered. We submitted a letter to the environment minister on Friday, seeking his intervention,"" he said.In Ghaziabad, Vasundhara was at 388 and Loni 364, in the very poor category, while Sanjay Nagar and Indirapuram were in the poor range at 298 and 278.Meanwhile, Delhi's overall AQI stood at 361 - among the worst readings this season. By 10pm, the hourly AQI was 385 and 20 out of the 36 monitoring stations have turned severe. However, the stricter restrictive measures under Graded Response Action Plan stage-III are yet to be implemented, and only preventive and advisory measures continue under GRAP-II. Officials at Commission for Air Quality Management, however, said stage-III would kick in only after AQI turned 400 or worse.Meanwhile, the city recorded the lowest minimum temperature for Nov on Saturday at 11 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal against Friday's 12.7 degrees.","Saturday was Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal.

AHMEDABAD: A 35-year-old Hyderabad doctor arrested in Gujarat with drone-smuggled weapons from Pakistan and materials to produce the deadly toxin ricin was identified Sunday as the central figure in an IS-sponsored terrorist plot to strike multiple Indian cities.Two other suspects in the conspiracy, a tailor from Uttar Pradesh's Shamli and a student from Lakhimpur Kheri, were traced to Banaskantha.Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash, from which ricin is extracted.He was on the move when investigators intercepted his silver hatchback at Adalaj toll plaza on Ahmedabad-Mehsana Road.Saiyed's call records led to the arrest of UP natives Azad Suleman Sheikh, 20, and Mohammad Suhail Mohammad Saleem Khan, 23. Both had been allegedly supplying firearms and cartridges to the doctor, who has an MBBS from China, officials said.Ricin is a highly toxic poison derived from castor beans after the oil has been extracted. The substance has no known antidote if ingested, inhaled or injected. Castor oil, which is used for skincare and in various commercial products, does not contain the toxin.ATS officers said Saiyed had been in contact with Abu Khadija, an Afghanistan-based operative linked to Islamic State-Khorasan Province. The doctor had been allegedly producing ricin in large quantities, possibly for mass poisoning, he said.The suspect conducted reconnaissance of unspecified security-sensitive sites in Lucknow, Delhi and Ahmedabad. The weapons came from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan. Saiyed and the other arrested men told interrogators that their handler used drones from Pakistan to deliver arms across the border.Deputy SP SL Chaudhary led the operation to bust the module based on initial intelligence about Saiyed's movements in Ahmedabad.An FIR was registered at the ATS police station against all three arrested men and Abu Khadija, who is on the run, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Arms Act. A local court gave ATS custody of Saiyed until Nov 17. The other two suspects will be produced in court separately. ATS officials said investigations were continuing to identify and arrest other operatives involved in the conspiracy.","Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash.

From Sidhu Moose Wala To Canada: Lawrence Bishnoi Gang Expands Threat To Global Punjabi Scene

'Bringing two gangsters back to India a challenge'

NEW DELHI: Indian security agencies have achieved a big breakthrough in their operations against criminals, with the detention of two of most-wanted gangsters -Venkatesh Garg and Bhanu Rana - operating from foreign soil.The detentions were made in Georgia and the US, marking a major success in the effort to dismantle international criminal networks.The first criminal, Venkatesh Garg, was apprehended in Tbilisi. Garg, associated with the gang led by UK-based Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu, is wanted in more than 10 criminal cases, including the high-profile murder of a BSP neta in Gurgaon. Garg, a resident of Haryana's Narayangarh, was living in Georgia and recruiting youth from Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and other states for carrying out contract killings.Garg's chief Sangwan belongs to Najafgarh in southwest Delhi and is known for running an organised crime syndicate from London, coordinating extortion, murder and arms-related offences. A team of cops from Delhi and Haryana is learnt to have reached Georgia to expedite Garg's extradition. Cops anticipate that Garg will be brought back to India at the earliest to face trial in over a dozen criminal cases registered against him in Haryana and Punjab.The second detention is that of Bhanu Rana, who was taken into custody in the US. Rana is linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Bishnoi, who hails from Punjab and began his criminal career during student politics, now runs a vast network of hundreds of associates across India and abroad who are involved including heinous crimes, including murder and extortion.The Lawrence Bishnoi gang has been implicated in numerous violent crimes, including murder and extortion, and has recently gained notoriety for operating its syndicate from behind bars.Police investigations have revealed that Bhanu Rana's criminal network is deeply entrenched across Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. His name had also previously surfaced during the investigation into a grenade attack in Punjab.Intelligence suggests that some of Rana's associates based in the US are actively connected to Bishnoi's criminal operations. Indian agencies are now working to secure Rana's swift deportation from the US. Multiple accomplices of Rana have already been arrested in India, and he faces numerous chargesheets in several criminal cases.Sources said these detentions abroad exposed a wider network, as over two dozen Indian gangsters are believed to be operating from abroad, running extortion and smuggling rackets by hiring operatives from India.""The detention of both Garg and Rana is a blow to their respective gangs and underscores the commitment of Indian law enforcement to pursue high-value targets across international borders,"" a senior officer said.Sources, however, pointed out that bringing the gangster duo back will be a challenge given the complex extradition procedure, which requires them to submit a range of documents to probe charges prima facie and establish their wanted status.",Venkatesh Garg and Bhanu Rana are two of India's most-wanted gangsters. The detentions were made in Georgia and the US. Garg is associated with the gang led by UK-based Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu.

NEW DELHI: The Quad leaders’ summit to be hosted by India may no longer be taking place this year but navies of the four countries are all set to kick off their top-notch Malabar exercise off Guam in the western Pacific Ocean from Monday.Indian guided-missile stealth frigate INS Sahyadri has now joined the American Aegis guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, Australian Anzac-class frigate HMAS Ballarat and Japanese helicopter destroyer JS Hyuga at Guam, a strategic US military base, for the intense combat manoeuvres from Nov 10 to 18.The `Cope India’ air combat exercise between India and the US that was slated in Gwalior from Monday, with Japan and Australia as observers, however, has been deferred as of now. The US was supposed to deploy F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighters and B-1 Lancer supersonic heavy bombers for the exercise. Instead, it has sent a solitary B-1 aircraft for “bomber integration sorties” with the IAF.On the maritime front, it will be the 29th edition of the Malabar exercise, which began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992 but includes all the Quad countries now.“INS Sahyadri’s participation in the Malabar exercise reaffirms India's enduring partnership and its commitment to strengthening coordination, enhancing interoperability, and demonstrating a collective resolve to safeguard regional security,” the Indian Navy said on Sunday.The exercise, however, comes amid the Trump administration indicating that his country’s long-standing Indo-Pacific strategy to counter an aggressive and expansionist China is no longer a top priority.India, Australia and Japan, however, remain extremely concerned about China’s continuing `Grey Zone’ tactics to push its vexatious territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific, be it against its neighbours in the South and East China Seas or the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with India.Though India and the US inked an expansive new 10-year defence framework on Oct 31, overall bilateral ties have been in atailspin since President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi,including 25% over its purchase of Russian oil, earlier this year.India, however, decided to go ahead with the Malabar exercise in the belief that the bilateral strategic partnership with the US built over the last two decades, with defence cooperation being its cornerstone, was in no danger of unravelling, as was first reported by TOI.Parallelly, India is cranking up its defence ties with the other Quad countries, Australia and Japan, as well as other regional players like South Korea and the Philippines, all of whom are deeply concerned about China’s muscle-flexing in the Indo-Pacific.The `harbour phase’ of the Malabar on Nov 10-12 will feature operational planning and discussions, alignment on communication protocols, familiarisation visits between participating nations, and sports fixtures, the Navy said.The `sea phase’ from Nov 13 to 17, in turn, will see the warships and aircraft taking part in drills focusing on joint fleet operations, anti-submarine warfare, gunnery serials and flying operations, it added.","The Quad leaders’ summit to be hosted by India may no longer be taking place this year.

says

GRAP-III

not needed as of now

NEW DELHI: The capital's air quality continued to deteriorate for the fourth day running, with the city's average AQI inching closer to 'severe' levels on Sunday. The day's average air quality index was recorded at 370, in the upper range of 'very poor', the second worst of the season so far after October 30, when the index was at 373.Delhi woke up to another morning of toxic smog but, just as on the previous day, winds picked up towards late afternoon, providing some relief. The average AQI at 8 am Sunday was 391, close to the 'severe' range that starts from 401. By 11 am, the air remained just as bad, with the AQI at 389. The day's official 24-hour average is taken at 4 pm, when the air had improved a bit.The share of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana on Delhi's PM2.5 levels continues to be low, with the figure dipping to nearly 5% from 8% on Saturday.""The wind speed reached 14-15 kmph in the afternoon. While yesterday the wind was northwesterly, coming from Punjab and Haryana, today it changed to westerly and south-westerly. Thus, the fire farm impact,"" said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet.According to the Centre's Decision Support System (DSS), the share of farm fires was 5.3% on Sunday. The share has been less than 10% so far this season while in the past years it has peaked at over 40%.The DSS did not issue any forecast on the impact of stubble burning for Monday. The air quality early warning system expects the air quality to remain within the very poor category.""The air quality is very likely to be in the very poor category from November 10 to 12,"" it stated. The AQI is expected to stay 'very poor' for the subsequent six days as well, the note added.Meanwhile, the Commissioner for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) said that they are not imposing strict pollution preventive measures under Grap-III.The CAQM issued a statement asserting that in the wake of Delhi's daily average AQI hovering around the higher end of the very poor category in the morning, a review meeting was held on GRAP.""However, the sub-committee, while reviewing the current air quality scenario of Delhi-NCR and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions made available by IMD/IITM, noted that at 10am the hourly average AQI of Delhi was 391... Given that Delhi's daily average AQI has since shown a consistent declining trend, with AQI improving to 370 at 4 pm and further improving to 365 at 5 pm today, with the dynamic model and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions and AQI by IMD/IITM also indicating the overall AQI of Delhi to stay in the 'very poor' category in the coming days, the sub-committee opined that invocation of stage-III of GRAP is not required at the moment,"" CAQM stated.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa pointed to a slew of measure being taken by the city govt, including installing sprinklers, fixing pollution norms for industries etc, while attacking the previous AAP govt, stating that while they let Delhi's pollution worsen for 10 years and expect it to be cleaned in 7 months.""The inaction of pollution of 10 years cannot be fixed in 7 months...

Every Indian Shares Ancestral Roots, No ‘Ahindu’ Exists: Mohan Bhagwat

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said the Sangh welcomes people from all faiths, including Muslims and Christians, as long as they see themselves as sons of Bharat Mata and part of the broader Hindu society.Speaking at a two-day lecture series titled ""100 Years of Sangh Journey: New Horizons"" in Bengaluru, Bhagwat clarified that the RSS does not divide its members by caste or religion and that its approach is rooted in unity and a shared national identity.Asked whether Muslims are allowed to join the RSS, Bhagwat said, ""No Brahmin is allowed in Sangh. No other caste is allowed in the Sangh. No Muslim is allowed, no Christian is allowed in the Sangha. Only Hindus are allowed. So people with different denominations, Muslims, Christians, any denomination, can come to the Sangha but keep your separateness out.""He explained that the Sangh works on the principle of inclusivity, saying, ""Muslims come to Shakha, Christians come to Shakha, as all other castes from the routinely called Hindu society, they also come to Shakha. But we don't take their count, and we don't ask who they are.We are all sons of Bharat Mata. That is how Sangha works.""Bhagwat also defended the organisation’s legal standing, saying, ""Sangha started in 1925. Do you expect us to register with the British government? Against whom?... We were banned thrice. So, the government has recognised. If we were not there, who would they ban? And each time courts resolved the ban, they dismissed the ban and made RSS a legal organisation."" He added, ""Legally, factually, we are an organisation. We are not unconstitutional. We are within that constitution. So we need not register. Many things are there which are not registered. Even Hindu Dharma is not registered.""Outlining the Sangh’s broader vision, Bhagwat said its mission is to unite and empower Hindu society to build a strong and prosperous India capable of guiding the world through the principles of Dharma. ""We want to unite, organise, impart qualities to the entire Hindu society so that they will create a prosperous and strong Bharat which will impart the Dharma knowledge to the world. Our mission, our vision is an organised, strong Hindu society,"" he said.He also reaffirmed the Sangh’s respect for the national flag, saying, “Since its creation, Sangha has always stood by, respected, offered tributes and protected this Tiranga Dhwaj... There is no question of Bhagwa vis-a-vis Bhagwa and Tiranga.”","Mohan Bhagwat: Sangh welcomes people from all faiths, including Muslims and Christians.

Trophy-hunting syndicate of the rich & influential exposed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trophy-hunting-syndicate-of-the-rich-influential-exposed/articleshow/125208066.cms,"Probe also revealed that two members of the alleged syndicate had travelled to southern African countries to practise hunting (AI-generated image)

BHOPAL: What began as a wildlife meat seizure of blackbuck and sambar in Madhya Pradesh has exploded into one of India's most chilling wildlife crime investigations - a sprawling probe that has unearthed an alleged trophy-hunting syndicate operating across nine districts, linked to affluent clients, rifle-club insiders and even cross-border hunting circles.Nearly a year after three Mumbai-based youths were arrested, forensic specialists have cracked encrypted mobile data from seized phones, uncovering a cache of videos, GPS logs and chat records that laid bare a covert commercial game-hunting racket posing as ""sports gatherings"". A total of 60 kills of blackbuck, chinkara and sambar have been established between 2022 and 2024. The operation, investigators say, turned protected forests into private killing grounds for the wealthy.Moreover, the case has now drawn the attention of the Bishnoi community of Rajasthan, which holds blackbucks sacred. The community has filed an intervening application (IA) before MP high court's Indore bench, opposing the bail plea of one of the suspects, Salman Piyarji of Mumbai. The IA will come up for a special hearing on Tuesday.This massive antelope poaching was reportedly modelled on southern Africa-style game hunts, where wealthy participants pay to track and shoot animals for trophies or meat.Investigators said those involved had studied and replicated safari-hunting formats - complete with preselected ""targets"", night chases, and trophy photo sessions in the forests of central India.Among the decrypted files is a video purportedly showing a blackbuck being shot, then its throat being slit with a knife to drain its blood as it gasps for air. Recorded under torchlight, the footage is one of several videos showing alleged night hunts carried out by the syndicate. There are many more.Sharad Jatav, spokesperson for State Tiger Strike Force (STSF), told TOI that the forensic data has ""opened a Pandora's box"". ""They mainly targeted males, be it blackbuck, chinkara, chital or sambar. We have matched the videos with the mobile-location data of the suspects,"" Jatav said.He said males were targeted because their horns were taken as trophies. ""Whether these outsiders were being charged by the Bhopal-based group facilitating these hunts or if it was purely for sport is still under investigation. Key local suspects are yet to be arrested. Their questioning will reveal more. The rifles have been sent for a ballistic examination,"" he said.Jatav said the group first met during a religious gathering in Bhopal, and ""it is possible that more game hunters from other states travelled to Madhya Pradesh for similar expeditions"".Investigations also revealed that two members of the alleged syndicate had travelled to southern African countries to practise hunting legally for trophies and meat from antelopes.The decrypted data indicates that between 2022 and December 2024, the network orchestrated hunts that killed more than 60 protected animals across Narmadapuram, Rajgarh, Sehore, Shajapur, Raisen, Vidisha, and parts of Bhopal, Ujjain, and Indore divisions. These alleged hunts were marketed to clients as exclusive ""wildlife sport experiences"".The case first came to light in Dec 2024, when STSF, Indore forest department, and local police arrested three alleged poachers - Johar Sain, Iyaz, and Salman Piyarji - at Kishanganj forest range in Indore district. Officers seized 65kg of suspected wildlife meat, a country-made pistol, three live cartridges, and an SUV with a Maharashtra registration allegedly used for transporting carcasses. After months of forensic analysis, the fourth arrest was made on Oct 24 this year when Sabah (45), son of Salasin, was picked up from Mitra Nagar, Jogeri, Mumbai.Investigators are examining possible links between the alleged hunters and certain rifle club members suspected of supplying weapons, ammunition, and logistical support. Some are believed to have helped identify forest-edge hunting zones for the group. ""The evidence confirms a commercial operation masquerading as sport. More arrests are expected in Maharashtra and Rajasthan,"" a senior investigator said.","A total of 60 kills of blackbuck, chinkara and sambar have been established. The operation, investigators say, turned protected forests into private killing grounds for the wealthy.

HYDERABAD: Girls from migrant Hindu families of Bengal are being drugged and exploited in pockets of Hyderabad's Old City on AIMIM's watch, Union junior home minister Bandi Sanjay alleged Sunday, days after slamming Asaduddin Owaisi 's party and Congress for what he claimed were attempts to ""turn Telangana into an Islamic state"".""Hindus in West Bengal have no safety cover... Now, they are facing a similar situation in the Old City of Hyderabad too,"" he said, termling these stories of alleged exploitation ""The Hyderabad Files"". Sanjay said that he had already reached out to the families of women and girls allegedly targeted by men from ""another community"".""Initially, they lured a girl from school to a Muslim classmate's house under the guise of a birthday party, where she was offered chocolates laced with drugs... She was later kidnapped and assaulted for six days,"" he said at a presser. ""When the girl's parents approached police, they were dismissed, and the case was closed without any investigation. The girl was later blackmailed with videos of the assault. She was even forced to bring her other friends. ""Sanjay said the survivor named nine other girls who suffered similar abuse. ""Hundreds of such incidents are going on right in the middle of the city without being reported.The local police are scared as they operate under pressure from AIMIM.""In one instance, the minister alleged, a minor was abducted by a gang of drug addicts. When she returned home and the family filed a police complaint, the case was ""abruptly shut"" without a proper investigation.""The girl is now battling addiction and exhibiting erratic behaviour. Despite having evidence, including CCTV footage, no action has been taken against the gang,"" he said, displaying CCTV snapshots of two men allegedly trying to abduct a girl.Sanjay said that he knew the parents of one such alleged victim attempting suicide. He urged CM Revanth Reddy to take immediate action in all cases, failing which he warned that ""Hindu protection squads"" would be set up in the Old City.The minister also asked the CM to deploy ""capable police officers"", free of political interference, to dismantle the alleged drug network. ""What is the intelligence wing doing? The CM is also the state home minister...Is he only looking out for his family members and leaving the rest to feel unsafe?"" he said.Officers at Charminar police station dismissed the minister's allegations as false. ""An investigation was conducted and the (abducted) girl was traced. But we didn't find any evidence of sexual abuse. The girl had previously gone missing twice,"" an officer said. ""In the most recent case, the girl said she willfully went with the accused. But since she is a minor, a case of abduction has been registered against the person.

NEW DELHI: India has seen its highest foreign tourist arrival (FTA) growth in percentage terms from Somalia between pre-Covid 2019 and 2024. At over 144%, the poor east African country is the only one to register a triple digit growth rate, surging from 5,044 in 2019 to 12,320 in 2024, according to Union tourism ministry data.Besides this surprise entry, the other countries in the top five by growth rate are Cambodia (81%), Kazakhstan (72%), Vietnam (61%) and Bhutan (47%). Somalia's growth rate would have been higher had it not seen its tourists dip from 16,607 in 2023 to 12,320 in 2024.India had 99.5 lakh FTAs in CY (calendar year) 2024, less than the pre-Covid all-time high of almost 1.1 crore. The travel industry expects to breach pre-Covid numbers either this year or latest by early next year with ""continued focus on visas, infrastructure, and global promotion"", according to Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) president Ravi Gosain.""India's inbound tourism is witnessing a better rebound this season. Most of our member operators are reporting 10%-15% higher arrivals than last year, driven by renewed interest from North America, Europe, West Asia and Southeast Asia. The encouraging part is the quality of travel with longer stays, higher per-capita spending, and growing preference for experiential and sustainable tourism products,"" Gosain said.Preliminary data and trade feedback indicate that CY 2025 could see 1-1.05 crore FTS compared to 1.09 crore in 2019. With ""continued policy support, especially easier e-visas and India's global positioning, we are on track to surpass 2019 inbound volume by 2026,"" Gosain added.While India is slowly inching up to pre-pandemic levels, the ministry data show FTA recovery is different across regions. Only the Americas (US and Canada) have surpassed 2019 levels.""Asia and the Pacific remained the largest source region, accounting for 43% of total FTAs in 2024 (42.8 lakh arrivals), according to the data. However, this represents a 22.6% decline from 2019, mainly due to continued decline from South Asia (minus 28.6%) and North-East Asia (minus 49.4%). Oceania surpassed its 2019 level by 38.2%, reflecting strong recovery led by countries like Australia and New Zealand, the ministry said.Europe contributed 26.7% to FTAs in 2024 (26.6 lakh) and was just 3.2% lower than 2019 levels. The Americas showed impressive recovery and growth with 23.7 lakh arrivals in 2024. The region recorded a 20.8% growth over 2019 and constituted 23.8% of total FTAs, the ministry said.Africa accounted for 3.4% of FTAs in 2024, with near-complete recovery to 2019 levels. West Asia, contributing 2.97% to India's FTAs in 2024, witnessed a decline of 14.1% over 2019, the ministry said.","India has seen its highest foreign tourist arrival (FTA) growth in percentage terms from Somalia.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

NEW DELHI: NDA and Mahagathbandhan face the challenge of retaining their bastions and making fresh headways in the last phase of Bihar polls, and much will depend on whether their smaller allies, which will be fighting a majority of their seats on November 11, can deliver after having driven a good bargain from their principal partners.For NDA, Union minister Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV) is contesting 15 of its total 28 seats - the nomination of one of its candidates was rejected - and Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM (Secular) all six of its constituencies in the second phase of elections.While both Paswan and Manjhi are Dalit mascots of the governing alliance, its Kushwaha face Upendra Kushwaha, too, has a lot at stake as his candidates, including his wife Snehlata Kushwaha, are in the fray in four of the six seats his party, RLM, was allotted.If BJP-JDU alliance has to change its fortunes in Magadh region, where RJD-led MGB had won 20 of 26 seats in 2020, its two key Dalit constituents have to make it count on the 11 constituencies they are contesting in its five districts.A share of 29 seats for Chirag had triggered some heartburn within NDA, and he has often harped on his 100% strike rate in Lok Sabha elections to raise his bargaining power within the alliance.For MGB, Congress is contesting 37 of its 61 seats and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) seven of its 12 seats, of the total 122 constituencies going to the polls on Tuesday.The opposition alliance is banking on Mukesh Sahani-led VIP to swing the Nishad votes, who account for 2.6% of the total population, according to the state's caste survey.Sahani was a part of NDA in 2020, and MGB has walked the extra mile to keep the 'son of Mallah' in good humour, agreeing to his demand for naming him as its deputy chief ministerial choice if elected to power.The Tirhut region has been a traditional stronghold of NDA, and MGB is hoping to push the ruling alliance back there. NDA currently holds 23 of the 30 seats that go to the polls on Tuesday and eight of the 10 in Madhubani district, a part of Mithilanchal region, another bastion of the ruling alliance.Among the various forces at work in these polls, in no region have they drawn more attention than Seemanchal, which has the highest concentration of Muslims in Bihar. Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM is again in the fray there, having stumped MGB in 2020 with victories in five of 24 seats in its four districts.Congress is fighting on 12 seats in this region, as against RJD's nine. NDA had won 12 seats in Seemanchal in 2020, and alliance members believe that if AIMIM manages to draw a section of Muslim votes, then they can do well on the back of Hindu consolidation. However, the calculation guiding MGB is that Muslims will solidly back it this time, and it can significantly boost its numbers by also cornering a section of Hindu votes.Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor, too, has run an energised campaign to create a third pole in the state's binodal politics, and a record turnout of over 65% in the first phase of polls on November 6 has made him as well as the two main alliances claim popular support. Which means that a similarly high turnout on Tuesday will only further the puzzlement over who actually is gaining from the enthusiasm of the electorate.JDU was the lead NDA player in the first phase of polling as it contested 57 seats, as against BJP's 48.In the second phase, BJP will contest 53 compared to JDU's 44. For MGB, RJD is contesting 71 seats and CPI(ML) six in this phase amid ""friendly fights"" among its constituents on several seats.","NDA and Mahagathbandhan face the challenge of retaining their bastions and making fresh headways in the last phase of Bihar polls.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor on Sunday dismissed the ""notion"" that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi holds any meaningful sway over Gen Z voters in Bihar.He further criticised Gandhi's limited engagement and understanding of the state.In an exclusive interview with news agency ANI, Kishor said, “How much knowledge does Rahul Gandhi have here? Rahul Gandhi comes here, roams around, does a couple of show bites and then he is gone.”He questioned the idea that Bihar’s youth would rally behind Gandhi’s calls on issues like “vote theft” or protecting democracy.“When the people of Bihar are not listening to him (Rahul Gandhi), then why would Gen Z listen to him? Gen Z is not a homogeneous group in Bihar who acts on someone’s call or on the basis of their assessment,” he said.Referring to recent protests in Nepal that led to the fall of the former PM KP Sharma Oli's government, Kishor said some people were “getting excited” after the Gen Z movement there but stressed that Bihar’s political landscape is different.“Bihar is a very political place. It is not like Bangalore. People won’t have clothes, food, jobs, but there is a lot of political optimism among the people here. And the result of this is that people are leaving their work and doing politics day and night.But I don’t think there is going to be a revolution by someone’s call here,” he said.Kishor underlined that youth play an important role in Bihar’s politics, primarily because of unemployment and migration.“The youth between 20 and 30 years, who are facing a bit of unemployment. Not a bit, I mean he is facing a lot of difficulties due to unemployment. They are forced to go out, enduring the tough life there. That is definitely a big factor in Bihar. You can call him Gen Z, you can call him a youth, you can call him a millennial. This is the terminology,” he said.Commenting on the Congress party’s role in the upcoming elections, Jan Suraaj founder said it remains marginal.“I had also said at that time that Congress is a follower of RJD in Bihar. They are a big party of the country. They are the leaders of the opposition in the country. They belong to the Gandhi family. So it is natural that the media will cover them,” he said.“But from the point of view of Bihar, there is no presence of Congress. Congress is not a factor. There is no discussion of Congress. What is Congress doing? Congress has little effect. Politically, you can see it in Seemanchal. In Seemanchal, I think that even today, the Muslims are more tilted towards Congress than RJD,” he added.Hours before the first phase of polling, Gandhi had appealed to young voters, particularly Gen Z to come forward and “save democracy through truth and non-violence.”In a video message posted on X, Congress leader addressed “Gen Z brothers and sisters” from Bihar, urging them to turn out in large numbers and vote responsibly.“My young friends from Bihar, my Gen-Z brothers and sisters — tomorrow is not just a day for voting, but a day to decide the direction of Bihar’s future,” he said.Referring to his repeated “vote theft” allegations, Gandhi added, “You’ve seen how in Haryana, a nefarious game of vote theft was played. In Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh — everywhere, these people have tried to suppress the people’s voice. Now their eyes are on Bihar, on your votes, on your future.”He urged voters to “stay vigilant against every conspiracy” and to “walk the path of truth and non-violence” while supporting Mahagathbandhan candidates in their constituencies.The first phase of the Bihar assembly elections concluded peacefully on Thursday with a record voter turnout, while the remaining 122 constituencies will vote in the second phase on November 11. Counting will take place on November 14.","Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor questions Rahul Gandhi's understanding of Bihar.

"India, China look to restart cultural, people exchanges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-look-to-restart-cultural-people-exchanges/articleshow/125211664.cms,".

How it works

NEW DELHI: With the resumption of direct flights between India and China, both countries are looking to resume the high-level mechanism for cultural and people-to-people exchanges early next year.The mechanism chaired by the foreign ministers has met twice so far - in 2018 and 2019 - and its resumption is key to advancing cooperation in a range of areas like tourism, culture, media and academic exchanges.The next, or third, meeting is expected to take place in Delhi. The decision to restart direct air services saw China Eastern launching on Sunday its first Shanghai-Delhi flight, which witnessed 95% occupancy.Since they resolved the military standoff in eastern Ladakh, India and China have taken a series of steps to normalise the relationship.In Hindu mythology, mortals prayed and performed elaborate rituals to please Indra, the god of rain. Legend has it that musician Tansen's melodious voice could summon showers from cloudless skies. Ordinary mortals, however, have neither the Ashvamedha yagna nor Tansen's tenor.In modern India, a new kind of rainmaker relies on science, not song to coax moisture from the sky. While Dilliwalas' hopes of a downpour may have dried up after this week's failed experiment, this handful of rainmakers remain convinced that the science of cloud seeding works - when used the right way.Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification that involves dispersing particles like silver iodide or calcium chloride into moisture-bearing clouds to stimulate rainfall. Research has shown that it can enhance rain by 18-46% and help prevent drought, water scarcity and related problems. It has been used with varying degrees of success across the world, particularly in China and the US. In India, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, has conducted cloud seeding experiments and research since the 1970s, but it was only in 2003 that states began on-ground experiments in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for rain enhancement. This is the first time cloud seeding has been used to tackle pollution.Bengaluru-based Agni Aero Sports Adventure Academy has worked with Maharashtra, Andhra and Rajasthan for rain enhancement since 2003. Its founder Arvind Sharma, a trained microlight aviator, says the Delhi experiment may have done more harm than good. ""Cloud seeding cannot create rain. It can enhance rain under specific weather conditions including cloud formation and moisture. It is no surprise that the project has failed,"" he says.Helmed by Sharma, the company has run projects in rain-shadow areas of Andhra and Maharashtra that come with their own set of challenges. ""Pilots are trained to stay away from turbulence to protect passengers and the craft. In cloud seeding, we not only go seeking turbulence but also go right into the clouds,"" Sharma says, explaining how the plane needs to be at close range to inject the clouds with the chemical.Prakash Koliwad, founder of Kyathi Climate, which has run projects with IITM Pune and worked on several missions in Maharashtra and Karnataka between 2015 and 2019, says there has been 30 years of research in the field, establishing it as sound science. He argues that if used well, it is not as exorbitant as it is being made out to be. ""The Maharashtra govt spends Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in drought relief every year and must combat problems like farmer distress and suicide. If they spend 0.1-0.2% of that amount at the beginning of the monsoon season to enhance rainfall, they will no longer have to face angry farmers or distress,"" he says.So why has this technique not become more popular? Suman Akkaraju, CEO of Siri Aviations, attributes it to lack of awareness. ""Cloud seeding is still viewed as an experimental approach by many. Awareness, regulatory clearances, and public understanding take time. But with more proven outcomes and better data, adoption is slowly increasing.""The Delhi govt is reported to have spent Rs 65 lakh a day, while projects that run for several months can cost Rs 30-40 crore. A more cost-effective method was recently deployed by Rajasthan, billed as India's first drone-based cloud seeding. However, that too, has a patchy track record. In Aug-Sept this year, the govt used drones to create artificial rain to revive Ramgarh lake with no success.Though a bit of a damp (or dry) squib in India, the technology has found favour abroad. The first pioneering attempt was documented by Vincent Schaefer in 1946, who used dry ice to increase snowfall. The US has used cloud seeding in mountainous areas since the 1950s to increase snowfall and even deployed it in Operation Popeye, a secret five-year US military programme during the Vietnam War, meant to lengthen the monsoon season and disrupt enemy movement. Cloud seeding was also used at the 1980 Moscow and 2008 Beijing Olympics, though it wasn't to make it rain but to prevent it. It was reportedly used even at the 2012 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. China and UAE have invested heavily to tackle drought.Back home, environmental experts have dismissed the cloud seeding exercise as ""theatrics"" that fail to address the root causes of air pollution. Gufran Beig, of the National Institute of Advanced Studies and founder-director of SAFAR, says cloud seeding is a highly specialised scientific project that must be executed with care. ""Even in the most favourable conditions, the probability of success is 50-60%, which is before and post-monsoon season. The probability at this time of year goes down to 10%,"" he says.","Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification that involves dispersing particles like silver iodide or calcium chloride into moisture- bearing clouds. Research has shown that it can enhance rain by 18-46% and help prevent drought, water scarcity and related problems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125211670,imgsize-490912,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-39.jpg"
Delhi pollution: Citizens protest against toxic air in Capital; demand action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-pollution-citizens-protest-against-toxic-air-in-capital-demand-action/articleshow/125201887.cms,"Delhi residents portesting against air quaility in national capital (ANI)

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

NEW DELHI: As air quality in the national capital continues to plunge, several Delhi residents gathered at India Gate on Sunday, demanding that the government take concrete policy measures to curb the city’s persistent air pollution crisis. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Priyanka Kakkar also joined the protest, accusing the government of being in “denial” about the problem.Following the same, several protesters were detained for demanding stronger government action against rising pollution levels. The event, described as a “clean air protest,” called on authorities to implement stricter measures to tackle what participants referred to as an ongoing ""air emergency"" which has pushed the air quality index (AQI) close to 600 in some parts of Delhi - a level classified as ""severe."" Participants said their demonstration was peaceful and aimed at drawing attention to what they described as government inaction on the worsening situation.Speaking to reporters at the protest, Kakkar accused the BJP-led Delhi government of manipulating the data and demanding them to be on ground with the public.“People of Delhi are angry because the government of the national capital is in denial. They are not accepting that there is pollution.Rekha Gupta is sitting in her office-home after ordering 13 air purifiers - she should have been here. This is public anger. Because the BJP government didn’t take even a single step to address pollution and everyone knows it this time. The BJP government should have been with the people on the ground and not manipulating the data” she said.One protester said, “We want policies from the government to take action on the worsening situation of air quality. The AQI is touching heights, it’s around 600. In European countries everyone has the right to protest - here when we are protesting peacefully, no one wants to listen. We are being evacuated and not allowed to protest peacefully here. This is very wrong, we are not hurting anyone.”The resident further added, “All we’re saying is no matter whose government it is, common people are dying. Yet the government is not designing any policies and hiding the data. They are sprinkling water at the data centres. No one is working, the entire work force is in Bihar. What about our lives? Have we taken birth here to die?”Also read: What are you smoking? Delhi wakes up to thick smog as air quality sinks to ‘very poor' Expressing frustration over failed experiments like cloud seeding, the protester said, “It’s been 11 years since they have been in government but they haven't done anything to bring about change. Even the cloud seeding didn't work. That is, anyway, not a solution. We want a permanent solution.”The demonstrator also lamented the lack of public participation in such protests, saying, “Even the public is fast asleep. Many people are here to watch the show, but they are not raising their voices in protests. We demand from the government to take action on the issue and make policies.”The protest comes amid alarming levels of pollution across Delhi-NCR, as authorities grapple with deteriorating air quality ahead of winter.","Several Delhi residents gathered at India Gate on Sunday, demanding that the government take concrete policy measures to curb the city’s persistent air pollution crisis.

"Many still sitting on old note stashes, hoping for exchange",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gang-cheats-traders-sitting-on-old-notes/articleshow/125195600.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: Nine years after demonetisation, crores of invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes remain stashed with people, sustaining a grey market large enough for organised fraud. This became evident from the arrest of eight members of a gang over the last two weeks.The men were allegedly behind a multi-level racket that trapped clients, mainly traders and middlemen still hoarding invalid notes, via social media sites by promising discreet conversion of demonetised currency in exchange for hefty commissions.Investigation revealed that no currency was ever exchanged, and the gang simply collected bundles of demonetised currency and their advance fees before vanishing. Police have so far recovered demonetised notes worth Rs 3.9 crore from their stash.""Most victims never approached police because their own transaction was illegal,"" Trans-Hindon DCP Nimish Patil said. ""The fraud operated through a structured, three-tier chain. The first tier, which included the recently arrested SK alias Sharik and Abhinav alias Rahul Buddhi Raja, handled negotiations with victims and offered assurances of converting the notes at 25% of face value.The second comprised collectors who sourced demonetised currency directly from clients, and the third consisted of couriers who transported the notes to designated handover points. ""Police said the gang used WhatsApp, Telegram and encrypted calling apps to connect with potential clients. Conversations were coded, identities were masked, and SIM cards were changed frequently to avoid tracking. Abhinav, identified as the mastermind, coordinated activities across the chain and handled communications between collectors and couriers.In two rounds of arrests-first on Oct 31 and then on Nov 6 night-cops also nabbed Fakhruddin, Nasruddin, Shubham Chaudhary, Arun Kashyap, Mahesh Prasad and Jitendra Kumar.An FIR has been registered under BNS sections 318(2) (cheating), 62 (punishment for attempting to commit offences), 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 3/5 (common intention) and 5/7 of the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017.Police are now examining the digital trails and financial links between the accused and their clients. Investigators say two to three other suspects named in the FIR are yet to be traced. For now, officers are expanding their focus to traders and middlemen who approached the gang, the very people who kept this underground market alive.""Victims rarely report these cases because they fear legal consequences. That secrecy is what the gang exploited for years,"" the DCP said.","Eight members of a gang were arrested over the last two weeks.

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray Sunday complained about a drone ""peeping"" into Matoshree, the heavily guarded residence he shares with party chief Uddhav Thackeray and his mother at Bandra's Kalanagar, raising concerns about potential surveillance. MMRDA and police clarified that the drone was part of a survey being conducted for the proposed pod taxi service in the area, but Aaditya asked why residents weren't informed beforehand.""A drone was caught peeping into our residence [on Sunday] morning and when the media learnt about it, MMRDA said it was a survey being done for BKC with police permission,"" Aaditya said on X. ""What survey allows you to peep inside homes and fly out quickly when spotted? Why weren't residents informed? Is MMRDA only doing surveillance of our house?"" He said MMRDA ""should rather get on the ground and focus on its own work, like the MTHL (Atal Setu), which is an example of its corruption. ""In response, MMRDA said the drone survey was conducted over the weekend along the approved pod taxi alignment-from Kurla to Bandra via BKC-to facilitate a visual study of the corridor. ""All necessary permissions were obtained by MMRDA on behalf of the concessionaire from the police department, and every instruction issued by them was strictly adhered to,"" it said on X.It said the certified drone operator, whose background verification was already submitted to the authorities, carried out the survey in the presence of police personnel and concessionaire officials.""The operation remained fully compliant and restricted to the approved alignment, with no breach or deviation at any stage.""

Lawyer jumps from house to evade cops, breaks legs

AGRA: A 40-year-old lawyer allegedly raped a gang-rape survivor in an Agra hotel room after luring her with the promise of arranging an out-of-court settlement in a 2022 sexual assault case in which he was reportedly representing one of the accused, reports Sudeep Lavania.The 24-year-old had travelled from Auraiya to attend a hearing Thursday when Jitendra Singh alias Jitendra Dhakre took her to a hotel, served her alcohol during the car ride, and assaulted her. Police arrested him two days later after he jumped from a neighbour's rooftop during a raid and fractured his legs while trying to flee.The rape survivor had come to Agra to appear in court in connection with the gang-rape case against three men in Etmadpur. Advocate Jitendra Singh, who, she said, approached her the same day, claimed he could mediate a settlement with the other accused. He later booked a room for her at a city hotel, saying it was too late for her to return home.The woman told police that Singh initially left her in the hotel room but returned later that night with dinner and, under the pretext of discussing the case, allegedly raped her. She added that though he locked the door from inside and prevented her from leaving, she managed to slip out under the pretext of getting water and hid inside the hotel until he left.She approached police the following morning and filed a complaint, based on which an FIR was registered under BNS section 64(1) (rape).Investigators visited the hotel, collected CCTV footage and visitor records, and launched a manhunt to trace Singh. A forensic team examined the room, and officials said both digital and physical evidence were being preserved. Police also recovered entries from the hotel's visitor register and CCTV footage showing Singh and the woman entering the premises together.Agra DCP (city) Sayeed Ali Abbar said, ""During a raid at the accused's house, he jumped from a neighbour's roof and fractured both legs. He was admitted to SN Medical College. We secured his remand Saturday and produced him before the court. He has been sent to judicial custody.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has finally granted permission for Phool Walon ki Sair following the intervention of lieutenant governor VK Saxena, Raj Niwas officials said on Sunday. Last week, the organising body, Anjuman Sair-e-Gul Faroshan, announced that it had decided to cancel the event as DDA did not give permission for the annual festival in Mehrauli's Aam Bagh.The approval has been conveyed to the organisers, an official said. Following reports about the cancellation, Saxena had ordered an investigation. It revealed that the permission was delayed due to a forest and environment department direction on Nov 28, 2023, that prohibits the organisation of such a festival in the area, the official claimed.For a week every year, the centuries-old festival transforms Mehrauli with floral offerings at the dargah of Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki and the Yogmaya temple. Kites fly, qawwalis are sung and wrestling matches are held. Each day, a particular activity takes place. DDA permitted the festival regularly till 2023 and had even facilitated its organisation in 2024, the official said.However, the organisers this time insisted on a written permission, which was issued after LG's intervention.The permission has been given on the condition that no harm will be caused to the environment during the festival, said officials.The organisers said the event would be held in Feb-March next year. ""We have not yet received any written or verbal communication from DDA regarding therequired permission,"" said Usha Kumar, general secretary of Phool Walon KiSair, Anjuman Sair-e-Gul Faroshan. Another organiser noted that while the department earlier gave verbal assurances, there wasn't enough time left for the extensive preparations. LG has urged action against the erring officials.

For families, loss not only emotional but existential

KOTA: Concrete buckled and the school roof crashed. Piplodi village froze as seven children died, and with it the futures of two women who had closed the door on childbirth - until grief forced it back open.The July 25 collapse of the govt upper primary school in Rajasthan's Jhalawar district claimed the son and daughter of 32-year-old Binti Bai and the only son of 36-year-old Rajubai Lodha. The two young mothers - already sterilised - spiralled into devastation no counselling textbook fully captures. Doctors treating the two women said their PTSD grew from a single tormenting despair: no chance of conceiving again. Both women had undergone tubal ligation years earlier, choices made when their families felt complete.Binti Bai, wife of daily-wage labourer Chotulal, had opted for ligation in 2020, two years after the birth of her son Kanha. The collapse killed Kanha, 7, and her daughter Meena, 10. She withdrew into silence, refused food, and stopped sleeping.Rajubai, wife of farmer Harakchand Lodha, had undergone family planning six years earlier.Their 10-year-old son, Kartik died in the collapse, leaving her terrified the family lineage would end. She had three daughters - the youngest, Aarti, survived with a crushed leg and remains under treatment.""After Kartik's death, my wife couldn't sleep or eat,"" said Harakchand. ""Her condition deteriorated, haunted by her inability to conceive again and no boy to carry the bloodline. Now she's regaining health. Her smile is back - instilled with hope. We're praying for a son.""The belief that only sons can carry a family's lineage remains deeply embedded. Daughters are cherished but often seen as leaving the household after marriage, while sons are viewed as heirs who uphold rituals and family names. This patriarchal calculus shapes reproductive decisions - and intensifies grief when a son dies. For both families in Piplodi, the loss was not only emotional but existential, tied to fears of a lineage abruptly ending.Backed by the district administration and the psychiatry team, Rajubai underwent fallopian-tube recanalisation in late Sept at Heera Bai Kanwar women's hospital in Jhalawar. Binti Bai followed on Oct 29. Her husband Chotulal said: ""Kanha's loss is irreparable. But the operation has given fresh hope.""Jhalawar chief medical health officer Dr Sajid Khan said the sterilisation reversal procedure is undertaken only in the ""rarest of rare"" cases. ""We did it to instil hope for life in two families. Both were devastated, in deep shock and depression. Our psychologists convinced them they could regain motherhood.""District collector Ajay Singh Rathore has assured IVF access in Kota or Jaipur if needed and ordered a medical board to evaluate further treatment pathways.Hope is the only tool for revival, according psychiatrist Dr Rashid Gauri, who led counselling. ""The absence of hope for a child after tubal ligation was the core of their shattered mental status. Three months of sessions prepared them mentally and physically for the surgery.""INDIA","The July 25 collapse of the govt upper primary school in Rajasthan's Jhalawar district claimed the son and daughter of Binti Bai and the only son of Rajubai Lodha.

Acid test: Free surgery should be a right, not a fight

NEW DELHI: Weekends at Chhatarpur are usually all about wedding shopping and the accompanying glitter. On Sunday though, in a quiet hall away from the chaos and the crowd, the air felt gentler. Women in soft lehengas and pastel anarkalis sat together, dressed not for a wedding, but for themselves.From afar, it looked like any friendly gathering or a rehearsal for a fashion show. Then the scars came into view. The laughter didn't stop. The shoulders didn't drop.Among them stood Reshma Ansari and Suniti Karmakar, smiling as they posed for a photo. ""We stopped going to weddings,"" said Reshma, who survived an acid attack in 1997. ""People stare before they even say hello."" Suniti, attacked in 2010, nodded. ""You start feeling like the room isn't yours.""A few steps away stood Haseena, still wearing a mask. She was attacked a year and a half ago and had come to Delhi for surgery.Her 13-year-old daughter, also a survivor, played nearby. Reshma walked up to her and reassured her: ""You don't have to hide here."" Haseena's eyes filled as she slowly lifted her mask.For the first time in months, she wasn't hiding.That quiet courage was what From Scars to Strength, a symposium by Brave Souls Foundation led by Shaheen Malik, was all about - a day for acid attack survivors to meet, celebrate and remind the world that scars aren't shame; they are stories of survival.Some had lost an eye, some an ear, others bore quiet scars on their hands - but every story in that room had a heartbeat.For instance, Meena, who was attacked in 2023 and is recovering from 14 surgeries, let her song speak for her. ""Zindagi ke safar mein guzar jaate hain jo makam..."" Her voice trembled at first, then steadied, each lyric carrying what words could not - the pain, the nostalgia, the stubborn hope. When she reached the words ""woh pal bhi kya pal the..."", the hall fell silent, a shared quiet among those who understood loss too well.Male survivors, too often invisible, sat among them. Shahnawaz, attacked in 1997, had travelled from Meerut. ""The pain is the same for men - the shame, the struggle, the silence,"" he said. Neeraj, attacked in 2010, nodded, saying, ""Even finding a job becomes a fight. People look away."" Their stories were quieter, but no less powerful - reminders that acid doesn't discriminate, but empathy often does.And then, there was a story that didn't need words - of Reshma Khatun and Ashok. Their presence alone said it all: love has no bias, no boundaries, and no fear of scars. In 2014, acid changed Reshma's life. It took away her vision; today, she can see only faint shadows with one eye. But it couldn't take away her will. Years later, a Facebook message from Ashok changed everything again. What began as shy hellos turned into long chats, shared laughter, and quiet understanding.When they finally met on a video call, he didn't flinch. He just smiled and promised to stay. ""He saw me, not my face,"" Reshma said softly.In 2019, they married, an interfaith union that now includes their little son. Wherever she goes, whether for events or small errands, Ashok is always beside her, his hand steady on hers, guiding her steps. ""It was never about looks,"" he said simply. ""It's the heart that matters.""Between songs, hugs, and stories, the event also turned the spotlight on what still needs fixing. Actor Sharmila Tagore, the chief guest, spoke softly but firmly: ""When I met Shaheen, she was still behind her pardah. Even now, her pain lingers. Quick redressal is essential - and the sale of acid must stop completely.""A panel, which included Justice Dharmesh Sharma (Retd), AAP's Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh and retired public prosecutor Neelam Narang, discussed key issues facing survivors - from faster compensation and free surgeries to greater accountability. ""Free surgery in every hospital should be a right, not a fight,"" said Singh, vowing to raise the matter in Parliament.Under the Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme, payouts have swung wildly - from Rs 7.6 lakh for six victims in 2014 to Rs 79.5 lakh for 27 survivors in 2024. Till July 2025, Rs 40 lakh was disbursed among 14 survivors. For most, that doesn't even cover the first few surgeries.Shaheen, who leads Brave Souls Foundation, said, ""The average recovery cost easily crosses Rs 20 lakh,"" she said. ""And survivors still get money in instalments - after pleading for every rupee.""Real rehabilitation, she added, is not about one cheque. It's about long-term medical care, therapy, free medicines, disability certificates without red tape, and mental health support. ""These aren't luxuries,"" she said firmly. ""They are basic rights - for people whose lives were burned but not broken.""As the hall began to empty, the survivors gathered again - arms around each other, smiles lighting up scarred faces. In that glow, there was no trace of pity, only power. They weren't hiding their scars anymore. They were owning them - like badges of survival, like light.","From Scars to Strength was a symposium by Brave Souls Foundation led by Shaheen Malik. It was a day for acid attack survivors to meet, celebrate and remind the world that scars aren't shame; they are stories of survival.

NEW DELHI: The government has earned little over Rs 800 crore from the sale of scrap during the month-long cleanliness drive conducted in October, which is enough to buy seven Vande Bharat trains, and also freed around 233 lakh sq ft of space.The past five rounds of the special campaign for cleanliness across central govt offices has generated around Rs 4,100 crore revenue by selling scrap, which personnel minister Jitendra Singh said was similar to the total budget of one mega space mission or multiple Chandrayaan missions.In these drives, govt entities and subsidiaries have cleared 923 lakh sq ft of space. The minister on X said total space freed in the past five special campaigns was enough to bring up a big mall or some other massive infrastructure.In 2021, govt had decided to run a special swachhta campaign from Oct 2 to Oct 31. The department of administrative reforms and public grievances coordinates this drive through collaboration across 84 central ministries and departments.For the intensive drive and success of the campaign, central ministers briefed officers, held interactions with staff and chaired review meetings on reducing pendency. Similarly, tasks were spelt out for secretaries and director generals, which included review of the campaign on weekly basis and for reducing pendencies.Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had to mobilise personnel for cleanliness of outdoor spaces across government offices.Officials said that while every ministry and department must take cleanliness, reducing the number of physical files and pending references as priority, these get special focus during the monthlong campaign and there is a lot of thrust also on how to convert waste to wealth.","The government has earned little over Rs 800 crore from the sale of scrap during the month-long cleanliness drive conducted in October.

'AP probably revisited scheme due to Centre's reluctance to fund it'

VIJAYAWADA: The Chandrababu Naidu-led Andhra Pradesh government has scrapped the contentious Polavaram-Banakacherla irrigation project, which neighbouring Telangana has been opposing, and is planning a new one by utilising Godavari's surplus water to make Rayalaseema region drought-free, reports Samdani MN.The Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt in Telangana has claimed the Banakacherla project would deprive it of its rightful share in Krishna and Godavari river waters. It has also said the Polavaram backwaters pose a serious inundation threat for its villages and infrastructure.The new project plans to take water from Polavaram to Nallamala Sagar, which is part of the Veligonda project in Prakasam district. The scheme is estimated to cost Rs 58,000 crore as against Rs 90,000 crore required for the Banakacherla project.The water resources department has officially revoked all tenders called for the detailed project report. Sources said Centre's reluctance to fund the ambitious Banakacherla scheme seemed to have prompted state govt to revisit it.As per the revised plan, the latest draft proposal has suggested pumping of water from the Polavaram project to the Prakasam barrage and from there, a separate canal would be built to link it with the Nagarjuna Sagar's right canal.Then, water will be taken to Bollapalli reservoir near Vinukonda and from there channelled directly into the Nallamala Sagar reservoir, a key component of the ongoing Veligonda Project.Surplus flows will be diverted to the Somasila reservoir as needed. Banakacherla phase will be considered at a later stage, depending on the completion of the initial phase. The shift reflects a recalibration aimed at accelerating water security for Rayalaseema while avoiding protracted delays and inflated expenses, officials said.","Andhra Pradesh has scrapped the contentious Polavaram-Banakacherla irrigation project, which neighbouring Telangana has been opposing.

‘Don’t turn away’: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat says India must chart path amid US tariffs; pushes for upholding values,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-turn-away-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-says-india-must-chart-path-amid-us-tariffs-pushes-for-upholding-values/articleshow/124036835.cms,"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwa. (Pic credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said India must chart its own path of development rooted in its sanatan values to overcome challenges amid US decisions on tariffs and immigration.Speaking at a book launch event, Bhagwat said the present situation confronting India and the world is the result of a ""fragmented vision of development and happiness"" that has dominated for the past 2,000 years. ""We can't turn our backs on the situation. We must do whatever is necessary to get out of it well. But we can't proceed blindly. We need to chart our own path,"" he said.""So we need to chart our own path. We will find a way out. But inevitably, we will have to face all these things at some or other point in future again. Because in this fragmented vision, there is an 'I' and the rest of the world, or 'we' and 'them',"" he added.Outlining India's traditional outlook, Bhagwat stressed the four goals of life — artha (wealth), kama (desire and pleasure), and moksha (salvation) bound by dharma.The RSS chief also recalled a conversation with ""a gentleman from America"" three years ago about Indo-US cooperation, where the emphasis was repeatedly on safeguarding ""American interests.""Bhagwat said such self-serving approaches inevitably fuel conflict.""Everyone has different interests. So, conflict will continue. Then again, it's not just the nation's interests that matter. I also have an interest. I want everything in my hands,"" Bhagwat said.""The one who is at the top of the food chain will eat everybody, and living at the bottom of the food chain is a crime,"" he added.On environmental commitments, Bhagwat said India has been the only nation to consistently fulfil its pledges. ""If we had to fight in every confrontation, we would have been fighting continuously from 1947 to today. But we endured, we prevented war, and even helped those who opposed us,"" he added.Bhagwat said if the country aspires to become a vishwaguru (global teacher) and vishwamitra (friend of the world), it must embrace its traditional worldview.""If we want to manage this, we will have to think from our own perspective. Fortunately, our country's outlook is traditional. This outlook on life is not old; it is 'sanatan' (eternal). It is shaped by the experiences of our ancestors over thousands of years,"" he said.""Our approach hasn't cancelled artha and kama. On the contrary, it's compulsory in life. The four goals of life include wealth and work. But it's bound by Dharma. Dharma doesn't mean method of worship.""And the law that oversees all this is natural law, ensuring that no one is left behind. Follow it. Follow its discipline,"" he added.","Mohan Bhagwat says India must chart its own path of development rooted in its sanatan values.

PM Modi Calls For Self-Reliance As Tensions With U.S. Continue; Lauds GST Reforms | WATCH

NEW DELHI: Congress lashed out at govt on Sunday, alleging that PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Sunday evening to claim ""sole ownership"" of amendments made to GST regime by GST Council. Calling the latest reforms ""inadequate"", the party said the PM's talk of a ""savings festival of Rs 2.5 lakh crore"" was like ""applying band-aid after inflicting deep wounds"".The party has sought that govt apologise to the public for imposing GST on essential items. In a post on X, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge criticised the PM by citing a Hindi proverb, 'nau sau choohe khakar billi haj ko chali' ('After committing many sins, the cat goes on a pilgrimage'). ""Instead of the simple and efficient GST of Congress, your govt imposed 'Gabbar Singh Tax' by collecting from nine different slabs and collected more than Rs 55 lakh crore in eight years,"" he alleged.""Now you are talking about putting a simple band-aid after inflicting deep wounds on the public by talking about a 'savings festival' of Rs 2.5 lakh crore! The public will never forget that you collected GST on pulses, rice, grains, pencils, books, treatment, farmers' tractors, etc.Your govt should apologise to the public!"" he added.Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said, ""PM addressed the nation today to claim sole ownership of the amendments made to GST regime by GST Council, a constitutional body."" He went on to say that Congress has long argued that GST has been a ""Growth Suppressing Tax"". ""We have been demanding a GST 2.0 since July 2017. This was a key pledge made in our 'Nyay Patra' for 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" he added.Holding that the latest ""GST reforms are inadequate"", Ramesh stressed that the key demand of states ""made in true spirit of cooperative federalism - namely, extension of compensation for another five years to fully protect their revenues - remains unaddressed"".In a scathing attack posted on X, Congress' Supriya Shrinate said, ""Modi ji is cursing the old GST as if someone else had implemented it. You yourself imposed Gabbar Singh Tax and collected it for eight years. Have you forgotten?""Other outstanding issues enumerated by Ramesh include widespread concerns of MSMEs that, he said, must be ""addressed meaningfully"". ""Sectoral issues that have surfaced - for instance in textiles, tourism, exporters, handicrafts and agricultural inputs - must be tackled,"" he said, adding, ""States should be incentivised to move towards introduction of state-level GST to cover electricity, alcohol, petroleum, and real estate as well. """"Whether this round of GST changes - delayed by eight years - will actually boost private investment that is essential for higher GDP growth remains to be seen. Meanwhile, trade deficit with China has doubled in past five years to cross $100 billion.

Who is Aryan Maan? Hansraj Graduate and ABVP’s Newly Elected DUSU President 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/who-is-aryan-maan-the-hansraj-graduate-and-abvp-elected-dusu-president-2025/articleshow/123994789.cms,"Aryan Maan of ABVP wins DUSU presidential elections 2025.

Early roots in Bahadurgarh

Graduation at Hansraj College

Pursuing postgraduate studies at Delhi University

Beyond classrooms: Sports and student activism

Campaign promises and vision as President

The student politician as a product of DU’s ecosystem

Aryan Maan has secured a major win in Delhi University politics by being elected President of the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) 2025. Representing the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ABVP ), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Maan’s victory reflects both his grassroots connect and the organisational strength of ABVP on campus. His journey from Bahadurgarh, Haryana, to the capital’s premier university system underscores the diverse social and academic backgrounds that shape Delhi University’s leadership.Born and raised in Bahadurgarh, Haryana, Aryan Maan’s student leadership stems from a background shaped by regional aspirations and a keen interest in youth mobilisation. His roots outside Delhi resonate with the significant number of students in the university who migrate from across India for higher education. This has also influenced his campaign themes of accessibility, affordability, and infrastructure reforms.Also See: Aryan Maan wins DUSU 2025 presidency as ABVP dominates Delhi University student elections Maan’s academic journey within Delhi University began at Hansraj College, where he pursued his undergraduate studies. He completed his B.Com degree in 2025, building a reputation not only as a diligent student but also as an active voice in campus debates. Hansraj, known for producing leaders in academia, politics, and business, gave him both the platform and networks to step into active student politics.Currently, Aryan Maan is enrolled in a Master’s programme in Library Science at Delhi University. This choice of discipline sets him apart from the conventional law, commerce, or political science tracks pursued by many student leaders. It also reflects his long-term academic interest in research, knowledge systems, and access to learning resources.Maan is also known as a football player, adding a sporting dimension to his personality. His active participation in athletics has contributed to his appeal among students who look for well-rounded leaders. Parallel to sports, his involvement in ABVP-led campaigns—ranging from protests against fee hikes to initiatives for improved campus infrastructure—strengthened his reputation as a hands-on organiser rather than a symbolic candidate.Also See: Who is Rahul Jhansla? The SBSC grad and law student who became DUSU Vice President 2025 For the 2025 DUSU elections, Aryan Maan outlined a set of promises centred on enhancing the student experience. These include subsidised metro passes, free Wi-Fi across campus, accessibility audits to support students with disabilities, upgraded sports facilities, and financial assistance for final-year research scholars. Now, with his election as DUSU President, the challenge will be in translating these commitments into concrete outcomes.Aryan Maan’s trajectory underlines how Delhi University continues to serve as a breeding ground for India’s next generation of leaders. With his blend of academic pursuit, athletic involvement, and grassroots activism, he represents a modern model of the student politician: one grounded in local roots, shaped by the university’s plural environment, and aspiring for a larger role in shaping youth-centric policy debates.","Aryan Maan has secured a major win in Delhi University politics by being elected President of the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) 2025.

Poll Do you think Paramjit's detention is justified based on his past infraction? Yes, he should face consequences. No, the punishment is too harsh.

Kept inside airport for five days, taken to emergency room

'We are lost,' says Paramjit's brother





Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now. Paramjit is a green card holder and has been doing business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for the last three decades. He was detained at Chicago O'Hare Airport on July 30 as he was returning from a trip to India, as he makes trips to India several times a year.Singh's attorney Luis Angeles toldthat his detention was absolutely illegal and that the government is increasing his health risks as Singh has a brain tumor and heart issues.But why was Singh arrested in the first place? His attorney and family members said that the government cited an incident from the past when Singh used a pay phone without paying. It was a ""minor infraction for which he has already taken full accountability, served his time, and paid his debt to society,"" Angeles said.Also read: EB-5 investment visa cap reached for 2025, green card route paused till September 30 Narrating the harrowing details of what happened since Singh was detained, his family members revealed that he was kept inside the airport for five days. His health condition deteriorated to the point where he had to be taken to the emergency room. His family was not notified about his health and they only came to know when the ER bill was sent to them.""As a lawful permanent resident (green card holder), Mr Singh should never have been detained in the first place, as he has always followed the rules to the letter. We often hear the mantra of ""follow the rules"" to achieve legal status in this country. Well, that's exactly what he did: he entered the United States lawfully, adjusted his status properly, built his American dream through hard work, and has been a significant contributor to his community,"" his attorney said.Paramjit’s brother Charanjit Singh told WPTA that they were trying to post the bond after he won the bond hearing, but alleged that the DHS was using delaying tactics to keep him in detention. ""We're just trying to post the bond, we're just trying to speak to someone, trying to communicate with someone. We're lost,"" the brother said.","Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now.

"Appointed, ignored & unpaid: Meet India's 'invisible' teachers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/appointed-ignored-unpaid-meet-indias-invisible-teachers/articleshow/124033011.cms,"In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer - on paper. Forty-two years later, he's still waiting for his first salary. The appointment letter, issued by Sanjay Gandhi Mahila College in Gaya, promised pay and service conditions on a par with university faculty. What followed was four decades of unpaid teaching, no employee ID, no pension - just a man showing up to class every day with a PhD and no payslip.""I taught, I evaluated papers, I invigilated exams,"" he said. ""But officially, it's as if I was never there."" His only proof is a fading sheet of paper from 1983 and a lifetime of unacknowledged labour.Last month, in a sharply worded verdict, Supreme Court ruled that 18 assistant professors in Gujarat - hired on contract and paid far less than their regular colleagues - had been denied basic constitutional protections. The bench, led by Justice Abhay S Oka, invoked a line familiar to nearly every Indian classroom: ""Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara."" The words, the court said, mean little if teachers are paid a pittance. Alam and thousands of haplesss teachers like him would know.The truth is harder than what the verdict suggests: in places far from Gujarat, and in classrooms that do not appear in affidavits, teachers still work for Rs 3,000 a month.Or Rs 1,000. Or nothing at all.Alam lives in a rented two-room flat in Gaya, where the plaster peels and the only reliable light comes from a window that faces the street.Every morning, Alam folds his PhD certificate back into a drawer, picks up the same well-thumbed books he has taught from for years, and steps out toward a college that never recognised him as its own. His wife, Shamsun Nisa, said the only income now comes from occasional evaluation work during university exams. “Even private tuition stopped after Covid,” she said. “People think he’s too broken to teach. But he still reads. He still steps out in the morning dressed for work.”He began teaching English there in 1983, just after completing his master’s from Magadh University. Though formally hired under university-approved terms, the college denied him regular employee status. “When I asked for a salary,” he said, “they told me I was just a part-time teacher.” Magadh University, in response to an RTI application, confirmed Alam had indeed been appointed as regular faculty. In 2023, the state’s higher education director directed the university registrar to take necessary action. Nothing changed. “I couldn’t afford lawyers,” Alam said. “Sometimes I couldn't afford two meals a day.”India’s education system — vast, decentralised, often romanticised — rests on people like Alam. People who carry attendance registers without knowing whether they’ll be compensated for it. People who prepare lectures, invigilate exams, sign logbooks, evaluate answer sheets, and still have to take private tuition just to afford a sack of rice. Alam is not the only oneThe numbers alone tell a story that’s difficult to look away from. There are more than 10,000 teachers in 220 unaided affiliated degree colleges across Bihar. At Banwari College, commerce lecturer Deepak Kumar Singh teaches every day. His salary last year was Rs 9,000. In 2022–23, it was Rs 21,000. Before that, for four consecutive years, he received nothing. “No holidays, no leave. We come, we teach,” he said. “We mark attendance on the biometric machine like everyone else. ” The biometric scanner at the entrance does not care whether its data leads to a pay slip.Others never got even that far. Shankar Bhagat, who taught ancient Indian history in the same college, died of liver cirrhosis without treatment. Another colleague, Mukesh Kumar Mishra, is battling cancer in Muzaffarpur. His salary wasn’t enough to even consider a private hospital. “These are PhD holders,” said Arun Gautam, a senior teacher and media-in-charge of the Federation of Affiliated Degree College Teachers’ Associations of Bihar.This neglect, over time, has ossified into routine. A 2013 policy promised performance-based grants to unaided institutions — linking funding to student outcomes. But funds were never consistently released. Today, teachers are paid, if at all, from the internal revenues of their colleges: exam fees, certificate charges, hostel deposits. Many have no formal employment letters. Some earn barely Rs 1,500 a month.In Gujarat, the disparities played out on official contracts — but the outcome was no less punishing. Between 2008 and 2014, over 450 engineers were hired as assistant professors on fixed-term contracts. Some were placed in govt engineering colleges, others in polytechnics. They were paid Rs 30,000 or Rs 25,000, and told their tenure would end once Gujarat Public Service Commission filled the sanctioned posts.Naitik Gor was among them. He joined a govt polytechnic institute in 2013 and worked 32 hours a week — nearly double the regular load — and took on the full slate of responsibilities: practicals, examinations, even election duties. “There were no vacations, no earned leave. Same job, half the pay,” he said. In 2020, he walked away and took a position at a private firm in Ahmedabad.In 2018, over 300 contractual faculty like him went to Gujarat HC. They argued the disparity in pay violated Articles 14, 15, 16 and 19 of the Constitution. In 2023, a singlejudge bench agreed, calling it a “crying shame” that qualified lecturers, appointed by due process, were still kept on ad hoc contracts. The state appealed. Two division benches rejected its argument. A third overturned the decision. The matter reached SC.The apex court has now ruled in the petitioners’ favour. Gujarat govt has been ordered to pay arrears with 8% interest from 2015, and to align these teachers with the pay scale of regular assistant professors. But much of damage is already done. Gor said most of the original petitioners had left teaching.The erosion is not just economic — it is emotional, generational, institutional. Siksha Mitras — guest teachers recruited in large numbers in the early 2000s — were briefly regularised in 2015, drawing salaries of Rs 50,000. Two years later, the decision was reversed. Their salaries dropped back to Rs 10,000. “We were promoted, then demoted,” said Meenu Goswami, a Siksha Mitra in Bulandshahr, UP, who lives with a leg disability. She recounted at least a dozen suicides among demoted teachers in her district. “Some had loans, others lost homes. The salary cut killed them.” Shaily Sharma spent five years teaching at a small school in Amroha. She holds a postgraduate degree and a BEd. By 2015, she had become principal. Her salary was Rs 4,500 a month. “I loved the work,” she said. “But love doesn’t pay rent.” She left teaching in 2016.Teachers in Lucknow’s top-tier schools might earn Rs 60,000 or more. But those are few. Most private school teachers, even at well-known institutions, are paid Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. “Even the fancy schools don’t offer more,” said Atul Srivastava, president of the Association of Private Schools, UP.The longer-term effects are showing across Uttar Pradesh. Since 2021, there has been no recruitment of govt school teachers. Thousands of schools now run entirely on guest faculty. “There’s no pipeline anymore,” said Dinesh Sharma, president of the Uttar Pradesh Primary Teachers’ Association. “People are migrating to other states.” The National Education Policy 2020 promised to restore dignity to the teaching profession. It called for better pay, regularisation, and a clear career path.","In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer - on paper.

NEW DELHI: Amid instances of builders and their agents using “govt-style terminology” to make their projects resemble official housing schemes, the Centre has asked states and real estate regulators (RERAs) to take action to stop such advertisements to prevent buyers from being deceived. They have also been asked to submit reports to ensure the protection of buyers’ interests.Sources said there was a detailed discussion on the issue at a recent meeting of the Central Advisory Council (CAC) of RERA, chaired by housing and urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Some samples of such misleading advertisements were also shared with all members, including representatives from state govts and RERA authorities.“This has been identified as a persistent issue, and hence, there is a need to address it immediately,"" said one of the CAC members. The ministry, in its presentation, pointed out that in some cases, advertisements did not disclose the names of publishers or promoters. “By doing so, such players bypass all mandatory norms, such as disclosing specific information related to projects. It appears that many of these advertisements are being disseminated by real estate agents,” a source said.Abhay Upadhyay, a member of the CAC and president of the homebuyers’ group FPCE, has written to Khattar, emphasizing the need to crack down on misleading advertisements to protect consumers. In fact, a study conducted by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) in Maharashtra last year found that out of 2,087 advertisements, 1,027 were in violation of the norms laid down by the Maharashtra RERA.FPCE has also raised concerns about data mismatches between RERA web pages, developers’ websites, and sanctioned plans, urging the govt to implement a system to eliminate such discrepancies.",The Centre has asked states and real estate regulators (RERAs) to take action to stop such advertisements. They have also been asked to submit reports to ensure the protection of buyers’ interests. There was a detailed discussion on the issue at a recent meeting of the Central Advisory Council (CAC) of RERA.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124032235,imgsize-711336,width-400,resizemode-4/article-41.jpg"
‘Don’t let Rambo die alone like Shankar’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-let-rambo-die-alone-like-shankar/articleshow/124017909.cms,"When 20-year-old Nikita Dhawan heard of Shankar’s death on Wednesday, it felt as if she had lost a close family member. For years, she had fought for the rescue of Delhi’s only African elephant, kept in solitary confinement at the city zoo.Now, she hopes Shankar’s passing will prevent a similar fate for Rambo, the only remaining African elephant in captivity at Mysuru Zoo.Dhawan first saw Shankar four years ago on a trip to Delhi Zoo with her parents, and felt something shift inside her. The elephant, one of two brought to India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe, stood alone, his feet bound with metallic chains. His companion had died in 2001, and since then, the elephant named after former Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma lived in isolation — a cruel fate for a species known for their social nature and desire for companionship.“At that time, he was chained for 17 hours a day. He was also in the proximity of trains, which was very harmful to his ears. He was showing a lot of stressful behaviour,” she said.Dhawan, whose love for wildlife stemmed from the many trips she made with her parents to sanctuaries, decided to channel her heartbreak into action. She started a non-profit called Youth for Animals to mobilise support and help Shankar get out of the zoo.Soon, other young volunteers joined, filed RTIs and sent letters to the Delhi Zoo and the Prime Minister. They also gathered video evidence of his physical and mental state. In 2022, they officially filed a public interest litigation in Delhi high court.“An inspection report for Shankar was ordered, but it was not done by an independent third-party. So, we didn’t feel like the results accurately reflected his condition,” Dhawan says. It was decided that Shankar would be kept at the zoo. Then, in March 2023, the Supreme Court increased the jurisdiction and powers of a high-powered committee led by Justice (retd) Deepak Verma, to conduct necessary checks and fact-finding exercises concerning wild animals, including those in captivity, across India. That brought hope to Dhawan, and she focused on getting transfer options ready for Shankar.“We knew something had to be done urgently. Elephants are very social animals, and you can’t just rip them out of the wild and make them live on their own. For nearly 13 years, Shankar had no visual or oral communication, even with the other Asian elephants at the zoo,” says Dhawan.UK-based Aspinall Foundation, which runs multiple sanctuaries across Africa, agreed to shift the lonely elephant, and take care of the expenses too. However, the domestic authorities wanted to keep Shankar in India, Dhawan says. Hence, the search for a domestic alternative began. Last summer, she visited Vantara, the animal rescue arm of Reliance Foundation in Jamnagar, which expressed interest in housing Shankar alongside other African elephants. “We sent that option to the high-powered committee, but received no response,” she says.Meanwhile, pressure began to mount on the Delhi zoo authorities. In Oct 2024, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums suspended its license over concerns about Shankar’s living conditions. The body asked the authorities to either improve the conditions or relocate him. However, before that could happen, Shankar passed away at the age of 29, years before the species’ average life expectancy of 70. An inquiry has been ordered into the cause of the death, while zoo officials claim that Shankar showed no signs of illness and the collapse was sudden. “I feel that the zoo had the option and the funding to make a better life for Shankar, but they chose not to take it. I do believe his death was preventable,” Dhawan emphasises.Currently studying at Stanford University, she hopes that the death will urge more Indian youngsters to speak up against the exploitation of animals for public entertainment. Her focus is now Rambo, the African elephant in Mysuru who has been alone since 2016 following the death of his father. “I really hope that Shankar’s death highlights the need to save Rambo before it’s too late.”","Shankar, Delhi's only African elephant, died on Wednesday at the age of 29.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 5pm on Sunday, the PMO confirmed earlier in the day.The PMO did not disclose the topic of the address.With Navratri beginning and GST reforms set to take effect from Monday, the PM's address on the eve of these events is expected to focus on the economic changes.He may also highlight his recent appeals to use ""Swadeshi"" products, promoting an 'Atmanirbhar' India in response to Donald Trump’s 50% tariff on India.Over his more than ten years in office, PM Modi has often addressed the nation to announce major decisions, from demonetisation to military operations. These speeches have served to inform citizens, explain government initiatives, and highlight major national milestones.On this day, PM Modi addressed the nation to announce the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.

NEW DELHI: Popular singer Zubeen Garg will be cremated with full state honours on September 23 at a village near Guwahati, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.The decision to cremate Garg at Kamarkuchi NC village was taken during a cabinet meeting, considering the family's wish that his last rites be performed at a place in or around Guwahati, Sarma said at a press conference.There were also demands from the people of the Upper Assam town of Jorhat, where the singer had spent his formative years, that he be cremated there, he said.''We discussed both the proposals. Zubeen does not belong to the government, and so his family's choice should be given priority,'' Sarma said.His wife Garima Saikia Garg and sister Pamle Borthakur pointed out that it would not be possible for his 85-year-old ailing father to go Jorhat for the last rites and even later during anniversaries or other rituals, it would be difficult for the family to go there, the CM said.''Three of my cabinet colleagues - Ranoj Pegu, Keshav Mahanta and Bimal Borah - and also a delegation of the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) had discussed the matter with his wife and she had conveyed the family's decision to hold the last rites in Guwahati'', Sarma said.Besides, Garg had lived in Guwahati for the most part of his life, he added.''We, however, respect the sentiments of the people of Jorhat, with the Cabinet deciding that his ashes will be immersed there and a memorial will be built there,'' Sarma said.Regarding the request of the people of Jorhat to at least take Garg’s mortal remains there for one last time, the CM said that his body was not in a condition to be taken there and again brought back to Guwahati for cremation.A memorial will also be built at the place where he will be cremated near Guwahati, he added.The cremation site encompasses 3.3 acres of government land where some local people had set up a plant nursery, and they eagerly gave it for Garg’s funeral, he said.The CM said that he had visited the site while returning from Delhi on Sunday and will go there again on Sunday night to review arrangements for the cremation.He said that the place can accommodate around 5,000 people and appealed to Garg's fans to pay their last respects to him at the Arjun Bhogeswar Baruah Sports Complex, where his body will be kept till the morning of September 23.The state government had declared a three-day mourning till September 22, but it has been extended by another day for his cremation, the CM said.On the day of the cremation, the highway adjacent to the site of the last rites will remain closed for heavy vehicles.Sarma also said the Singapore government has issued the singer's death certificate, which states that he died due to drowning.''The Indian High Commission in Singapore has sent us the death certificate, and we have also requested that the postmortem report be also sent to us at the earliest,'' Sarma added.Garg died in Singapore while swimming in the sea on Friday.Regarding the investigations into the case registered by the CID following Zubeen's death, the CM said that statements of those who filed multiple FIRs against the two accused are being recorded.Both the accused - North East India Festival (NEIF) Chief Organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta and the singer's manager Siddhartha Sharma - are now not here, and ''my top priority now is to ensure Zubeen's last rites are conducted smoothly,'' he said.Besides, the place of occurrence is Singapore, so the police of that country will investigate the case, and ''we can only look into whether he was taken there as a part of a conspiracy'', Sarma said.''We shall proceed step by step, but let me first fulfil my duty and responsibility of giving Zubeen the farewell he deserves with dignity and respect,'' the CM said.","Zubeen Garg will be cremated with full state honours on September 23 at a village near Guwahati, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.

In a significant milestone for the ambitious undersea tunnel project between BKC and Shillphata, the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) has successfully achieved a breakthrough for its 5 km tunnel stretch.This critical section, which runs 4.881 km, notably includes a challenging 7 km segment beneath the Thane Creek. Tunneling commenced in May 2024, and on July 9, engineers celebrated the first breakthrough for a continuous 2.7 km section, connecting the ADIT to the Savali shaft.With this achievement, excavation is now complete between the Savali shaft and the tunnel portal at Shillphata, paving the way for the tunnel's integration with the viaduct segment of the Mega Airport High-Speed Rail (MAHSR) project. To accelerate the process, an Additional Driven Intermediate Tunnel (ADIT) was constructed, enabling simultaneous excavation from both Ghansoli and Shilphata sides.The remaining 16 km of tunnelling will be executed using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs). The tunnel will be a single tube tunnel of 13.1 meters in diameter to accommodate twin track for both up and down lines.Comprehensive safety measures have been implemented at the site, including ground settlement markers, piezometers, inclinometers, and strain gauges to ensure safe and controlled tunnelling activities without disturbing nearby structures.Proper arrangements were made to restrict access to the tunnel construction sites, preventing unauthorised entry and ensuring the safety of workers within the sensitive and complex construction environment. Provisions were made for pumping fresh air inside the tunnel for the construction workers.India's first 508 km long Bullet Train corridor, connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad, is making significant progress. Out of the total length of 508 km, 321 km of viaduct and 398 km of pier work have already been completed.Additionally, all 17 river bridges and 9 steel bridges have been finished. To enhance noise control, more than 400,000 noise barriers have been installed along a 206 km stretch. The construction of 206 km of track bed has also been completed, alongside the installation of over 2,000 OHE masts, which cover approximately 48 km of the mainline viaduct.Currently, excavation work is ongoing for 7 mountain tunnels located in Palghar district.Meanwhile, the superstructure work on all stations in Gujarat is at an advanced stage, and construction has commenced on all three elevated stations, with base slab casting in progress at the Mumbai underground station in Maharashtra.","Austrian tunnelling method achieves milestone breakthrough in BKC-Shillphata undersea tunnel project.

Smoke from a funeral pyre over 3,700 years ago left behind a trail of charcoal. That faint trace, sealed inside a terracotta sarcophagus buried in Kilnamandi village of Tiruvannamalai district, has now rewritten Tamil Nadu's ancient past. Radiocarbon analysis in a US laboratory dated the deposit to 1692 BCE, placing this burial in the late Harappan age and hinting at trade links between southern India and regions as far away as Gujarat and Maharashtra.Burial offerings scattered around the stone coffin tell their own story. Etched carnelian beads, once prized in Harappan centres, lay beside graffiti-inscribed potsherds. ""Carnelian beads were available in Maharashtra and Gujarat regions. So, it clearly establishes a trade contact with the north during the later Harappan period,"" said K Rajan, professor and academic adviser to Tamil Nadu State Dept of Archaeology (TNSDA).Harappan or Indus Valley Civilization is generally dated between 3300 BCE and 1300 BCE. Rajan said the new dating also pushes TN's graffiti tradition further back. ""The grave goods contain graffiti-bearing pots, which indirectly places the date of the graffiti marks in TN to the 17th century BCE,"" he said.Symbols carved onto the shoulders of the pots include fork-like shapes, semi-concentric circles in a U-formation, and vertical strokes with wavering lines superimposed.Excavators G Victor Gnanaraj and M Suresh said in their field report that some graffiti appeared restricted to specific burials, suggesting they could belong to members of the same clan.A larger study by Rajan and TNSDA joint director R Sivanandam examined 140 archaeological sites and found striking parallels between TN graffiti and markings at Indus Valley locations - nearly 90% shared similarities. ""The AMS date of the sarcophagus gives authenticity to our study on graffiti marks,"" Sivanandam said.Objects unearthed at Kilnamandi, including iron tools and pottery finds, add to the picture of a complex society. State archaeology minister Thangam Thennarasu released on Saturday this AMS-dating result, one among 139 scientific dates collated by the department, alongside preliminary excavation reports at Keeladi near Madurai.",Radiocarbon analysis in a US laboratory dated the deposit to 1692 BCE.

Supreme Court Says Flaws In Bihar SIR Can Nullify Exercise; Ruling To Extend Across The country

Latest state poll rolls uploaded, mapping work underway

NEW DELHI: All states and Union territories (UTs), except Bihar , have been given time until September 30, 2025, by the Election Commission (EC) to complete mapping of their current electors with those who figured in the rolls published after the last intensive revision in the state/UT over two decades ago.This, sources said, indicates possible announcement of rollout of a nationwide special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by EC in early Oct, with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date.Sources said that though the EC, at its meeting with all state/UT chief electoral officers on Sept 10, had asked them to finish over the next 10-15 days preliminary activities for a nationwide SIR, with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date, the deadline was extended to Sept 30 after some states sought more time.The chief electoral officers (CEOs) of all states/UTs have already uploaded the electoral roll from last intensive revision on their respective websites. All electors included in the roll on the date of issue of the nationwide SIR order by EC will be given enumeration forms by booth level officers (BLOs), and whoever signs and submits the form, with or without documents as required, either directly to the BLOs or through the parties' booth-level agents (BLAs), will be included in the draft roll.""The pre-SIR activities undertaken by the states/UTs identify electors who were there in the rolls from the last intensive revision, and they shall be presumed to be citizens, as will their children, and do not need to submit any documents. They may constitute 50-60% of the current electorate; it is only the remaining 40% of electors that the BLOs will need to focus on for making house-to-house visits and collecting their enumeration forms along with documents to prove their citizenship,"" said an Election Commission functionary.The EC had written to all state/UT CEOs on July 5, 2025, asking them to begin preparations for a Bihar-like SIR exercise with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date.The states/UTs have since been busy with the digitisation and uploading of electoral rolls from the last intensive revision on the CEO's website, mapping electors in the roll from last SIR with the current roll, rationalisation of polling stations to cap electors at 1,200 and the training of officials involved in SIR.The special summary revision undertaken at the end of each year, with Jan 1 of the following year as the reference date, usually begins with pre-revision activities in Aug-Sept, followed by publication of draft roll in Oct-end, the filing of claims and objections by Nov-end and their settlement by Dec-end.

'With lower GST rates, fulfilling personal dreams will get easier for citizens'

'Buy swadeshi, sell swadeshi'

NEW DELHI: On the eve of the month-long festival season, which begins with the first day of Navratri, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday made a strong pitch for people to take advantage of the ""Bachat Utsav"" (savings festival) starting Monday, when the next generation GST reforms roll out, helping reduce prices, lower compliance and accelerate India's growth story.In a special address to the nation ahead of the rollout of the GST reforms, the PM also made a strong pitch for promoting 'swadeshi' goods and urged people to liberate themselves from ""the dependence on foreign goods"" and buy products that are 'Made in India'.""Tomorrow, on the first day of Navratri, at dawn, the next generation of GST reforms will be implemented. From tomorrow, the 'savings festival' begins. Your savings will increase, you will be able to purchase your preferred items more easily. With lower GST, it will be easier for citizens to fulfil their dreams,"" the PM said.""The poor, the middle class, the neo-middle class, the youth, farmers, women, shop owners and traders will all benefit. This means that in this festive season, everyone will get a sweet treat,"" Modi said, adding that most everyday-use items will become more affordable. PM Modi listed food items, medicines, soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste and health and life insurance among many goods and services that will either be tax free or attract only a 5% tax.He said of the items previously taxed at 12%, 99% - virtually all - have now been brought under the 5% tax bracket, and noted that shopkeepers are making efforts to ensure benefits of GST rate cuts reach consumers.Highlighting that the essence of serving people is clearly reflected in the next generation of GST reforms and recalling abolition of income tax on annual income up to Rs 12 lakh, PM Narendra Modi said when income tax relief and GST rate cuts are combined, the decisions taken over the past year will result in savings exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh crore for people of the country.He said that this is precisely why he calls it a 'Bachat Utsav'.The PM said with lower GST rates, fulfilling personal dreams will become easier for citizens - whether it's building a house, purchasing a TV or refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or car - all will now cost less. Travel will also become more affordable, as GST on most hotel rooms has been reduced, he added.Modi also emphasised the responsibility of state govts and merchants in ensuring the benefits of GST cuts reached the consumer.Against the backdrop of global trade tensions, the PM said just as the mantra of 'swadeshi' empowered India's freedom struggle, it will energise the nation's journey toward prosperity.He said many foreign items have unknowingly become part of a citizen's daily life, and they often do not even realise whether the comb in their pocket is foreign or indigenous.Modi called for every household to become a symbol of 'swadeshi' and every shop to be adorned with indigenous goods. The PM encouraged citizens to declare their commitment to 'swadeshi' - ""I buy swadeshi"", ""I sell swadeshi""- and stated that this mindset must become intrinsic to every Indian. He asserted that such a transformation will accelerate India's development.The PM appealed to all state govts to actively support 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and 'swadeshi' campaigns by boosting manufacturing in their regions significantly and by creating a conducive environment for investment.He said when Centre and states move forward together, the dream of a self-reliant India will be fulfilled, every state will develop, and India will become a developed nation.","PM Narendra Modi made a strong pitch for people to take advantage of the ""Bachat Utsav"" (savings festival) starting Monday.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Experts Call Out Trump’s H-1B Visa Rules, Warn Of Impact On Indian Workers And Students





Amid taunts of TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) MAGA hardliners fumed about being let down by the White House walk-back on enhanced H-1B visa fee, complained that President Trump had chosen big tech over American workers, and demanded a more stringent reading of his executive order to keep out foreign workers they claim are taking away “American jobs. ”""Well this ruined my day. It should apply to renewals. And it should apply to transfers. And it should apply to ones that leave and return. Because if they leave and return so much - why aren't they just employed remotely? Why do they need a visa?"" a stoked anti-HIB critic wrote on X after the White House clarification walking back some aspects of the $100k enhanced fee.MAGA hardliners are also unloading on the President for backing down, pointing out that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick twice explicitly said during the White House presser that the $100k fee would be an annual fee.“This isn't miscommunication. Trump chickened out yet again,” one MAGA activist said.Although the reprieve is only temporary and partial – the 100k fee will be one-time and kicks in after March 2026 – MAGA tech activists are now taking aim at OPT programs, which allow foreign graduates to stay on in the US for training after they graduate, and L1 visas, which allow multinational companies to transfer certain qualified employees from a foreign office to a related office in the US.In the line of fire are global corporations like Microsoft and Google, both incidentally led by Indian-Americans, who are being accused of being “globalists” who are not serving American interests.“If the Trump administration truly wants to help American tech workers and STEM graduates, it needs to end the OPT program, which was created entirely through regulation. Otherwise, it isn’t serious about fixing this issue,” a US tech workers lobby group complained, asserting that companies like Google and Microsoft won’t be affected by the Trump proclamation because they source their foreign workers through L-1 visas or from those who arrived on student visas.The sharp uptick in MAGA nativism is alarming some and amusing others who see it as a sign of the US losing its mojo. Critics of the so-called “MAGA virus” are warning that shutting down the US to foreigners and immigrants risks diminishing American global primacy. “The people behind Maga are people who are not optimistic about the future of the United States. Maga is strongest where American technological development is weakest… where America is least competitive,” David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush said in one tv interview, calling the MAGA outlook “domestic bigotry that crimps your ability to be great in the world. ”But even tech titans who formerly espoused immigration and globalisation, and still lead companies that are global in nature, have been cowed into silence. Elon Musk, who last December tweeted that he would go to war to defend H1B visas, has remained silent about the new order, although his defenders say he has been in favor of enhanced fees – something his companies can afford but which may be out of reach for start-ups.", MAGA hardliners fumed about being let down by the White House walk-back on enhanced H-1B visa fee.

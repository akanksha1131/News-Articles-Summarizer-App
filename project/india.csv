Entire Sunjay assets suit can't be in sealed cover: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/entire-sunjay-assets-suit-cant-be-in-sealed-cover-hc/articleshow/124138930.cms,"Karisma Kapoor’s Kids Challenge Billionaire Dad’s Will in ₹30,000 Cr Estate Feud In Delhi HC

NEW DELHI: Industrialist Sunjay Kapur's third wife Priya Sachdev Kapur asked Delhi HC to let her submit a list of her late husband's assets and liabilities in a sealed cover. She alleged Thursday that pleadings from the partition suit were being leaked to the media and said the documents carried financial implications. The court will hear the matter on Oct 9.The case was filed by Kapur's first wife, actor Karisma Kapoor , along with their son and daughter (Kiaan and Samaira), who are seeking a share of their father's estate. Kapur and Karisma divorced in 2016.The court earlier directed Priya to produce a comprehensive statement of Kapur's personal assets as of June 12. On Sept 10, she was told to file the full list.Priya's lawyer Shyel Trehan argued Thursday that the details contained sensitive information and urged that at least two pages be kept confidential. Counsel for Karisma's children opposed the request. The HC bench said while limited confidentiality could be granted, ""the whole suit can't be in a sealed cover"".Kiaan and Samaira have challenged Sanjay's purported will and sought shares in his assets reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore. Priya, meanwhile, informed the court that they have already received Rs 1,900 crore from the family trust.","Kapur's third wife Priya Sachdev Kapur asked Delhi HC to let her submit a list of her late husband's assets and liabilities in a sealed cover.

India's forest cover expanded by mere 2.5% in 10 yrs but 'very dense' cover grew 22.7%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-forest-cover-expanded-by-mere-2-5-in-10-yrs-but-very-dense-cover-grew-22-7/articleshow/124138513.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's forest cover increased by merely 2.5% between 2010-11 and 2021-22, but the 'very dense forest' component of it grew by 22.7% during the period, indicating effective regeneration and conservation efforts, claimed the central govt's first-ever dedicated publication on forest accounting. It recorded a decline only in the 'moderately dense forest' category.Released on Thursday, the physical asset accounting showed that forest cover (very dense, moderately dense and open forest) increased from 6,97,898 sq km in 2010-11 to 7,15,342 in 2021-22, adding 17,444 sq km (2.5%) in 10 years.During the same 10-year period, 'very dense forest' (VDF) increased by 19,000 sq km (from 83,502 sq km in 2010-11 to 1,02,502 sq km in 2021-22), whereas 'moderately dense forest' (MDF) decreased by 11,071 sq km (from 3,18,745 sq km to 3,07,673 sq km). The increase was also reported in the 'open forest' category from 2,95,651 sq km to 3,05,167 sq km (3.2% increase).All lands with tree canopy density of 70% and above come under VDF, whereas lands with tree canopy density of 40% and more but less than 70% are categorised as MDF. Similarly, all lands with tree canopy density of 10% and more but less than 40% come under the 'open forest' category.State-wise data shows the highest increase of 4,137 sq km in Kerala, followed by 3,122 sq km in Karnataka and 2,606 sq km in TN in the VDF category.The forest accounting was done by ministry of statistics and programme implementation adopting the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA) Framework which is an agreed international framework for the compilation of the environment economic accounts from 2018.Besides accounting the forest physical asset, it also analysed the 'forest condition' showing the status of growing stock, carbon stock, economic value and status of regeneration. The publication claimed the condition of forests has improved in terms of biomass and carbon storage, with reduced severe degradation indicating better forest health. It, however, underlined that the ""declining regeneration and rising fire risks"" highlight vulnerabilities in forest conditions that need urgent attention.",India's forest cover increased by merely 2.5% between 2010-11 and 2021-22.

"Ensure day-to-day trials in criminal cases, SC tells HCs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ensure-day-to-day-trials-in-criminal-cases-sc-tells-hcs/articleshow/124138458.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has asked high courts to ensure day-to-day trial in criminal cases, especially important and sensitive cases, saying it has become imperative in the prevailing social, political and administrative scenario, including the style of functioning of police.Expressing disappointment over discontinuance of day-to-day trial, which was the norm three decades ago, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan said once the examination of witnesses commences in a trial, the court concerned must not adjourn proceedings keeping in mind the convenience of advocates, which has become common.Stressing that speedy trial is a part of the right to life, the bench, in its order of Sept 22, said, ""One of the significant factors contributing to delays in the justice system is the discretionary practice of noncontinuous criminal trials, where evidence is heard by the court in piecemeal fashion, with cases effectively spread out over the course of many months or even years.""While limited judicial or court resources and a shortage of available court time due to the volume of cases are often cited for the use of this discretionary practice, the costs of non-continuous trials to both parties and to the justice system as a whole can far outweigh the perceived benefits,"" it said.Asking HCs to issue a circular to every district judicial authority, SC said trial should be adjourned because of lawyers only in the case of bereavement in their families.If the accused and their counsel collusively delay proceedings, the trial court could put the accused on notice for cancellation of bail, the court said, adding that if the lawyer is behind the delay, then the trial court could appoint an amicus curiae to conduct day-to-day trial.Though SC recognised the discretion vested in the trial judge to defer or adjourn trial proceedings, it held, ""The legal position is that once the examination of witnesses starts the court concerned must continue the trial from day to day until all the witnesses in attendance have been examined.""","Supreme Court has asked high courts to ensure day-to-day trial in criminal cases.

"On 80-yr-old's plea, SC orders eviction of his 61-yr-old son",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-80-yr-olds-plea-sc-orders-eviction-of-his-61-yr-old-son/articleshow/124138246.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a case reflective of relationship issues that are unique to today's times, Supreme Court has come to the relief of an 80-year-old man and his 78-year-old wife and ordered eviction of their 61-year-old son from two rooms owned by the man in Mumbai after he failed to provide them with maintenance, as mandated under the Maintenance and Welfare of Senior Citizens Act, 2007.The octogenarian father and his wife had moved back to their native town in Uttar Pradesh after being pushed out of the properties - one room at Yadav Chawl in Yadav Nagar and another at Raju Estate, Bengali Chawl, Saki Naka -- by their eldest son who was running a business there.In July 2023, they filed for maintenance and eviction of their son from the said properties before the tribunal concerned, which in June last year directed the man to hand over possession of both the rooms to his parents and also provide them with a monthly maintenance of Rs 3,000. The son's challenge was rejected by the appellate tribunal. He then appealed against the eviction order in Bombay HC.The HC, on April 25, allowed the son's petition on the ground that the tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to pass an order for vacation of property against a senior citizen, the son being over 60 years old. The parents moved the SC against the HC order.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta termed the Bombay high court order erroneous and highlighted that the man was 59 years old when his parents moved the tribunal under the 2007 Act, which was enacted to address the plight of the elderly and to ensure their care and protection.""Being a welfare legislation, its provisions must be construed liberally so as to advance its beneficent purpose. This Court on several occasions has observed that the Tribunal is well within its powers to order eviction of a child or a relative from the property of a senior citizen, when there is a breach of the obligation to maintain the senior citizen,"" the bench said.Asking the son to vacate the two rooms in Mumbai and hand over their possession to his parents by Nov 30, the bench said, ""In the present case, despite being financially stable, the son has acted in breach of his statutory obligations in not allowing the parents to reside in the properties owned by the father, thereby frustrating the very object of the Act. The HC fell in error in allowing the writ petition on a completely untenable ground. ""","The octogenarian father and his wife had moved back to their native town in Uttar Pradesh. They had been pushed out of the properties by their eldest son who was running a business there. In July 2023, they filed for maintenance and eviction of their son from the said properties.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124138259,imgsize-79106,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"School dropout rates halved in 2 years, says govt report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/school-dropout-rates-halved-in-2-years-says-govt-report/articleshow/124138112.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's school system has recorded one of its sharpest gains in recent years, with dropout rates falling significantly across all levels, according to the ministry of statistics and programme implementation's (MoSPI) Comprehensive Modular Survey: Education, 2025.The survey, conducted during April-June 2025 as part of the 80th round of the National Sample Survey, shows that dropout rates have nearly halved within just two years. At the secondary level, the rate fell to 8.2% in 2024-25 from 13.8% in 2022-23. At the middle level, it dropped to 3.5% from 8.1%, while at the preparatory stage, it declined to 2.3% compared with 8.7% earlier.This sharp improvement signals a structural turnaround in retention, suggesting that more children are staying enrolled and completing schooling. Experts link the gains to govt initiatives such as expanded mid-day meals, targeted scholarships for disadvantaged groups, better infrastructure under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, and the flexibility introduced by the National Education Policy (NEP-2020).Yet the survey also uncovers a nuanced challenge around affordability. While more children are completing school, household spending on education has risen steadily.In rural India, the average annual expenditure per student on govt schools was Rs 2,639, compared to Rs 19,554 in non-govt schools. In urban areas, the difference is sharper - Rs 4,128 in govt schools against Rs 31,782 in private unaided institutions. Overall, 57% of students reported paying course fees, with the proportion much higher in private schools.This suggests that families are stretching finances to sustain education, even as retention improves. ""Improved retention is a success, but sustaining it requires keeping education affordable. Rising costs could become the next barrier, particularly for low-income families,"" said an official with the ministry of education.The steepest improvements were seen at the preparatory and middle levels, long considered vulnerable to socio-economic pressures. That these stages now show the lowest dropout levels is being read as proof that early interventions are paying off. But the secondary stage remains fragile, where adolescents face competing demands: household income, early work, and the absence of nearby higher-secondary schools.A MoSPI official noted, ""India is steadily moving towards ensuring that every child not only enters but also completes school. The challenge now is sustaining retention at the secondary stage, where aspirations often collide with financial realities.""The MoSPI report is particularly significant because it provides fresh national-level estimates after a seven-year gap, offering policymakers vital evidence for India's push towards universal secondary education and higher Gross Enrolment Ratios. Experts argue that if the current downward trend in dropouts continues, India could achieve near-universal school completion within a decade, provided affordability and access remain central to reforms.",India's school system has recorded one of its sharpest gains in recent years. Dropout rates have nearly halved within just two years. Experts link the gains to govt initiatives such as expanded mid-day meals. But the survey also uncovers a nuanced challenge around affordability.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124138173,imgsize-34560,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

Poll Do you think political posturing is overshadowing sportsmanship in cricket? Yes No

The Asia Cup has once again become a stage for political posturing rather than cricket . Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has sparked outrage after posting a video of Cristiano Ronaldo making a fighter-jet gesture. The act is being seen as a deliberate provocation and an attempt to legitimise behaviour that has already drawn heavy criticism.This comes on the heels of Haris Rauf’s controversial ‘6-0’ and fighter-jet gesture during the Super Four clash against India in Dubai. Rauf’s actions, aimed at Indian fans chanting “Kohli, Kohli,” were slammed across social media as cheap, classless, and unbecoming of an international cricketer. Adding to the embarrassment, Sahibzada Farhan mimicked firing a gun with his bat, showing how quickly Pakistan ’s players turned a sporting contest into a theatre of political provocation.Instead of calming matters, Naqvi has only worsened the situation. A board chairman using Ronaldo’s image to back such behaviour has shocked fans, who expect administrators to rise above pettiness. Pakistan cricket, instead of focusing on its on-field struggles, is hiding behind provocative symbolism that damages the spirit of the game.While Pakistan wrestles with controversy, India have done their talking on the pitch. Abhishek Sharma ’s sparkling 75 set up a strong total, and Kuldeep Yadav alongside Varun Chakravarthy dismantled Bangladesh to seal a 41-run win on Tuesday. With this result, India stormed into the Asia Cup final, knocking out Sri Lanka and leaving Pakistan to battle Bangladesh in a virtual semifinal for the remaining spot.Naqvi’s actions, however, have ensured that Pakistan’s cricket remains in the headlines for the wrong reasons.",Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has sparked outrage after posting a video of Cristiano Ronaldo making a fighter-jet gesture. The act is being seen as a deliberate provocation and an attempt to legitimise behaviour that has already drawn heavy criticism.

Congress Kept India In Darkness, BJP Brought Electricity To Every Village: PM Modi In Rajasthan

Main maanata hoon ki logon ne kaha ki aalu se sona hoga. Aalu se sona to nahin hua lekin hamaaree jameen se aapane sona hamen jaroor de diya.”

Banswara ke kisaanon ne suraj ki roshni se apne khet ki takdeer badal di hai

NEW DELHI: A farmer in Rajasthan’s Banswara on Thursday left the crowd in splits, and even drew a chuckle from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he took an indirect jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ’s viral “aalu se sona” remark.The exchange took place during the Prime Minister’s interaction with beneficiaries of the PM-KUSUM scheme, an initiative to promote solar energy in farming, during his visit to Banswara. Farmers from Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka joined the event.One local farmer, praising the scheme, said his long-cherished dream had been fulfilled through the installation of a solar plant on his land. Taking a swipe at Gandhi, he added: “The quip instantly lit up the audience, sparking laughter across the venue and a smile from PM Modi himself. BJP I-T department chief Amit Malviya also shared the clip of the exchange, saying: ""Prime Minister interacting with PM-KUSUM beneficiaries in Banswara. You just can’t miss the rustic sense of humour here"".The farmer referred to a 2017 remark attributed to Rahul Gandhi. A video that went viral on social media showed an edited version of the Congress leader supposedly saying he would install a machine that could turn potatoes into gold.However, the complete video later shared by the Congress showed Rahul Gandhi claiming that the remark had actually been made by Prime Minister Modi. The shorter clip of Rahul, with only the first part, had gone viral that year.The Prime Minister lauded the farmers of Banswara for turning to solar energy and leading the way in sustainable agriculture. “,” he remarked, highlighting how the scheme is helping farmers not only grow food but also generate and sell surplus energy.The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of Anushakti Vidhyut Nigam Ltd's (ASHVINI) Mahi Banswara Rajasthan Atomic Power Project (4X700 MW) worth around Rs 42,000 crore in line with his commitment to transform India's power sector to ensure affordable, reliable, and sustainable power supply.It will be one of the largest nuclear plants in the country, supplying reliable base load energy, and will strengthen India's position in environmental stewardship and the evolving nuclear energy landscape.Mahi Banswara Rajasthan Atomic Power Project comprises four indigenous 700 MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors with advanced safety features, designed and developed by NPCIL.","The exchange took place during the Prime Minister’s interaction with beneficiaries of the PM-KUSUM scheme.

(inputs from Sanjay Khajuria in Jammu)

SRINAGAR: Police detained 48 people during pre-dawn searches Thursday after four protesters were killed and more than 80 wounded when security forces allegedly opened fire to quash a violent demonstration in Leh demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.Peace returned Thursday under heavy curfew. Traffic on streets in Leh was thin, with only official vehicles moving. Alongside police and paramilitary, ITBP patrolled to enforce order. District magistrate Romil Singh Donk ordered closure of all schools and colleges for two days from Sept 26.At Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital, calm prevailed after Wednesday’s rush. Sources said four bodies were handed to families following autopsy, while recovered bullets were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory in J&K. About 60 of the wounded were discharged. One critical patient will be shifted to AIIMS, officials said.The clashes left 20 security personnel among the wounded. Protesters torched the BJP office, damaged public property, and threw stones at forces. LG Kavinder Gupta accused demonstrators of trying to set a paramilitary vehicle on fire and blamed “outsiders” and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk’s “provocative” statements for inflaming youth.Wangchuk held a hunger strike from Sept 9 for Sixth Schedule and statehood, which he ended Wednesday.Sixth Schedule in the Constitution grants tribal areas in the Northeast autonomy over land, resources and culture. Ladakhis have sought similar protections since 2019 when J&K was carved into two Union territories, including Ladakh. Talks with a high-powered committee set up by Centre in 2023 yielded only a domicile policy. Another round is due Oct 6, but delays have fuelled anger.Ladakh MP Haji Mohammad Haneefa Jan demanded an investigation into the use of bullets and pellets, calling the force “disproportionate”. Speaking in Kargil, where a shutdown was observed on the call of Kargil Democratic Alliance, he said govt delays in dialogue had frustrated youth. Kargil district magistrate imposed curfew Thursday morning.J&K CM Omar Abdullah urged restraint. “They should adopt the path of peace, and govt should pay attention to their legitimate demands,” he said, adding that authorities must examine “why such situations arise instead of blaming others”.In Srinagar, National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah rejected LG’s claims of outside involvement. “China is on our doorstep and has already taken control of much of our land. It is better to resolve the issue through dialogue,” he said.Congress veteran Karan Singh, son of J&K’s last Dogra ruler, appealed to Ladakhis to remain calm and urged govt to consider constitutional safeguards. “Inclusion in something like the Sixth Schedule seems an eminently reasonable solution,” he said.Congress functionaries from J&K and Ladakh blamed BJP and Centre for ignoring demands over land, culture, jobs and political rights. “Now indulging in blame game is part of their diversionary tactics… it is an insult to the peaceful people of Ladakh,” they said in a joint statement.",Police detained 48 people during pre-dawn searches Thursday after four protesters were killed and more than 80 wounded.

India ‘Of Critical Importance To US’: Marco Rubio After Meeting EAM Jaishankar On Sidelines Of UNGA

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Thursday, in a veiled message to US President Donald Trump, said the world cannot ignore the need for a global workforce, pointing out that many countries cannot meet labour demands from their own populations.Speaking at an event hosted by Observer Research Foundation on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Dr Jaishankar said, ""This is a reality. You cannot run away from this reality,"" adding, ""Where that global workforce is to be housed and located may be a matter of political debate. But there’s no getting away. If you look at demand and you look at demographics, demands cannot be met in many countries purely out of national demographics. ”The external affairs minister's remarks come as Indian professionals face new challenges under US President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, including a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas. Indians are the largest group using these temporary work permits.Dr Jaishankar further called for a more “acceptable, contemporary, efficient model of a global workforce” that can be spread across a distributed workplace.He said the new model will see different trade arrangements between countries. “We will see, as part of this re-engineered world, we will see countries which will make decisions which they may not have made in other circumstances, countries which today will feel the desire, sometimes even the compulsion, to have new partners and new regions,” he said.The external affairs minister stressed that trade and technology will continue to reshape international relations despite uncertainties. “For all the obstacles and complications that may arise, I also think they will be countered or mitigated… it is easier to trade today,” he said, pointing to smoother physical and digital interfaces, highlighting the success of India’s digital public infrastructure, which he said other countries find more practical than western models.Dr Jaishankar further said that in today’s global environment, countries, especially larger ones, must strengthen their capacities to become more self-reliant. He argued that multi-polarity would not emerge on its own but must be actively built through national strength and experience.",Dr S Jaishankar said the world cannot ignore the need for a global workforce.

Latest Agni-Prime test-fired from rail-based launcher,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/latest-agni-prime-test-fired-from-rail-based-launcher/articleshow/124132466.cms,"India Creates History With First Rail-Based Agni-Prime Missile Test, Has a Strike Range of 2000 Kms

NEW DELHI: India successfully tested the new-generation nuclear capable Agni-Prime ballistic missile, which has a strike range up to 2,000-km, from a rail-based launcher system for the first time on Wednesday night.With the road-mobile Agni Prime already being inducted into the tri-Service Strategic Forces Command (SFC), the specially designed rail launcher will enhance the operational flexibility, survivability and cross-country mobility of this smallest and lightest among the Agni series of ballistic missiles.“The rail launcher will allow the SFC to launch on the go with a short reaction time, along with reduced visibility to enemy forces. Rail-based launchers, for instance, can escape detection by enemy satellites by hiding in tunnels,” an official told TOI.Moreover, the Agni Prime is a canister-launch missile system like the Agni-V, the country’s most formidable missile with a strike range of over 5,000-km. In such systems, the nuclear warheads are already mated with missiles in hermetically-sealed canisters.Consequently, the canisters can be stored for longer periods without adverse weather impact, are easier to handle, and can be swiftly transported through rail or road to launch from wherever required.On Wednesday night, DRDO and SFC conducted the test of the solid-propellant fueled Agni Prime “under a full operational scenario” from the rail launcher “having the capability to move on the country’s rail network without any pre-conditions”, the defence ministry said.The missile trajectory was tracked by various ground radar stations and met all mission objectives. “This successful flight test has put India in the group of select nations which have developed canisterised launch systems from on the move rail network,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.An official, in turn, said, “The system is self-sustained and is equipped with all independent launch capability features, including the state-of-the-art communication systems and protection mechanisms.”The Agni-Prime, which incorporates new propulsion systems and composite rocket motor casings as well as advanced navigation and guidance systems, will gradually replace the Agni-I (700-km) and Agni-2 (2,000-km) in the arsenal of SFC, which also has the Prithvi-2 (350-km), Agni-3 (3,000-km), Agni-4 (4,000-km) and Agni-5 ballistic missiles.While fighters like Sukhoi-30MKI, Mirage-2000, Jaguar and Rafale can deliver nuclear gravity bombs, India is also working towards strengthening its naval leg of the `nuclear triad’ – the ability to launch nukes from the land, air and sea.The commissioning of India’s third SSBN (nuclear-powered submarine armed nuclear ballistic missiles) as INS Aridhaman will now take place early next year after some delay. The first two SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, are already fully operational.With a displacement of 7,000-tonne, the third SSBN is slightly larger than the first two and will be able to carry more K-4 missiles with a strike range of 3,500-km.While a fourth submarine is under construction under the secretive advanced technology vessel (ATV) project, there is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones, as reported by TOI earlier.",India successfully tested the new-generation nuclear capable Agni-Prime ballistic missile from a rail-based launcher system for the first time on Wednesday night.

NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry cancelled Thursday the licence issued under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 to Ladakh activist Sonam Wangchuk 's NGO, Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh, over alleged violations. Wangchuk had alleged that the govt was building a case to put him behind bars.The cancellation came hours after MHA attributed Wednesday's mob violence and arson in Ladakh to the ""provocative"" speeches made by Wangchuk with references to Arab Spring-style protests and the Gen Z outpouring in Nepal.The alleged violations include depositing locally generated funds in SECMOL's FCRA account, diversion of funds for non-permissible activities, like studying the country's sovereignty, and failure to deposit the foreign funds received in the designated FCRA account.Sources claimed even Himalayan Institute of Alternatives Ladakh (HIAL) founded by Sonam Wangchuk had received foreign remittances of over Rs 1.5 crore without FCRA registration. An amount of Rs 6.5 crore was allegedly diverted to Wangchuk's private firm Sheshyon Innovation. Sources said Wangchuk had sent Rs 2.3 crore abroad during 2021-24 from his personal account, and received Rs 1.68 crore foreign funds from 2018 to 2024 in different accounts, adding that he has nine personal bank accounts of which eight are not declared.An official said HIAL has seven accounts, of which four remain undeclared; and SECMOL nine accounts, of which six are not declared. Sheshyon has three accounts of which two are not declared. Wangchuk has been receiving huge CSR funds from corporates, including PSUs, even though he criticises them, the official said.CBI, on the request of the home ministry, is now probing the alleged violations while the income tax authorities are looking into other financial irregularities.Proceedings against SECMOL began Aug 20 with the issuance of a show-cause notice which raised the depositing of Rs 3.5 lakh by Wangchuk into SECMOL's FCRA account in 2021-22. Though SECMOL clarified that Rs 3.35 lakh were proceeds from sale of an old bus in 2015, MHA noted that the FCRA return filed by SECMOL showed Wangchuk received it as foreign donation.MHA said local funds worth Rs 54,600 were deposited in the FCRA account of SECMOL by three individuals in violation of Section 17 of the Act, which the NGO said was mistakenly transferred.An additional Rs 4.9 lakh was received from foreign donors for study on topics including sovereignty, which cannot be accepted, said MHA as it ""is against the national interest"".","Union home ministry cancels licence issued under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 to Ladakh activist Sonam Wangchuk's NGO.

The contested will



What Priya Kapur has argued



NEW DELHI: What began as a story of grief and loss with the sudden death of businessman Sunjay Kapur has quickly spiraled into one of India’s most high-profile inheritance battles. When Sunjay Kapur collapsed during a polo match in Windsor this June, condolences quickly gave way to courtroom drama. His sprawling empire, nearly Rs 30,000 crore, is now at the heart of a bitter feud involving his widow Priya Sachdev Kapur, his 80-year-old mother, Rani Kapur, and his children with actor Karisma Kapoor And the claims are only getting sharper with each passing day. In the latest, lawyers for Sunjay’s teenage children Samaira and Kiaan have alleged that their father’s disclosed bank accounts had already been ""wiped clean"".Priya has however moved a plea in Delhi high court to submit her late husband’s full asset list in a sealed cover or in the alternative, constitution of Confidentiality Club. She has cited fears of leaks and misuse. The court said filing the list of personal assets and liabilities in a sealed cover may be ""problematic"" since his two children with former wife and actor Karisma Kapoor have a ""right to question the assets disclosed.The judge has directed Priya to file a complete disclosure of Sunjay’s assets and liabilities as of June 12, the day of his sudden death.Sunjay Kapur, chairman of Sona BLW Precision Forgings (Sona Comstar), was among India’s leading auto component tycoons. His profile extended beyond boardrooms: his marriages, first to designer Nandita Mahtani, then to actor Karisma Kapoor, and finally to fashion entrepreneur Priya Sachdev, kept him firmly in the public eye.The 53-year-old industrialist died suddenly on June 12 in Windsor, England, after collapsing mid-match at the prestigious Guards Polo Club. He reportedly swallowed a bee during the polo match that triggered a fatal heart attack.At the heart of the dispute is Sunjay Kapur’s estimated Rs 30,000 crore estate, comprising shares, properties, business holdings, and family trusts.Following his death, the division of assets became a legal and emotional battleground between his widow Priya, his two children with Karisma Kapoor (Samaira and Kiaan), his mother Rani Kapur, and Priya’s own child, all seeking their fair share.The matriarch of the family and widow of late industrialist Surinder Kapur, founder of the Sona Group. After her son’s passing, Rani publicly questioned Priya Sachdev Kapur’s control over Aureus Investment and opposed her appointment to the company’s board. In a letter dated July 24, she voiced strong concerns about how affairs were being managed following Sunjay’s death.: Samaira and Kiaan are Sunjay and Karisma’s children. Both live with their mother in Mumbai. Samaira and Kiaan Raj have challenged Sunjay's purported will and sought shares in his assets reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore. Priya, meanwhile, informed the court that they have already received Rs 1,900 crore from the family trust.: A year after his divorce from Karisma, Sunjay married model-turned-entrepreneur Priya Sachdev. The couple has a son, Azarias. Priya has positioned herself as the defender of both her late husband’s legacy and her son’s rightful share in the estate, but her moves have drawn resistance from both Rani Kapur and Sunjay’s children with Karisma.Sunjay Kapur’s death triggered a flurry of legal manoeuvring. In July, Sona Comstar held its Annual General Meeting (AGM), brushing aside an emotional plea from Rani Kapur to delay the proceedings.Rani Kapur, in a letter, had asked the board to postpone the AGM by two weeks. Her reason? The family was still reeling from Sunjay’s death and critical decisions about control and legacy were being rushed through behind her back. In her letter to the board and shareholders, Rani called the AGM ""insensitive,"" accusing unnamed individuals of exploiting the family's tragedy to ""wrest control"" of the company and install their preferred nominees.Sona Comstar, however, didn’t blink. In a sharply worded response, the company said the AGM was conducted in ""full legal and regulatory compliance."" It dismissed Rani Kapur’s objections, stating that she hadn’t been a shareholder ""since at least 2019.""The inheritance battle reached the Delhi high court as Karisma Kapoor's children filed a plea seeking their rightful share.At the heart of the suit is a disputed will dated March 21, 2025, which leaves Sunjay’s entire personal estate to his widow Priya Sachdev Kapur.

NEW DELHI: After aggressive advocacy of caste census, removal of 50% ceiling on reservations and private sector quota, Congress has asserted its new branding as a ""social justice"" platform by slamming UP govt's ban on caste-based political rallies.In a little-noticed statement, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, at a CWC meet in Patna, asked PM Modi to answer how does the all-round acceptance of caste census square up with threat to jail people who come out to protest against atrocities inflicted on them. By linking the ban to UP CM Yogi Adityanath ""who has written in the past against reservations"", Kharge sought to paint caste rallies as part of protest and mobilisation rooted in caste injustices - in support for the now-banned gatherings.The reaction from the AICC chief has been stronger than the words of protest murmured by some regional parties of Mandal hue.But insiders said it is in line with the new politics, being pursued by Congress with a special nudge from Rahul Gandhi, who has found a strong ally in the party president. Since his debut, Rahul followed aggressive ""pro-poor politics"" with an element of Dalits and weaker sections. However, things took a dramatic turn over two years ago when he shifted gears to whole-heartedly embrace Mandalite fervour, with features like caste census and reservations.",Mallikarjun Kharge slams UP govt's ban on caste-based political rallies.

"In 30th reform, EC tightens Postal Ballot counting rules amid surge in PwD, senior voters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-30th-reform-ec-tightens-postal-ballot-counting-rules-amid-surge-in-pwd-senior-voters/articleshow/124126869.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday revised the rules relating to counting of postal ballots, making it mandatory for all postal ballot papers to be counted before the penultimate round of EVM/VVPATs counting is taken up.This restores the arrangement prior to May 2019, when the EC had last changed the counting guidelines to allow EVM counting to proceed regardless of the postal ballot counting stage. The 2019 change did not rule out chances of EVM counting being completed before completion of postal ballot counting.The opposition INDIA bloc had, during the 2024 general elections, objected to the 2019 rule change and demanded a return to the old system, citing cases where the margin of victory was less than the postal ballots polled. Complaining that the result in a close election may depend on the number of postal ballots getting rejected or held valid, the bloc had asked the EC to issue directions in consonance with Rule 54A of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, which says “the returning officer shall first deal with the postal ballot papers…”.As per EC instructions issued on Thursday, the rule relating to the start of counting of postal ballots 30 minutes before EVM counting remains unchanged.Announcing its 30th reform in the past six months to streamline and improve the electoral process, the EC said the postal counting guidelines were being revised in view of the substantial increase in postal ballots, thanks to the facility being extended to persons with disabilities (PwD voters) and senior citizens aged over 85 years.“Although, counting of postal ballots generally gets completed before counting of EVMs, in order to ensure uniformity and utmost clarity in the counting process, the Commission has decided that, henceforth, the penultimate (second last) round of EVM/VVPATs counting shall be taken up only after the counting of postal ballot papers is completed, at the counting center,” EC said in a statement.The Commission further directed that in cases where there are a large number of postal ballots, the returning officers shall ensure that sufficient number of tables and counting staff are in place so there is no delay and the counting process is further streamlined.","The Election Commission on Thursday revised the rules relating to counting of postal ballots.

BJP Office Torched In Leh Amid Ladakh Statehood Agitation, Police Vehicle Burnt

.

Amid violent protests in Ladakh demanding statehood, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday said BJP was opposing statehood in J&K.Speaking to the media outside his office, Abdullah said that BJP was the only party opposing the restoration of statehood. ""If there is opposition to restoring statehood, it is coming only from the BJP,” he said.The J&K chief minister said there is a growing impression in the Union Territory that the party ruling the center will not restore statehood because it lost last year's assembly elections.""Sometimes it looks like people of Jammu and Kashmir will not get statehood because the BJP lost the elections. This is an injustice because nowhere was it said that statehood will be restored only if the BJP wins,"" he said.Abdullah also said his government, which has been in office for 11 months, faced a major challenge because Jammu and Kashmir is still not a state.The J&K CM further said that the promise made to the people of J&K was not fulfilled. He said, ""The way the people were promised and the Supreme Court was informed, we expected it to be a three-step process: first delimitation, then elections, followed by restoration of statehood,"" the chief minister said.""The delimitation happened, elections were conducted and people enthusiastically participated in the polls. It was bad luck for the BJP that they did not win the polls, but people cannot be punished for that,"" he said.Abdullah later tweeted that Ladakh had been betrayed and was angry. ""Ladakh wasn’t even promised Statehood, they celebrated UT status in 2019 & they feel betrayed & angry. Now try to imagine how betrayed & disappointed we in J&K feel when the promise of statehood to J&K remains unfulfilled even though we have gone about demanding it democratically, peacefully & responsibly,"" he wrote.Parliament passed a resolution in August 2019 declaring the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 of the constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. It also proposed bifurcation of the state into two Union territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.Last month, the Supreme Court said the “ground situation” in Jammu and Kashmir must be weighed before restoring its statehood, stressing that “incidents like Pahalgam” cannot be ignored. The top court also sought a response from the centre on a plea demanding the restoration of statehood to the region.","BJP Office Torched In Leh Amid Ladakh Statehood Agitation, Police Vehicle Burnt.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe.

Antonio Brown slams Charlie Kirk coin proposal and demands focus on Epstein files

Antonio Brown says real issues are being sidelined

Fans echo frustration with political priorities

Antonio Brown has turned his attention from football fields to Capitol Hill debates, blasting lawmakers over a proposed Charlie Kirk silver coin. The former NFL star called the idea “the dumbest” distraction, arguing that Congress is avoiding bigger issues. Brown insists the real priority should be releasing the Epstein files, a demand echoing public frustration.Antonio Brown, the outspoken former NFL star, is once again making headlines—this time for calling out lawmakers over a bizarre new proposal. Reports surfaced that legislation is being filed in the U.S. House to mint 400,000 silver dollar coins in 2026 featuring conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.The planned coins would reportedly include the phrase “well done, good and faithful servant” on one side, with Kirk’s face on the other. The proposal even goes so far as to designate them as legal tender.Brown, who has built a reputation for sharp and sometimes controversial social commentary, wasted no time responding on X (formerly Twitter). He mocked the idea with a pointed message: “They’re doing literally the dumbest sh*t you can possibly think of just to avoid releasing the Epstein files 😂”For Brown, the coin legislation isn’t just unnecessary—it’s a distraction from something much larger.His call to release the Epstein files highlights a broader public frustration over government transparency. Many Americans believe these documents could reveal powerful names tied to one of the most infamous scandals of the last decade.Brown’s reaction taps into this sentiment, questioning why lawmakers spend time on symbolic gestures rather than addressing issues that could expose corruption and deliver long-awaited accountability.Brown’s comments struck a chord online, with many echoing his concerns that Washington often focuses on political theater rather than substantive action. To his critics, the coin proposal seems like an odd attempt to elevate a media figure while ignoring pressing matters.Also Read: Antonio Brown slams late-night shows such as The Daily Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live for political bias in viral post By turning the spotlight back to the Epstein files, Antonio Brown not only mocked the legislation but also amplified a conversation that continues to resonate with the public.

Micah Parsons vs Dak Prescott: A battle of respect and rivalry



Cowboys seek stability without Parsons in critical matchup



When Micah Parsons steps back into AT&T Stadium this Sunday wearing Green Bay colors, the spotlight won’t just be on his talent—it will be on his bond with former teammate Dak Prescott. The star pass rusher, now with the Packers, made it clear he plans to get after Prescott, even if it comes at a personal cost.Parsons admitted the matchup carries weight beyond football. “It’s going to be painful,” he said of sacking Prescott. “That’s my guy. He was always like a good mentor for me. But you know how it is. He always told me if I ever faced him that it'll be a great matchup, so I’m excited to see what Sunday brings itself.”Prescott, though, is hoping the “pain” doesn’t fall on him. With five sacks already allowed in three games, Dallas faces an even tougher challenge without two key linemen and top receiver CeeDee Lamb. Still, Prescott trusts his line and his preparation: “I hope it’s not (painful) for me. And I hope he doesn’t get to me… Just getting to go out there and compete with a guy that’s a good friend… I’m excited to go and have that matchup.While Parsons is eager for a “revenge” game, it’s not rooted in animosity. During his contract standoff with the Cowboys, Prescott and other teammates openly supported him. That respect has carried into this week, even as the Packers defense—with Parsons and Rashan Gary—enters the matchup with a league-leading 10 sacks.The Cowboys, meanwhile, continue to feel Parsons’ absence. Their defense has managed only four sacks this season while giving up explosive plays through the air. Defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus acknowledged the chatter around Parsons but insisted, “Our eyes are forward. We have guys in the building that we’re coaching, guys are working their tail off.”Prescott praised the Packers’ pass rush, calling it “great” and stressing how it changes the rhythm of a game. Yet, he downplayed the personal storyline. “This is Dallas Cowboys vs. the Green Bay Packers, and we’ve got to go get a win.”For fans, however, the duel between Parsons and Prescott is unavoidable. It’s a clash of friendship, loyalty, and competition—one that could define Sunday’s outcome.Also Read: Tory Horton emerging as Seattle’s breakout star and earning Justin Jefferson comparisons","Parsons admitted the matchup carries weight beyond football.

Rookie Tory Horton makes an early impact on offense and special teams

Why Tory Horton’s rise matters for Seattle’s offensive identity

The Seattle Seahawks took a bold step this offseason by parting ways with veterans Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf, signaling a new era for their passing game. While many expected Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Cooper Kupp to dominate early on, it’s rookie wide receiver Tory Horton who is stealing headlines with his dynamic play.Through his first games in the NFL , Horton has been making the most of his opportunities. He has converted eight targets into five receptions for 64 yards and two touchdowns, proving himself to be a reliable red-zone weapon. Beyond his contributions as a receiver, he has also impressed on special teams with six punt returns totaling 156 yards.That dual-threat ability has not gone unnoticed by Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. Having worked closely with Justin Jefferson during his time with the Minnesota Vikings, Kubiak drew a direct comparison between the rookie and the All-Pro wideout, saying Horton’s skill set reminds him of Jefferson’s early career flashes. For a young player, such praise speaks volumes about his ceiling.Cooper Kupp’s underwhelming start, with just 136 yards and no touchdowns so far, has created an opening for Horton to carve out a bigger role.Smith-Njigba has lived up to expectations with solid production, but Horton’s versatility and explosiveness bring a new wrinkle to the offense.With Kubiak’s history of developing Jefferson into one of the league’s best receivers, Horton is in a prime situation to grow into a legitimate star. If his early performances are a sign of what’s ahead, the Seahawks may have found their next franchise wideout.Also Read: Kenneth Walker trade prediction: Why the Patriots could make a bold move for the Seahawks running back Tory Horton’s emergence adds excitement to Seattle’s future and raises the possibility that fans could be watching the beginning of another Justin Jefferson–like rise, only this time in a Seahawks uniform.",Rookie wide receiver Tory Horton is stealing headlines with his dynamic play.

"Can't free Katara case lifer after 20-year term, Delhi government tells SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-free-katara-case-lifer-after-20-year-term-delhi-government-tells-sc/articleshow/118542041.cms,"SC: 20-year jail terms would become meaningless if state takes such stand

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday took exception to Delhi govt's stand that a convict, sentenced to life imprisonment with 20 years of jail term without remission , could not be released even after completion of the period.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed surprise over the oral submission made by the Delhi govt counsel in the case of convict Sukhdev Yadav alisa Pehalwan in the Nitish Katara murder case and asked that it be said on oath in an affidavit. It said the govt's stand might amount to contempt of the court's order which awarded a 20-year jail term.How can a govt take such a stand? Twenty-year jail terms would become meaningless. The court had said 20-year imprisonment and now the state is saying he cannot be released even after 20 years,"" the bench said.The court was hearing a plea by Sukhdev Yadav alias Pehalwan who was sentenced to life imprisonment with a caveat that it shall be 20 years of actual imprisonment without consideration of remission. He was convicted in the 2002 Nitish Katara murder case and had filed a petition seeking furlough. As his jail term is about to get over in a few weeks, the court sought the state's response on when he could be released from jail.Senior advocate Aparajita Singh, appearing for Nitish's mother Neelam Katara, said it was a life sentence with 20 years without remission which meant that the convict could be eligible for remission after 20 years.The bench, however, was not convinced and disapproved of the state govt's stand on the issue relating to freedom. ""This is the concept of liberty for the state? We will deal with it. Let your home secretary take a stand on oath after taking legal opinion. If needed we can haul up your home secretary,"" the bench said.On Oct 3, 2016, Supreme Court had awarded 25-year jail term without any benefit of remission to Vikas Yadav and his cousin Vishal for their role in the kidnapping and killing of Nitish Katara. Co-convict Sukhdev Yadav was handed down a 20-year jail term in the case.Earlier, Delhi high court, while upholding the life imprisonment awarded to Vikas and Vishal Yadav by the trial court, had specified a 30-year sentence, without any remission, to the two. It had awarded 25-year jail term to Sukhdev Yadav.All three were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Nitish from a marriage party on the night of Feb 16, 2002, and killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, Vikas's sister. Bharti is the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav who is in jail in connection with another murder case.","Supreme Court took exception to Delhi govt's stand that a convict, sentenced to life imprisonment with 20 years of jail term without remission, could not be released.

"DTC losses mounted by Rs 35,000 crore in 6 years: CAG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dtc-losses-mounted-by-rs-35k-crore-in-6-years-cag/articleshow/118541905.cms,"DTC losses mounted by Rs 35k crore in 6 years: CAG (Pic credit: PTI)

CAG points out deficient route planning by DTC

NEW DELHI: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has stated that Delhi Transport Corporation 's cumulative losses soared from Rs 25,300 crore in 2015-16 to nearly 60,750 crore in 2021-22 as it was weighed down by dwindling fleet, with 45% of buses being overage and prone to high levels of breakdown, resulting in below-par fleet utilisation.In the long overdue report, expected to be tabled in assembly by the new BJP govt on Tuesday, the auditor pointed to multiple lapses, including the transport utility's inability to augment its fleet, sources told TOI. This is the first of 14 reports that the AAP govt had refused to share in the assembly.The primary reason for the losses was DTC fares remaining unchanged since 2009, sources said, with the Delhi govt refusing to pay heed to multiple requests. The burden further went up as women were given free bus rides. The auditor also pointed to the absence of any business plan and there was no roadmap to check the bleeding and to ensure its financial viability , said sources who have seen the report.The skeletal DTC fleet, with broken down buses part of commuters' daily experience, turned into a political issue, with BJP and Congress repeatedly talking up AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal's 2015 promise to boost the fleet by 10,000.In 2007, Delhi High Court had ordered that DTC should have a fleet of 11,000 buses. However, five years later, the Delhi cabinet pegged the number at 5,500. The CAG report is learnt to have pointed out that at the end of March 2022, DTC had a fleet of 3,937 buses, of which 1,770 were overage. The low-floor buses were more than 10 years old and were due to be phased out by the end of next month.Although there was a shortage of 1,740 buses, except the addition of 300 buses in 2022, procurement was not done despite Rs 233 crore being available. It did not avail of central assistance of another Rs 49 crore under FAME-I scheme, which CAG attributed to indecision and lack of clarity on specifications. A delay in the finalisation of 300 electric buses under FAME-II resulted in the contract period being reduced from 12 years to 10 years.An ageing fleet meant that DTC could not achieve operational efficiency compared to the national average. Besides, breakdowns ranged between 2.9 and 4.5 for every 10,000 km of operations, which was seen to be very high in comparison to other state transport corporations as well as cluster buses run by private operators on contract.CAG pointed out that the performance of cluster buses was much better than that of the DTC fleet on each operational parameter, despite both operating in similar circumstances.The federal auditor also faulted DTC for deficient route planning with the state utility operating on 468 routes or 57% of the total 814 routes. ""The corporation was unable to recover its operational cost in any of the routes operated by it. As a result, it suffered losses of Rs 14,199 crore on operations during 2015-22,"" a source said.While losses soared, the Delhi govt provided a revenue grant of Rs 13,381 crore between 2015 and 2022, which left a gap of Rs 818 crore. Further, DTC did not sign an MoU with the Delhi transport department setting physical and financial targets.Further, CAG is learnt to have pulled up DTC for not implementing an automatic fare collection system and having CCTV surveillance system that remained incomplete even nine years after the project was initiated.","Delhi Transport Corporation's losses soared from Rs 25,300 crore in 2015-16 to nearly 60,750 crore in 2021-22.

Poll What Is Most Important for the Success of the Current Assembly Session? Advancing Development Projects Ensuring Financial Accountability

Will focus on making Delhi a 'viksit rajdhani': Sachdeva

NEW DELHI: CM Rekha Gupta said Sunday the previous AAP dispensation left the state coffers ""empty"", but assured that the BJP govt was ""committed"" to rolling out the Rs 2,500-per month honorarium scheme for eligible women.Addressing a joint press meet with Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva after a legislative party huddle, Gupta said several rounds of meetings had been held with govt officials on the issue in the past four days since she took over.""The condition the previous govt left for us... when we sit with officers to review the financial status... the entire govt exchequer is found empty,"" Gupta said, while replying to a question on preparations to implement the women's aid scheme. ""But giving the money to women is a routine work we have to do. We will surely implement the scheme with detailed planning. It's our commitment. We will do it 1,000%,"" the CM said.According to an estimate, after excluding taxpayers, govt servants and beneficiaries of other state welfare schemes, around 38 lakh women above 18 will be eligible for assistance under this scheme. The govt may need over Rs 11,000 crore annually for this.Giving a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500 per month to women in Delhi under the ' Mahila Samriddhi Yojana ' was one of the prominent electoral promises made by BJP in the run-up to the assembly polls.The Delhi CM said the first day of the Delhi assembly session on Monday will see the election of Speaker and Deputy Speaker followed by the newly-elected legislators taking oath. She added that the three-day assembly session will focus on discussions about development projects. ""The most important aspect of the session, as we committed, will be the laying of the pending CAG reports in the house and the previous govt must now answer the people of Delhi for the misuse of their hard-earned money,"" Gupta said, adding that all commitments made by BJP will be fulfilled.On former CM Atishi's statement that her govt followed the procedure and forwarded the CAG reports to the lieutenant governor for approval before tabling them in the house, Sachdeva said the AAP dispensation was in a habit of ""peddling lies."" ""They should be ready to reply (on CAG reports),"" he added. The assembly session is starting Monday and will continue till Thursday.Sachdeva also said that the BJP govt in the next five years will focus on making Delhi a ""viksit rajdhani"" (developed capital). ""All MLAs discussed in the meeting on how to take forward the developmental works in their respective constituencies. Our govt will complete all the projects and fulfil the expectations of the people. AAP's attempts to defame the BJP by spreading lies will be countered by the work of our legislators,"" the Delhi BJP president said.","Delhi CM Rekha Gupta says previous AAP dispensation left state coffers ""empty"" But she assured that the BJP govt was ""committed"" to rolling out the Rs 2,500-per month honorarium scheme for eligible women.

Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 crashed today

3) Markets Await Inflation Report

4) Ongoing Foreign Investment Outflow

BSE Sensex ended the day at 74,454.41, down 857 points or 1.14%. Nifty50 ended at 22,552.50, down 243 points or 1.07%.American consumer confidence hit its lowest point in 15 months during February, with inflation expectations rising amidst worries regarding President Donald Trump's proposed tariff policies, as indicated by recent data.Asian markets largely declined, following the negative performance on Wall Street from Friday, driven by growth-related concerns.Shares of Zomato, HCL Tech, TCS, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, and IndusInd Bank started lower, whilst Sun Pharma, Maruti, M&M, Bajaj Finserv, and Nestle India registered initial gains.In sectoral performance, the Nifty IT index fell by 1.8%, with LTTS, Persistent Systems, and Coforge leading the decline. Additionally, Nifty Financial Services, Media, Metal, PSU Bank, Realty, and Consumer Durables indices all opened more than 1% lower.Global markets retreated following an unexpected reduction in US services activity, influenced by tariff concerns and rising costs.

Citizens voiced worries about how President Donald Trump's tariff policies might affect their spending capacity.The US faces worries about concurrent economic slowdown and rising inflation, creating market uncertainty.

Chennai Water Safety: Govt rejects IIT Madras findings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-water-safe-govt-rejects-iit-madras-findings/articleshow/118511457.cms,"Chennai: Rejecting IIT Madras' findings, govt asserted that Chennai's drinking water sources, including lakes, are free from ‘forever chemicals' PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).A state pollution control board study across 40 locations, including Chembarambakkam lake, Adyar river, and Buckingham Canal, found PFAS levels below the quantification threshold. Govt maintained that industries near waterbodies follow strict waste discharge policies, though some samples collected between Napier Bridge and Tondiarpet contained fluoride, iron, and chloride. On the outskirts and southern part of the city, sewage mixing was detected, and steps are being taken to address it.IIT-M's study reported PFAS levels between 23 and 136 ng/L about 400 times higher than advisory limits of 0.004-0.02 ng/L. NGT principal bench in New Delhi, taking suo motu cognizance, directed TN and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to hold a detailed examination.PFAS are synthetic chemicals, commonly found in non-stick cookware, upholstery, industrial materials, and food packaging. Their presence in drinking water has been linked to serious health risks, including liver damage, low infant birth weights, hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, immune system suppression, and even cancer.While Tamil Nadu has asserted that its water is safe, CPCB informed NGT that only a limited number of studies on forever chemicals have been conducted in India. Based on past research, CPCB noted a significant rise in perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels in water samples from south India. CPCB attributed this increase to a shift in industrial production from developed nations to countries such as China and India, following the US environmental protection agency's (EPA) phase-out initiative under the stewardship programme a voluntary agreement with manufacturers to reduce and eliminate PFAS use.The tribunal noted that while Bureau of Indian Standards has yet to set drinking water standards for PFAS, this does not absolve CPCB and the Union environment ministry from establishing compliance norms under Water Act, 1974. It has added the ministry as a respondent in the case, which is scheduled for a hearing on April 29.","State pollution control board study across 40 locations, including Chembarambakkam lake, Adyar river, and Buckingham Canal, found PFAS levels below the quantification threshold.

NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: A batch of 12 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US to Panama arrived Sunday in Delhi via Istanbul on a Turkish Airlines flight, making them the first group to be sent back without restraints since three American military aircraft brought 332 deportees to Amritsar within a fortnight this month.The 12 deportees are said to be among 50 undocumented Indian nationals who reportedly arrived in Panama recently. Panama has been assisting the US in its deportation efforts.According to local media reports, the UN-affiliated International Organisation for Migration helped purchase plane tickets for people of various nationalities whose citizenship was confirmed, 17 of them Indians.

Europe-backed resolution seeks withdrawal of Russian troops

Amid high drama at the UN over the 2 resolutions that were brought in the UN General Assembly on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war – one by the US and other by Ukraine and Europe – India abstained from voting on both. Both resolutions were adopted with 93 votes in favour, as EU members seemed to prevail over the Americans in mustering support from the 193-member body for comprehensive peace and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.The voting for the US effort, which sought a swift end to the conflict, was more dramatic as the US itself abstained from voting on a resolution it had sponsored.This was because the European countries managed to successfully introduce amendments in the text. India, which maintains that it is not neutral but on the side of peace, was expected to vote in favour but the amendments meant that Indian too had to abstain.India was also among the 65 countries that abstained from voting on the Europe-backed resolution that called for just and lasting peace, and also immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. This was in line with its earlier abstentions in the Assembly on resolutions condemning Russia.India officially continues to maintain that it wants both parties involved to restart the dialogue and diplomacy process to resolve the conflict. The Trump administration has been engaging directly with Russia to end the war, keeping both EU and Ukraine out.While the defeat in the General Assembly is a setback for the US, it will look to make up for it in the Security Council, hoping that France and UK will not veto it. Both countries have not used their veto power for decades. The voting was expected to take place later in the day. With effectively just one paragraph, the US resolution seeks lasting, and not just and lasting, peace and calls for a swift end to the conflict between the 2 countries. If approved, it will be the first real resolution to be adopted by the Council on the issue since the beginning of the war. The only 1 adopted so far was days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine for a special emergency session in the Assembly on Ukraine.EU member states had sought 3 amendments in the US draft resolution, including replacing “Russia-Ukraine conflict” with “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation”.It also called for reaffirming the UN’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, including its territorial waters. The third was a mention of “just, lasting and comprehensive” peace and not just lasting peace. Russia’s amendment for addressing the “root causes” of the conflict was rejected.","India abstained from voting on the 2 resolutions brought in the UN General Assembly on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war.

BAREILLY: A drunk groom 's misstep at his own wedding in UP - in which he mistakenly garlanded his bride's best friend - set off a series of mishaps, ending with his arrest and the bride calling off the marriage.It started as Indian weddings often do - with a delay. The groom, Ravindra Kumar, 26, was late, and when he arrived, he didn't seem to be in a hurry, lingering with his friends, catching up over drinks.The 500-odd guests at a house in Naughwa Bhagwantpur village in Bareilly stayed in their seats as the bride waited. The garland-exchanging ceremony - one of those formalities that takes only a moment - was about to begin. Then, Kumar turned to the wrong woman. It was just a second. A miscalculation. But in that brief pause, before anyone could intervene, he placed the ceremonial garland over the bride's best friend.As confusion rippled through the crowd, he took the garland off and placed it around the neck of a male friend beside her. Then, to perhaps maintain a certain symmetry, he garlanded an elderly guest as well. There are moments when silence is more telling than noise. The wedding guests did not react immediately. They watched. The bride, Radha Devi, 21, did not. She slapped him and walked away. It had taken months of preparation.Omkar Verma, the bride's brother, said the family had spent over Rs 10 lakh on the wedding. He had his own theory for why things had gone wrong. ""They were unhappy with the dowry gifts. Maybe this was their way of humiliating us,"" he told TOI. ""And then we find out that he isn't even a farmer as his family told us-he's a truck driver.""At 4am, a complaint was filed at Kularia police station. By morning, the wedding was off, and Kumar was in police custody. By noon, he had apologised. His family suggested the wedding should go on. Radha refused.Circle officer Harsh Modi-used to break-ins and thefts but less accustomed to cases of misdirected garlanding-kept his summary brief. ""The groom was intoxicated. He misbehaved. His medical examination confirmed he was drunk. He was booked under sections of the Dowry Act.""","Ravindra Kumar, 26, mistakenly garlanded his bride's best friend.

Row over praise for rivals: Should Congress be wary of Shashi Tharoor?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/row-over-praise-for-rivals-should-congress-be-wary-of-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/118537166.cms,"Shashi Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor is no pushover in politics. And the Congress knows that. In October 2022, the former UN dilpomat-turned politician surprised many in the Congress when he announced to contest elections for the post of Congress president against Mallikarjun Kharge - who was the ""nominee"" of the Gandhis. Tharoor fought the elections against all odds with little support from any one in the party and managed to get 1,072 votes against Kharge's 7,897.Tharoor, who then already had the rebel tag around him as a member of G-23 (group of Congress leaders who had written a letter to Sonia Gandhi seeking reforms in the party), braved the risk of being labeled an open dissident to put forth his views on reviving the Congress - which had been on a constant decline since its shocking defeat in 2014. He batted for decentralising authority and empowering the grassroots office-bearers of the party.The former UN diplomat-turned-politician, who has won four consecutive Lok Sabha elections from Thiruvananthapuram, has once again challenged the Congress leadership with his praise for party's political rivals - both at the national and the state level.The Congress MP, who has never been afraid to speak his mind, was once again under fire for his comments praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States and his thumbs up to entrepreneurial growth in Kerala under the LDF government.As expected, the Congress pushback was strong and immediate. But Tharoor, in keeping with his combative style, instead of taking a step back took digs at the party leadership with a cryptic social media which said ""it is a folly to be wise."" The message was loud and clear - the Thiruvananthapuram MP was once again ready to fight the battle within the party.Tharoor, who was reportedly unhappy over being sidelined in the party - both at the national and the state level, had a one-to-one closed-door meeting with Rahul Gandhi and later claimed that the conversation was ""very good"" though he did not divulge any details.The Kerala Congress leader however remained defiant about his article praising the Left Front government and said he was happy that it had ‘done some good' as it had opened a scope for discussion on the issue.According to reports, Tharoor in a yet to be telecast podcast has said that he is ready to explore other options if the Congress did not need his services.What may worry the Congress that this time around there are some voices of support for the embattled leader. Echoing the sentiments of Tharoor, another senior party leader Rashid Alvi, said there was a need to bring senior and ground-connected politicians into Congress mainstream.""Congress party has many senior, seasoned, and ground-connected politicians. We should bring them into the mainstream of the party. This will make Congress stronger. If we do not bring these experienced individuals into the mainstream, it will harm the party,"" Alvi said.This is not the first time that Alvi has given a message to the party leadership. Recently when Congress contested the Delhi elections with full vengeance against Arvind Kejriwal and played a key role in AAP's defeat, Alvi had then spoken against the leadership decision to divide votes and help the BJP in process.And while Alvi was diplomatic in his attack, Sanjay Jha, former Congress spokesperson, who was pushed out of the party following airing his differences, was more direct in his attack. Sanjay Jha wrote an open post on X addressed to Rahul Gandhi explaining why he needed to bell the cat.""I am writing to you publicly here because no one within the Congress is probably going to tell you this. So as usual, let me bell the cat. Leadership ( corporate or political or any other) is about having difficult conversations. It is about trouble-shooting. It is not about living in denial; problems have to be addressed, they cannot be wished away,"" he wrote.Advising Rahul Gandhi to set the house in order, Sanjay Jha said ""We need to the hit the nail on the head going forward, but right now, we seem to be hitting our head on the nail.""Clearly, the Congress leadership in general and Rahul Gandhi in particular need to ensure that the party does not lose another popular leader because of the differences within.",The former UN diplomat-turned-politician has won four consecutive Lok Sabha elections from Thiruvananthapuram.

MUMBAI: French engineering giant Systra, which has designed and overseen the metro construction in Mumbai, has levelled allegations of corruption against senior officials of the planning agency, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), accusing them of seeking ""undue favours"" and delaying payments. Complaints, which have been communicated to the govt, include pressuring the firm to inflate orders to contractors, stalling approvals for key staff and imposing arbitrary penalties.Systra sought diplomatic intervention. In a letter dated Nov 12, 2024, the French embassy asked Rupinder Singh, resident commissioner of Maharashtra in Delhi, to intervene for the firm, which cited ""severe harassment and challenges"" while working as general consultant on MMRDA projects.CM Devendra Fadnavis said the complaint had not reached him but he would speak to chief secretary Sujata Saunik. ""Transparency is at the core of our administration. We will ensure it is restored at any cost,"" Fadnavis told TOI.In its response, MMRDA called the allegations ""baseless"" and ""a deliberate attempt to malign"" the reputation of the agency and its personnel.Systra's complaint routed through the embassy highlighted its record in executing rail and metro projects in India and said, ""Since August 2023, Systra has been facing severe problems in its daily operations, escalating to the suspension of its payments due in January 2024.""It requested that the matter be ""studied in depth"" and left it in the hands of the resident commissioner ""to resolve the situation."" It said, ""Systra is keen to work together with MMRDA for mutual benefit in an atmosphere of peace and cooperation, without external pressure.""Systra said the trouble began in Aug 2023 following a leadership shake-up at MMRDA. As general consultant for Mumbai's Metro lines 5, 6, 7A, 9, 10, and 12, and detailed design provider for lines 2A, 7, and associated depots, the company alleges that MMRDA officials began pressing for monetary benefits, which were thinly veiled as demands from higher-ups.Systra claimed ""favours"" were sought on the pretext that the ""MC (metropolitan commissioner)"" was demanding it. Systra said it informed the authority that the company ""shall not be able to do the same"".Reacting to the allegations, MMRDA said a detailed report was sought from the department concerned and submitted to govt for consideration. The report revealed multiple contractual and regulatory violations by Systra, extending beyond the initial cost overruns of 4.27% to 10% in fees, it said.MMRDA said it has issued a termination notice to Systra for various violations, including security concerns and operational lapses. ""It is important to note that the present matter pertains to a commercial dispute,"" it said. ""Unfortunately, Systra appears to be attempting to escalate this into an issue between a foreign country and an agency of the government of Maharashtra, which is not an appropriate practice.""Systra's general manager for Mumbai, Arun Mishra, said, ""We cannot comment as the matter is sub judice."" Systra has approached Bombay high court over the issue.Between Jan and Feb 2024, Systra alleges that MMRDA issued payment suspension notices, citing supposed deficiencies in already-resolved issues on line 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), 9 (Dahisar-Mira-Bhayander), 7A (Gundavli-Airport), and line 6 (Lokhandwala to Vikhroli). Additionally, MMRDA issued notices changing the scope of contractual work, alleging deficiencies in civil and systems contracts for line 10 (Gaimukh-Shivaji Chowk) and 12 (Kalyan-Taloja), issues that had already been resolved, it said.Systra said the payment suspension was lifted for lines 6, 5, 9, and 7A (systems) in June 2024 following the company's response. However, the freeze continues for lines 5, 9, and 7A (civil), with Rs 30 crore still unpaid. Systra also alleges MMRDA attempted to pressure the firm into approving inflated orders for a contractor on line 9. It said, ""Since we are not obliging... we believe MMRDA is continuing the suspension of payments for general consultant services for lines 5, 9, and 7A (civil). From what we understand, MMRDA is taking further steps to terminate the general consultant services for these contracts.""It claims similar pressure tactics are being applied to DB E&C, a German consultancy handling the general consultant contract for line 4. Systra and DB E&C are consortium partners for lines 10 and 12. Systra said MMRDA has stopped making payments on these projects, including the ones where suspension notices were revoked. Compounding the issue, Systra says MMRDA has stalled approvals for key staff, imposed arbitrary penalties, and demanded certifications for payments to minor contractors hired directly by the agency.","French firm levels graft charges against MMRDA, seeks diplomatic intervention.

It also said its annual collection is close to only Rs 2.1 crore, out of which Rs 59.2 lakh is paid as tax. It, however, justified halal certification for lipstick, tulsi water , biscuit, water bottle, etc, saying it is done to ensure that animal fat, bones or any other component has not been used in their manufacturing.Referring to Centre's statement during court hearing on Jan 20, the affidavit said, ""It is submitted that statements of Centre are completely incorrect, vexatious and scandalous. The statements are without any basis, inconsistent with the record and the pleadings sworn on oath by public officials submitted before this court. The instructing officer of govt has shown irresponsible behaviour while instructing the solicitor general to make such statements. This court may direct govt for disclosure of the fact as to which officer instructed the SG to make such statement before this court as these statements have caused serious prejudice to the concept of halal; which is considered to be one of the basic requirements of behaviour and lifestyle of a very large community of our country.""Centre had told court that 'halal' certification was not confined to food items but it was done for all sorts of products, even cement & iron bars have to be halal-certified.Responding to allegations, the trust said, ""It is submitted that the petitioner has not issued any halal certification to iron bars or cement. Govt is hereby put to strict proof for producing such certification having been granted to any of such manufacturing. However, there are few, predominantly, steel and cement manufacturing companies which produce materials to be used in preserving or protecting edible materials, like tin plates/food cans (for packaging) and are interested in doing their export for their material benefit. When it comes to making exports outside India, the importing establishments from outside India, place conditions on exporting companies that the said materials be halal certified.""The trust said halal certification is a serious issue of religious belief and practice of a large section of Indian citizenry and the same is protected under Article 25 and 26 of the Constitution and it is also related to international trade and commerce.""It is further submitted that halal certification, mostly, if not all, are consumer driven. In the process as to whether this certification is required or not, there is no role to be played by the certifying agency.

Arrested without a warrant, thrown into a van

Denied legal rights, trapped in the system

From petty crimes to murderers’ block

'They wanted money'

Seeking justice

NEW DELHI: Vasundhara Oswal , daughter of Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal , has broken her silence on her three-week nightmare behind bars in Uganda. Falsely accused of kidnapping and murdering her father’s former employee, she endured prison conditions that she calls a “gross violation of human rights.”The 26-year-old was arrested on October 1, 2024, over the alleged abduction of Mukesh Menaria , a former employee of Pankaj Oswal. However, the case crumbled when Menaria was found alive in Tanzania just days later.Despite this, Vasundhara remained imprisoned for weeks. Speaking to PTI on Friday, she recalled the horrors she faced, ""I was detained for five days, then thrown in prison for two weeks. I wasn’t allowed to shower, and they denied me food and water. My parents had to bribe police officers just to get me basic necessities.”At one point, she was reportedly denied access to a washroom as punishment.According to Vasundhara, Ugandan police raided her premises without a warrant and took her away under false pretenses. ""When I asked them to present a search warrant, they said, ‘We are in Uganda, we can do anything. You’re not in Europe anymore,’” she alleged.She claimed a male officer physically forced her into a police van when she refused to comply immediately.Forced to give a statement without a criminal lawyer, Vasundhara said she was made to pay $30,000 and surrender her passport for a police bond—yet she was still thrown back in her cell. Even after obtaining an unconditional release order from the courts, she was illegally detained for another 72 hours.Shockingly, instead of dismissing the case after Menaria was found alive on October 10, authorities kept her in prison and even escalated her charges from kidnapping to attempted murder.Initially housed in a facility for petty criminals, Vasundhara was later moved to a prison for convicted murderers and human traffickers. She spent two weeks in Nakasongola prison , fearing for her life.After weeks of legal battles, she secured bail on October 21, but her ordeal was far from over. Her passport was only returned on December 10, and the case was not dismissed until December 19.Vasundhara alleges that corrupt officials kept the charges alive even after Menaria was found, reducing them later to a misdemeanor confinement charge—all in an attempt to extort more money.""This was done to keep something over our heads and squeeze more money from my family,"" she said.Now free, Vasundhara wants the Ugandan government to be held accountable for what she calls an unjust persecution. ""This is up to the Ugandan government to correct its mistakes. We have invested in their country for years, and this is how they treat us?"" she said.As she reviews legal options, her case has raised global concerns over police corruption and human rights violations in Uganda.","Vasundhara Oswal was arrested on October 1, 2024, over the alleged abduction of Mukesh Menaria, a former employee of Pankaj Oswal. The 26-year-old was detained in a cell after providing a statement and was asked to pay USD 30,000 and surrender her passport as part of a police bond.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118503420,imgsize-58392,width-400,resizemode-4/118503420.jpg"

She also increased the private-practice distance cap from 20 km to 30 km for state service doctors (they can now conduct private practice up to 30 km from their workplace) and, in another significant decision, scrapped the suspension of seven Midnapore Medical College junior doctors (which followed the death of a young mother after a Caesarean delivery).The CM also outlined her expectations from the community: doctors should spend at least the required eight hours at their workplace and seniors should not leave patient care, including Caesarean deliveries, to junior doctors. Doctors should not have any ""political colour""; they should rise above politics and have ""only one colour (humanity)"", she said.Monday's meet, organised by the grievance cell set up by the state in the wake of the RG Kar crime and the public protests that followed it, was Banerjee's first with a general body of doctors following the August 9 incident (though she has met agitating doctors as well as other small groups of doctors in the interim). Her 40-minute speech started with a reference to the RG Kar crime: ""I extend my condolences to the family of the sister who was killed. We demand proper punishment.

More than 48 hours, still 8 people trapped after tunnel collapsed

Chances of survival very, very remote: Telangana minister Krishna Rao

'Gush of water increased and loose soil also started falling off': Survivor

Six teams of rat miners have arrived in Telangana's Nagarkurnool to assist in the ongoing rescue operation for the Srisailam Left Bank Canal collapse (SLBC), where eight workers are trapped.Firoz Qureshi, a member of rat miner's team, said that a total 6 more teams set to join their 6 teams who already arrived for the rescue of 8 more people, who are trapped after the tunnel collapsed.""I have come from Delhi, our whole team has come from Delhi, Collector has called us here. 6 of us have come here and 6 more will be coming, we are a team of 12 people. In Uttarakhand, we had rescued 41 labourers...till now, we have not received much information. As of now, we have been told that we need to go along with NDRF and SDRF teams. It will be difficult to say something until we see the situation there,"" he added.These Rat miners were previously involved in the successful rescue mission during the Uttarkashi tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand that occurred on October 31 last year.A miner from the team discussed the difficulties ahead, noting that the presence of water in the tunnel and the considerable distance would present significant obstacles during the rescue operation. Nevertheless, he remained optimistic about their chances of success."" We have come from Delhi...we will go inside along with the NDRF and SDRF teams. We will be able to say something when we see the situation inside...our 12-member team rescued the labourers when an incident took place in Uttarakhand during Diwali...we took part in the last 26-hour operation...that situation was different from here...there is difficulty as the distance where the incident has happened is 14 km from entrance point and because of water as well...it might take some time, but we hope that we will succeed,"" one of the members of the Rat miners team.The survival prospects appear grim for the eight individuals who have been trapped for more than two days in the SLBC tunnel following its partial collapse. The rescue teams continue their tireless efforts to reach them. The Indian Army, Navy, NDRF, and other agencies have faced significant challenges in their rescue attempts, having to work through dense muck, intertwined iron rods, and cement blocks.The accident occurred at the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) project in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district on Saturday morning.A substantial rescue force comprising 584 skilled personnel from the Army, Navy, Singareni Collieries, and other agencies, alongside central and state disaster response teams, has conducted seven tunnel inspections. Official sources confirm that gas cutters are being used continuously to cut through the metal obstructions.The rescue operation also employed sniffer dogs to locate the trapped individuals. However, their progress was hindered by water accumulation in the tunnel.The chances of survival of the eight persons who remain trapped in the SLBC tunnel after a partial collapse two days ago are ""very remote,"" though every effort is being made to reach them, Telangana Minister Jupally Krishna Rao said on Monday.""To be honest, the chances of their survival are very, very, very, very remote. Because, I myself went up to the end, almost just 50 meters short (of the mishap site).When we took photographs, the end (of the tunnel) was visible. And out of the 9 meter diameter (of the tunnel)--almost 30 feet, out of that 30 feet, mud has piled up up to 25 feet"", he said.""When we shouted their names also, there was no response...so, there is no chance at all,"" he said.During the ongoing rescue mission for the eight trapped personnel, survivors of the incident remained hopeful for their colleagues' safe return whilst recounting the harrowing events they witnessed.Nirmal Sahu, a worker from Jharkhand, described how on February 22 morning, they encountered a sudden increase in water flow inside the tunnel, accompanied by falling loose soil. He told PTI videos that whilst some workers managed to escape after recognising the imminent danger, eight individuals remained trapped inside.Obi Sahu, who is related to one of the trapped workers, Sandeep Sahu, mentioned that several workers sustained minor injuries whilst fleeing from the tunnel.","Six teams of rat miners have arrived in Telangana's Nagarkurnool to assist in the ongoing rescue operation for the Srisailam Left Bank Canal collapse (SLBC), where eight workers are trapped.

He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector. I feel very happy seeing that today the space sector has become a favourite of the youth. For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit. There, people lauded India's strides in the field of AI,"" PM Modi said.He also mentioned a teacher from Telangana, Thodasam Kailash, who is harnessing AI technology in digital song and music to help preserve the tribal languages, including Kolami. His tracks are being liked a lot by the tribal people.

J&K is peaceful even now but you should make sure that the peace is permanent,” he said while exhorting the children to carry back the message of peace and development that they have witnessed in rest of the country during the ‘Watan ko Jano’ tour, to their family, friends, neighbours and village in J&K.Around 250 children from J&K visited Jaipur and Delhi as part of the tour aimed at familiarising them with the social and cultural diversities of the country and bringing about an emotional connect among them. “We got a chance to visit the Hawa Mahal and enjoyed the non-Kashmiri cuisine in Jaipur,” Samriti Balraj from Reasi replied when asked by Shah about her experience. “Get your parents to visit next,” he promptly advised.Stating that he sincerely believes that “no govt can maintain peace in J&K as only its children can”, the home minister asked the young J&K visitors to convince their parents and neighbourhood that the entire country belongs to them and that terrorism should be replaced with peaceful co-existence “that is witnessed in the other parts of the country”. To make sure that his message was understood by the children, the home minister gave the analogy of a house with several rooms, saying that states/UTs are like rooms that make India and that Kashmir is one such room. “Like you visit all rooms in your house, you must familiarise with the other states/UTs as well,” he said, even persuading them jokingly to fight with their parents to plan their next family vacation outside J&K.Stating that J&K had witnessed a major change in the last 10 years, with civilian deaths down by 80% and a big push to development, infrastructure and industry, Shah said he was still not satisfied as he firmly believes that not a single Kashmiri youth should die. “Fifteen years ago there were no religious processions like tazia, schools were facing shutdowns and cinema halls were closed. In the past 10 years, roads, bridges, hospitals and educational institutions came up...we empowered the grassroots with the panchayati raj system. Stone-pelting, bomb attacks and terrorism were controlled and school shutdowns became a thing of the past...Development follows when there is peace..You should tell your family and friends that terrorism will not lead you anywhere,” he said.",Around 250 children from J&K visited Jaipur and Delhi as part of the tour aimed at familiarising them with the social and cultural diversities of the country. ‘Watan ko Jano’ (Know Your Country) programme is aimed at bringing about an emotional connect among them.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118540219,imgsize-1144546,width-400,resizemode-4/118540219.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India's technological sector is on the rise and is expected to reach $300-$350 billion in the next five years, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday.Speaking at the foundation day celebrations of IIT-Mandi , he said the biggest challenge before the country is not only to adapt to rapidly changing technology, but to create new technologies.""Don't just be adapters, become the disruptors who lead innovation,"" the minister said, highlighting the rising number of start-ups in the country. With more than 1.25 lakh start-ups and 110 unicorns, the country is emerging as the third-largest start-up ecosystem in the world, he said.The minister said India is progressing towards self-reliance in defence where it has achieved 88% self-sufficiency in ammunition production. Defence exports reached approximately Rs 23,000 crore in 2023-24 while the goal is to reach Rs 50,000 crore by 2029, he added. Today, the defence industry not only contributes to the security of the country but also supports its economic growth, Singh said.In the context of national security, Singh urged IIT-Mandi to play a more significant role in defence-related technologies. He commended the existing collaboration with DRDO and called for further contributions in areas such as AI-driven warfare, indigenous AI chip development, cybersecurity, and quantum technology.Urging students to excel in technological innovation in order to make the country developed by 2047, the minister said, ""India's telecom sector is now the second-largest in the world. With the success of initiatives like UPI, India is setting global standards in digital transactions. We are in the midst of an unparalleled digital revolution.""He encouraged students to actively contribute to the development of India's digital ecosystem, reiterating that technological innovation is central to India's growth story in the coming decades.","India's technological sector is on the rise and is expected to reach $300-$350 billion in the next five years.

HYDERABAD: Hopes for two engineers and six labourers trapped in the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel in Telangana 's Nagarkurnool district are diminishing, as more than 48 hours of strenuous efforts to rescue the eight people have come to a standstill, with rising water levels and shifting silt making the operation riskier by the hour.The eight people were trapped deep inside the tunnel when the tunnel roof caved in on Feb 22, while 52 others managed to come out to safety. By late Monday evening, family members of some of the trapped people were also flown in by the authorities.State govt, which initially considered vertical drilling and digging from the top of the tunnel, above 400 metres, has now abandoned that approach. Instead, the authorities have decided to continue efforts from within the tunnel to mitigate any potential harm to rescuers. The increased water inflow and the sudden accumulation of silt have raised grave concerns about the structural integrity of the tunnel, forcing officials to reconsider their strategy.On Monday morning, rescue teams entered the tunnel to assess the situation, only to find that the silt had increased by about one metre, to over seven metres. The influx of water continued unabated, complicating the dewatering process. Experts suspect the fresh water surge could be due to either a sudden increase in activity at the collapsed roof or the onset of a new collapse-though they have been unable to confirm this. Officials further reported that the tunnel boring machine had moved 500 metres, likely due to the rising water, and the conveyor belt used for material removal was damaged.The rescue operation remains on hold as the authorities tread carefully, awaiting more information on how best to proceed without endangering additional lives.The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) urged govt to slow down operations and proceed with utmost caution. No risks could be taken at this point, they advised, suggesting the tunnel should be observed for any further signs of collapse while the water and silt gushed in.Australian tunnel expert Chris Cooper, too, strongly urged against using gas-cutters or any form of digging, emphasising that the area near the collapsed roof remained unstable. He advised waiting for a more thorough assessment before any further action could be taken.""To gain a clearer picture of the terrain and soil conditions, govt has sent coordinates and maps to institutions like the National Remote Sensing Centre, National Geophysical Research Institute, and Geological Survey of India for further analysis,"" a senior official said.","Two engineers and six labourers trapped in Telangana tunnel since Feb 22.

THANE: Forests minister and BJP politician Ganesh Naik announced his second ' janta darbar ' in the city next month following the response received to the inaugural event on Monday, which saw over 550 applications.While political observers see this as a fresh attempt by BJP to dig in its heels in the Shiv Sena stronghold of Thane, Naik, who was also anointed as the 'sampark pramukh' for the district, dismissed any such advances and maintained he was simply following the directions given by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The idea of the darbar is to bring the administration closer to citizens instead of having them travel to the state headquarters at Mantralaya, he said. Mahayuti is working smoothly with equal participation from Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar-led NCP, he said.""I was the guardian minister of Thane for nearly three terms and conducted such darbars in the past also. I recently scheduled a public meeting in Navi Mumbai and Palghar and conducted my first darbar here in Thane. The response has been overwhelming, and citizens seem to be dissatisfied as their issues are still pending.""We resolved some issues today, while the rest were forwarded to the departments concerned. I will hold my second 'janta darbar' next month and do a review,"" he told reporters.Even as Naik openly dismissed speculation of BJP attempting to make inroads in the district, those in political circles spoke of his ambition to wield control over the region in view of his work and ground connect. ""Naik was the guardian minister for three terms but later got restricted to Navi Mumbai after Shinde rose within the region in the last few years,"" an observer said. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske refuted speculation that BJP was attempting to wrest control over Thane, saying Naik was a senior Mahayuti leader and there was no reason for his party to object to his darbars.

Chatterjee, a resident of Chandernagore in Bengal, was traveling to Gaya in Bihar for work when the accident occurred around 12.30am. While Chatterjee, seated in the front passenger seat, bled to death, at least two of her colleagues suffered injuries. Police have seized both vehicles involved in the chase, but have yet to make any arrests.Durgapur-Asansol police commissioner Sunil Kumar Choudhary said the crash resulted from an overtaking attempt gone wrong. ""We have studied CCTV footage and have found that trouble arose when a white car, while overtaking the woman's car, grazed it. As per CCTV footage, the woman's car was chasing the other vehicle and met with the accident leading to the woman's death.

They alleged that the occupants of the white car had been harassing Chatterjee before ramming their vehicle multiple times over a 10km stretch.""There were five men in the car. They constantly honked and made obscene gestures at madam while driving next to our car. They kept overtaking us and then allowing us to go ahead. They chased us till Panagarh (150km northwest of Kolkata), and in the process, there were multiple collisions between our cars. We tried to avoid them, fearing they were robbers,"" said driver Sharma.According to Mondal, the white car's occupants appeared drunk and abandoned their vehicle at the scene before fleeing.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a grisly pre-planned murder spree Monday evening, a 23-year-old youth killed his girlfriend, brother, grandmother, uncle and aunt, and also attempted to hack his mother to death with a machete and a hammer, at three different places at Venjaramoodu in Thiruvananthapuram, before surrendering to police.The accused, Affan, told cops that he had killed six family members as they were reluctant to clear off the huge debts he had incurred after suffering losses in his business in a Gulf country. However, police have doubts over his version and are digging deeper to unearth more details. The mobile phone and call details of the accused are being checked to ascertain if he is addicted to drugs.Affan's mother Shemi (47), a cancer patient, is in ICU and remains critical. Affan, too, was admitted to the hospital as he claimed to have consumed rat poison to end his life. During the medical examination, however, doctors could not confirm the presence of any poison in his body. Police said the accused first murdered his grandmother Salma Beevi (88) at her Pangode home at about 3pm. He then reached the house of his paternal uncle Abdul Latheef (58) at SN Puram near Koonanvenga, some 16 km from Pangode, and murdered him and his wife Shahida Beevi (54).Affan then returned home at Perumala near Pullampara, and attacked his mother, brother Afzan (14) and girlfriend Farshana (19). After committing the crime, he went straight to the Venjaramoodu police station in an autorickshaw and surrendered.

NAAC purges 900 assessors after corruption allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naac-purges-900-assessors-after-corruption-allegations/articleshow/118539755.cms,"MUMBAI: The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) took a dramatic step, cutting nearly a fifth of its peer reviewers - almost 900 of them - after allegations of corruption surfaced in the grading process. The purge followed a tip-off to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that assessors visiting Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation , a deemed university in Andhra Pradesh, solicited a bribe in exchange for the highest accreditation grade.At a moment when NAAC was already reassessing its accreditation framework, the mass removal of reviewers signalled a deeper shift. Letters from the NAAC director to the remaining peer reviewers made clear that their work was more than procedural; it was a ""nationally important assignment"".""We were reviewing our processes for over a year. We were also looking at the assessors on board and while we removed many, we were also looking at onboarding some senior academicians, vice-chancellors, deans, and directors of reputed institutes,"" said professor Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the NAAC executive committee.In a move aimed at eradicating corruption and streamlining accreditation, after the KLEF case, NAAC abruptly halted physical inspections of colleges. Evaluations, it said, would now be conducted entirely online, eliminating campus visits for colleges. Universities, though, would see a hybrid approach-most assessments would be remote, but select reviewers would still conduct on-site visits to ensure oversight.""Integrity is not a line item-it is the very foundation of trust in the system. We dropped more than 900 assessors. In some cases, the data about these assessors was insufficient; in others, we reviewed their assessments and found them lacking. Some were removed based on feedback we received, and in others, we analysed how they wrote their reports,"" NAAC director Ganesan Kannabiran told TOI.The scrutiny extended beyond individual assessors. NAAC also examined assessment reports from institutions that requested a re-evaluation of their grades. ""In some cases, we compared the two assessment reports and felt that certain assessors' performance did not meet NAAC's requirements,"" Kannabiran added. Those names, too, were struck off the list.The crackdown went beyond internal reform. Each peer team member now receives a direct letter from the NAAC director, reminding them of the expectations placed upon them. ""In recent times, we received complaints that a few higher education institutions (HEIs) were offering above-normal hospitality, organising elaborate cultural activities, arranging sightseeing, and most importantly, offering gifts. Please discourage these aspects and report to us if you notice any such acts or intentions of the HEIs."" A similar message is sent to the institutes too, asking them not to indulge in ""elaborate"" hospitality.The letter is unequivocal. ""We are in the process of identifying such practices of the HEIs and taking punitive action. Keeping the long-term requirements of our nation in mind, I sincerely request you to ensure that a critical and transparent approach is adopted during the entire period of assignment. I strongly believe your invaluable commitment with honesty and integrity in this regard shall positively impact the credibility of NAAC and eventually enhance the quality of education.""",The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) cut nearly a fifth of its peer reviewers.

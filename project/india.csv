Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes

In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don't just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5% of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India's bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80% phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams. ""When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,"" said Hany Farid, professor at University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. ""I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,"" Sitharaman said at an event in Mumbai. ""Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos that can manipulate people,"" she added.Given that over 97% of India's urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. ""Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,"" said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. ""The very term 'deepfake' comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,"" said Farid, calling the new term 'Generative AI' clever ""rebranding"" by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. ""We need to label everything as real or not real,"" said Farid. ""We need real disclosures,"" he added. To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our 'Don't Get Scammed' stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, ""if you don't know what's real, how will you know what's false""?","Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes. 85.5% of Indian households owning at least one smartphone.

NEW DELHI: The stage is all set for Bihar assembly elections results 2025 that will be declared today. With a strong voter turnout and exit polls suggesting a possible return of the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government, all eyes are on the actual results.The counting will begin at 8 am, according to the Election Commission of India (ECI). As Bihar waits for the verdict, here's a look at the most talked-about fights.Sitting MLA: Tejashwi Yadav (RJD)A stronghold of the Lalu Prasad family, Raghopur remains one of Bihar’s most-watched seats. Tejashwi Yadav is eyeing a third straight win here. His main opponent, BJP’s Satish Kumar, lost in both 2015 and 2020, after holding the seat in 2010 as a JD(U) member.The seat made headlines this year when speculation swirled that Jan Suraaj’s Prashant Kishor might contest from here, but he didn’t.Sitting MLA: Chandra Shekhar (RJD)Known for its deep Yadav roots, Madhepura has never elected a non-Yadav MLA. Locals still quote the saying, “Rome Pope ka, Madhepura Gop ka”, meaning the head of Rome is the Pope, and the head of Madhepura is a Yadav.RJD’s Chandra Shekhar is seeking a fourth straight term, while JD(U)’s Kavita Saha hopes to rewrite history as the first woman and non-Yadav MLA from the seat.Sitting MLA: Mishri Lal Yadav (VIP)Singer Maithili Thakur’s political debut has made Alinagar one of the most talked-about constituencies this season. Her campaign, coloured by Maithili cultural symbolism and outsider debates, has drawn controversy. The seat, won by VIP in 2020, now sees Thakur take on VIP's ally and RJD’s Binod Mishra, who finished second in the last election.Sitting MLA: Dr C N Gupta (BJP)In Chhapra, Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav’s debut has turned the contest into a spectacle. The BJP has fielded Chhoti Kumari, hoping to retain the seat it has held since 2010. The campaign trail has looked more like a film set with stars from both camps joining rallies, from Tejashwi and Akhilesh Yadav to Ravi Kishan and Nirahua.Sitting MLA: Anant Singh (JDU)Mokama’s election season turned volatile after the killing of a Jan Suraaj supporter, Dularchand Yadav, allegedly by associates of JD(U)’s Anant Singh. Known as one of Bihar’s most notorious “bahubali” figures, Singh has switched parties multiple times, yet continues to win. Since 2010, he’s been MLA as a JD(U), RJD, and independent candidate, making him one of the most resilient faces in Bihar politics.Sitting MLA: Alok Ranjan (BJP)Traditionally a BJP seat, Saharsa swung to RJD in 2015 but could surprise again this time. The BJP’s Alok Ranjan faces a tough challenge from the Indian Inclusive Party’s Indrajeet Prasad Gupta, whose massive rallies, backed by the Pan and Tanti communities, pushed Tejashwi Yadav to bring IIP into the Mahagathbandhan fold.Sitting MLA: Awadh Bihari Choudhary (RJD)This is a heavyweight clash between the sitting MLA, RJD veteran Awadh Bihari Choudhary and BJP’s Mangal Pandey. In 2020, BJP’s Om Prakash Yadav came within a narrow 2% margin. Siwan’s legacy runs deep. It’s the birthplace of India’s first president, Dr Rajendra Prasad and the old base of strongman Mohammad Shahabuddin.Sitting MLA: Rajeev Kumar Singh (JDU)A symbolically charged seat this time, Nitish Kumar handed Tarapur to BJP leader Samrat Choudhary, ending JD(U)’s decade-long control. The seat is steeped in family history for Choudhary, whose parents both represented it earlier. RJD’s Arun Kumar Sah, who lost by a 2% margin last time, is hoping for a comeback.Sitting MLA: Chetan Anand (JDU)Chetan Anand, son of former MP Anand Mohan, won Sheohar last time but has since joined the NDA. This time, the JD(U) has fielded Shweta Gupta, while the RJD bets on Navneet Jha, grandson of veteran leader Raghunath Jha.Despite being allies under the INDIA banner, Congress and RJD are set to face each other head-on in several constituencies, exposing the uneasy truce within the opposition alliance. As a result, “friendly contests” are unfolding across the state. Congress and RJD will lock horns in Vaishali, Warisaliganj, Lalganj, and Kahalgaon, while Congress is also up against CPI(ML) in Bachhwara, Rajapakar, Rosera, and Biharsharif. These overlapping fights risk splitting the opposition vote in several key districts, a scenario that could benefit the NDA.","Bihar assembly elections results 2025 will be declared today.

New Delhi: While terror strikes understandably dominate news headlines and public discourse for days, the sustained and tireless efforts and operations by the security agencies to foil terror plots and nip attack conspiracies in the bud, may pass off without due notice.For instance, the six months preceding the Delhi car blast have seen several actions by the agencies - against Khalistani terrorism, IS-linked terror conspiracies, anti-narcotics crackdown, and al-Qaida ideology-inspired radicalisation modules.The month of May saw a Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) module busted in Batla on May 20 in an intelligence-based action, leading to the arrest of six members linked to foreign handlers and a Pakistan-based mastermind. Similarly, on May 19, intelligence teams in Hyderabad arrested two IS-linked terror suspects with explosives. Earlier on May 11, a Jamaat ul Mujahideen-Lashkar-e-Taiba network linked to Pakistan was busted in West Bengal.In July, Gujarat ATS and partner agencies busted an Al Qaeda in Indian State (AQIS) module promoting 'Ghazwa e Hind' with connections across Gujarat, UP and Delhi. On July 11, terror hideouts in Poonch, J&K were raided by the Army and J&K police, leading to discovery of terrorist hideouts and recovery of IEDs, grenades etc.August saw NIA apprehending Vizianagaram module case accused Arif Hussain alias Abu Talib at IGI airport in New Delhi; he was involved in conspiracy to supply weapons via Nepal border. August also saw anti-Sikh terror actions with the busting of BKI-Bishnoi gang modules in Punjab and Rajasthan.In September, UP ATS arrested four persons for attempting to form a radical organisation called the Mujahideen Army, with an aim to overthrow the elected govt through violent jihad and assassinate Hindu religious figures. Also, Delhi Police special cell busted a pan-India terror module and arrested five terrorists.In October, a border arms and opium network was exposed in Punjab; a JeM module active in Andhra Pradesh, UP and Maharashtra neutralised; and 2.5 kg IED seized in Punjab. On Oct 27, an IS module 'Saut-ul-Ummah' was busted by special cell of Delhi police and two terrorists arrested.","Security agencies have dismantled many terror networks in past six months. These include Khalistani terrorism, IS-linked terror conspiracies, anti-narcotics crackdown, and al-Qaida ideology-inspired radicalisation modules. The month of May saw a Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) module busted in Batla.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125312784,imgsize-63762,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Marco Rubio Praises India’s Handling Of Delhi Red Fort Blast Probe, Says India Doesn't Need US Help

PM Modi's strong message

BJP's 'response loading' clip



NEW DELHI: United States secretary of state Marco Rubio on Thursday said the repercussion of the Delhi car bomb blast has the ""potential of becoming something broader"" as he acknowledged the explosion near Red Fort was a “heinous terror incident. ”Rubio has said the Hyundai i20 explosion near Red Fort was “clearly” a terrorist attack and commended India for being “very measured” and “very professional” in the way it is investigating the deadly incident.A high-intensity blast outside the Red Fort in Delhi on Monday claimed at least 13 lives. India on Wednesday termed the car explosion as a “heinous terror incident.”“Yeah, we’re aware of the potential that that holds. But I think the Indians are – need to be commended; they have been very measured and cautious and very professional in how they’re carrying out this investigation,” Rubio said Wednesday in remarks to the press in Canada' Hamilton.“That investigation continues. Clearly, it was a terrorist attack. It was a car loaded with highly explosive materials that detonated and killed a lot of people,” Rubio said.When asked how concerned he was about rising tensions between India and Pakistan, against the backdrop of the four-day conflict between the two neighbours in May, Rubio said: “(But) I think they’re doing a very good job of carrying out an investigation; and I think when they have facts, they’ll release those facts.”India had launched Operation Sindoor targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. The on-ground hostilities ended with an understanding of stopping the military actions following talks between the directors general of military operations of both sides on May 10.“But clearly, ... we’re aware of the potential that it has, and so we spoke about that a little bit today – the potential that it has to become something broader. But I think we’re going to wait and see what their investigation reveals,” Rubio said, according to news agency PTI.Rubio also met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on the margins of the G7 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Niagara.He added that the US has offered to help, but “I think they’re very capable in these investigations. They don’t need our help. They’re doing a good job, and I thought they were very measured and professional in how they’ve approached it, as they usually are.”Following his meeting with Rubio, Jaishankar said in a post on X: “Good to meet @SecRubio this morning at #G7 FMM. Appreciate his condolences on the loss of lives in the blast in Delhi. Discussed our bilateral ties, focusing on trade and supply chains. Exchanged views on the Ukraine conflict, the Middle East/West Asia situation and Indo-Pacific.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that those responsible for the Delhi car blast won't be spared and will be brought to justice. PM Modi, who was on a two-day visit to Bhutan, said that he monitored the situation all night after the blast.""Today, I come here with a very heavy heart. The horrific incident that took place in Delhi yesterday evening has deeply saddened everyone. I understand the grief of the affected families. The entire nation stands with them today,"" he said.The Prime Minister added that he was in touch with all agencies investigating the incident.""I was in touch with all the agencies investigating this incident throughout last night. Our agencies will get to the bottom of this conspiracy. The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice,"" he added.Union home minister Amit Shah also on Thursday said that those responsible for the recent Delhi bomb blast will be given the “strictest possible punishment”.He added that the action will send a strong message to the world that no one should ever dare to attack India again.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday posted a clip of how India responded to every terror attack with a cross-border surgical strike, airstrike, and Operation Sindoor, which was launched to avenge the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack.In a drastic revision of its security doctrine, India, in May, after the Pahalgam attack, declared that it would from now on consider every instance of terrorism directed against it as an 'act of war' and would respond accordingly.Sources explained that the decision considerably lowers the threshold for India to give a full-scale military response to attacks orchestrated from across the border.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the repercussion of the Delhi car bomb blast has the ""potential of becoming something broader"" He acknowledged the explosion near Red Fort was a “heinous terror incident.” Rubio commended India for being “very measured” and ‘very professional’ in the way it is investigating the deadly incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125303188,imgsize-40608,width-400,resizemode-4/us-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio.jpg"

Candidates Party Votes polled Vote percentage Maithili Thakur BJP Binod Mishra RJD Biplaw Chaudhary Jan Suraaj Margin of difference

NEW DELHI: Singer Maithili Thakur has taken an early lead, securing 7,637 votes and establishing a margin of 3,004 votes after the first round of counting. RJD candidate Binod Mishra is trailing behind with 4,633 votes as the counting continues.Dominating the early trends, Thakur is giving the BJP a strong lead in this closely watched contest. The party’s decision to field Thakur, banking on her wide popularity and cultural connect, appears to be paying off. If the trend continues, the BJP could secure this seat for the first time since 2008.Thakur faces a direct contest with RJD’s Binod Mishra, who finished runner-up in 2020, and Jan Suraj’s Biplaw Chaudhary.The seat, falling under Darbhanga district and part of the Darbhanga Lok Sabha constituency, is in the General category.Political observers say the Alinagar outcome will indicate how far the BJP’s outreach through youth icons and cultural identity politics resonates in the region. Thakur’s candidature marks a strategic shift, with the party hoping her appeal among young and first-time voters could swing the seat its way.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, the Alinagar contest was among the closest in the state. Mishri Lal Yadav of the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had edged out Binod Mishra (RJD) by just 3,101 votes, securing 61,082 votes to Mishra’s 57,981.Five years earlier, in 2015, RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui had comfortably won the seat with 67,461 votes, defeating his nearest rival by over 13,000 votes.With Thakur entering the fray, this year’s race has taken on a new dimension. The BJP is seeking to expand its base in north Bihar beyond its traditional urban and upper-caste strongholds. The RJD, meanwhile, is counting on its organisational network and caste arithmetic to retain its edge.Counting for all 243 assembly constituencies begins at 8:00am, and early trends from Alinagar are expected to set the tone for the broader Darbhanga region.","Singer Maithili Thakur has taken an early lead, securing 7,637 votes and establishing a margin of 3,004 votes after the first round of counting.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.",CJI B R Gavai said Supreme Court's 1979 rape verdict was an institutional failure. He said it reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent. The public outrage and nationwide protests that followed ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125285031,imgsize-609522,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-67.jpg"

What DNA test from blast site revealed



A wider terror web

(With inputs from agencies)

The investigation into the deadly Red Fort blast that killed 13 people on November 10 has unveiled a chilling web of terror networks spanning Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Kashmir. As agencies sift through CCTV footage, encrypted chats, and forensic trails, a clearer picture is emerging of how a group of educated professionals allegedly plotted one of the most audacious terror conspiracies in recent years.The probe has exposed a “white-collar” Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM)-linked module led by doctors from Kashmir who used Al-Falah University in Faridabad as their base. The group reportedly received guidance from a handler in Turkiye, coordinated on encrypted apps like Signal and Threema, and planned multiple blasts across India.Police said the conspiracy was hatched inside Al-Falah University, a private institution in Faridabad. 2,900 kg of explosives were recovered from its premises and nearby locations. Three Kashmiri doctors — Dr Umar Un Nabi, Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, and Dr Muzaffar Rather — were allegedly the masterminds. They stored ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, and sulphur in small quantities before assembling improvised explosive devices (IEDs).The trio used the campus’s laboratories and rented rooms for storage. Following the blast, the government ordered a forensic audit of the university’s finances and the Enforcement Directorate was asked to trace its money trail. The Association of Indian Universities suspended Al-Falah’s membership citing “irregularities”.The group was dubbed a “white-collar” or “white-coat” terror module because most accused were medical professionals. PTI reported that Dr Umar, who drove the explosives-laden Hyundai i20, was a 28-year-old doctor from Qazigund, Kashmir. Dr Muzammil and Dr Muzaffar were his close associates. Another, Dr Shaheen Sayeed from Lucknow, was accused of providing logistical support. Investigators found that they radicalised peers at Al-Falah, using Telegram and Signal for coordination. The police have sought an Interpol Red Corner Notice for Muzaffar, who fled India in August and is believed to be in Afghanistan.The plot’s international dimension was uncovered when investigators traced a handler in Turkiye, codenamed Ukasa. He allegedly acted as the conduit between the Delhi-based doctors and leaders of JeM and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. Dr Umar and his associates had travelled to Turkiye in 2021–22, where they received ideological training. Ukasa reportedly instructed them on how to establish covert cells and communicate without detection. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is coordinating with foreign counterparts to track his digital footprint.CCTV footage analysed by Delhi Police, cited by PTI, revealed Dr Umar’s last movements. After leaving Faridabad, he was seen stopping for food near Nuh before entering Delhi through the Badarpur border. He looped across multiple areas — Okhla, Connaught Place, and Ashok Vihar — before parking near a mosque close to Asaf Ali Road, where he stayed for nearly three hours. Police believe he offered prayers and received instructions before driving toward the Red Fort Metro Station, where his car exploded at 6:52 pm.Investigators found coded notebooks and diaries from Room 13 and Room 4 at Al-Falah University, belonging to Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar respectively. As per PTI, the documents contained dates between November 8–12, coded names, and numerical sequences. The repeated mention of the word “operation” suggested detailed coordination. References to 25–30 individuals, mostly from Kashmir and Haryana, indicated a large, decentralised network. Police believe the diaries outlined phases of the operation, including procurement, transport, and execution.According to ANI, the module had planned simultaneous blasts in four cities. Eight suspects were to split into pairs, each assigned to one city. The targets were believed to include Delhi and Ayodhya, where an attack was allegedly planned around November 25 to coincide with Ram temple events. Each pair was to travel with multiple IEDs for coordinated strikes, mirroring tactics used in earlier JeM operations. Intelligence sources said at least two more vehicles — a red Ford EcoSport and a Maruti Brezza — were being modified for attacks.Police told PTI that the suspects pooled over ?26 lakh in cash, which Dr Umar managed for operations. The funds were used to purchase 26 quintals of NPK fertiliser from dealers in Gurugram and Nuh. This fertiliser, when mixed with chemicals, forms a key component of homemade explosives. A total of 2,900 kg of explosive substances were seized across Faridabad, confirming large-scale preparation. Authorities suspect additional funding from abroad, possibly routed via hawala channels linked to Turkiye and Pakistan.Dr Shaheen reportedly told interrogators that the attack planning coincided with the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition on December 6. Officials suspect the date was chosen to trigger communal tension. The group referred to December 6 as “Operation D-6” in their notes, according to ANI. Investigators believe this symbolic choice underscores the ideological motivation of the JeM-linked cell. The timing, they said, reflected an intent to cause maximum national disruption and political impact.Delhi Police confirmed via DNA profiling that Dr Umar Un Nabi was the driver of the car that exploded. PTI reported that his leg was found trapped between the steering wheel and accelerator, confirming he was behind the wheel. His remains were matched with samples from his mother and brother at AIIMS. Investigators believe the explosion was premature — possibly triggered accidentally while he was assembling or arming the IED inside the car.As ANI reported, the Delhi blast is only the visible part of a larger conspiracy. The module had prepared plans for 32 vehicles to be fitted with explosives for coordinated strikes. Police recovered a red Ford EcoSport linked to Dr Umar and are searching for a missing Maruti Brezza. Over 350 kg of ammonium nitrate and traces of RDX have been seized so far. Investigators are now probing whether the group was preparing to form a new outfit aligned with ISIS’s India affiliates. The Home Ministry has ordered a multi-agency review, while calls grow for an all-party discussion in Parliament on the attack.","The investigation into the deadly Red Fort blast that killed 13 people on November 10 has unveiled a chilling web of terror networks.

All 24 injured in blast near RedFort being treated at LNJP; No discharges or referrals madeNew Delhi: A critically injured patient on a ventilator succumbed to his injuries on Thursday morning, taking the toll in Monday's blast to 13.Doctors at Delhi govt's Lok Nayak Hospital (LNJP) confirmed the death of Bilal (35), who, according to police, lived near Jama Masjid. However, some sources said that he was a resident of Kangan in Ganderbal, Jammu & Kashmir.Among the most severely injured victims brought to the hospital after the explosion, Bilal suffered an abdominal-penetrating injury along with nearly 70% burns, said a senior doctor who was involved in his treatment.He underwent surgery on Wednesday after shrapnel from the blast ruptured multiple internal organs. ""Despite the surgical intervention, his condition remained extremely critical, and he could not survive,"" the doctor added.All 24 injured are being treated by LNJP multidisciplinary teams, hospital authorities said. Six of them continue to remain critical, as teams of doctors fight to stabilise them amid one of the hospital's most challenging emergency responses in recent times.""There have been no discharges or referrals to other facilities as we have all experts and faculties here,"" an official said.Doctors performed another complex surgery on a patient on Wednesday to remove a piece of shrapnel that pierced his eye. ""The patient had a head injury and a sharp foreign object punctured and was lodged inside the eye, damaging the cornea,"" said a doctor.Since the patient was too critical to be shifted to Guru Nanak Eye Centre, a team of ophthalmic surgeons from the eye hospital was brought to LNJP instead. ""Eye surgeries require an operating microscope. We planned and conducted the procedure in the neuro operation theatre, where such microscopes are available,"" a senior surgeon said.The operation was successful, and the shrapnel was removed. ""The cornea has been repaired,"" the surgeon added.Ophthalmologists have now joined the existing team of surgeons drawn from general surgery, burns and plastic, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, anaesthesia and ENT departments.Over 50 doctors and support staff have been working round the clock in LNJP's 70-bed disaster ward since Monday night. The unit was activated within minutes of the explosion, and has treated victims with severe burns, fractures, head injuries and blast-related trauma.Speaking about the pattern of injuries, doctors said two kinds of trauma are common among blast victims - burns and ear injuries. ""Most have superficial-to-deep burns, especially on the face and extremities. Many suffer ruptured eardrums or temporary hearing loss due to the shockwave,"" a medic said.At least four patients were treated for pneumothorax - a condition in which a blast's shockwave causes air to leak into the chest cavity, leading to the lung collapsing. Several others suffered eardrum ruptures and pellet wounds, while a few had to undergo emergency amputations.The hospital has set up a temporary facility near the emergency ward to accommodate up to two relatives per patient. They will be given food.","A critically injured patient on a ventilator succumbed to his injuries on Thursday morning, taking the toll in Monday's blast to 13.

Multiple IEDs, 32 Vehicles: Agencies Uncover Plan For Serial Car Explosions In Delhi Blast Probe

A day-long trail through Delhi

Meticulous planning revealed by CCTV mapping

NEW DELHI: Fresh CCTV visuals have provided new insights into the movements of Dr Umar Nabi, the main accused in Monday’s deadly explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that killed 13 people and injured several others.According to PTI, the footage shows Umar entering the national capital through the Badarpur toll plaza around 8.02 am on November 10, driving a white Hyundai i20 later identified as the vehicle that exploded near the Red Fort that evening.Investigators said Umar, wearing a mask, was seen handing cash to the toll operator while repeatedly glancing toward the CCTV camera. A large bag, believed to have contained explosives, was spotted on the car’s back seat.Another clip, reportedly from a lane near a mosque close to Ramlila Maidan, shows Umar walking along a narrow stretch before turning briefly — the moment his face is clearly visible on camera. Police believe he visited the mosque to offer prayers before driving toward the Red Fort. “His repeated glances toward the CCTV camera suggest that he knew agencies were looking for him, and he was consciously monitoring his surroundings,” a senior police officer told PTI.Delhi Police have retrieved footage from over 50 cameras showing Umar’s car travelling through several districts before the explosion. He was first captured on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. Umar stopped for a meal at a roadside eatery and spent the night in his car before entering the capital the next morning.From there, his route covered multiple areas: from Southeast Delhi to the East and Central districts, then northward to Ashok Vihar in the Northwest District, where he stopped to eat. The footage later shows him returning to central Delhi and visiting a mosque near Asaf Ali Road before heading towards the Red Fort parking lot at 3:19 pm.Another CCTV footage showed Umar at Mewat Toll, Haryana, on 10 November.PTI reported that the white i20 was later seen in the Sunehri Masjid parking area, where it remained stationary for nearly three hours. Around 6:22 pm, the car exited the parking lot and was last seen moving toward the Red Fort Metro Station side. Barely half an hour later, at 6:52 pm, it exploded into a fireball amid evening traffic, shattering nearby windows and setting off panic in the area.Investigators have reconstructed Umar’s movements in detail, suggesting he travelled from Haryana to Delhi via the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. Police sources said Umar halted several times on his journey — once at a roadside dhaba where he ate and another time at a mosque where he offered prayers. He reportedly spent the night inside his car before entering Delhi on Monday morning. “He seemed to have planned every step, including his entry and exit routes, to avoid detection,” a police source told PTI.The footage shows that Umar deliberately avoided arterial roads, instead navigating through crowded lanes and smaller routes to confuse surveillance or observe public movement. He appeared calm throughout, even stopping at eateries. Police believe he used these pauses to check his phone and possibly receive instructions.ANI also reported that Umar’s diaries, recovered alongside those of co-accused Dr Muzammil, mention dates between November 8 and 12 — suggesting the planning phase for the attack. The diaries reportedly list about 25 individuals, many from Jammu and Kashmir and Faridabad, hinting at a wider conspiracy.Forensic experts have since confirmed through DNA testing that Dr Umar Nabi was indeed driving the Hyundai i20 at the time of the explosion. His mother’s DNA sample, collected on Tuesday, matched remains retrieved from the blast site. “The DNA results confirm that it was indeed Umar who was driving the fateful vehicle,” a source told PTI.","Dr Umar Nabi is the main accused in the deadly explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that killed 13 people and injured several others.

When the talks were halted, it had reached a certain level. So, does that mean that you're reviewing what was agreed upon till then?

What do you make of foreign minister Anita Anand's remarks on progress in the normalization of the relationship being contingent upon the law enforcement dialogue?

Did you discuss India's purchase of Russian oil?

For India, visas are an important issue especially for professionals and business visitors in trade agreements. Can you give us a sense of what the visa policy is going to be?

And this would be STEM and similar skills?

Now that high level engagements have resumed, can we expect the Prime Ministers to meet on the margins of the upcoming G20 summit in South Africa? Can we expect Prime Minister Carney to visit India for the AI Summit in February?

Canada’s minister for international trade Maninder Sidhu, who is in India to take forward the bilateral dialogue on trade and investment ties, says that his government is looking for skilled workers from foreign countries, focusing more on quality. In an interview, he tells TOI that India and Canada are taking one step at a time and assessing the changes in the global economy before moving ahead with talks on a trade deal. Excerpts:We had a great meeting today to focus on a lot of the opportunities; opportunities around aerospace, energy, AI and critical minerals. These are all critical sectors for India. As India grows, Canada is there in complementary services and that's what we discovered today in terms of how fast India is growing.India needs 70% more energy by 2040. Canada is building the projects to get there. We have seven LNG projects in various phases of development. It was our first trade and investment dialogue at the ministerial level in many years.We need to continue building on that energy. Prime Minister Carney has given me a mandate, an ambitious target of $300 billion of (additional) non-US exports within the next 10 years and I'm looking at every market to see how we can continue diversifying and building on our trade partnerships.India is a great partner with $30 billion of two-way trade right and there's room to grow.Right now, we're identifying opportunities and hopefully, in the near future we'll be able to get into the trade conversations, taking investment and trade to the next level. We also need to bring the business community along with us.Look, this is a new government, new Prime Minister, new mandate, new focus. As you've seen from Prime Minister Carney, it's new energy, it's starting afresh. The context has changed from even six months ago. You know, President Trump's tariff policies have really shifted things globally. So, we're in a different frame right now. We just wrapped up a trade agreement with Indonesia a few weeks ago and launched negotiations with Thailand, with the Philippines. Two weeks ago, I ran into minister Jaishankar at the Asean Summit in Malaysia.We had a good conversation. Canada is looking at every opportunity, but now is the window that we can use. Our geography with the US Is not going to change. They'll always remain important. We have to match the energy from businesses in Canada. It was very positive to hear from minister Goyal that he's looking to come to Canada early next year with a delegation so we can continue building on this. Minister Jaishankar was in Canada yesterday and I'm here today. You know, there's this sustained energy that we need to continue building upon because it's not going to happen overnight.The minister’s visit was positive, and it laid the groundwork for what I'm doing now. The safety and security of citizens of both countries is paramount. So those conversations are encouraging that law enforcement agencies are talking to each other to resolve some of the challenges. My job as an economic minister is to focus on the trade and investmentsWe talked about alternative sources of energy and Canada can provide that. As you look for stable, reliable, long-term supply, Canada is that. These contracts are done for 10, 15, 20 years, now is the time to get in early. You'll notice in LNG, different countries have invested that those countries are now receiving the first shipments.Look, immigration comes up quite a lot; look at the diaspora, it's huge in both countries. We have a lot of family and friends visiting each other. That's why I sat down with Air Canada to talk about more flight options. In Canada, 13% of our trade flows through our airports. The Prime Minister has been very clear on immigration. It's a focus on economic immigration, a focus on skilled immigration. So making sure we're creating pathways to permanent residency for those skilled immigrants is very important for Canada's growth plans.When you look at what's happening to the south of us with the H1B anxieties, it's in our budget. It's still early in the conversations, but we're looking at different pathways to attract technical capabilities, skilled capabilities to Canada. The PM's focus is how do we build Canada. You have your localized talent, but you also need to bring in some talent that can add to that. So a part of that is looking at India and maybe something around the H1B programme is very important.Yes, STEM, skilled workers. We need nurses and doctors. We have specialized pathways. Are we going to continue that as a government? These are all considerations that we were looking at because in the past, it was more about quantity. With us, yes, the quantity, quality is also important. There are no caps on postgraduates, they can come to Canada and study at the University of Toronto, McGill, many of the universities.Prime Minister Modi has been very clear he'd like universities and colleges to come to India from other countries like Canada to set up shop here. And so we're facilitating those conversations because we'd like that partnership. It's important. It helps build the partnership and trust between communities through research, through students. And so we're looking at that option as well.The schedules are still being looked at. But of course, more conversations are very important to this relationship, to have that sustained dialogue.","Canada’s minister for international trade Maninder Sidhu is in India to take forward the bilateral dialogue on trade and investment ties.

NEW DELHI: As counting begins at 8am for Bihar’s 243 assembly seats, all eyes will be on Tarapur, where Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Samrat Chaudhary faces his first electoral test on a saffron ticket. He faces RJD’s Arun Shah and JS’s Santosh Singh.The seat, part of Munger district and falling under the Jamui parliamentary constituency, is being closely watched as a key indicator of the BJP’s attempt to consolidate non-Yadav OBCs and upper-caste voters in the state.For the last three assembly elections, Tarapur remained with the JD(U), represented by Mewa Lal Choudhary, who retained it in 2020. But under this year’s NDA seat-sharing arrangement, the constituency has gone to the BJP, setting up a fresh contest between Samrat Chaudhary, RJD’s Arun Shah, and Jan Suraj’s (JS) Santosh Singh.In the 2020 assembly election, JD(U)’s Mewa Lal Choudhary had defeated RJD’s Divya Prakash by 7,225 votes, securing 64,468 votes (36.93 per cent) against 57,243 (32.8 per cent). LJP’s Mina Devi and Independent Rajesh Kumar Mishra followed with over 11,000 and 10,000 votes respectively. Tarapur recorded a turnout of 55 per cent, with 1.74 lakh valid votes out of 3.17 lakh electors.Five years earlier, in 2015, JD(U)’s ML Choudhary had defeated HAM(S) candidate Sakuni Choudhary by nearly 12,000 votes, polling 66,411 (43.62 per cent) to 54,464 (35.77 per cent).This time, the focus is on whether Samrat Chaudhary - who belongs to the Koeri (non-Yadav OBC) community - can expand BJP’s social reach in a seat that has historically backed JD(U)’s local leadership. The result will also test how effectively the NDA has managed its transition after the latest round of seat swaps.","Counting begins at 8am for Bihar’s 243 assembly seats.

NEW DELHI: Counting of votes in the Supaul Assembly constituency will begin at 8:00am today, with the spotlight on JD(U) heavyweight Bijendra Prasad Yadav , who is seeking to retain the seat for a third consecutive term. He faces a triangular contest against Congress’s Minnatullah Rahmani and Jan Suraj’s Anil Singh, in a region where caste alignments and rural priorities have long shaped electoral outcomes. The contest this year comes against the backdrop of complex caste arithmetic, a predominantly rural electorate, and the continuing influence of agrarian and livelihood issues.Located in Supaul district, the constituency falls under the Supaul parliamentary seat, which comprises five assembly segments.Classified as a general category seat, it has long been a key political ground for Yadav, one of JD(U)’s senior-most leaders and a cabinet minister in the state government.Supaul had 2,97,943 registered voters and 392 polling booths in the 2020 Bihar Assembly election. During the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the number of polling booths was revised to 320. Voter participation has remained steady over the years - 56.71% in 2020, 58.09 per cent in 2015, and 60.05 per cent in the 2019 parliamentary election.The constituency’s diverse voter base - with a significant presence of Muslims, Scheduled Castes (SC) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) - continues to shape its political outcomes. Muslims make up a considerable share of the electorate, making their support decisive for any candidate.In 2020, Bijendra Prasad Yadav (JD(U)) defeated Minnatullah Rahmani (INC) by a comfortable margin of about 28,000 votes. Yadav secured 86,174 votes (50.2 per cent), while Rahmani polled 58,075 (33.8 per cent). Five years earlier, in 2015, Yadav had won with 82,295 votes (54.7 per cent), defeating Congress’s Renuka Devi, who garnered around 44,898 votes.With the JD(U) hoping to maintain its stronghold and the opposition banking on local anti-incumbency, early trends from Supaul will offer a glimpse into north Bihar’s rural mood and the social coalition dynamics driving this election season.",JD(U) heavyweight Bijendra Prasad Yadav is seeking to retain the seat for a third consecutive term.

NEW DELHI: After three years of suspension of MGNREGS in West Bengal, the Centre is said to have told a key parliamentary panel that it will resume the flagship scheme in the state as per orders of Kolkata HC.According to sources, rural development secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh told the Public Accounts Committee that the Centre would follow the HC's judgment, after MPs raised the issue of continued halt to its implementation in the state. The Centre suspended the scheme in the state in 2022 after alleging irregularities in its implementation. While the Centre approached SC against the HC judgment, the apex court rejected the appeal.The Centre has since not announced how it planned to proceed on the issue given that it had exhausted the legal route.The PAC chaired by Congress MP KC Venugopal held a three-and-half-hour discussion on MGNREGS, and members across party lines like Praful Patel, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shaktisinh Gohil, Jagdambika Pal, Dharmendra Yadav, are learned to have raised questions about the scheme's implementation, and the norms decided by the Centre.As the secretary declared that the Centre would follow the HC order, a Congress MP told the panel there had already been a big delay in resumption of the scheme as the HC judgment came a few months ago. He demanded that the resumption be done without any further loss of time.The suspension of MGNREGS in Bengal has resulted in a protracted political confrontation between the TMC of CM Mamata Banerjee and BJP.","The Centre suspended the scheme in the state in 2022 after alleging irregularities in its implementation.

NEW DELHI: In early counting trends, BJP ’s Sanjiv Chaurasia has opened up a sharp lead, pulling in 9,226 votes, putting him 4,541 votes ahead of his nearest rival. Trailing him is CPI(ML) Liberation’s Divya Gautam , who stands at 4,685 votes, struggling to bridge the growing deficit. The margin, while still fluid at this stage, signals a strong early advantage for the BJP as counting continues.Candidates from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation (CPI(ML)L), and the Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) are locked in a close three-way contest in Bihar’s Digha Assembly constituency, one of the largest and most politically significant seats in the state. As polling took place on November 11, 2025, in the second phase of the Bihar Assembly Elections, incumbent MLA Sanjeev Chaurasia (BJP) is facing a strong challenge from Divya Gautam (CPI(ML)L) and Ritesh Ranjan Singh alias Bittu Singh (JSP), making this a crucial battleground in Patna district.The Digha constituency witnessed a voter turnout of 74.85%, reflecting high civic engagement compared to its 2020 turnout of 60.12%. Bihar as a whole recorded a historic 66.91% turnout, marking the state’s highest in over two decades.Located in Patna district, Digha is one of six Assembly segments forming the Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat. Created in 2008 after the delimitation exercise, Digha was designed for a more balanced voter distribution but has since grown into Bihar’s largest constituency by electorate size.In the 2020 Assembly polls, Sanjeev Chaurasia (BJP) retained the seat by a margin of 46,073 votes, defeating Shashi Yadav (CPI(ML)L) in a straight contest. He had earlier won the 2015 election as well, reinforcing the BJP’s urban dominance in the area.The constituency comprises six panchayats and 14 municipal wards, largely falling under the Patna Municipal Corporation, making it a politically vibrant mix of urban and semi-urban voters. The electorate has grown steadily, from 460,868 registered voters in 2020 to 473,108 in 2024, underlining its expanding political weight within Patna’s urban belt.Digha has consistently leaned toward BJP. With the Jan Suraaj Party also entering the fray this year, the 2025 contest has evolved into a three-cornered battle, potentially reshaping the region’s urban political dynamics. The BJP’s challenge will be to maintain its dominance amid growing anti-incumbency and voter fatigue.","In early counting trends, BJP’s Sanjiv Chaurasia has opened up a sharp lead, pulling in 9,226 votes.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday rejected Tamil Nadu's strident opposition to Karnataka's proposed multi-purpose Mekedatu project and said that the M K Stalin govt's objection to preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) is misconceived as it is yet to be approved by the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) and the Central Water Commission (CWC).A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul M Pancholi said Tamil Nadu's application seeking cancellation of the Mekedatu project is ""totally misconceived and premature"" as Karnataka is bound to release TN's share of water as per the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) award, as modified by SC in 2018.""If Karnataka fails to do so, it runs the risk of committing contempt of court,"" the bench said while rejecting Tamil Nadu's application.However, it said if the DPR gets approved by the CWC, then the states would be free to take steps as permitted under the law.Tamil Nadu, through senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, used strong words against Karnataka and tried every possible argument to persuade the top court to stop the detailed project report's preparation.The bench said the CWDT award has allocated the share of water between the two states and the Union territory of Puducherry, and that whether the Mekedatu project is constructed or not, Karnataka is bound to release of 177 tmcft water to TN as per the SC judgment.Rohatgi said, ""Karnataka is the upper riparian state. It wants to construct the dam and control the flow of water to Tamil Nadu. The dam will have the key for release of water to TN."" The bench said that if Karnataka does not release water as per the judgment, it would face contempt of court proceedings.Tamil Nadu said it has had a water dispute with Karnataka for the last 50 years and that it cannot trust that state on equitable sharing of Cauvery water. The bench asked, ""If Karnataka is constructing the dam without affecting TN's water share, how can TN oppose the project?""When the bench said the DPR is yet to be finalised and wanted to know how Tamil Nadu could oppose at this premature stage, TN said, ""The mechanism for complaint against not honouring the water share decree is such that it will take a complaint months to be addressed. That is why we want to nip the problem in the bud.""Appearing for Karnataka, senior advocate Shyam Divan and advocate general Shashi Kiran Shetty told the court the state will utilise its share of Cauvery water for the purpose of storage in Mekedatu dam, which is to provide drinking water to the burgeoning city of Bengaluru and generate 400 MW of electricity. The dam would not impede the flow of water to Tamil Nadu, they assured.","Supreme Court rejects Tamil Nadu's strident opposition to Karnataka's proposed multi-purpose Mekedatu project.

NEW DELHI: The origins of the 'Faridabad' module - with tentacles extending to UP and beyond - lay in Jaish-e-Muhammed and Pakistan's ISI 's larger plan, hatched almost four years ago, to raise and nurture a ""homegrown"" outfit in India on the lines of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. The aim was to carry out attacks on the instructions of Pakistani handlers while allowing them deniability before the international community.Sources in security agencies told TOI that after AGUH - an al-Qaida offshoot - became almost defunct following neutralisation of its chief Zakir Musa in 2019, ISI turned to Jaish chief Maulana Masood Azhar to help build a similar outfit with radicalised youths not just from Kashmir, where local terror recruitments have dropped to single digits, but also from other parts of India.The plan was to have Kashmiris in leadership roles, who would then use encrypted platforms like Telegram to identify, radicalise and recruit members.The first link in the ISI-Jaish plan was established by Pak-based operative Umar bin Khattab, alias Hanjullah, who connected with Maulvi Irfan Waghay, a cleric from Shopian. Irfan, who had radicalised several youths over the years, offered to help create the pan-India outfit.He roped in Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, bringing him into the JeM mission, and used his Deoband connections to spread the network further.Dr Muzammil expanded the chain by recruiting his colleagues at Al Falah University. Both Dr Adeel and his brother Muzaffar were contacted; while Adeel joined the plan, Muzaffar switched allegiance to al-Qaida and is believed to be in Afghanistan. Muzammil also brought in Dr Shaheen Shahid and her brother Dr ParvezAnsari.""Muzammil, Adeel and Umer were constantly in touch on Telegram with three Pakistani handlers, Faisal, Hashim and Ukasha, who sent them instructions, radicalisation material and bomb-making videos,"" an officer said.The radicalisation and recruitment drive aimed to build a strong, educated cadre capable of operating discreetly across India. ""Zakir Musa himself was a BTech dropout. Al Falah provided the perfect platform to tap students and faculty for recruitment,"" an officer said, adding that separatist elements like Dr Nisar-ul-Hassan, sacked from a Srinagar college over terror links, were embedded there.Members of the homegrown Jaish-backed network were encouraged to generate funds through their salaries or religious donations such as zakat, while Jaish supplemented them via hawala.Over the past two years, after gaining organisational strength, operatives began sourcing explosives and bomb components. Around 2,900 kg of IED-making material was amassed by Dr Muzammil, Dr Adeel, and Dr Umar Un Nabi, and stored with the help of Mewat cleric Hafiz Mohd Ishtiak. Agencies suspect more such dumps exist.""It is possible that Dr Umer hurriedly assembled the car bomb using the instructional videos sent by Pakistan-based handlers. The device was crudely made, which limited its impact. But Jaish had already identified targets for pan-India attacks - the crackdown on the Faridabad module stopped them just in time,"" said an officer.",'Faridabad' module was part of Pakistan's larger plan to raise and nurture a 'homegrown' outfit in India on the lines of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. Aim was to carry out attacks on the instructions of Pakistani handlers while allowing them deniability before international community.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125313844,imgsize-134812,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

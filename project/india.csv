Sibal eyes judge's impeachment, seeks PM's support

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday took note of a controversial speech by Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav, in which he reportedly said the country would function as per the wishes of the ""bahusankhyak (majority)"" and expressed a term used to describe rigid clerics, which is considered pejorative by many. Amid protests that his remarks were unconstitutional and were aimed against the minority community, the apex court also sought a report from HC.The judge made the remarks while speaking on the Uniform Civil Code at a function organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Sunday.As reports of his speech made headlines and a complaint was filed against him in the apex court, the SC administration headed by CJI Sanjiv Khanna sought details about the speech from HC.""SC has taken note of newspaper reports of a speech given by Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, a sitting judge of HC of judicature at Allahabad. The details and particulars have been called from HC and the matter is under consideration,"" stated a brief statement issued by the apex court.Meanwhile, NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms, whose patrons include retired SC judge P B Sawant, filed a complaint with CJI Khanna against the judge, seeking an in-house inquiry and suspension of his judicial work. A strong institutional response is needed as his speech creates doubts about the independence and neutrality of judiciary, it said.Senior advocate and Supreme Court Bar Association president Kapil Sibal appealed for the HC judge's impeachment and sought the support of the PM, home minister and BJP MPs to support the process of impeachment.In his speech, Justice Yadav reportedly said that the children of Hindus are always taught about being kind and non-violent, but such is not the case in the Muslim community. When there is one country and one Constitution, then why should not there be one law for all citizens, he said, supporting UCC.He said many bad practices, which were earlier prevalent among Hindus, such as Sati and female foeticide, have been done away with, and Muslims should also take steps to stop the practice of triple talaq and polygamy.Justice Yadav then said, ""I have no hesitation in saying that this is Hindustan, this country will function as per the wishes of the 'bahusankhyak (majority)' living in Hindustan. This is the law... You cannot say that you are saying this being a high court judge. The law works according to the majority, look at the functioning of family or society, it is the majority which decides.""In its complaint to the CJI, CJAR said, ""Such communally charged statements at a public event, by a sitting judge of HC, not only hurt religious sentiments, but completely erode faith of the general public in the integrity and impartiality of the judicial institution. Such a speech is also a brazen violation of his oath as a judge, where he had promised to uphold the Constitution and its values impartially.""","Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav reportedly said the country would function as per the wishes of the ""bahusankhyak (majority)"" Yadav made the remarks while speaking on the Uniform Civil Code at a function organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116190499,imgsize-1008256,width-400,resizemode-4/116190499.jpg"

Move against VP ploy by 'rattled' Cong to divert focus from Soros links: Rijiju

NEW DELHI: In a first in parliamentary history, the INDIA bloc of opposition parties Tuesday submitted a notice for the removal of vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar , who also serves as chairman of Rajya Sabha, accusing him of ""partisan"" conduct as the RS chair.While the motion is unlikely to be passed, opposition members, however, downplayed the inevitability of defeat and insisted that the move was meant to be a ""strong message to fight for parliamentary democracy "". Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh and Naseer Hussain submitted the notice signed by 60 MPs, including those from TMC, SP, RJD, CPI, CPM, JMM, AAP and DMK, to RS secretary general P C Mody.Condemning the move, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, ""The opposition disrespects the dignity of the chair, be it in Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha... In parliamentary tradition, speakers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are our guides. We must obey whoever sits on the chair."" He stressed that NDA had a majority in the House.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday dubbed INDIA bloc's move to submit a notice for the removal of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar as ""extremely regrettable"" and said the move was intended to divert focus from what he described as Congress-Soros ""anti-India agenda"".Talking to reporters, he defended the Vice President, who is also chairman of Rajya Sabha, and described him as ""extremely professional and impartial"".""The opposition disrespects the dignity of the chair, be it in Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha. We all know that in the parliamentary tradition, the speakers of both Houses are our guides. Whoever sits on the chair, we have to obey them. Congress and their alliance have continuously behaved wrongly by not following the direction of the chair,"" he said.Praising Dhankhar, Rijiju highlighted his humble background and commitment to farmers' and public welfare both inside and outside Parliament. ""He guides us. We respect him,"" he added.""I condemn the action of those 60 MPs who have signed the notice. NDA has the majority, and we all have faith in the chairman. We are happy with how he guides the House,"" the minister said.Attacking Congress, Rijiju said amid reports of ""links"" between George Soros and Congress leadership, along with their ""combined anti-India agenda"", Congress and its allies were ""rattled.""""I think Congress leadership should apologise to the country. The entire nation is worried about this issue,"" the minister said.","Move against VP ploy by 'rattled' Cong to divert focus from Soros links: Rijiju. 60 MPs, including those from TMC, SP, RJD, CPI, CPM, JMM, AAP and DMK, to RS secretary general P C Mody.

TMC first came up with idea of no-trust motion against VP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-first-came-up-with-idea-of-no-trust-motion-against-vp/articleshow/116190153.cms,"Jagdeep Dhankhar

To bring a motion to remove the VP, a 14-day notice has to be given and it should be approved by the deputy chairman before it is taken up. With the winter session ending on Dec 20, the notice submitted on Tuesday may not cover the required number of days. Opposition sources said they plan to submit a fresh notice in the next session.It is learnt that 10 days ago, TMC first came up with the suggestion of a no-confidence move against the VP. ""However, with Congress caught up with the Adani issue, it was conveyed to Sonia Gandhi , who spoke to Congress president and leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge, encouraging him to join the move,"" a source told TOI. It was decided that Kharge, Sonia and floor leaders of opposition parties would not be among the signatories to the notice, sources said.Since their first step during the monsoon session, opposition parties had gathered what they called ""evidence"" by compiling videos, articles and other documents, to prove their accusation of bias against the VP.In fact, a video clip also showed Dhankhar picking on BJP's Piyush Goyal.The opposition has been upset with Dhankhar over multiple issues, the latest trigger being him allowing BJP members to raise allegations of links between Congress representatives and controversial billionaire George Soro, who, the saffron party claims, are involved in ""anti-India activities"".The opposition said his conduct in the House on Dec 9, 2024, was ""particularly one-sided and totally unfair"", and that he was ""encouraging and provoking"" the treasury benches to make outrageous remarks. The motion submitted by the opposition MPs said it was ""unbecoming of high-level constitutional authorities that are expected to act in accordance with and in furtherance of the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India"".The motion said Dhankhar's term as RS chairman was ""rife with instances"" where he has ""acted in a manner that is explicitly partisan and unfair towards members belonging to the opposition"".They accused him of repeatedly making disparaging comments about opposition members, criticising actions where their MPs have expressed their views on issues concerning functioning of govt.They mentioned an instance from July where Dhankhar, while presiding over the House, labelled himself as the ""Eklavya of RSS"".It said Dhankhar has repeatedly denied ""legitimate requests"" of the leader of opposition in RS to intervene and rebut the PM and the leader of the House. They also alleged he was being an ""impassioned spokesperson of govt's policies in public forums across the country"".","A 14-day notice has to be given and it should be approved by the deputy chairman before it is taken up.

Mumbai Bus Accident: 4 Dead, 25 Critically Injured After Bus Accident Wreaks Havoc On Road

Mumbai BEST bus crash

: Locals compare accident impact to 'terror attack'

At least seven people died, while 43 others sustained injuries, some critically, in an accident on S.G. Barve Road, Kurla (W), on Monday. Police officials have cautioned that the number of fatalities could increase given the grave nature of the accident.The deceased in the fatal Kurla BEST bus accident have been identified as Shivam Kashyap (18), Kaniz Fatima (55), Afeel Shah (19) and Anam Sheikh (20). Three other deceased are yet to be identified.A crowded BEST Bus on route 332 travelling between Kurla and Andheri lost control near the White House building next to L ward office. The fast-moving bus struck multiple vehicles and people walking on the street before finally crashing into the entrance of Ambedkar Nagar at around 9:30pm on Monday. The collision involved five to six autorickshaws, 10 motorcycles, and approximately 10 pedestrians.“First the bus hit an auto and then it went on to hit vehicles one after another till it crashed into the Ambedkar Colony gate. In the melee, it rammed into several pedestrians and hawkers. There was chaos as people did not understand what was happening. It was like a terror attack. A mob chased the bus and caught hold of the driver and manhandled him until the police arrived,” said Kapil Singh, an eyewitness.“As I was leaving my house to head to the railway station, I heard a loud noise and saw that a BEST bus driver had hit several pedestrians, rickshaws, and cars.” Ahmed said they rescued some of the injured people trapped in a rickshaw. “We sent them to Bhabha Hospital in another rickshaw.” Sharique Ansari said his car was pushed for 100 metres before the bus halted,"" said Zaid Ahmed, an eyewitness from Kurla.BEST officials have initiated an investigation to determine whether the accident resulted from careless driving. While initial reports suggest brake failure as a possible cause, a technical expert from the traffic division is verifying these claims.Regional Transport Office chief Ravi Gaikwad confirmed that specialists have examined the vehicle and will assist Mumbai police in determining the root cause, whether it was due to technical issues, brake malfunction or driver negligence.The authorities have taken into custody the 43-year-old bus operator, Sanjay More, who claimed that faulty brakes led to the collision.Some locals described the accident's impact as ""resembling a terror attack ,"" which led to widespread panic.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash’s brother Bikas Kumar accused Subhash’s wife, her mother, brother, and uncle of filing false complaints and demanding Rs 3 crore for a settlement. Kumar claimed that the relentless harassment drove Subhash to end his life.A 34-year-old deputy general manager of a private firm, Atul Subhash, died by suicide in his flat at Manjunatha Layout’s Delfinium Residency on Monday.Subhash, originally from Uttar Pradesh, left behind a 24-page suicide note accusing his wife, her family members, and even a judge, of pushing him to the brink. He alleged explicit instigation for suicide, harassment, extortion, and corruption.The victim's father, too alleged that Subhash's wife framed Subhash in multiple cases. He said, ""He (victim) had said to us that those in the mediation court do not work as per law, not even as per the rules of Supreme Court. He had to go to Jaunpur from Bengaluru at least 40 times. She (the deceased's wife) used to frame one charge after another. He must have been frustrated but never let us feel that. Suddenly, we received the information about the incident - he sent a mail to our younger son around 1 am. It's 100% true (the allegations of the deceased against his wife and her family). We cannot express the level of tension that our son would have been in.""The Hoysala Police Control Room received a call early Monday morning about the incident. Upon reaching the flat, the police found it locked from the inside. Breaking the lock, they discovered Subhash hanging from a ceiling fan with a nylon rope.Subhash’s suicide note details his ordeal, highlighting nine cases filed against him by his wife. These included accusations of murder, sexual misconduct, harassment for money,domestic violence , and dowry demands. Subhash alleged that these cases were part of a larger conspiracy to extort money from him.Shockingly, the note also implicated a principal family court judge in Uttar Pradesh’s Jaunpur and a court officer, accusing them of corruption and bribery.Throughout the suicide note, Subhash repeatedly wrote “Justice is Due.” He recorded a video narrating his alleged harassment and urged his family not to immerse his ashes until justice is served.The note included a heartfelt message for his estranged four-year-old son, whom he claimed was kept away from him. Subhash called for his parents to be granted custody of the child.The police have registered a case under the BNS Act and initiated an investigation.","Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, 34, died by suicide in his flat on Monday.

NEW DELHI: The Congress, weakened by its electoral losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, now faces a strong challenge to its leadership of the INDIA(Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc. Days after the Congress dismissed Mamata Banerjee 's pitch to lead the opposition coalition as a "" good joke"", some of its allies have openly backed the Trinamool chief's claim while others said they are open to the idea of leadership change.Mamata Banerjee had last week expressed dissatisfaction with the functioning of the INDIA bloc and signalled her intent to take charge of the alliance if given the opportunity. ""What can I do if they cannot run the show? I do not lead the front. Those who are in leadership positions there should think about it. But still, I am maintaining my connections with the regional and national parties,"" Mamata had said. ""There are some who cannot tolerate me. If given the responsibility, though I do not want that, I can run it (INDIA bloc) from West Bengal. But I do not want to stay away from Bengal. I was born here and will die here,"" the West Bengal chief minister had added.While Mamata's target would be the Gandhis, especially Rahul, the fact remains that the INDIA bloc is being led by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at present.On Tuesday, RJD chief Lalu Prasad not just endorsed Mamata's claim but also dismissed any possible objections by the Congress. ""Mamta Banerjee should be allowed to head the INDIA bloc. The Congress's opposition will not make any difference,"" Lalu said when asked about change in leadership of the opposition coalition.Lalu is the second senior leader of the opposition coalition to endorse Mamata's leadership claim. Last week, NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar had said the Trinamool Congress chief is a capable leader and has the right to show her intent to head the opposition alliance. ""She is a capable leader in the country and has the right to say it. The MPs she has sent to the Parliament are hardworking and aware,"" Pawar had said when asked about Mamata's claim.The Shiv Sena(UBT) of Uddhav Thackeray has also backed the idea of discussions on leadership change and wants the Congress to convene a meeting of the INDIA bloc to discuss the issue.""If some of our allies, be it TMC, Lalu ji, or Akhilesh ji, have a different opinion about the INDIA alliance, we all have formed the INDIA alliance together. If someone wants to say something new and wants to strengthen the INDIA bloc, then it should be considered,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said. ""Congress should join the discussion and put forward its point,"" he added.Samajwadi Party, another key party of the opposition alliance, feels Mamata's leadership claim is triggered by string of poor electoral performances by the Congress.""In Himachal Pradesh, where the Congress is in power, they lost all four seats. Similarly, in Karnataka and Telangana, both Congress-ruled states, they lost half of their Lok Sabha seats. Furthermore, Congress failed to win even a single seat in Madhya Pradesh. It suffered major losses in Chhattisgarh. Had Congress performed better in the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi would not have become the Prime Minister today,"" Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav had said reacting to calls for change in INDIA bloc leadership.Mamata's party Trinamool Congress, however, directly targeted the Congress and urged the grand old party to get rid of its ego.""We had said earlier only that Congress should understand that INDIA bloc has failed under its leadership. It will be good if Mamata Didi is brought for leadership (of INDIA bloc). Out of all the leaders, Mamata Didi's name is on top when it comes to fighting politically,"" TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee said. ""Congress should get rid of its ego. She knows how to raise the issues related to the people,"" he added.This is not the first time Mamata Banerjee has taken up cudgels against the Congress. Ahead of the 2019 elections, Mamata alongwith TRS chief K Chandrashekhar Rao had made a strong pitch for a non-Congress, non-BJP federal front. However, their efforts for a third front did not fructify.The INDIA bloc's first meeting in Patna was hosted by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who had worked actively to bring together regional parties against the BJP. More than 32 leaders of around 17 political parties had attended the Patna meeting. However, from there on the Congress took over the leadership of the coalition and Nitish, who wanted to be the leader/convener of the alliance, eventually walked out of the INDIA bloc and joined hands with the BJP.While Congress has struggled to defeat the BJP in elections after elections, Mamata Banerjee has emerged as a strong anti-BJP pillar in West Bengal defeating the saffron party again and again in her state. However, the Congress has been quick to question Mamata's electoral performance outside West Bengal.With 99 MPs in Lok Sabha and the only party to have pan-India presence, the Congress is unlikely to accept the leadership of any regional leader, more so of Mamata Banerjee with whom they share a blow hot and cold relationship. With its dwindling electoral fortunes, the grand old party faces a real challenge this time around. For now, the Congress seems to be avoiding direct confrontation, with Rahul Gandhi advising party MPs to not react to ongoing leadership debate. The Congress seems to have survived BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's electoral pitch of Congress-mukt Bharat and Congress-mukt India, but if the regional parties continue to flex their muscles, we may see Congress-mukt INDIA - an opposition bloc minus the Congress.(With inputs from agencies)",Mamata Banerjee had last week expressed dissatisfaction with the functioning of the INDIA bloc. RJD chief Lalu Prasad not just endorsed Mamata's claim but also dismissed any possible objections by the Congress. The Shiv Sena of Uddhav Thackeray has also backed the idea of discussions on leadership change.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116177691,imgsize-141274,width-400,resizemode-4/116177691.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a significant decision, Supreme Court on Monday ruled that maintenance payable to the estranged wife and children would get priority over claims of secured, financial and operational creditors over the assets of a husband's firm facing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan refused to buy the excuse of the husband that he was not earning well to pay the huge arrears of interim maintenance fixed by SC for his estranged wife and children and that his diamond factory was running in loss. ""We direct that the charge of arrears of maintenance, payable to respondents, shall have preferential right over assets of the appellant, over and above the rights of a secured creditor or similar right holders under the insolvency framework,"" it said.The bench further ordered, ""Wherever such proceedings are pending, that forum is directed to ensure that the arrears of maintenance are released to the respondents forthwith. No objection of any secured creditor, operational creditor or any other claim shall be entertained opposing the entitlement of the respondents for maintenance.""The bench justified its order by giving priority to maintenance over claims of creditors by saying, ""Right to maintenance is commensurate with right to sustenance. This right is a subset of right to dignity and a dignified life, which in turn flows from Art 21 of Constitution.""In a way, the right to maintenance being equivalent to a fundamental right will be superior to and have overriding effect than the statutory rights afforded to financial creditors, secured creditors, operational creditors or any other such claimants encompassed within the waterfall mechanism under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, or similar such laws.""SC said if the husband failed to pay arrears of maintenance to the wife, the family court ""shall take coercive action against the husband and, if so required, may auction immovable assets for purpose of recovery of arrears of maintenance"".In Nov 2022, Supreme Court had stayed a Gujarat HC order which had directed maintenance of Rs 1 lakh to the wife and Rs 50,000 each to the children and fixed the interim maintenance at Rs 50,000 to the wife and Rs 25,000 each to two children every month. The bench confirmed its interim order.The wife had pointed out to SC that though the husband was paying monthly instalment of Rs 3.7 lakh for 10 years against a Rs 5 crore loan he had taken to purchase a house, he misled SC by showing his annual income as Rs 2.5 lakh.","Supreme Court rules maintenance payable to estranged wife and children would get priority over claims of secured, financial and operational creditors. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan refused to buy the excuse of the husband that he was not earning well to pay.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116186592,imgsize-1062185,width-400,resizemode-4/116186592.jpg"
"Rajnath meets Putin, affirms India will stand by Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-meets-putin-affirms-india-will-stand-by-russia/articleshow/116186941.cms,"India and Russia reaffirmed their strategic partnership, with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasizing their strong bond during a meeting with President Putin. Discussions focused on expediting S-400 deliveries, enhancing Sukhoi-30MKI maintenance, and expanding joint production of AK-203 rifles. While Russia remains India's primary arms supplier, India is diversifying its procurement.

NEW DELHI: India’s expansive strategic partnership with Russia was reinforced on Tuesday, with defence minister Rajnath Singh telling President Vladimir Putin that their “friendship is higher than the highest mountain and deeper than the deepest ocean”, while the two countries also inked a wide-ranging protocol on defence cooperation in “ongoing and prospective areas”.In his almost hour long meeting with Putin at the Kremlin, Singh also stressed that India “has always stood by its Russian friends and will continue to do so in the future”, underlining the fine balance India has struck between Russia and the US-led western countries even during the ongoing Ukraine war.“Putin and Singh were of the view that the bilateral partnership holds immense potential and their combined efforts will pave the way for remarkable outcomes,” an Indian official said.There were, of course, several concerns raised by the Indian delegation during the 21st India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meeting, which was co-chaired by Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrey Belousov.Sources said New Delhi asked Moscow to speed up deliveries of the two remaining squadrons of the S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems as well as set up a repair and overhaul facility for them in India, while also ensuring timely deliveries, maintenance support and supply of spares for several other weapon systems and platforms, ranging from Sukhoi-30MKI fighters to T-90S main-battle tanks.Moscow was also asked to give more transfer of technology (ToT) to improve the “maintenance and sustenance” of the IAF’s existing fleet of 259 Sukhoi jets, the bulk of them produced by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) under licence from Russia for over $12 billion.With Singh asking Russian defence industries to “explore new opportunities” to enhance their participation in `Make in India’ projects, Belousov said the operationalisation of the military technical cooperation agreement for 2021-31 will give the necessary impetus to such endeavours.Dubbing the ongoing joint production of AK-203Kalashnikov assault rifles at the Korwa ordnance factory in Amethi district of UP a “resounding success”, Singh also told Belousov that Russia must expand the production of such products in India and explore exporting them to other countries, the sources said.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to a major delay in the delivery of the S-400 missile systems to India, which were contracted under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract in 2018.IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan, but is likely to get the other two units only by 2026 at the earliest.On the Sukhoi front, the procurement of another 12 of the jets is now in the pipeline to replace the ones that have crashed over the years. In Sept, the defence ministry had also inked a mega over Rs 26,000 crore contract for the procurement of 240 AL-31FP aero-engines to power the Sukhois, which will be manufactured by the Koraput Division of HAL with help from Russia.There is also a major indigenous Rs 63,000 crore upgrade plan to make the existing Sukhois much more lethal with advanced radars, avionics, longer-range weapons and multi-sensor fusion to ensure they are capable of air combat for another 30 years, as reported by TOI earlier.Russia still remains India’s main weapons supplier, accounting for over 36% of its arms imports, though New Delhi has been focussing on enhancing its own domestic defence production. India has also increasingly turned to countries like the US, France and Israel for military hardware and software over the last two decades.Around 60% of the existing inventory of the Indian armed forces, however, is still of Russian-origin, including fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs and MiG-29s, warships like aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, Talwar and Teg-class frigates and Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines, AN-32 medium-lift aircraft and Mi-17 helicopters, among others.","India and Russia reaffirmed their strategic partnership during a meeting with President Putin.

On Syria



NEW DELHI: Israel can learn from India the use of soft power to win the war of narratives in times of conflict, Israeli ambassador to India Reuven Azar said during an interaction with TOI editors. As Israel has pressed on with its military offensive to destroy Hamas, there's been a wave of support for Palestinians in Gaza. Azar said Israel, as the only Jewish state in the region, was outnumbered in geopolitical composition.""We are the one and only Jewish state. You have very powerful media outlets that are investing billions of dollars like Al Jazeera, TRT, and many other outlets. Frankly, we haven't been investing enough because most of our investment went to hard power, not to soft power. You have been combining hard and soft power in the way that you have been challenging these groups,"" he said.As India looks to keep its relations with both Israel and Palestine on an even keel, calling repeatedly for a ceasefire in Gaza but also strongly backing Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, Azar said the Indian govt has been supportive of Israel's ""core national interests"". Acknowledging the differences between the two sides on issues like India's continued aid to UNRWA, an agency banned by Israel, and India's voting on UNGA resolutions concerning Palestine, the ambassador said Israel shares friendly ties with India and it will continue to engage with the Indian govt on these issues.""I'm not in the business of giving grades to our friends. I think that when it comes to our core national interests, India has been pretty cooperative. Of course, we would like to see many countries, including India, changing their voting pattern. And I told our Indian friends that when it comes to UNRWA, we prefer that they divert their assistance to the needy people through other channels. So, this is a conversation we're having and we are going to continue to engage. At the end of the day, this is a very friendly relationship and we have to continue having the discussion,"" Azar said.Like last year, India released $5 million for UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in Near East). The govt also informed Parliament last week that it voted in favour of 10 out of the 13 resolutions that were introduced in the UNGA since the conflict began, and abstained on 3.Azar suggested there might be some progress in negotiations for a hostage deal. The ambassador said Israel's agenda in Gaza is to destroy the military capabilities of Hamas and ensure that the group is not able to rearm itself.""For that, you need a new order in the Gaza Strip. So, that's what we are trying to achieve. To engage, to continue decimating Hamas, to engage with partners that want to work with us to restore peace. And that may take time. We want to see the release of hostages in batches at least. The PM (Benjamin Netanyahu) just met the families of the hostages and said he feels that time is ripe for a hostage deal. It seems there might be some progress in negotiations.... The bottom line is that we won't allow Hamas the possibility that in return of hostages, they will be able to take back control of the Gaza Strip.""While India and most other countries have repeatedly called for a two-state solution, Israeli Parliament Knesset voted overwhelmingly earlier this year in favour of a resolution rejecting Palestinian statehood. The ambassador said Israel wants the Palestinians to rule themselves to the extent that they can without threatening Israel.""It means that as long as you have a population that is bound to try and destroy you, you won't be able to give them full sovereignty because they will use that in order to destroy you. We tried it with the Gaza Strip. Look what happened. For 17 years, we gave a chance. And then Hamas indoctrinated their people from the age of two or three just to kill Jews. They completely took hostage all their activities just to create this capability to destroy the state of Israel. So, we have to be realistic about the degree of self-rule that Palestinians can have, unless a new generation comes that thinks differently.""Speaking about the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and its potential to further destabilise West Asia, Azar said there are three things about the geopolitical situation that are important now. ""First is that the Iranian axis is debilitated as a result of the cutting of its three tentacles (Hezbollah, Hamas and Assad). The second is what's going to happen with Russian presence in eastern Mediterranean because this is shifting balance of power between Nato and Russia. And third, this was a meticulously planned attack by the Syrian opposition that was supported, sponsored by the Turkish govt. The question is to what extent they are going to be able to stabilise the Syria situation. Don't forget that the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham comes from Jabhat al-Nusra, which was part of al-Qaida,"" Azar said.","Reuven Azar: Israel can learn from India the use of soft power to win the war of narratives in times of conflict. Indian govt has been supportive of Israel's ""core national interests"", he said. Azar suggested there might be some progress in negotiations for a hostage deal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116186102,imgsize-352707,width-400,resizemode-4/116186102.jpg"

HYDERABAD: Telangana high court stripped Monday former BRS MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh of his Indian citizenship , declaring him a German citizen. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 30 lakh for concealing his German citizenship and misleading the judiciary. This marks the first instance of a former legislator losing Indian citizenship.Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said Ramesh's actions since 2009 had deprived genuine Indian citizens of their right to contest elections. The court upheld the Union home ministry's decision to cancel Ramesh's Indian citizenship, citing his status as a German citizen.Petitioner V Rohith, counsel for Congress functionary Adi Srinivas, argued that Ramesh had naturalised as a German citizen in the 1990s after settling in Germany, where he worked, married, and raised a family. Ramesh, a four-time MLA for Vemulawada , has had a long political career since first being elected in 2009.An inquiry revealed that Ramesh had retained his German passport and citizenship despite acquiring Indian citizenship in 2008.","Chennamaneni Ramesh, a four-time MLA for Vemulawada, has had a long political career since first being elected in 2009.

NEW DELHI: The opposition INDIA bloc in Maharashtra will move the Supreme Court over the alleged manipulation of EVMs in the recent assembly elections.The decision to approach the Supreme Court against the Election Commission was announced by Prashant Jagtap, leader of the NCP-Sharad Pawar who lost the assembly elections from the Hadapsar seat in Pune.The decision was announced after a meeting between NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal and noted lawyer and Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi, reported news agency PTI.In the meeting, Kejriwal also flagged concerns related to voter lists in Delhi where assembly elections are due early next year.Earlier in the day, the Election Commission of India (ECI) claimed that, in a mandatory count, there was no mismatch found in the Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trial (VVPAT) slips and the votes polled in the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during the recently concluded Maharashtra assembly elections .In the elections held last month, the BJP-led Mahayuti received a paradigm-shattering mandate as the ruling coalition won 235 seats in the 288-member assembly while the opposition was virtually decimated, withMaha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance bagging only 46.The issue of EVMs authenticity had blown up after the Maharsthra polls as over 20 candidates from opposition parties who lost the assembly elections raised serious concerns about the integrity of EVMs.These candidates had alleged significant discrepancies between the votes polled and the results declared, particularly in constituencies where opposition had expected strong performance.Last week, the opposition parties in Maharashtra boycotted the oath-taking ceremony during the first day of the assembly's special session. The boycott was led by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, which included prominent opposition parties like Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP led by Sharad Pawar.The leaders of these parties, including Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray, voiced their concerns regarding the fairness of the recent elections. Thackeray accused the Election Commission of allowing ""misuse of EVMs"" during the state assembly elections.","The opposition INDIA bloc in Maharashtra will move the Supreme Court over the alleged manipulation of EVMs in the recent assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over growing misuse of dowry harassment provision by women against her in-laws and relatives, SC Tuesday said that any complaint without specific allegation must be nipped in bud and the law should not be allowed to be misused for arm twisting tactics by a wife and/or her family, reported.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and N Kotiswar Singh said that criminal proceedings on the basis of vague allegations should not be allowed in such cases. ""A mere reference to the names of family members in a criminal case arising out of a matrimonial dispute, without specific allegations indicating their active involvement should be nipped in the bud. It is a well-recognised fact, borne out of judicial experience, that there is often a tendency to implicate all the members of the husband's family when domestic disputes arise out of a matrimonial discord . Such generalised and sweeping accusations unsupported by concrete evidence or particularised allegations cannot form the basis for criminal prosecution,"" it said.SC said courts must exercise caution in such cases to prevent misuse of legal provisions and legal process & avoid unnecessary harassment of innocent family members.""Inclusion of Sec 498A of IPC by way of an amendment was intended to curb cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband and his family, ensuring swift intervention by the State. However, in recent years, as there have been a notable rise in matrimonial disputes, accompanied by growing discord within the institution of marriage, consequently, there has been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife,"" it said.The apex court further said that it did not mean to say that any woman who has suffered cruelty should remain silent and forbear herself from making a complaint or initiating any criminal proceeding but the court should exercise caution while acting on vague allegations.",SC expresses concern over growing misuse of dowry harassment provision by women against her in-laws and relatives.

SC took suo motu cognisance of the case on Aug 18. CBI has already chargesheeted Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer, for rape-murder.Mehta said though trial against the main accused in the rape-murder case has been filed, CBI is likely to file a supplementary chargesheet after completing its probe into alleged destruction of evidence by hospital authorities in the immediate aftermath of the incident, which sparked nationwide strike by doctors.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar asked Mehta whether the chargesheet in the financial irregularities case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been filed before the same sessions court where the earlier chargesheet was lodged in the rape-murder incident. Mehta said it was filed before a CBI court, which is different from the court conducting the trial into the rape-murder incident. He said the financial irregularities chargesheet was filed on Nov 29, but the agency had sought sanction for prosecution from West Bengal government on November 27.Appearing for the state, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, ""We have received no such communication."" Mehta said the senior advocate may not be aware of this as the request for sanctions to prosecute Ghosh and Pandey had been sent to the authority concerned in the state government on November 27.The bench asked the state to expeditiously process the request for grant of sanction to prosecute. Senior advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the parents of the rape-murder victim, informed the court that the trial in the case is proceeding on a day-today basis and as many as 43 of the 51 prosecution witnesses have been examined.

Rahul's Adani focus, Congress unilateralism rile INDIA allies

NEW DELHI/PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Tuesday endorsed Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee 's desire to take over the reins of INDIA bloc from Congress, days after Sharad Pawar too had backed her.""Congress's reservations (on this) amount to nothing. Mamata ko do (give her the leadership role),"" Lalu said.Congress, though, played down the issue. At a meeting with party MPs, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have advised them to ignore what is seen by the party to be a ""media-manufactured"" issue and mere ""posturing"" by allies.Though Lalu supported Mamata's claim to lead the anti-BJP alliance , it may be recalled he had consistently backed Congress since the days when Sonia Gandhi was struggling to shake off the ""foreigner"" tag.Other allies of Congress, such as Shiv Sena (UBT) and SP , have made few bones of their reservations about Congress continuing to lead the opposition alliance despite having been consistently underwhelming in election contests since the LS polls where it significantly improved its tally.YSR Congress, which is not part of INDIA group, too reiterated support for Mamata, calling her the ""most capable leader to lead the bloc"".There have been palpable signs of uneasiness with Congress's unilateralism in deciding priorities of the alliance. Allies are also upset with Rahul's fixation with the Adani issue which, many feel, has deprived them of the opportunity to use Parliament to seek to corner govt on issues like inflation which, they maintain, resonate better with people. Congress's poor performance in Maharashtra, Haryana and J&K and its manifest inability to be competitive against BJP in direct contests have weakened its case to be the natural leader of the opposition alliance.Considering that INDIA bloc, despite having Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge as its president, is not a structured entity and does not have a secretariat or a programme of action agreed upon by all stakeholders, Mamata's claim appears to be a challenge to Congress's ""size matters"" assertion and to make the intra-alliance equations more symmetrical.Congress is not pleased and its annoyance with Lalu came to the fore, with Congress secretary Shahnawaz Alam saying the party deserved to lead the alliance by virtue of its sheer strength.""Lalu ji is known to say lots of things casually. Let him place on record his views whenever INDIA bloc holds meeting. What does he mean by saying there should be a leadership change? Does he want Rahul to be replaced as LoP , a post our representative holds by virtue of the party's strength in LS?"" he asked.","RJD chief Lalu Prasad endorsed Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's desire to take over the reins of INDIA bloc from Congress.

BENGALURU: The suicide of a Bengaluru-based 34-year-old automobile company executive amid a bitter legal battle over divorce, child custody and estranged wife's Rs 3.3 crore demand has ignited an intense debate on men's rights and mental health.A police complaint filed by his brother Bikas Kumar alleged that his wife and in-laws demanded Rs 3 crore to withdraw police cases against him and Rs 30 lakh to grant him visitation rights to see his son.Subhash Atul was found dead in his apartment in Marathahalli area early Monday, leaving behind a detailed suicide note and a video outlining the alleged harassment he faced from his wife Nikita Singhania and her family.Based on these allegations, police have registered a case of abetment to suicide against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.""My brother was mentally and physically exhausted ever since the court battle started. Every time he attended the court hearing, he was mocked by his in-laws and told to die if he could not pay the money or pay for the visitation rights. These drove him to take the extreme step,"" Bikas said.Atul's 24-page suicide note and recorded video, which have since gone viral, accuse his in-laws of filing eight ""false"" police complaints and manipulating the legal system. He also charged a family court judge in UP, where the custody and divorce hearings were under way, with bias in favour of his in-laws.""It is better for me to end my life as the money that I am earning is only making my enemies stronger as I have to pay them... This cycle will keep continuing. With my own money that I pay as taxes, the courts and the police system will harass both me and my family members along with other people. The supply of the value should be cut. Anyway, they (in-laws) have been suggesting me to commit suicide,"" Atul said in the note.He also urged authorities not to allow his in-laws near his body and requested that his last rites not be performed until his ""harassers"" are brought to justice.""Despite all these, if the accused are allowed to go scot-free, just dump my ashes into a gutter near the court. This way, I can know how life is valued in this country,"" he wrote.In his final message, Atul apologised to his parents for being unable to care for them in their old age.",Subhash Atul was found dead in his apartment in Marathahalli area early Monday.

NEW DELHI: The massive gap in subsidies to fisherfolk - $35 (Rs 3,000) per person annually in India, compared with over $75,000 (over Rs 63 lakh) in some advanced countries, has forced government to seek a relook at the global trade negotiations and focus on per capita distribution of subsidies instead of aggregate payout.The current direction of WTO talks, which are seeking to address overfishing concerns by limiting subsidies, are seen to be skewed in favour of European nations, China and Japan. The countries, citing overall subsidy data, are seeking to cap the support in line with the current spend. This will limit the policy space for countries like India which may in future want to provide incentives. The position submitted in a paper at the trade body in Geneva are based on learnings from agriculture where the terms of trade rules favour rich nations""Adopting a per capita distribution of subsidies criterion could provide a more accurate and fair basis for managing overfishing and capacity issues, considering both stock sustainability and livelihood concerns,"" India has said. It added the annual aggregate level of fishing subsidies can't be the correct measure as they include beneficial as well as subsistence subsidies linked to livelihood, which do not contribute to overcapacity and overfishing.","$35 (Rs 3,000) per person annually in India, compared with over $75,000 (over Rs 63 lakh) in some advanced countries.

Lalu repeated the remark twice, suggesting it was deliberate and not a slip of the tongue.The comment has drawn widespread condemnation from NDA politicians, with many describing it as an insult to women and Nitish's efforts at their empowerment.Nitish's party JDU condemned Lalu's remark and demanded an apology. ""No amount of condemnation would be enough,"" JDU working president Sanjay Kumar Jha said, while calling the comment a reflection of a ""disgraceful mindset"".Jha highlighted Nitish's transformative policies for women, including 50% reservation in panchayati raj institutions, 35% reservation in govt jobs, the ban on liquor, and the success of the Jeevika initiative, which has empowered 1.4 crore women in rural Bihar.

BELAGAVI: A demonstration by Lingayat Panchamasali community near the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Karnataka's Belagavi on Tuesday, demanding reservation under 2A category, turned violent, with 50 protesters suffering injuries as they clashed with police.The Panchamasali are currently placed in the 3B category that offers 5% reservation in govt jobs and education, while 2A has 15% quota earmarked for the communities included in the category.During the 'Sangharsh Yatre' called by Basavajaya Mrityunjaya Swamiji, the spiritual head of the movement, thousands of members from the community, including lawyers and politicians, marched from Kondasakoppa towards the Vidhana Soudha, blocking the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway for more than an hour and creating a tailback over 6 km.As the protesters tried to force their way past police barricades, cops resorted to lathi-charge. The angry protesters retaliated by throwing stones and footwear at the police personnel, and shouted slogans against state govt and chief minister Siddaramaiah Police briefly detained Mrityunjaya Swamiji, Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and Dharwad legislator Arvind Bellad, along with some of the agitators, to restore normality.Before the march started, a ministerial delegation visited the Kondasakoppa protest site and requested the community members to withdraw the agitation. However, the agitators demanded that the CM should visit the spot, or else they would storm into the Vidhana Soudha.Later, responding to media queries at the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha, Siddaramaiah said: ""We invited the Panchamasali leaders to discuss the issue, but they didn't turn up. We are not opposed to protests as everybody has the right to protest in a democracy.""Meanwhile, factionalism within state BJP was out in the open during the protest. As Yatnal's followers shouted slogans against BJP state president B Y Vijayendra, party MLA Siddu Savadi took them on, resulting in heated arguments between the two sides. Police had to intervene to bring the situation under control.In further embarrassment for the party, when BJP Rajya Sabha MP Iranna Kadadi praised former CM B S Yediyurappa in his speech, the agitators started shouting ""sullu sullu"" (false false).","Demonstration by Lingayat Panchamasali community near Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Karnataka's Belagavi turned violent, with 50 protesters suffering injuries as they clashed with police.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday paid tribute on Swahid Diwas , commemorating the martyrs of the Assam Movement , by highlighting their ""extraordinary courage and sacrifices"".He said efforts of the participants in the mass movement to preserve Assam's unique culture and identity serve as enduring inspiration for the state's development. ""Swahid Diwas is an occasion to remember the extraordinary courage and sacrifices of those who dedicated themselves to the Assam Movement. Their unwavering resolve and selfless efforts helped preserve Assam's unique culture and identity. Their valour also inspires us all to continue working towards a developed Assam,"" he posted on X.The Assam Movement was an upsurge against the influx of illegal Bangladeshi migrants that altered the demography in many parts of the state. His remarks underscore BJP's strategy to align itself with the legacy of the movement - led by All Assam Students' Union and All-Assam Gana Sangram Parishad and later politically represented by Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which is now part of NDA. By invoking these sentiments, BJP seeks to connect Assamese identity with its developmental vision, reinforcing its political foothold. The movement culminated in the Assam Accord of 1985, but remains a contentious issue. AGP, born from the movement, initially gained political prominence but gradually declined due to governance challenges and unmet promises.Over the years, BJP has emerged as the dominant force in Assam, repositioning itself as the custodian of Assamese identity. Through a blend of cultural politics, the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, and an inclusive coalition approach, BJP has extended its influence across communities. Modi's focus on infrastructure and economic growth has further cemented the party's appeal. While Congress, once dominant, was perceived as indifferent to the migration issue during the movement, its subsequent inability to address voter concerns has eroded its influence in Assam.",PM Narendra Modi hails Assam Movement martyrs on Swahid Diwas.

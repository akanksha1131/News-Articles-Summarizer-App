Yes – They drive accountability and productivity No – They increase pressure and reduce flexibility





BENGALURU: TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually, restricting their bench time to a maximum of 35 business days each year. The policy aims to foster a proactive approach towards associate allocation, ensuring both organisational and individual goals are met.""At any given point in time, associates must be allocated for a minimum period of 225 business days in the last 12 months,"" the document reviewed by TOI showed. ""Long periods of remaining unallocated shall adversely impact associate compensation, career growth, avenues of overseas deployment in future, and continuity of employment with the organisation,"" it said. The new policy, which came into effect on June 12, was laid out by Chandrasekaran Ramkumar, global head of The Resource Management Group (RMG).RMG at TCS oversees workforce deployment, ensuring the right talent with the right skills is assigned to projects. This team focuses on maximising organisational utilisation by making sure every associate is optimally engaged and allocated to projects at all times.""In the event an associate is unallocated, it is the primary responsibility of the associate to proactively engage with the Unit / Regional RMG for seeking allocation and take initiative towards pursuing suitable opportunities provided by the organisation,"" the policy said.All associates who are released to RMG, available for the next assignment, and reporting to RMG are unallocated resources.TCS provides opportunities through platforms like iEvolve, Fresco Play, VLS, and LinkedIn. While unallocated, associates are expected to spend 4-6 hours daily on relevant learning via iEvolve, complete all mandatory and prioritised training, attend in-person sessions as recommended by RMG, and actively upskill to stay interview-ready. They should also use the Gen AI interview coach, review and address feedback from past interviews, and complete all training programmes on time with full attendance.To facilitate swift deployment, TCS has called out that physical presence in the office is mandatory. As a result, WFO exceptions and flexible work arrangements are generally not applicable. ""However, associates may request short-term flexible work options for personal emergencies in exceptional circumstances, subject to organisational policies and prior approval from the RMG.""TCS has stated that frequent short-term allocations to multiple projects are discouraged and may lead to HR investigations and appropriate disciplinary measures. An email sent to TCS on the policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to the press.","TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually.

Leaders agree to designate new high commissioners



Relations soured over Nijjar killing



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada. The two leaders also agreed to appoint new high commissioners for both countries to help resume ""regular services"" for citizens and businesses.PM Modi praised Carney for hosting the G7 Summit and said India is looking forward to working closely with Canada to improve ties. He noted the common values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law that India and Canada share.""Had an excellent meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney. Complimented him and the Canadian Government for successfully hosting the G7 Summit. India and Canada are connected by a strong belief in democracy, freedom and rule of law. PM Carney and I look forward to working closely to add momentum to the India-Canada friendship. Areas like trade, energy, space, clean energy, critical minerals, fertilisers and more offer immense potential in this regard,"" PM Modi posted on X.India and Canada have also agreed to designate new high commissioners, with a view to returning to regular services to citizens and businesses in both countries.A statement from the Canadian Prime Minister’s Office said Carney and PM Modi agreed on the need to strengthen ties based on mutual respect, rule of law, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.""The leaders agreed to designate new high commissioners, with a view to returning to regular services to citizens and businesses in both countries,"" the statement said.PM Modi also thanked Carney for inviting India to the G7 Summit. ""I am very grateful to you for inviting India to G7 and I am also fortunate that I have got this opportunity to visit Canada once again after 2015 and connect with the people of Canada,"" he said.He also spoke about the strong economic links between the two countries. Canadian companies have invested in India, and Indian businesses have also made a mark in Canada.PM Modi said, ""India and Canada relations are very important in many ways. Many Canadian companies have investments in India. The people of India also have a huge investment on Canadian soil. Dedicated to democratic values, Canada and India will have to strengthen democracy together, will have to strengthen humanity...""""This is the first time I have got the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister after his election, so I congratulate him for his grand victory in this election and in the coming period, India and Canada will progress together in many areas with him,"" he added.Ties between the two countries had worsened after the killing of pro-Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. In October last year, India withdrew its high commissioner and five other diplomats after Canada linked them to the Nijjar case. India also expelled Canadian diplomats.India had said the Justin Trudeau government was letting pro-Khalistani groups operate from Canada. Carney became prime minister in March this year after Trudeau stepped down. He is an economist and entered politics recently.After Trudeau’s exit, India hoped to rebuild relations with Canada based on ""mutual trust and sensitivity."" In recent months, security officials from both countries resumed contact. There have also been talks about appointing new high commissioners.The ministry of external affairs said last week that India sees the upcoming meeting between PM Modi and Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit as a chance to exchange views and “explore pathways” to reset ties.During PM Modi’s previous visit to Canada in 2015, the two countries upgraded their relationship to a strategic partnership. Canada has a large Indian diaspora.About 4.5 per cent of Canada’s population is of Indian origin, including around 1.8 million people of Indian descent. The Sikh population is around 770,000. Additionally, nearly 1 million Non-Resident Indians (NRI) live in Canada as students, skilled professionals, or temporary workers.Indian students have been the largest group of international students in Canada. In 2022, they made up 41 per cent of the international student population. However, Canada’s recent immigration policies have affected both Indian students’ prospects and the finances of Canadian universities.","PM Modi praised Carney for hosting the G7 Summit and said India is looking forward to working closely with Canada to improve ties.

Winnipeg Jets are willing to make a serious commitment

Where could Jonathan Toews end up next season? | OverDrive Clips | 06/11/25

Colorado Avalanche still strongly in the mix



Jonathan Toews is expected to decide soon as negotiations begin.







Jonathan Toews is inching closer to a highly anticipated NHL comeback. Once eyed by four teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning, he has reportedly cut his list in half. Now, all eyes are on two Western Conference teams, the Winnipeg Jets and Colorado Avalanche, as Toews prepares to negotiate a deal.Toews returning to his hometown is more than just a feel-good narrative; it’s now a serious possibility. For Winnipeg, bringing in Toews would not only boost leadership and experience but also serve as a powerful symbol for the franchise. With the team looking to re-establish itself as a strong postseason contender, Toews could be the missing piece that stabilizes the locker room and adds playoff grit.While the Jets offer sentiment and hometown appeal, the Colorado Avalanche bring title ambitions. Despite earlier assumptions that the Avalanche had moved on after acquiring Brock Nelson, Dreger clarified that his Colorado sources insisted they remain very, very interested in Toews.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver





The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns.

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was taken to a hospital in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after suffering an allergic reaction, according to officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The 53-year-old cabinet member was transported by ambulance out of precaution and is now alert and recovering, a DHS spokesperson confirmed. “Secretary Noem had an allergic reaction today. She was transported to the hospital out of an abundance of caution. She is alert and recovering,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.Noem was admitted to the emergency room, where CNN reporters observed several Secret Service agents positioned at multiple entrances.Appointed to lead the department shortly after Donald Trump secured a second presidential term, Noem was confirmed by the Senate in late January. Her appointment followed a career as South Dakota’s governor and representative in Congress.Since taking over the DHS, she has become a key figure in enforcing Trump’s renewed focus on strict immigration controls. Under her leadership, the department has overseen troop deployments to the southern border and the use of emergency powers to facilitate mass deportations of undocumented migrants.In addition to overseeing immigration enforcement, Noem also manages the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), though she has recently called for the agency to be dismantled. She has repeatedly criticised FEMA as ineffective and unnecessary. Last week, Trump also stated his intention to phase out FEMA following the end of this year’s hurricane season.As news of her hospitalisation spread, messages of support poured in online.Bruce LeVell, former Executive Director of President Trump’s National Diversity Coalition, posted on X, “My dear friend @Sec_Noem, our fearless Secretary of Homeland Security, was just rushed to the hospital. My heart is with her during this challenging time, but I know her strength and determination will shine through. Please join me in keeping Kristi in your prayers for a swift and full recovery.“She has been tirelessly spearheading @realDonaldTrump initiative to uphold law and order and utilise ICE to keep our country safe from criminals. Let’s stand strong for her, just as she’s stood strong for America.”Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk also called on supporters to “Pray for Kristi”.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was taken to a hospital in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after suffering an allergic reaction.

Why Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner needs a clean NHL break



A Blizzard of Goals Puts Florida a Win Away From Glory | 32 Thoughts

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner







The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.Read more: Trade news: Blackhawks send Victor Söderström to Bruins for Ryan Mast and a draft pick According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey. Mitch Marner wants control over his next chapter, and that next chapter seems destined to begin far from Toronto, in the quieter lanes of the NHL’s Western frontier. Don’t be surprised if talks stretch deep into the summer. Marner’s $10.9 million cap hit means any deal will require strategic balancing from both sides.In the meantime, fan opinion remains divided. Some still believe Marner deserves more time, while others see his exit as a necessary evolution for the franchise. Mitch Marner’s future with the Maple Leafs seems increasingly uncertain as trade rumors intensify. A move to the Western Conference could offer the reset he’s reportedly seeking. With emotional fatigue setting in and pressure mounting, Marner’s next chapter may unfold far from Toronto’s spotlight.","Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner is reportedly looking for a clean break.

Zack Cozart delivers strong message: He won’t back Trump if U.S. chooses war path







As global tensions escalate in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel, the political discourse in the United States is starting to reflect the unease. One unexpected voice has emerged from the sports world, signaling a strong personal stance—former MLB All-Star Zack Cozart has publicly warned that his support for Donald Trump could vanish if the president initiates a new war.Zack Cozart, who earned All-Star honors in 2017 and was once a vocal backer of Trump, used his platform on social media to issue a clear message. “If Trump gets us in a war, I will no longer support him, and I’m sure most of you know I love Trump,” he declared in a candid post on X. The statement marks a notable shift from his previous support, which had been emphatic and unwavering.Just last year, ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Cozart made no effort to hide his excitement. “I dunno bout yall but I can’t wait to vote for Trump… I’ve honestly never seen the party as united as now… they tried to kill our President … least we can do is VOTE!!” he wrote, reflecting his deep alignment with the Republican cause.But with President Trump closely monitoring the brewing Middle East conflict, the stakes have changed. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, acknowledged on Monday that Trump left the G7 summit early to “attend to many important matters,” citing ongoing developments in the region.The situation has become increasingly volatile, prompting Trump to make bold declarations. He urged citizens to evacuate Tehran and stated, “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate,” while emphasizing the need for “a real end, not a ceasefire.” This hardline posture may be driving even staunch supporters like Cozart to reconsider their allegiance.Cozart didn’t stop with one post. He later shared another message, hinting at a sense of disillusionment among Republican voters. The tone suggested frustration over what some perceive as misplaced priorities—foreign entanglements over domestic issues.For a figure once so invested in Trump’s political journey, Cozart’s statement feels like more than just a fleeting opinion—it reflects a deeper concern over the consequences of military action. While war is far from certain, it’s clear that even loyal followers are prepared to speak out if they believe the country’s direction veers off course.Also Read: Bryan Reynolds rushes out of Pirates-Tigers game as his wife goes into labor mid-match","Former MLB All-Star Zack Cozart has publicly warned that his support for Donald Trump could vanish if the president initiates a new war.

NHL insider reveals NHL and NHLPA are talking about new cap rules for playoffs





Why NHL teams and fans are paying close attention to this salary cap talk

Every NHL season brings intense playoff battles, but behind the scenes, there’s growing talk about something else, money rules. A recent report reveals that the league and the players’ union are in early talks to change how playoff salaries work. While nothing is final, one key insider has now explained the possible changes. And if approved, it could affect how teams are built for the postseason.On June 17, 2025, sports journalist Chris Johnston discussed a new topic on The Chris Johnston Show that has caught the attention of hockey fans. He shared that both the NHL and the NHL Players’ Association (NHLPA) are now in talks about setting some kind of “playoff salary cap.”Right now, the salary cap only applies during the regular season. But once the playoffs begin, teams are free to use players coming off long-term injuries, even if that pushes their total salary far above the usual limit. This has created what many call a “loophole,” and some teams have been criticized for using it to their advantage.Johnston said, “This is something that’s at the discussion stage… but there is a desire to at least look at changes.”No rule has been passed yet, but if the idea moves forward, it could stop teams from using certain tricks to get stronger just in time for playoffs.In recent years when clubs such the Tampa Bay Lightning employed the existing method to include star players during the postseason, this issue grew front and center. Many thought it was unjust even though the rules permitted what they did. Some fans believe this gives an advantage to rich or smart teams that can work around the cap.Also Read: NHL Salary Cap Loophole Gives Teams Like Dallas And Florida Extra Leverage: Report The NHL and NHLPA have not confirmed any changes, but sources from Sportsnet and TSN confirm that these talks are real. If a playoff cap is created, it would mean teams can only spend up to a set amount during the postseason, just like in the regular season.So far, there’s no word on when a final decision will come. But as next season draws near, several think the league should move swiftly to prevent more controversy. Everybody is now waiting to see if the NHL and NHLPA agree on a new playoff salary restriction.","NHL insider reveals NHL and NHLPA are talking about new cap rules for playoffs.

G7 on Migrant Smuggling



Condemning Transnational Repression



Zelenskyy appeals for Support



France to host next summit







On Day 2 of the G7 summit in Kananaskis on Tuesday, the remaining leaders continued with key discussions on terrorism, human smuggling, and the war in Ukraine, after Trump exited Monday night, saying he needed to focus on rising tensions between Iran and Israel.Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Outreach Session and held several bilateral meetings. G7 members issued strong joint statements on migrant smuggling and transnational repression, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for more global support amid fresh Russian attacks.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called his discussions with G7 leaders “productive”, saying they focused on global challenges and hopes for a better world.He held meetings with Canadian PM Mark Carney, UK PM Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, and Australian PM Anthony Albanese. They spoke about strengthening trade ties and boosting cooperation in economic matters.India and Canada also agreed to appoint new high commissioners to normalise consular and trade services, after a period of diplomatic strain.At the G7 Outreach Session, Modi repeated India’s firm stand against terrorism. He urged world leaders to act strictly against those who support or promote it. He also raised concerns of the Global South, asking the G7 to address them more seriously.The G7 countries released a joint statement renewing their pledge to stop migrant smuggling. This comes under the G7 Coalition and their 2024 Action Plan.The leaders committed to stronger border management and targeting criminal networks involved in human smuggling and trafficking. They also noted links between smuggling and other crimes like money laundering and drug trafficking, calling it a threat to public safety.The G7 also took a joint stand against transnational repression—acts by foreign states to threaten or silence people living abroad.Calling it a growing threat, the statement described it as an attack on sovereignty, national security, and human rights. It said such actions often target journalists, dissidents, activists, and religious minorities, especially those in diaspora communities.The leaders agreed to coordinate efforts to stop this trend and uphold international law.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined the second day of the summit as Russia launched one of its biggest attacks since the war began—killing 15 people and injuring more than 150.“It was a very difficult night,” Zelenskyy told leaders. He asked for continued military and diplomatic support, and said Ukraine is ready for peace talks, but only if pressure is applied on Russia for an unconditional ceasefire.Canadian PM Carney said the attack “underscores the importance of standing in total solidarity with Ukraine”.French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will host the next G7 summit in June 2026. The meeting will take place in the Alpine spa town of Évian-les-Bains. Macron said the focus would be on maintaining unity among G7 nations and working closely with trusted partners to increase their influence on global issues.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Outreach Session and held several bilateral meetings.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in series of posts on early Wednesday warned the ""terrorist Zionist regime"" and said “the battle begins” amid escalating tensions with Israel. Khamenei's post came following escalating threats from US President Donald Trump, who had just hours before called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender.""Moments later, Khamenei posted on X: “We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy.” The statement came shortly after Iran launched two rounds of ballistic missiles at Israel early Wednesday.Khamenei’s posts appeared to frame the attacks as part of a broader ideological struggle. In Farsi, he posted “the battle begins”, alongside an image of a man with a sword entering a castle gate, alluding to the historic battle of Khaybar, as per the Times of Israel.In a series of posts on his platform Truth Social Trump had claimed the United States had full control of Iranian airspace and warned that the country’s top leader was within reach. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump had wrote.“But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He later followed up with a post calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”Iran fired the latest barrage of missiles around 12.40 am which triggered sirens across of Israel and included around 15 projectiles. A second wave of about 10 rockets followed roughly 40 minutes later, prompting alerts in central parts of the country and the West Bank. Although there were no reported casualties, a fire broke out in a central Israeli parking lot, damaging several cars.Warning sirens were also activated around the Dead Sea due to what officials described as a suspected drone infiltration.Read: How Iran’s Supreme Commander Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lost his top commanders Meanwhile, Israel continued its offensive inside Iranian territory. Early Wednesday morning, the Israel defense forces (IDF) called for residents of Tehran’s District 18 to evacuate, citing upcoming military action targeting strategic infrastructure. Soon after, Israeli forces confirmed a new wave of airstrikes in Tehran. Reports also emerged of explosions in the city of Karaj, previously the site of a nuclear centrifuge facility targeted by Israeli strikes.Israel launched its military campaign six days ago, calling the assault necessary to dismantle what it described as an “existential threat” posed by Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. According to Israeli officials, the ongoing operation aims to eliminate top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists, missile launch sites and uranium enrichment centres.The conflict has already caused significant casualties. Iranian authorities report at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israel says over 370 missiles and hundreds of drones have been launched by Iran.

New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested on Tuesday at a federal immigration court in Manhattan. He was taken into custody after linking arms with a man whom federal agents were attempting to detain.Journalists and photographers captured the incident.Lander had spent the morning observing court proceedings and said he was there to “accompany” immigrants as they left the building. As one man stepped out of a courtroom, federal agents moved in to arrest him. Lander locked arms with the individual and asked to see a judicial warrant.Agents spent over 40 seconds trying to pull the two apart, dragging them down the hallway in a messy struggle. They eventually separated them and put handcuffs on Lander.“You’re obstructing,” one agent told him.“I’m not obstructing. I’m standing right here in the hallway,” Lander responded.According to US Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, Lander was arrested “for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.”The man Lander was escorting was also arrested. Lander was released after a few hours and walked out of the building holding hands with his wife and flanked by New York Governor Kathy Hochul, to cheers from supporters.He insisted he “certainly did not” assault anyone.“I am happy to report that I am just fine. I lost a button,” Lander told reporters. “I believe it is important to show up and bear witness and accompany people.”He added that the immigrant “ripped” from his arms “doesn’t have a lawyer” and will likely spend the night in a detention facility.The US attorney’s office confirmed it is reviewing the matter and will decide whether to press charges. “The safety and security of official proceedings, government officials, law enforcement officers, and all members of the public who participate in them is a core focus of our Office,” said spokesperson Nicholas Biase.The arrest comes as immigration agents conduct aggressive enforcement operations nationwide, often detaining immigrants outside courtrooms immediately after their cases are dismissed.Lander’s detention follows similar episodes involving other Democratic politicians. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested outside a detention centre last month, though his charge was later dropped. Rep. LaMonica McIver was charged with impeding officers at the same event. Last week, Senator Alex Padilla was physically removed from a press conference in Los Angeles for speaking out against raids.Lander’s rivals in the Democratic mayoral primary, now just days away, swiftly criticised his arrest. Former governor Andrew Cuomo called it an example of “the extreme thuggery of Trump’s ICE out of control.”Candidate Zohran Mamdani and governor Hochul both visited the scene, with Hochul likening the arrest to excrement in a post on X.","New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested on Tuesday at a federal immigration court in Manhattan.

US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early Tuesday, Trump made his stance clear. “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he said, adding that his goal is a permanent solution: “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire.”Later, on Truth Social, Trump doubled down, calling for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and stating that the US knows “exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”US defence officials had made arrangements anticipating Trump's potential directive for the US Air Force to support Israeli fighter aircraft with refuelling during their operations over Iran, two sources told CNN.These sources indicated that this consideration partly explains why more than 30 aerial refuelling tankers have been deployed to the region in recent days.Refueling Israeli jets midair would be one of the least aggressive forms of support.Still, CENTCOM has presented Trump with the possibility of joint US-Israel strikes on nuclear facilities.Vice President JD Vance echoed the urgency, posting on X that Trump “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”Trump met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday. Israeli officials, who have been urging US involvement, expressed optimism but said no formal decision from the US had been conveyed yet.While Trump had previously avoided direct military involvement beyond missile defense and intelligence sharing, his recent statements — including “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran” — suggest a shift.“Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.’ Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA,” he wrote on Truth Social.After Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, it claimed Iran was rapidly advancing toward building nuclear weapons.However, a US intelligence report earlier this year said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear bomb, though mounting pressure may be pushing the regime to restart its nuclear program.The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium in recent months. Iran continues to insist its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.While President Trump has not confirmed direct US involvement, his recent posts on Truth Social have stirred speculation. Trump’s increasingly aggressive tone and use of the term “we” in reference to military actions have raised questions about the extent of American involvement.And one of the key targets being considered is Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a heavily fortified uranium enrichment facility buried deep under a mountain. According to Brett McGurk, a former US official who served under four presidents, “Fordo is the crux of this thing.” Destroying it would deal a major blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but only the US has the firepower to make that happen.Military experts agree that multiple precision strikes by American B-2 bombers would be needed in a carefully coordinated mission. The New York Times reports that the Pentagon has rehearsed this scenario, which involves dropping a series of bombs ""down the same hole"" to penetrate Fordo's deep underground structure.Fordo is located nearly 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by heavy air defenses. It is widely believed to be Iran’s most likely site for developing nuclear weapons, as it is where Iran has enriched uranium and expanded its stockpile.","US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News. Trump had previously avoided direct military involvement beyond missile defense and intelligence sharing.

The New York Times

Who is Alex Soros?



Alex Soros, 39, is the chairman of the Open Society Foundations, the global philanthropic organization founded by his father, billionaire investor George Soros.

Raised in New York, Alex graduated from New York University in 2009 and earned a PhD in history from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2018.

In June 2023, he was named the heir to his father’s fortune and took over leadership of OSF and Soros Fund Management.

Who is Huma Abedin?



Huma Abedin, 48, is a longtime political aide and trusted confidante of Hillary Clinton.

Often called Clinton’s “second daughter,” she worked closely with her in various roles — from the White House to the US Senate and the State Department.

Born in Michigan to an Indian father and Pakistani mother, Abedin was raised in Saudi Arabia. She often credits her multicultural background for shaping her identity and perspective.

She started her political journey at 19, interning in the First Lady’s office in 1996, and steadily rose through the ranks to become one of Clinton’s most trusted aides.

Over the years, she held several prominent positions: senior advisor to Senator Clinton, traveling chief of staff during the 2008 presidential campaign, deputy chief of staff at the US State Department, and ultimately vice chair of Hillary for America in 2016.

Her final role with Clinton was as chief of staff. Though known for keeping a low profile, Abedin’s personal life has drawn attention.

She married former Congressman Anthony Weiner in 2010, but their relationship unraveled after multiple sexting scandals, The People reported. The couple separated in 2016 and divorced in 2017. They share a son, Jordan Zain Weiner, born in 2011.

She briefly dated actor Bradley Cooper before meeting Alex Soros at a mutual friend’s birthday party in 2023.

The two got engaged in May 2024 and recently married in a high-profile wedding attended by political heavyweights and celebrities alike.

'They are guilty as sin': Elon Musk slams media companies; dares both 'to take drug tests & publish' after he tests negative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-are-guilty-as-sin-elon-musk-slams-media-companies-dares-both-to-take-drug-tests-publish-after-he-tests-negative/articleshow/121914382.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday hit back at media companies, posting his own negative drug test results and challenging “The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal to take tests and publish the results. ”Musk posted a photo of his lab test results on X with a simple caption “lol,” showing negative results for several substances including ketamine, cocaine, and amphetamines. The post came just weeks after a New York Times bombshell report, which alleged that Musk had used a “cocktail” of substances while serving in a government advisory role.Responding to a repost, Musk doubled down, writing: “New York Times lies as easy as breathing. It’s normal for them.”In a separate post, he threw down a public challenge: “Great idea. I hereby challenge the NYT and WSJ to take drug tests and publish the results!”“They won’t, because those hypocrites are guilty as sin,” he sharply added.Musk also accused WSJ of falsely reporting that Tesla’s board was seeking a new CEO, calling it another example of unreliable journalism.Musk has tested negative for fentanyl, ketamine, and more than 22 other substances, including amphetamines, benzodiazepines, ecstasy, opioids, cannabis, cocaine, and ketamine, according to lab results he shared.The screening was conducted at Fastest Labs of South Austin, Texas on June 11, according to the shared documentation.Musk had previously acknowledged receiving ketamine prescriptions for depression treatment.The results follow intense media scrutiny and a bombshell New York Times report that claimed Musk was regularly using ketamine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and kept a daily pillbox with around 20 different drugs, including Adderall.The report even alleged the ketamine use had started affecting his bladder.He also reposted a user who quipped, “If Elon is on any drugs, I want what he’s having,” and later shared his test results with a single-word caption: “lol.”Musk had earlier dismissed these claims, saying, ""I tried prescription ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this is not even news,"" he posted. ""It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then,"" he added.The controversy came to a head recently when US President Donald Trump called Musk a “big-time drug addict.”Earlier, in his final Oval Office press conference last month, Musk appeared with a black eye, which he said was caused by his 5-year-old son—and brushed off drug-related questions, telling reporters to “Move on!”","Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted his own negative drug test results on Tuesday.

Iran-Israel conflict: How will blocking of Strait of Hormuz hit India? Indian refiners look at alternative routes for fuel supply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/iran-israel-conflict-how-will-blocking-of-strait-of-hormuz-hit-india-indian-refiners-look-at-alternative-routes-for-fuel-supply/articleshow/121902819.cms,"The Strait of Hormuz serves as a crucial channel for worldwide energy transportation.

Israel Strikes Iranian Foreign Ministry Building; ‘IDF Missiles Hit Nuclear, Govt, & Energy Targets’

What is the Strait of Hormuz & why it matters

The Strait of Hormuz serves as a crucial channel for worldwide energy transportation. This strategic waterway, spanning just 29 nautical miles at its narrowest section, facilitates the movement of approximately one-third of maritime oil shipments and 20% of global liquefied natural gas.

The strategic significance of this passageway, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and Arabian Sea, is emphasised by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), which designates it as the ""world's most important oil chokepoint.""

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that in 2023, roughly 20 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil and refined products traversed the Strait of Hormuz, accounting for about 30% of global oil commerce.

The majority of this volume—approximately 70%—was destined for Asian markets, with China, India and Japan being the primary destinations.

Although alternative pipeline networks are present, their capacity remains restricted.

According to IEA calculations, merely 4.2 mb/d of crude oil can be redirected through land-based routes, including Saudi Arabia's East-West pipeline to the Red Sea and the UAE's Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline to Fujairah. This available capacity constitutes just about one-fourth of the regular daily volume passing through the Strait.

Impact on India

Will the escalating Iran-Israel conflict cause an oil supply issue for India? Indian refiners are exploring alternative energy sources, including those from West African nations, to ensure fuel supply security in case Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz amid escalating tensions with Israel, according to oil industry officials.Following the eruption of Iran-Israel tensions on Friday, senior oil ministry officials and industry leaders are conducting scenario analyses and preparing contingency plans for potential supply disruptions and price volatility.The oil ministry reports that India maintains crude oil and petroleum product storage facilities capable of meeting 74 days of domestic consumption requirements. The strategic petroleum reserves account for 9.5 days of this total capacity.Unlike its strategic crude reserves, India has not established gas storage facilities. Additionally, the government maintains confidentiality regarding national oil and gas inventory levels.Industry executives indicate that this overall storage capability includes stocks at refineries, pipeline networks, vessels in transit, product storage terminals, and vacant tanks suitable for storing both crude oil and refined products.A potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz could impact 40% of India's crude imports and 54% of its LNG supplies. This strait currently facilitates approximately 30% of global oil trade and 20% of LNG shipments.India's crude oil dependency on imports stands at 90%, with refineries heavily dependent on Gulf supplies. Russian imports constitute approximately 35%, Gulf nations contribute over 40%, whilst Africa, the US and other sources make up the balance. African imports declined to 5% in May from 12% in April.For 2024, India's LNG procurement from the Gulf region stands at 54%, with Qatar providing 80% and UAE supplying the remaining amount. Qatar, ranking amongst the top three global LNG exporters, maintains significant influence over worldwide gas supply. Any interruption to Qatari exports could trigger a surge in spot LNG prices.Also Read | Significant dent? How an escalating Iran-Israel conflict can threaten India’s growth story - explained Additionally, long-term LNG prices could increase, considering 60% of India's long-term agreements are connected to crude oil rates.However, industry executives from Indian refining and gas companies express scepticism about Iran implementing a blockade, based on historical precedents. They suggest that such an action would likely trigger substantial price increases and direct US intervention, whilst also adversely affecting Gulf nations and oil-dependent countries.Additionally, executives note that blocking the strait would disrupt both Gulf exports and essential imports, including Iran's own trade, which serves as a significant deterrent.Currently, Indian refiners are maintaining their normal purchasing patterns without resorting to 'panic buying'.Also Read | Iran-Israel conflict impact: Basmati rice prices to drop as exports to Iran, third largest buyer of Indian basmati, expected to decline While contingency plans exist, an executive told ET that ""closure of the strait would shrink the global pool of available oil and gas. No matter how carefully you prepare, every economy would feel the impact of a supply crunch and price spike."" Another executive highlighted the situation's intricacy, stating, ""If India turns to West Africa for additional supplies, other importers are likely to follow.""The international LNG trade lacks the maturity and flexibility seen in oil markets, with few options for supply diversification. The 2022 energy crisis highlighted this vulnerability when a former Gazprom subsidiary defaulted on its LNG delivery commitments to India's GAIL, compelling the company to reduce supplies to domestic consumers.","The Strait of Hormuz serves as a crucial channel for worldwide energy transportation.

Josh Allen breaks silence on controversial Tush Push after NFL rule talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allen-breaks-silence-on-controversial-tush-push-after-nfl-rule-talks/articleshow/121916060.cms,"Josh Allen breaks silence on controversial Tush Push after NFL rule talks (Image via Getty)

Josh Allen shares his thoughts about the Tush Push ban during a sports interview

Josh Allen’s comments add more heat to the debate in the 2025 NFL season





The Tush Push play has become one of the most talked-about moves in the NFL. It gained fame through the Philadelphia Eagles, who used it with great success. Other teams, including the Buffalo Bills, have also tried it. Not everyone, however, concurs on whether it should still be in the game. Some coaches believe it is too dangerous. One team even voted to ban it. But now, quarterback Josh Allen has spoken out with a clear opinion—and it might surprise fans of the Buffalo Bills.In a new interview with Sports Illustrated published on June 14, 2025, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen spoke about the ongoing debate over the Tush Push. The talk happened after the NFL meeting in May 2025, where teams voted on whether to ban the play. The Buffalo Bills voted yes to ban it. Head coach Sean McDermott said it was risky and could lead to injuries.But Josh Allen had a different view. He told Sports Illustrated, “If you can’t stop it, keep running it.” He said that only a few teams, like the Philadelphia Eagles, do the play really well because they practice often and have the right players for it.Josh Allen also added, “Just because some teams do it better doesn’t mean others can’t try.If you don’t like it, my advice is to stop it.” He said he would follow any rule changes, but for now, if it’s allowed, teams should be free to use it.The Buffalo Bills used the Tush Push last season during important games. They tried it in the AFC Championship game against the Kansas City Chiefs. But it didn’t work well then—the Kansas City Chiefs stopped it. That loss may be one reason why coach McDermott supported banning the play this offseason.Still, Josh Allen seems open to using it again in the 2025 season if it stays legal. His words gave fans and experts something to talk about, especially since his coach feels the opposite.For now, the Tush Push remains part of the game, and Josh Allen seems ready to keep pushing forward—literally.Also Read: ""I would absolutely love to"": Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen willing to lead Team USA in 2028 flag football debut","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen spoke out about the Tush Push in an interview with Sports Illustrated.

Shaunie Henderson does a cover-up on her family tattoo





Tattoos are personal for most people. Some let a patchwork stay on their body for the rest of their lives, while some evolve and change the designs on their body according to the changes in their lives. And looks like NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal's ex-wife, Shaunie Henderson, belongs to the second group of people, as she was recently seen changing a piece of ink on her body that once meant the world to her. Is it her way of letting the past go or something else? Let's find out.Shaquille O'Neal and Shaunie Henderson got married back in 2002, and share four children - Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me’arah. Shaq also has a daughter from a previous relationship and adopted Shaunie's son Myles from hers. They had it all, and their love was evident in the way they stood by each other. But like all good things, this came to an end when Shaunie filed for divorce in 2009.Before things took a turn though, Shaq and his wife both got tattoos to commemorate their family. Shaq got the names of his ex-wife Shaunie, and two of their sons—Myles and Shareef, tattooed on his right wrist, and the names of his daughters—Taahirah, Amirah, and Me’Arah, tattooed on his left wrist.Shaunie, too, had a beautiful tattoo on her back - a butterfly sitting on a flower, where the petals had the names of all her children written in them.And while Shaq and Shaunie maintain a very amicable relationship as co-parents, looks like the latter is ready to move on from the past a little bit. She got married to Pastor Keion Henderson in May 2022 and now, recently, was seen doing a cover-up ink on the butterfly tattoo on her back. The previous design is gone, and in its place, there is a vibrant and colorful floral piece.Shaunie is still a very dedicated mother to all her children, which is pretty evident with how much time she spends with them, but what does the cover-up mean? Maybe it's just her way of bringing a new change into something old. After all, a tattoo is not proof of how much she loves all her kids.Also Read: “People will always talk”- NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal speaks out after wild gossip","Shaunie Henderson got married to Shaquille O'Neal back in 2002.

""Durant is on an expiring $54.7 million deal for 2025-26, and the Suns have made clear to six-to-eight seriously interested teams that they will make the best deal for the franchise – even outside of his preferred list of Miami, San Antonio and Houston.""





Kevin Durant has multiple trade options this summer. From the San Antonio Spurs making a buzz to even rumors of the Golden State Warriors knocking at his door, the NBA veteran could go anywhere. But the real question is - Will it be for the right reasons? While it is almost a done deal that he will be leaving the Phoenix Suns during the off-season, where he ends up landing is the main thing everyone wants to know. And with multiple sources saying that quite a few top teams are vying for his talents, the 36-year-old also has other things to consider.From the San Antonio Spurs to the Miami Heat to the Houston Rockets, Kevin Durant is keeping quite a few options at hand as the offseason window inches closer. He will be leaving the Phoenix Suns at the end of it, but where he ends up going is still up in the air. But according to NBA sources, chances of him landing with the Rockets or the Heats are much higher than that of the Spurs, who are also gunning for some top draft options this summer.According to Shams Charania of ESPN, while Durant has made his choices clear, whether his preferred destinations will match with what the Suns are looking for in their perfect business deal is not equated to the same.Durant apparently wanted to make a move to Houston or Miami back in February, and everyone thought that he could be transitioned into a new team, but nothing panned out, and he stayed with the Suns. Where he ends up now, once the off-season window opens, is what fans will be looking to see, as the playoff season inches closer with each day.

Andrew McCutchen exposes MLB’s new baseballs as reason for Aaron Judge ’s power drop





Yankees power hitters like Aaron Judge can be affected





The New York Yankees are going through a rough patch with their recent losing streak. While many fans are pointing fingers at the team’s performance, one baseball veteran has shared something even more surprising. His words are now making headlines. The truth may have less to do with how players are swinging and more to do with what they are swinging at. The problem could be in the baseballs themselves.Former New York Yankees outfielder Andrew McCutchen discussed on June 15, 2025 a major baseball shift few fans were aware of. He made this public in a video interview, saying that an MLB official told him the balls this season are not the same as previously.McCutchen said, “They told me the seams are higher this year. ” Higher ball seams, he said, can slow it down in flight. This implies that the ball does not travel as far when a player hits it as it used to. “Every baseball is hand-sewn; so no ball is same,” he continued.When McCutchen asked the MLB if they could fix the issue during the 2025 season, they said no. The league is still looking into it but won’t make changes right now.This comes at a time when teams like the Yankees depend on strong batters to hit home runs and score runs.Known for their potent hitters Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, the Yankees are having trouble scoring. Once leading in home runs, the squad is having more difficulty now hitting balls outside the park.Also Read: Aaron Judge And Fans React After DJ LeMahieu Hit Sparks New MLB Outrage Stats from this season show fewer home runs across all MLB teams.

Some believe it’s unfair to teams built around power hitting.If what McCutchen says is true, the Yankees might need to change their game plan. Until the MLB fixes or confirms the issue, teams and fans will be watching closely.","Former New York Yankees outfielder Andrew McCutchen discussed on June 15, 2025 a major baseball shift few fans were aware of.

A nickname born out of early dominance on the ice

Acceptance of a name that would define a legacy

Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT





Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Walter Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne Gretzky's famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Sunjay Kapur passes away after reportedly swallowing a bee: What we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/sunjay-kapur-passes-away-after-reportedly-swallowing-a-bee-what-to-do-if-caught-in-such-a-situation/articleshow/121902556.cms,"What happened to Sunjay Kapur

Why are these stings dangerous (and in this case fatal)

Poll Have you ever experienced a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting? Yes, it was very severe. No, I have not.

What should you do if you accidentally swallow a bee

Stay calm

Remove the stinger if visible

Seek immediate help

Remedies for mild symptoms (without breathing issues)

Rinse your mouth gently with water.

Take care of ""delayed reaction""

How to prevent such stings

When to go to hospital

Businessman Sunjay Kapur, who was previously married to actress Karisma Kapoor, died in a freak accident last week in London last week. Reportedly, the 53-year-old accidentally swallowed a bee while playing Polo, which triggered a heart attack. Reports suggest that the bee stung him inside his mouth, triggering a severe allergic reaction called anaphylactic shock, which then led to a fatal heart attack. However, as difficult as this might seem to believe, it is a real, though rare medical issue that can strike anyone. Let's dig deeper...Sunjay Kapur was playing Polo, when he suddenly said, “I’ve swallowed something,” and soon collapsed. According to his friends, he swallowed a bee that stung him inside the mouth. The sting in such a sensitive area can cause dangerous swelling and severe allergic reactions. According to doctors, stings in the mouth, nose, or throat are especially risky, because they can block airways and cause breathing difficulties, almost immediately, which can be fatal (like it happened with Kapur)A bee sting releases venom that can cause pain, swelling, and redness. On an open area such as hands or feet, the sting will first swell, and then get itchy, but will subside on its own, with some over the counter medication (unless you are allergic). However, when stung in the mouth or throat, the swelling can quickly block breathing passages. For people allergic to bee venom, this can trigger anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction causing difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, and shock.Even without allergies, stings inside the mouth are risky due to swelling and possible airway obstruction.Flies generally do not sting, unless threatened, but accidentally swallowing any insect can cause choking or irritation. The main danger is from stinging insects like bees, wasps, hornets, or yellow jackets.If you accidentally swallow an insect or get stung in the mouth, try to remain calm. Panicking can make breathing harder. Check if you have any difficulty breathing, swelling in the mouth or throat, dizziness, or hives. These signs may indicate a serious allergic reaction.If the insect is a bee and the stinger is stuck in your skin, remove it quickly by scraping it out with a fingernail, credit card, or any object with a blunt edge. Avoid pinching or squeezing the stinger, as this can release more venom.If you experience swelling in the throat or mouth, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, or collapse, rush to a hospital immediately. People known to have allergies to insect stings should carry an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) and use it right away if stung.Apply a cold compress or ice wrapped in a cloth to reduce swelling and pain.Take an oral antihistamine to reduce itching and swelling if you can swallow safely.Avoid scratching or irritating the affected area.Sometimes allergic reactions can worsen after the initial sting. Watch for any new symptoms and seek medical advice if swelling or breathing difficulties develop later.Be cautious when eating or drinking outdoors, especially in areas with bees or wasps.Avoid wearing strong perfumes or bright colors in such areas, as they attract such creatures.If you have known allergies, always carry your emergency medication and inform those around you about your condition.If stung inside the mouth, nose, or throat.If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to insect stings.If you experience difficulty breathing, swelling, dizziness, or fainting.If multiple stings occur.Disclaimer: This information is based on internet research and is intended for general knowledge only.

The liver is the largest internal organ in your body. It plays a key role in digesting food, storing energy, and eliminating toxins. Fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver. There are two primary types: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease, also known as alcoholic steatohepatitis.Fatty liver disease, particularly Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), is a growing health concern, affecting an estimated 30.2% of the world's population. Prevalence varies by region, with rates above 40% in the Americas and Southeast Asia.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by heavy alcohol consumption. It's often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from simple fat buildup (NAFL) to more serious inflammation and scarring (NASH).Often termed the ""silent epidemic,"" NAFLD can progress to more severe conditions like cirrhosis soon, if left unchecked. While many symptoms manifest during the day, certain warning signs become more pronounced at night.Recognizing these nocturnal symptoms is crucial for early detection and management.Individuals with fatty liver disease often report difficulty falling or staying asleep . The discomfort from liver inflammation or the body's struggle to process toxins can lead to restless nights. Moreover, the liver's reduced ability to store and release glycogen can cause blood sugar imbalances, further disrupting sleep patterns.A common symptom of fatty liver disease is discomfort in the upper right abdomen. This sensation can worsen at night, making it hard to get a good night's sleep. People may feel a sense of fullness or pressure, which can be quite concerning.Though not typically a symptom seen during night time, a decrease in appetite, particularly at night, may signify fatty liver disease. Individuals may find they have less interest in food, especially during dinner, which could eventually lead to weight loss and nutritional problems.As fatty liver disease progresses, the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream can affect brain function. This may lead to symptoms like confusion, poor memory, or trouble focusing on any task, commonly referred to as ""brain fog.""Fatigue is a hallmark of fatty liver disease. However, when the liver's detoxification processes are compromised, individuals may experience overwhelming tiredness during the night. This isn't just typical tiredness; it's an overpowering fatigue that can interfere with daily life.While swelling can occur at any time, it may become more noticeable at night. Fluid retention due to liver dysfunction can lead to swelling in the legs and feet, causing discomfort and affecting sleep quality.Fatty liver disease can cause itchy skin, especially if liver damage affects bile flow. When bile salts build up under the skin, it can cause irritation and itching, even if there is no visible rash.Unexplained weight loss can be an early indicator of fatty liver disease. The liver's involvement in various metabolic processes, including the regulation of body weight, can be disrupted, leading to unintended weight loss.In more advanced stages of fatty liver disease, jaundice can develop. This condition causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow due to elevated levels of bilirubin, a waste product from red blood cells. Jaundice is a serious sign and should be checked by a doctor immediately.While adopting a healthy lifestyle – which consists of a balanced diet, regular exercise, checking alcohol consumption and smoking, and having adequate sleep – can significantly elevate liver health, if you experience any of the above symptoms, especially during the night, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. Early detection through blood tests and imaging can help manage and potentially reverse the effects of fatty liver disease. Consult a doctor if you see such symptoms. It is important that you ensure a healthy well-being of your liver as it becomes one of the most vital organs of survival as the age increases, but also loses immunity without proper care.","Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) affects an estimated 30.2% of the world's population.

NB: This information is based on internet research and is intended for general knowledge only. It should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection, and now doctors are warning others to be aware of the symptoms.William Hand, a recent 8th-grade graduate from Hughes Academy of Science and Technology, started feeling really unwell early on June 8. He woke up before 5 a.m., and according to his father, Will Hand, things went downhill fast. In a heartbreaking Facebook post, he wrote, ""Everything snowballed and God called him home."" He shared a photo of his son, remembering him with ""flowing hair, big smile and in sports attire,"" saying, ""I will see you again, son. ""Will had developed a rare blood infection called meningococcemia—also known as meningococcal septicemia. It’s caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, which enters the bloodstream and spreads quickly. Once it kicks in, it can be extremely hard to treat, and is usually fatal.Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch told Fox Carolina, how brutal the illness can be: “The infection happens so quickly, and once it starts going, sometimes it’s very hard to save the person who is infected.”The disease spreads through saliva or respiratory droplets—meaning things like kissing, sharing drinks, or using the same utensils can pass it on.Meningococcal septicemia is basically a rare—and very serious—blood infection caused by a type of bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. You might’ve heard more about meningitis, which is when the same bacteria attack the lining of the brain and spinal cord. But in septicemia, instead of staying in the brain, the bacteria invade your bloodstream and start causing chaos throughout your entire body.This bacteria normally lives quietly in the back of the nose and throat of some people (called carriers) without making them sick. But every now and then, it can go rogue—especially if it finds its way into the bloodstream. Once it's in your blood, it multiplies like crazy and starts releasing toxins that damage blood vessels, mess with your circulation, and can quickly lead to organ failure.It spreads through close contact—think coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing things like drinks, straws, water bottles, lip balm, or utensils. You usually have to be in close or prolonged contact with someone who is carrying the bacteria. That’s why outbreaks can happen in places like college dorms, military barracks, or households where people are living close together.So, what actually happens? Once these bacteria enter the blood, they multiply rapidly and release toxins that can damage blood vessels. This can lead to internal bleeding, organ failure, and tissue damage—sometimes in just a matter of hours. That’s what makes it so terrifying: the speed. One minute a person might just feel a little unwell, and within a day—or sometimes even less—they’re in critical condition.Early symptoms can look like a regular flu or a bad cold. We're talking fever, chills, body aches, nausea, cold hands and feet, or a fast heart rate. In kids and teens, symptoms can include extreme tiredness, irritability, or a rash that doesn’t fade when pressed (a big red flag). That rash comes from bleeding under the skin, caused by blood vessel damage. It might start out as small red or purple spots and then spread quickly.The tricky part is how fast it moves. With many illnesses, you’ve got some time to figure out what’s going on. Not with this one. That’s why doctors and parents are always urged to trust their instincts—if someone looks seriously sick and symptoms are worsening quickly, it’s better to get them to a hospital ASAP rather than wait it out.The good news? It’s treatable—but only if caught early. Meningococcal septicemia is usually treated with strong antibiotics through an IV. Fluids, oxygen, and sometimes even medications to support blood pressure may also be needed. In severe cases, people may end up in the ICU or require surgery to remove damaged tissue. Even then, survivors might face long-term effects like hearing loss, amputations, or organ damage. That’s how serious this infection can be.Meningococcal septicemia is rare, but when it strikes, it’s aggressive. Knowing the signs, acting quickly, and staying vaccinated can make all the difference. It’s one of those “better safe than sorry” situations where awareness really can save lives.","A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection.

Unhealthy Gut Symptoms: Six warning signs of an unhealthy gut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/unhealthy-gut-symptoms-six-warning-signs-of-an-unhealthy-gut/articleshow/121898410.cms,"Frequent bloating , burping, and acidity

Skin issues : Acne, breakouts, and dullness



Irregular pooping schedule: Constipation and diarrhea



Hair fall, thin hair, and weak nails



Hormonal imbalance : No appetite at all or constant hunger



Constant fatigue or sleep disorders



Our gut is a natural indicator that something is wrong with our body. It examines the body from the inside and monitors hormone imbalance, nutrient deficiencies, and overall well-being. It doesn't just affect our stomach but also impacts our skin, hormones, and mood. Sometimes there are silent signals that we often ignore, assuming them to be something else, but that might just be our gut telling us to eat better and work better. ( Let us look at six of these signs...If your stomach starts to feel uncomfortably full after each meal or you find yourself burping constantly, it could be more than just a heavy meal and eating too fast. These symptoms often reflect the early signs of gut imbalance or a slow metabolic system. If your gut is healthy, it will efficiently process food, minimizing these discomforts. Symptoms like gas, bloating, constipation, and heartburn are distress signals from your gut.If something is not right with your body, it will show up on your face, reflecting what is going on the inside. Persistent pimples, dull skin texture, and sudden breakouts might not just be a skincare issue; it could be your gut’s way of asking for help.Imbalances in the gut may contribute to conditions such as deteriorating skin quality and psoriasis, which can affect the immune system.The most obvious red flag is the irregular bowel movement. If you are struggling with constipation, unpredictable timings, and frequent diarrhea, it is a sign, your digestive system needs support. Constipation may occur when the gut lacks the right balance of fibre, hydration, or healthy bacteria. If you are having loose stools, it may signal inflammation in your body, infection, and even food intolerances.If you notice significant changes in your hair and nails, then take it as a sign of an unhealthy gut. When the digestive system is not functioning properly, the body may struggle to absorb essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins like zinc, iron, etc. Addressing gut health can therefore, be a crucial step in restoring fuller hair, healthier nails, and overall vitality.Your appetite has much to do with what goes inside your body. It is a finely tuned system that involves multiple hormones like ghrelin (hunger hormone), leptin (which signals fullness), and cortisol. These hormones rely heavily on signals from the gut. If your gut is inflamed and overloaded with harmful bacteria, it can throw the body’s natural balance off. The body might feel starved for nutrients and push levels of unnaturally high hunger. Ignoring such fluctuations may lead to long-term hormonal disorders, mood instability, or chronic digestive issues.Your gut health resonates with your sleep quality. Having an unhealthy gut can impact your sleep habits, leading to chronic fatigue and fragmented sleep. The intricate links between energy levels, metabolic function, and gut health necessitate restoring equilibrium for restful sleep.So the next time your body starts to experience any of these symptoms, be sure to check with your trusted doctor to inquire further about the underlying condition.","Gut monitors hormone imbalance, nutrient deficiencies, and overall well-being.

5 dementia symptoms hiding in plain sight that are not just normal aging,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/5-dementia-symptoms-hiding-in-plain-sight-that-are-not-just-normal-aging/articleshow/121858845.cms,"What is dementia?



Frequent word-finding difficulties



Misplacing items in unusual places



Withdrawal from social activities



Changes in financial management



Mood and personality changes



Depression, anxiety linked to earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease

As we age, certain cognitive changes are expected, such as occasional forgetfulness or slower processing speeds. However, some symptoms may appear subtle and are often mistaken for normal aging, when in fact, they could indicate early stages of dementia.Dementia is a common and disabling disease that affects the brain. The number of people with dementia is growing worldwide and is expected to triple by 2050. There are currently over 55 million people with dementia worldwide, and nearly 10 million new cases of dementia develop each year.Now, dementia is a broad term describing a decline in cognitive abilities that encompasses various causes, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, among others.Although there’s no proper cure for dementia, prevention is possible even from a young age. It’s the spotting of early signs of the disease that helps in preventing the disease with an early diagnosis and treatment. Recognizing these signs early can lead to better management and planning.It's common to occasionally forget a word or name, especially if it's not frequently used. However, individuals with early dementia may experience persistent challenges in finding the right words during conversations.They might pause mid-sentence, use fillers like ""that thing,"" or substitute words incorrectly, such as calling a ""watch"" a ""hand-clock."" These difficulties can disrupt communication and may go unnoticed in casual interactions.While misplacing items occasionally is a normal part of aging, individuals with dementia may place items in unusual locations and be unable to retrace their steps to find them. For instance, placing a wallet in the refrigerator or a remote control in a drawer is more than just absent-mindedness. This behavior can lead to confusion and may cause the individual to accuse others of stealing.A person who once enjoyed social gatherings may begin to withdraw from them, not due to a lack of interest but because they feel overwhelmed or embarrassed by their cognitive difficulties. They might avoid phone calls, skip family dinners, or stop participating in hobbies they once loved.

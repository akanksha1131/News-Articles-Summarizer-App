Will hit back on our terms: Rajnath conveys India’s resolve against Pak terrorism to Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-hit-back-on-our-terms-rajnath-conveys-indias-resolve-against-pak-terrorism-to-australia/articleshow/121636966.cms,".

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday told Australia that it will strongly retaliate against terrorism emanating from Pakistan on its own terms, without distinguishing between terrorists and their sponsors, and will not be deterred by nuclear blackmail by its western adversary.The stern message on India’s setting a new red line against Pakistan through Operation Sindoor was conveyed during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and the Australian deputy PM and defence minister Richard Marles here. “India thanks Australia for its unequivocal support to India’s resolute response against the barbaric act of terror in Pahalgam,” Singh said later.Marles later also called on PM Narendra Modi to mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the India-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership. “Our shared vision for a stable, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific continues to guide our collaboration,” the PM said.During the meeting earlier, the two sides decided to further strengthen their bilateral defence cooperation, including by intensifying and diversifying industrial collaboration, and steadily work together towards their shared commitment for a free and open Indo-Pacific, with an eye firmly on an aggressive and expansionist China.Pakistan’s role in actively aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism, however, was a major focus area. Singh stressed India’s right to respond in self-defence against terrorism, describing recent actions against Pakistan as “measured, non-escalatory, proportionate and responsible”.While the two sides “agreed to work together to combat terrorism in all its forms”, India also stressed that mere condemnation of terror activities was not enough, and all like-minded countries must act against terror facilitators in multilateral fora like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Financial Action Task Force.“Australia was also told that if it expands its defence ties with Pakistan, its military technologies will end up with China. India also said its concerns about the activities of pro-Khalistani elements in Australia should be addressed,” an official told TOI.With defence ties having emerged as an important pillar of the India-Australia partnership, the two countries expressed satisfaction at the growing strategic convergence in different areas.The two countries in November last year had announced an arrangement on air-to-air refueling between their armed forces as part of their expanding military interoperability, while stressing their shared interests in ensuring “stability and security” in the IOR and the larger Indo-Pacific.India already has a military logistics agreement with Australia, which provides for reciprocal refueling, repair and berthing facilities for warships and aircraft, on the lines of the ones it has with other countries like the US, France, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.Moreover, Australia and Japan are regular participants in the top-notch Malabar naval exercise, which began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992 but includes all “Quad” countries now.India and Australia are now also stepping up cooperation in information exchange, maritime domain awareness and niche areas like AI, cyber, anti-submarine and anti-drone warfare. “India has also showcased its warship-building capabilities, which can lead to joint production,” the official said.","The stern message on India’s setting a new red line against Pakistan through Operation Sindoor was conveyed during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and the Australian deputy PM and defence minister Richard Marles.

Public faith in judiciary gets denuded by corruption among judges: CJI B R Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/public-faith-in-judiciary-gets-denuded-by-corruption-among-judges-cji-b-r-gavai/articleshow/121635924.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the polity still grappling with the sensational incident of discovery of huge amounts of cash at Justice Yashwant Varma’s official residence, CJI B R Gavai has said instances of corruption and misconduct in judiciary adversely impact public faith in the judicial system.Speaking on the topic ‘Maintaining Judicial Legitimacy and Public Confidence’ at the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, CJI Gavai said, “Sadly, there have been instances of corruption and misconduct that have surfaced even within the judiciary. Such incidents inevitably have a negative impact on public confidence, potentially eroding faith in the integrity of the system.”He said legitimacy and public confidence in the judiciary cannot be secured through coercion of command (contempt proceedings) but through the credibility earned by the courts. “Any erosion of this confidence risks weakening the judiciary’s constitutional role as the ultimate arbiter of rights,” he said.Without referring to Justice Varma, who was swiftly inquired into by a three-member judicial panel which in its report found truth in the discovery of cash at the judge’s official residence on Mar 14 night in New Delhi, the CJI said, “The path to rebuilding this trust lies in the swift, decisive, and transparent action taken to address and resolve these issues.”He said every system, no matter how robust, is susceptible to issues of professional misconduct. “In India, when such instances have come to light, the Supreme Court has consistently taken immediate and appropriate measures to address the misconduct,” he said.The CJI said the SC has taken another step to bolster public confidence in the institution through voluntary disclosure of assets by its judges. This enhances transparency and promotes greater accountability and setting an example of ethical leadership, he said.“The Court maintains a dedicated portal where judges’ declarations are made public, demonstrating that judges are willing to subject themselves to a degree of scrutiny, similar to other civil functionaries,” he said.The CJI said though live streaming was done to curb fake news or out-of-context reporting of court proceedings, there are instances where reporters go overboard and give a twist to remarks of judges.“Only last week, one of my colleagues (Justice PV Sanjay Kumar) in a lighter vein counselled a junior counsel on the art of court craft and soft skills. Instead, his statement was taken out of context and reported in the media as, ‘Our ego is very fragile; if you offend it, your case will go out’,” Justice Gavai said, calling out a news article published in a digital media platform dedicatedly reporting court proceedings.In conclusion, he said, “In today’s digital era, where information flows freely and perceptions are rapidly shaped, the judiciary must rise to the challenge of being accessible, intelligible, and answerable, without compromising its independence.”",CJI B R Gavai said instances of corruption and misconduct in judiciary adversely impact public faith in the judicial system. He said legitimacy and public confidence in the judiciary cannot be secured through coercion of command (contempt proceedings) but through the credibility earned by the courts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121636449,imgsize-15118,width-400,resizemode-4/121636449.jpg"
Judges taking poll plunge or govt posts after retirement improper: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-taking-poll-plunge-or-govt-posts-after-retirement-improper-cji/articleshow/121635797.cms,"CJI BR Gavai (file photo: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Taking a swipe at judges who resign to contest polls, as Calcutta HC’s Justice Abhijit Ganguly did last year, or take govt posts after retirement, CJI B R Gavai said such decisions raises “significant ethical concerns” and could undermine public trust in judiciary’s integrity.Delivering a lecture at a round table organized by the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, CJI Gavai said, “If a judge takes up another appointment with the government immediately after retirement, or resigns from the bench to contest elections, it raises significant ethical concerns and invites public scrutiny.”“A judge contesting an election for a political office can lead to doubts regarding the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, as it may be seen as a conflict of interest or as an attempt to gain favour with the government,” he said.“The timing and nature of such post-retirement engagements could undermine the public’s trust in the judiciary’s integrity, as it could create a perception that judicial decisions were influenced by the prospect of future government appointments or political involvement,” Justice Gavai said.Flagging this tradition of judges accepting post-retirement assignments, roles and positions from the government, which is as old as the institution, Justice Gavai said, “In light of this, many of my colleagues and I have publicly pledged not to accept any post-retirement roles or positions from the government.This commitment is an effort to preserve the credibility and independence of the judiciary.”The first of the SC judges to accept the post of governorship was Justice S Fazl Ali, whose appointment as Governor of Orissa (now Odisha) was announced by Jawaharlal Nehru government in 1952 when he was still a judge of the Supreme Court. It had raised ethical issues in the legal circles. Since then, many SC judges – Fathima Beevi, P Sathasivam and S Abdul Nazeer - have accepted gubernatorial posts after retirement.Justice Ganguly’s plunge into politics immediately after resigning from Calcutta HC and contesting elections on a BJP ticket was dramatic as he had judicially castigated TMC govt in many cases, including the teachers’ recruitment scam. But there were many such precedents involving SC judges.The much-admired Justice V R Krishna Iyer epitomized the politician-turned-judge-turned-politician. Justice Baharul Islam, an out and out congressman was elected to Rajya Sabha in 1962 and re-elected in 1968, in between unsuccessfully contesting Assam Assembly elections. Islam resigned from RS in 1972 to become a judge of Gauhati HC and retired in 1980 to immediately return to active politics. Nine months after his retirement, the Indira Gandhi govt appointed him as a judge of the SC. He resigned in 1983, weeks after giving a verdict favouring Bihar COM Jagannath Mishra in a corruption case, to contest for the Barpeta Lok Sabha seat. When the elections got countermanded, the Congress elected him to Rajya Sabha in 1983.Even Justice K S Hegde was a congressman and was elected to RS in 1952 for a two-year term and then again in 1954. In 1957, he resigned to become a judge of Mysore HC and became a SC judge in 1967. He, along with Justices J M Shelat and A N Grover, resigned in 1973 when they were superseded by Indira Gandhi govt in 1973 to appoint Justice A N Ray as CJI.Hegde contested and won from Bangalore North constituency in 1977 on a Janata Party ticket and became Speaker of LS. He later joined BJP and was one of its vice-presidents from 1980-86. He had unsuccessfully contested the 1984 LS elections. There are many former judges of the Sc and HCs who gleefully accept govt roles or positions after retirement. Some of the statutes require retired constitutional court judges to head certain institutions.Justices A M Thipsay, Vijay Bahuguna, M Rama Jois, Rajinder Sachar had plunged into politics after retiring as HC judges. Former CJI Ranganath Misra became NHRC chief and then was elected to RS on a congress ticket. Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi was nominated to RS.","CJI B R Gavai said judges who resign to contest polls or take govt posts after retirement could undermine public trust in judiciary’s integrity. “If a judge takes up another appointment with the government immediately after retirement, or resigns from the bench to contest elections, it raises significant ethical concerns and invites public scrutiny,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121635881,imgsize-752927,width-400,resizemode-4/121635881.jpg"
Operation Sindoor: Did India mean to send a message to China too? Shashi Tharoor responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-did-india-mean-to-send-a-message-to-china-too-shashi-tharoor-responds/articleshow/121635693.cms,"Shashi Tharoor in Washington.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is in US leading an all-party delegation on Operation Sindoor executed by the military, on Wednesday (local time) reflected on the Chinese 'kill chain' deployed by Pakistan.Interacting with reporters in Washington, Tharoor was asked if India's military action against Pakistan had a message for China. ""The fact that they (Pakistan) were using Chinese weapons and we were bypassing some of the Chinese radar defences, and the famous sort of Chinese network system. .. it all comes, and that's supposed to be the great sort of Chinese 'kill chain' we read about in the newspapers. When India decided to bypass some of those threats and hit the airfields, I don't think they're worrying about who gets the message. They want to make sure that the Pakistanis got the message, and they got the rough end of what we were sending them, which they did... I do believe that what happened on the night of the 9th and 10th (May) speaks for itself, and even more so, the immediate reaction of Pakistan the next morning to call off the conflict also speaks very vividly for itself, and maybe that's the message the Chinese will have to look at.""He criticised Pakistan's targeting of civilian areas following India's strikes on nine bases belonging to terror organisations listed by the United Nations Terrorism Sanctions Committee, the 1267 Committee's designated terrorists.At the National Press Club in the US on Wednesday (local time), Tharoor described the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pahalgam as distressing and disruptive to India's growth trajectory. He noted the significant tourism growth in Kashmir, surpassing visitor numbers to Aspen, Colorado in the previous summer.He said, ""In fact, in Kashmir, it's very striking that the previous summer we've seen more tourism and more tourists coming than Aspen, Colorado gets every year. And in the course of this year, the first few months of this year, there's been a 100 per cent increase on the corresponding months of last year. So Kashmir was booming ordinary, Kashmiris are benefiting from vast numbers of tourists coming in, putting money into their hands and their pockets. It was a lovely time and here's this innocent group of holidays, tourists on a dappled meadow in Kashmir being murdered in cold blood by people coming and asking their religion and shooting them between the eyes.""The Indian Armed Forces initiated Operation Sindoor on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, which resulted in 26 casualties and numerous injuries.The operation targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists from organisations including Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen. Following subsequent Pakistani aggression, Indian Forces responded by targeting their airbases. Both nations agreed to cease hostilities on May 10.",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is in US leading an all-party delegation on Operation Sindoor executed by the military.

Supreme Court dismisses Delhi Wakf Board’s claim over Shahdara Gurdwara,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-dismisses-delhi-wakf-boards-claim-over-shahdara-gurdwara/articleshow/121635792.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bringing curtains over a 50-year-old dispute relating to Delhi Wakf Board’s claim over a Delhi gurdwara as waqf property, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the Sikh religious place has been in existence since 1947 and rejected the Board’s claim that the property was ‘wakf by user’ since time immemorial.Appearing for the Board, senior advocate Sanjay Ghosh told a partial working day bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Satish Chandra Sharma that the Delhi HC erred in reversing the concurrent findings of trial court and appellate court that it was a wakf by user. He said, “some kind of gurdwara was built over the mosque”.But the bench said the evidence shows that the gurdwara at Shahdara has been functioning at the suit property since 1947. “Not some kind of gurdwara was constructed as you claim. It is a functional gurudwara. This has been admitted by the witness produced by the Board before the trial court. You should voluntarily relinquish any claim over gurdwara.”The bench dismissed the appeal filed by the Board in 2011 against the Delhi HC’s September 24, 2010, judgment. Interestingly, the matter was taken up for hearing by the SC after a gap of 12 years, the last hearing in chamber being before Justice A K Sikri.The HC judgment by Justice Indermeet Kaur had discussed in detail what ‘wakf by user’ meant by relying on several judgments including one by a division bench of the Lahore HC in 1937 and those of the Supreme Court.The Lahore HC had ruled, ""In the absence of any such intention or declaration, no wakf can be said to have been created. It is true that a wakf can be created by user, but that user too must be preceded by an intention on the part of the owner to create a wakf. If no such intention is established, user alone will not be sufficient to divest the property of its private character."" A stand which is similar to that of the Centre in defence of validity of the Wakf Amendment Act, 2025, before the Supreme Court.In the Shahdra gurudwara case, the HC had said the oral and documentary evidence establishes that the disputed property was a private property. “There is no evidence forthcoming to substantiate the Board's claim that there was a permanent dedication of this property by the owner as waqf; there is not a whisper of this either in the pleadings or in the oral version of the witnesses (produced by the Board).”“A mere bald statement in the plaint that this property was being used since time immemorial as a wakf property was not sufficient to establish this plea… in fact there is a admission by a witness that the said property was used as a gurdwara since partition of the country,” the high court had said.","Supreme Court rejects Delhi Wakf Board’s claim over a Delhi gurdwara as waqf property.

'Unsuitable destination': Trump bars foreign students from coming to US to study at Harvard University; what next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unsuitable-destination-trump-bars-foreign-students-from-coming-to-us-to-study-at-harvard-university-what-next/articleshow/121635330.cms,"Harvard University (AP Image) and US President Dnald Trump (File Image)





US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students, as announced by the White House on Wednesday. This action represents a significant intensification of efforts to prevent foreign students from attending this prestigious institution.The directive halts entry for new Harvard students under F, M, or J visa categories and instructs the Secretary of State to evaluate revoking existing visas for current students meeting specific criteria, according to the White House statement on Wednesday.Citing national security concerns, the White House expressed apprehension about Harvard's foreign connections. The administration criticised the university's alleged inadequate reporting of foreign student information, noting deficiencies in data submission for three students.The White House statement claimed Harvard either inadequately reports foreign student disciplinary records or insufficiently monitors these students. Additional criticisms included the university's handling of antisemitism and its continued emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).Also read: 'Retaliatory step': Trump blocks visas for new foreign students at Harvard; here's how the University responded The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has long warned that foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher education to steal information, exploit research and development, and spread false information, as per the White House.""Harvard has also developed extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries, receiving more than $150 million from China alone. In exchange, Harvard has, among other things, hosted Chinese Communist Party paramilitary members and partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China’s military modernization,"" the White House said in a statement.""Harvard has failed to adequately address violent anti-Semitic incidents on campus, with many of these agitators found to be foreign students."" it added.The President said that there are people who wants to go to Harvard but they can't get in because of foreign students. He also said that they are waiting for the foreign student lists from Harvard so that the administration can determine how many ""radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all"" should not be let back into the US.“The students? Well, we want to have great students here. We just don’t want students that are causing trouble. We want to have students. I want to have foreign students. We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there. But I want to make sure that the foreign students are people that can love our country,"" he said.“We are still waiting for the Foreign Student Lists from Harvard so that we can determine, after a ridiculous expenditure of BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, how many radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all, should not be let back into our Country. Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents, and probably for good reason!” Trump added.This development came after US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs's recent ruling, which indefinitely prevented the Trump administration from modifying Harvard's international student visa programme. This ruling came shortly after the judge temporarily stopped the administration's attempt to revoke the university's authority to enrol international students.The ongoing showdown stems from Harvard's refusal to submit to a series of federal government demands. The situation escalated recently after the department of homeland security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.Trump had already froze more than $2.2 billion in funding and now had terminated $450 million in grants to the country's oldest university.Members of the Republican Party have introduced new bills aimed at substantially raising tax rates on endowments held by elite universities, with Harvard being a primary target. The former president had previously indicated his intention to revoke the university's tax exemption privileges.Following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the US President has repeatedly criticised the university for its perceived inadequate protection of Jewish students. In response, Harvard has broadened its legal challenge against the Trump administration, contesting both the suspension of federal funding and what the institution considers to be demands that compromise its autonomy and violate constitutional principles.",US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students.

NEW DELHI: At least 11 people died and 33 others were injured as a stampede occurred at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru after a large number of people gathered to participate in the RCB victory celebrations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident ""absolutely heartrending"" and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured people. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah held a press conference and announced Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of those deceased. He also ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident.What was meant to be a day of jubilation turned tragic as a massive crowd gathered to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) first-ever Indian Premier League (IPL) title win. Scattered shoes, broken sandals, and torn pieces of sports jerseys littered the area, marking the aftermath of the chaos that unfolded when crowds spiralled out of control.Lakhs of young fans had converged outside the stadium with ""RCB"" chanting. Many were seen climbing trees, scaling walls, and clinging to poles in a desperate attempt to catch a glimpse of their cricketing idols.As excitement peaked, the situation turned dangerous.People began to fall, some losing consciousness. Panic spread quickly as the jubilant cheers turned into screams for help. Emergency services rushed the injured to nearby hospitals.Even amid the unfolding tragedy, groups of young fans were seen sitting atop compound walls near Saint Mark's Cathedral, cheering for RCB as sirens wailed and police tried to restore order.Despite a heavy deployment of police personnel, the sheer scale of the crowd overwhelmed security arrangements. Officials acknowledged they were heavily outnumbered by the surging masses.Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the stampede in Bengaluru as ""absolutely heartrending"". In a post on X, he said, ""The mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heartrending. In this tragic hour, my thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that those who are injured have a speedy recovery.""President Droupadi Murmu also expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in a stampede and called the incident 'shocking and heartbreaking'.In a social media post on X, Droupadi Murmu wrote, ""The loss of lives in the tragic happening at a stadium in Bengaluru is shocking and heartbreaking. My condolences to the bereaved families and prayers for the speedy recovery of the injured.""Chief minister Siddaramaiah, while addressing a press conference gave details of the incident, saying that 11 lives were lost and 33 others were reported injured. He added that the stadium has capacity of hosting 35,000 people, but around two or three lakh people gathered to witness the event, and the crowd was unexpected.""11 are dead and 33 injured due to stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. More than 2-3 lakh people came, and no one expected this much crowd,"" Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said at a press conference.Further, the CM said that he would not justify the mishap but drew comparisons with similar tragedies elsewhere, like in Kumbh Mela, as BJP criticised his government for the tragedy.""Such incidents happened in so many places. I am not going to defend this by comparing it with them now by saying it happened here and there. In Kumbh Mela, 50-60 people died, I didn't criticise it,"" he said.""If Congress criticises, then that is a different matter. Did I or the Karnataka government criticise?"" CM Siddaramaiah said.The BCCI called the incident shocking adding that the organisers should have been better-prepared.""It's most unfortunate, organisers should have planned RCB's IPL-winning celebrations better,"" BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.""When one organises a victory celebration of this magnitude, proper precautions and security measures need to be taken,"" he added.IPL chairman Arun Dhumal said, ""Whatever inquiry that needs to be done, the concerned authorities will do that. It was not a BCCI event. It is sad and tragic.""According to eyewitnesses, fans thronged the venue of felicitation. Visuals showed police shifting the injured persons and those who had fallen unconscious to ambulances.Cops were seen using mild force to manage the crowd outside stadium. They had a tough time in crowd management as a large number of cricket enthusiasts tried to gain entry, at the same time, into the stadium.According to a traffic advisory from the Bengaluru police, entry to Chinnaswamy Stadium was limited to only those with valid tickets and passes. ""As there is limited parking facility available near the Chinnaswamy Stadium, those who are attending the event are advised to use public transport and Metro. The public is requested to cooperate,"" it had said.Karnataka BJP President BY Vijayendra arrived at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital to meet the injured people.""The state government should take full responsibility for this tragedy. When the whole country and Karnataka were celebrating RCB's victory, the state government's haste to hold a victory rally without any prior preparations led to this tragedy. The state government never cared about prior preparations. They were more interested in publicity. This resulted in the death of more than 11 people. Some people are in ICU. I spoke to some victims, there was no police inside, no ambulance facility. The CM should send the matter for judicial investigation,"" Vijayendra said.The IPL champions and several political leaders, including Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah marked their presence at the victory parade.Also read: Tragedy at RCB's IPL 2025 victory parade: KSCA, franchise break silence on stamped",Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident 'absolutely heartrending' Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah held a press conference and announced Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of those deceased.

The announcement caught cops unawares as they had no communication about it. But it sent the already-electrified fanbase into overdrive.Then came the colossal collective failure: Police honchos failed to act swiftly and draw up crowd-control plans. Politicians turned the celebration into a photo-op frenzy, brushing aside warnings in their race to bask in reflected glory. Many brought their families to Vidhana Soudha to pose with the cricketers.""RCB gave the city a reason to celebrate. But cops and netas turned the joy into grief with their incompetence. It's shameful that Bengaluru couldn't manage a 1km victory parade,"" said the grieving brother of one of the victims.Even senior bureaucrats admitted that the lives could have been saved with proper planning and coordination. ""The RCB management did not consult us before announcing a victory parade. We would not have allowed it given the crazy celebrations that unfolded on the streets on Tuesday night after the victory. But the political bosses were in no mood to listen, they wanted us to go ahead with bandobast,"" a policeman said.Till mid-afternoon, there was no clarity whether there was a parade and where the events would be held. Senior cops were informed around 2pm to be at the stadium and assembly. By which time, the crowds had already gathered.","RCB gave the city a reason to celebrate.

With a rented scooter, a borrowed smartwatch, and the kind of wide-eyed excitement the newlyweds carry, Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi set off from Indore to the lush, rain-drenched trails of Meghalaya.On May 22, the couple reached Mawlakhiyat village and began the steep 3,000-step trek to Nongriat - home to the famed living root bridges. They spent the night there, surrounded by clouds and forest silence. The next morning, they checked out of their homestay and vanished.What followed was a slow unraveling of a horror no one had imagined.Their scooter was discovered abandoned on May 24, near a café on the Shillong-Sohra road. Then came days of agonising silence until Raja's decomposed body was found deep inside a gorge near Weisawdong Falls.“There is no doubt it was a murder,” said East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem. “We have recovered a dao. It was new and used for this very purpose.”The body was identified by a tattoo on his hand — “Raja and a lady” — and the waterproof smartwatch he had borrowed from his brother. His wallet, gold jewellery, and four mobile phones were gone.A raincoat, possibly belonging to the couple, was later recovered in Mawkma village, just a few kilometres away.Police are still trying to piece together what happened. “Whether the motive was robbery, vendetta or personal enmity, we need to look for more evidence before drawing any conclusions,” SP Syiem added.The search for Sonam continues with drones, sniffer dogs, NDRF teams and mountaineers combing the thick wilderness. But relentless rain has slowed progress.For Raja’s family, the grief is compounded by frustration. His brother Vipin, who has been aiding in the search, said authorities ignored early pleas to explore the very area where the body was eventually found. He also alleged that misleading information may be hampering the investigation.Adding to the chilling puzzle is a voice recording Raja’s mother received from Sonam on May 23 — the last known contact. In it, Sonam can be heard short of breath, telling her mother-in-law she was trekking to a waterfall and refusing to break her religious fast. The call ended suddenly. That was the last time anyone heard from her.The family has refused to cremate Raja’s body in Shillong. They are bringing him back to Indore so his parents can say goodbye.Their demand is clear: a CBI probe and Army assistance. For now, all they have are questions, empty silence - and a borrowed watch that told the time, but not the end.","Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi set off from Indore to the lush, rain-drenched trails of Meghalaya.

Once all the buildings are complete, there will be enough space for all,” said a source.The message came amid the plan to shift the first set of offices from North Block to the new buildings and amid the govt’s challenge to find enough space as demanded by ministries and departments.Sources said during the meeting, health secretary Punya Salila Srivasatava made a detailed presentation on obesity, with focus on reducing intake of edible oil by 10%, a call given by PM earlier. In the presentation, she shared the estimated number of obese people in India by 2035 and how the problem is more in urban areas and among children going to private schools, sources said.","“The world saw India’s strength (duniya ne humari takat dekhhi),” PM Narendra Modi said as he addressed the Union Council of Ministers on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: What was supposed to be a jubilant occasion to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) first-ever IPL title turned into a tragedy on Wednesday. A deadly stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium claimed at least 11 lives and left over 30 injured, with two in critical condition. The chaotic scenes have sparked political uproar, a magisterial inquiry, and a call for accountability.Here are the top developments from the scenes:Thousands of RCB fans swarmed the stadium gates and surrounding areas in anticipation of the victory celebrations after RCB’s historic IPL 2025 win. The huge crowd overwhelmed police and security personnel, leading to a deadly stampede near the gates.According to police, eight people died immediately after being rushed to Bowring Hospital, while the death toll later rose to 11. At least 33 others were injured, with several admitted to ICUs.Authorities had deployed a large police contingent, but controlling the massive crowd proved difficult. At Vidhana Soudha, where the felicitation program was held, Karnataka police resorted to mild cane-charge to disperse surging fans.Several people attempted to climb gates, trees, and fences to catch a glimpse of players.Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar told the media, “I have spoken to the Police Commissioner and everyone. I will also go to the hospital later. I do not want to disturb the doctors right now. The exact number [of casualties] cannot be told now. We appeal to the people to remain calm.”He added, “We shortened the program. It ended within 10 minutes. We are trying to make everything normal... lakhs of people came.”On BJP’s allegations of mishandling, Shivakumar said, “They are there to allege and we are there to protect… Yes, I am going to the hospital.”Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah expressed deep sorrow and said, “This tragedy should not have happened. The government expresses deep sorrow. Most of the deceased are youth.”He announced Rs 10 lakh compensation for families of the deceased and free treatment for the injured.“I don't want to defend this incident. Our government will not do politics on this. I have ordered a magisterial inquiry and given 15 days' time. People even broke the gates of the stadium. There was a stampede. No one expected such a huge crowd. The stadium has a capacity of only 35,000 people, but 2-3 lakh people came,” Siddaramaiah said.In a social media post, the CM wrote, “The pain of this tragedy has even erased the joy of victory. May the souls of the deceased rest in peace, and may the injured recover soon. My condolences to the bereaved families. I appeal to the public to prioritise safety above everything else.”BJP Karnataka president BY Vijayendra slammed the state government, alleging poor planning and lack of preparedness. “The state government should take full responsibility for this tragedy. When the whole country and Karnataka were celebrating RCB’s victory, the state government’s haste to hold a victory rally without preparations led to this. More than 11 people have died. There was no police inside, no ambulance facility. The CM should order a judicial investigation.”BJP MLC Chalavadi Narayanaswamy called the incident a “clear security failure,” saying the government underestimated the crowd size and ignored necessary precautions.Congress leaders expressed their condolences and called for stronger safety protocols.Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, “I am deeply saddened by the tragic stampede. My thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost loved ones, and I wish a speedy recovery to the injured.”Rahul Gandhi called the tragedy “heartbreaking” and said, “This tragedy is a painful reminder: no celebration is worth a human life. Every safety protocol for public events must be reviewed and strictly enforced — lives must always come first.”AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi termed the incident “very unfortunate and heartbreaking” and called for major preventive steps to avoid such tragedies.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy said that the Congress government must take full responsibility, calling the tragedy a result of “lack of proper planning and complete failure to take precautionary measures.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief in a social media post, saying, “The mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heartrending. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that those who are injured have a speedy recovery.”Fans trapped outside described a “nightmarish” experience.

Poll Should the Karnataka government offer compensation to the families affected by the stampede? Yes, they should No, that's unnecessary

NEW DELHI: A political slugfest erupted between the BJP and the Congress in Karnataka after a celebratory event for Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL victory turned into a deadly stampede in Bengaluru. As the BJP slammed the Congress-led state government for ""gross negligence"" and ""publicity-driven haste"" that led to the loss of lives, deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar defended the decision to continue the event after stampede saying the program was shortened to just 10 minutes.Speaking to the media, Shivakumar said, “I have spoken to the police commissioner and everyone. I will also go to the hospital later. I do not want to disturb the doctors who are taking care of the patients. The exact number cannot be told now. We appeal to the people to remain calm. We shortened the program. The program ended within 10 minutes. We are trying to make everything normal... Lakhs of people came.”The stampede, which broke out due to overcrowding and alleged mismanagement at the event, has reportedly claimed eight lives and left at least 40 others injured.Responding to the BJP’s criticism over the incident, the Deputy CM remarked, “They are there to allege and we are there to protect... yes, I am going to the hospital.”The BJP accused the Congress-led Karnataka government of gross negligence and administrative failure. BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya took to social media platform X on Wednesday to express shock and anger over the incident that claimed seven lives and left several injured, many critically. “Tragic stampede in Bengaluru. A celebration has turned into a nightmare,” Malviya posted. “This heartbreaking incident could have been avoided. The lack of basic administrative foresight and failure in crowd control by the state government has led to an irreparable loss,” he said. Malviya further demanded accountability, stating, “Lives were lost due to negligence, not chance.”Karnataka BJP president BY Vijayendra also questioned the ""haste"" to hold victory parade. ""The state government should take full responsibility for this tragedy. When the whole country and Karnataka were celebrating RCB's victory, the state government's haste to hold a victory rally without any prior preparations led to this tragedy. The state government never cared about prior preparations. They were more interested in publicity. This resulted in the death of more than 11 people. Some people are in ICU. I spoke to some victims, there was no police inside, no ambulance facility. The CM should send the matter for judicial investigation,"" he said.JDS chief HD Kumaraswamy also trained guns at Congress-led government for lack of proper preparation and ""no precautions"".""I am deeply shocked by the tragic death of more than ten people in a stampede during RCB's victory celebration near the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. I am deeply saddened by the loss of innocent lives before the celebration of victory. The direct cause of this great disaster is the lack of proper preparation and taking no precautions. The state@INCKarnataka government must bear the responsibility for the disaster. The government should immediately rush to the aid of the families of the deceased, in addition to providing good treatment to the injured,"" he wrote in a post on X.""My concern is that the cricket lovers who came to witness the excitement near the stadium and Vidhana Soudha should reach home safely without panicking or being in a hurry. The police should take urgent action in this regard and help the people,"" he added.",The BJP accused the Congress-led Karnataka government of gross negligence and administrative failure.

NEW DELHI: If you have been baffled by how and why railway tickets in certain trains disappear within minutes of the booking window opening even 60 days before the scheduled journey, IRCTC has detected those behind creating this artificial crisis. Only in the past five months, it detected 2.9 lakh suspicious PNRs while analysing ticket purchases done within just five minutes after booking commenced for both general and Tatkal tickets.Top railway officials said between Janand May, they have deactivated 2.5 crore suspected user IDs for booking tickets and put 20 lakh user IDs under revalidation as a part of a special drive.

NEW DELHI: Despite achieving near-universal enrolment in primary education, India faces persistent challenges in ensuring learning outcomes and strengthening school leadership, says Unesco's Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2024-25 released on Wednesday, reports .And the problem is not limited to the country.New Delhi: ""Most teachers are women, but few lead"" is the central message of ""Leadership in Education: Lead For Learning"" section of Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2024-25, released on Wednesday by Unesco. The report highlights what is a problem across countries: under-representation of women in leadership positions at all levels of the education system - from schools to education ministries, reports Manash Gohain.Globally, women make up 57% of secondary school teachers, but in most countries the proportion of female principals lags the share of female teachers by at least 20 percentage points. This disparity exists despite growing evidence that gender-diverse leadership correlates with better learning outcomes and more enabling school environment. Similar is the story at the higher education level. While women comprise 45% of higher education faculty, they account for only 30% of leadership roles in universities and colleges.India is no exception to this phenomenon. While women dominate the teaching workforce in primary schools - accounting for over 60% of elementary teachers - their number declines sharply in leadership positions, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels.The report also examines political leadership in the education sector.

"Census to begin April 2026, caste to be part of survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-to-begin-april-2026-caste-to-be-part-of-survey/articleshow/121632736.cms,"With tech, census data to be out much faster than in past

NEW DELHI: The Census exercise, put on hold over five years ago due to the Covid outbreak, may start on April 1, 2026, ending with the population count to be taken with the midnight of March 1, 2027 as the reference date. The caste of each resident of the country will be recorded, in a first since the decennial headcount of 1931, as part of the exercise, which potentially holds the key to two other decisions of far-reaching significance - delimitation and implementation of women's quota in legislatures.Sources in the home ministry said the Census - the first one to capture data digitally - will follow a schedule similar to Census 2011; it will be held in two phases - the houselisting phase to be conducted non-synchronously over a 45-day period across states and UTs anytime between April 1, 2026 and Sept 30, 2026; followed by the population enumeration phase, which will also record caste this time, between Feb 9 and 28, 2027. The population count will be recorded as on March 1, 2027, followed by a revisional round from March 1 and 5, 2027.The snow-bound areas of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K, along with Ladakh, will undertake population enumeration six months before the rest of India, that is, sometime in Sept 2026, with the midnight of Oct 1, 2026, being their 'non-synchronous' reference date.There was no clarity on whether National Population Register updation will be done along with the population enumeration phase, like it was done in 2011.The intent to conduct Census after 15 years is bound to be welcomed by policymakers and beneficiaries alike. The exercise is an important data-source for delimitation and reservation of constituencies across all three tiers of govt. It provides a snapshot of the country's population at a given point of time and forms a critical input for planning and formulation of policy initiatives. Census tables also aid research in fields like demography, economics, anthropology, sociology etc.Since the upcoming Census will embrace the digital mode - with respondents free to self-enumerate or have the enumerators capture data on their phones or tablets through the Census app or portal - govt sources said the tables relating to various data fields captured will release much sooner than the earlier decadal counts involving a lag of 5-6 years. A senior functionary said caste data may be released in three years. However, it is unlikely that the caste count by itself will form the basis for reservation.Though a countrywide socio-economic caste census was done in 2011, it returned around 46 lakh castes, with inaccuracies that kept the data from being made public. In recent years, Bihar, Karnataka and Telangana have undertaken their own caste surveys.Census 2027 may also fulfil the condition set under the delimitation law, for being the basis for the next delimitation, which is crucial not only to decide the representation of states/UTs in Lok Sabha but also for implementing 33% reservation for women in LS and state assemblies. As per the law, the next delimitation exercise must be conducted based on the first Census to be undertaken after 2026, though no day or month has been specified.The home ministry on Wednesday said the notification regarding the intent to conduct Census 2027 will tentatively be issued on June 16. Refresher training of enumerators and Census staff may follow; sources did not rule out a fresh pre-test, last conducted in Aug-Sept 2019, in view of digitisation of the process and adding of new data fields like caste.Though only Rs 574 crore was allotted for Census - set to cost over Rs 13,000 crore, along with NPR updation - in 2025-26 Budget, govt sources said finding additional resources was not an issue.Five states/UTs - West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry - are due to go to the polls in May-June 2026 but will have the flexibility to choose a 45-day houselisting schedule anytime between April 1 and Sept 30 to avoid a clash.","The caste of each resident of the country will be recorded, in a first since the decennial headcount of 1931.

Rijiju said Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) has sent the recommendation for the monsoon session to President Droupadi Murmu.The minister said although opposition parties would formally respond in a couple of days, he had been assured of their support and was confident of the same, as there was no scope for politicking as corruption in the judiciary could not be approached through a ""political prism"".Rijiju said he would also reach out to smaller parties as govt wants all parties to ""jointly"" move the motion.""Govt feels the matter related to corruption is not one political party's agenda. It is a stand of all parties to fight against the menace of corruption, whether it is the judiciary or any other space,"" he said.He , however, said the decision on which House the motion would be brought in - LS or RS - would be taken based on the business of each House.According to the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, once a motion to remove a judge is admitted in any of the Houses, the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, will constitute a three-member committee to investigate the grounds on which the removal has been sought.The committee will consist of the CJI or an SC judge, an HC chief justice and a ""distinguished jurist"".Meanwhile, Congress said govt had announced dates for the monsoon session 47 days in advance to run away from the opposition's demand for an immediate special session to discuss Pahalgam terror attack and Centre's ""failure"" to bring the terrorists to justice, the impact of Operation Sindoor and its ""blatant politicisation"".","If Justice Yashwant Varma doesn't resign and holds on to his argument of being ""innocent"", he may earn the unenviable distinction of being the only judge to be removed through Parliament's removal motion.

Will the ministry fast-track the clearance process to achieve the country’s objective of completing the projects without further losing precious time?

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadavin an interview to TOIresponded to certain questions on critical environmental issues including plastic waste, India's stand on developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, implication of the Supreme Court 's recent order of striking down retrospective environmental clearances and the country's plan to update its climate action pledges ahead of the 30th session of the UN climate change conference (COP30) in Brazil later this year. Excerpts:Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that India is determined to reduce single-use plastic and micro-plastic pollution for sustainable development. In order to address the plastic pollution caused by unmanaged and littered plastic waste, the government focuses on two key pillars: banning identified SUP items with low utility and high littering potential, and effective implementation of EPR on plastic packaging. Ban has already been imposed on identified SUP items since July 1, 2022. The “whole of government” and “whole of society” approach adopted for implementation of the ban has led to development of innovative eco-alternatives to banned SUP items and development of new business models.The ministry is continuously taking steps to promote the use of eco-alternatives. State governments and local bodies have been asked to incentivise the manufacture of eco-alternatives. A compendium of manufacturers and sellers of eco-alternatives has been prepared for wider use by citizens. It is a comprehensive document providing detailed information on manufacturing capacities of eco-alternatives and their availability across the country. Local bodies across the country are being encouraged to set up eco-alternatives stores.The mandate for the use of recycled content in plastic packaging has come into force from April 1. This has played a transformative role in moving towards super clean recycling technologies in plastic packaging waste recycling. More than 130 lakh tonnes of plastic packaging waste have already been processed since 2022. The implementation of SUP ban coupled with extended producer responsibility on plastic packaging will lead to a reduction in pollution caused by littered and unmanaged plastic waste.India believes that the success of negotiations at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) mandated to develop a legally binding international instrument on plastic pollution requires consensus-based decision-making with a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation for reaching an agreement on various provisions. We believe that in order to reach agreement the instrument should focus on aspects related to plastic pollution only. Aspects which are not directly related to plastic pollution should not be taken up.We need to strike a critical balance between preventing plastic pollution without affecting the right to sustainable development of developing countries, keeping in view their respective national circumstances. As developed countries have higher per capita generation of plastic waste and have historical responsibility, they need to provide financial and technical assistance by setting up a stand-alone multilateral fund which provides incremental cost for transition to developing countries for meeting compliance obligations.At the outset, I would like to highlight that there are 195 countries, which are party to the Paris Agreement. As per information, 171 countries have not submitted their successive NDCs. This is due to a combination of factors, including capacity constraints in developing countries, need for extensive modelling and studies, and careful consideration of the national circumstances and development needs.A pragmatic approach and careful consideration of national circumstance and development priorities is essential for development of necessary policies to enable ambitious NDCs. For this purpose, the government has initiated a series of studies.The nature of goals under India’s successive NDC will be based on outcomes and subsequent consultations thereon. However, it should be noted that the Paris Agreement casts an obligation on the developed nations to take lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets.The need of the hour is ambitious climate action. For this purpose, the government stands committed and it has been initiating and implementing many schemes and programmes to scale up India’s action on both the adaptation and mitigation across many sectors including water, agriculture, forest, energy and enterprise, sustainability mobility and housing, waste management, circular economy, and resource efficiency, etc.The EIA Notification 1994 and 2006 provided that any new project or activity or expansion/modernization of any activity, covered in its schedule, shall not be undertaken unless it has been accorded prior environmental clearance. However, in practice certain projects, which are otherwise eligible to get Environmental Clearance (EC) under the EIA notification, commenced their projects or activities without prior EC and thus did not get formal EC for their project.A need was felt to bring such projects under the EC compliance mechanism. Initially, a Notification was issued in 2017 and later, in compliance with the directions of NGT in this regard, an OM was issued in 2021. The Supreme Court had on May 16 directed that ECs granted as on date of the order, under the above mentioned notification and OM, shall not be affected. However, no further ECs can be granted under the provisions of the 2017 notification and 2021 OM.The Modigovernment follows ‘whole of the government approach’ in addressing various issues. The ministry will ensure that all the green clearances/regulatory approvals for these strategic projects are granted expeditiously, while ensuring appropriate scientific rigour in the appraisal process.",Bhupender Yadavin answers questions on critical environmental issues including plastic waste. He also discusses India's stand on developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution.

He will also inaugurate the Anji bridge, India’s first cable-stayed rail bridge, in Reasi district, officials said.The massive developmental push comes at a time when J&K is reeling under the impact of the Pahalgam terror attack and its aftermath.Two days before the PM’s visit, LG Manoj Sinha said the infrastructure boost was aimed at driving J&K’s transformation, enhancing living standards and fostering broader economic participation. “PM Modi has created an inclusive and vibrant future for J&K. It has witnessed a new dynamism in every sector and inclusive growth has ensured no section of society is left behind,” he added.The LG emphasised that the 272-km long USBRL, constructed at a cost of around Rs 43,780 crore, would usher in a new era of development in Kashmir.The rail link, which includes 36 tunnels spanning 119 km and 943 bridges, establishes seamless all-weather connectivity between Kashmir Valley and the rest of the country, driving the region’s socio-economic integration.“This historic railway line will unlock the potential of Jammu & Kashmir and drive unprecedented economic growth in remote areas,” Sinha said, adding “it’s a railway line to the future.”The Chenab bridge, considered an engineering marvel, is part of the USBRL. Built at a height of 359 metres above the River Chenab, it is a 1,315-metre-long steel arch bridge engineered to withstand seismic and extreme wind conditions.“Through Vande Bharat train moving on the bridge, it will take just about 3 hours to travel between Katra and Srinagar, reducing existing travel time by two-three hours,” said an official.PM Modi will also lay the foundation stone of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence in Katra, built at a cost of over Rs 350 crore. It will be the first medical college in Reasi district.Some of the other projects to be inaugurated on June 6 include road networks that will boost last mile connectivity, especially in border areas, officials said. The PM will lay the foundation stone of a road widening project from Rafiabad to Kupwara on NH-701 and the construction of Shopian bypass road worth over Rs 1,952 crore. He will also inaugurate two flyovers in Srinagar.","PM Narendra Modi will launch multiple development initiatives worth over Rs 46,000 crore at Katra in Jammu.

The agency also confiscated his mobile phones and land documents.Khan, who had retired on March 31, 2018, appeared before CBI in Chandigarh, where he cooperated with the investigation, but requested for the return of his passport.However, the regional passport officer in Srinagar informed him on Feb 3, 2023, that his travel document had been impounded under section 10(3)(c) of the Passports Act, citing national security concerns.Khan filed an application seeking release of his passport before the CBI special court, stating he was a senior citizen and intended to go for Hajj pilgrimage. On Sept 11, 2024, the CBI court released the other articles seized during the raid, but held that the passport could not be released.Khan challenged the order in HC, arguing that he was not involved in any act prejudicial to India’s security and that his passport had been held for over three years without any charges being filed.CBI opposed the plea, stating that his role had been established in the “conspiracy for issuance of arms licences illegally in view of the monetary considerations”.The probe agency said it had sought sanction for his prosecution as of Oct 30, 2023, which was still awaited.The HC said the respondents had failed to place any material on record to indicate that the impounding of the petitioner’s passport was with regard to the security concerns of J&K and that it was necessary in the interest of the country’s security.The right to travel abroad was an important human right, for it nourished the independent and self-determining creative character of the individual, the high court stated, citing a Supreme Court judgment.","CBI had seized the passport of Sajad Ahmad Khan during a raid at his residence Oct 12, 2021, in connection with an investigation into the illegal issuance of arms licences.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi on Wednesday delivered a scathing rebuke of Pakistan and its political-military establishment during a public address in Brussels, targeting former Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari without naming him.Referring to Bhutto's remarks, Chaturvedi said, “The person who is leading the delegation, in his parliamentary speech, said ‘Kon raat ke andhere mein hamle karte hain, Buzdil raat ke waqt hamle karte hain’... ‘Buzdil’ are those who do a coup on an elected government and after sending them to jail, murder the elected Prime Minister, so that the army can control the government.”Her comments referenced Bhutto's remarks on India's military response to Islamabad's terror attacks. Chaturvedi flipped that accusation, linking true cowardice to Pakistan's history of military coups and political assassinations, including the killing of Benazir Bhutto and the ousting of Imran Khan.In a sharp critique of the Pakistani state’s support for terrorism , she called on the international community to confront Islamabad’s role. “It is high time that we ask the international community to stand up in unison and call out this kind of terror activities emanating from Pakistan...Pakistan has become a hub, the economic model to use terrorism as a way to try and hold the world to ransom... Call them out in the UNSC... till you don't call them out, this is a failed fight against terrorism that the European Union is running. ”She highlighted India’s resilience against Pakistan across fields—from military conflict to cricket—saying, “We have decades of experience of showing them their place.

NEW DELHI: As an American team touches down in the Capital for negotiating the proposed bilateral trade agreement, government is keeping close tabs on the legal dispute over Trump’s tariffs and the concessions being offered by the US administration to other countries given that the talks are focusing on how both countries can get better market access.The Trump administration is seeking to use the 10% baseline tariffs and the suspended reciprocal tariffs (26% in India’s case) to negotiate trade deals. The court setback, which was stayed a day later, has injected fresh uncertainty, and the government is keen to ensure that it manages to extract the best deal for Indian companies.“What we get compared to other countries will be what we will ultimately finalise in the deal,” a government official said.At the same time, India is conscious of the strategic ties with the US and is looking to step up import of shale gas, LNG, and crude oil from America to diversify its import basket, as prices of these items are lower in the US, an official said. This is expected to help bridge the trade gap of over $40 billion in India’s favour, a major grudge with Trump, who has been doling out various numbers to justify his tariffs actions.How the US administration works out the trade deal will also determine the government’s future course of action on retaliating against some of the tariff hikes introduced by Trump, such as those on steel and aluminium products.“Exports are increasing... there are several things we can buy from the US... For example, shale gas, LNG, crude oil. The more diversified our sources, the greater the benefit for us.

NEW DELHI: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi , who was part of a multi-party delegation led by BJP MP Baijayant Panda to four Gulf countries, launched a scathing attack on Pakistan on Wednesday, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism through illicit financial networks and promoting extremist ideologies.Speaking to news agency ANI, Owaisi described Pakistan as the “epicentre of Takfirism” and alleged that its government, deep state, and intelligence agency ISI were complicit in funding terror groups. “We represented India over there... and told them Pakistan has been indulging in terrorism in India for many years,” he said.He added that the Resistance Front, which was behind the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , was essentially a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba , and India's concerns had already been conveyed to the United Nations Security Council’s 1262 sanctions committee.Owaisi further referred to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir’s speech on April 15, implying its alignment with extremist ideology. “Terrorism survives on two things, ideology and money,” he said, urging the international community to act on both fronts. “A form of polio exists only in two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan… there is 40% poverty in Pakistan, so where is the money going?”He noted that the four nations visited, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Algeria, were part of groups like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF), and had previously backed India’s diplomatic push to place Pakistan on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2018.During their stop in Algeria, Owaisi reiterated that “there is no ideological difference between the terrorist groups in Pakistan and Daesh and Al-Qaeda”. He stressed that Islam does not permit violence and said the international community must act against countries that provide ideological and financial shelter to terrorists.He also said that placing Pakistan back on the FATF grey list would significantly reduce terror attacks in India. “Once you bring Pakistan back in the grey list, we will see a decrease in terrorism in India… we have the 2018 experience when Algeria and other countries helped India,” he said.Referring to the case of 26/11 handler Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Owaisi added, “The trial progressed immediately when Pakistan was put on the Grey list. That tells you how effective FATF can be.”The eight-member delegation, including MPs Nishikant Dubey, Phangnon Konyak, Rekha Sharma, Satnam Singh Sandhu, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and former foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, met leaders and think tanks in the four countries to highlight India’s stand on terrorism, particularly following the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor.According to news agency PTI, the delegation also presented its feedback to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday.Jaishankar reportedly congratulated the delegation and said the objectives of the visit were fulfilled. “All four countries have taken clear steps against terrorism and understand India’s principled stand,” said Panda.",All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi launched a scathing attack on Pakistan on Wednesday.

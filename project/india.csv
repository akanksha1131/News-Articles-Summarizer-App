"Green cover in India absorbed more carbon than it emitted annually, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/green-cover-in-india-absorbed-more-carbon-than-it-emitted-annually-says-study/articleshow/118316185.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, use for representational purposes only.

MUMBAI: The green cover in India has absorbed more carbon than it emitted annually in the last decade, but the rate of sequestration declines during extreme climate events such as drought, a study has revealed. The study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal, also stressed the critical role of vegetation in climate change mitigation and adaptation.Green vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and releases it back into the air through respiration.""The overall balance between this uptake and release of CO2 is known as the net ecosystem exchange (NEE). When the NEE is positive, it means vegetation is releasing more carbon than it absorbs, and when it's negative, it indicates that the vegetation is effectively storing carbon,"" said Dhanyalekshmi Pillai, associate professor, head of the Max Planck Partner Group Germany, and of the Earth and Environmental Sciences, IISER Bhopal.""For the last decade, India's (green) ecosystem absorbed more carbon than they emitted annually, with annual NEE estimates ranging from 380 to 530 million tonnes of carbon per year,"" she said.Researcher and co-author of the paper, Aparnna Ravi, said this level of carbon sequestration is impressive but tends to decline in response to climate extremes, emphasising the critical role of vegetation in climate change mitigation and adaptation.Scientists also studied how different types of vegetation across India help absorb CO2 each year.Pillai said evergreen forests in India are highly efficient in capturing CO2 through photosynthesis. However, the deciduous forests in central India released more carbon into the atmosphere as plant respiration surpassed primary productivity.""They (green vegetation) released 210 million tonnes of carbon annually, acting as carbon sources. Although croplands are less effective at absorbing carbon per unit area than forests, their extensive coverage across the country benefits significant CO2 removal from the atmosphere,"" she said.Pillai said the sequestration rate is not constant but shows a decreasing trend, especially in response to drought.She said drought is an example of climate extremes, and these conditions are increasing due to climate change.""Green vegetation is favouring us (reducing global warming), but the sequestration potential cannot be limitless...under climate extremes, it shows decreasing sequestration. This is concerning,"" Pillai said.She said the study reflects on creating and implementing effective climate policies and ecosystem management in consonance with nationally prioritised action plans.IISER scientists, in collaboration with international experts, led and established an innovative technology-driven approach using highly resolved observations of plants' fluorescence (""glow"") and advanced physics-based computer models to quantify vegetation's carbon sequestration potential across India for the first time.In this novel approach, IISER-Bhopal researchers led long-term analyses across India by tracking several thousands of observational records of the last 10 years (2012-22), together with research experts from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (Germany), University of Exeter (United Kingdom) and National Remote Sensing Centre (India).Pillai said this newly demonstrated system also benefits from the recently available radiance observations from multiple satellite instruments, including the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-2 satellite.She said the method is more sensitive to detecting changes in ecosystem responses widely across the country than the commonly employed global methods that lack sufficient in-situ carbon measurements.""By integrating interdisciplinary national and international expertise, IISER-B research focuses on uncovering the complex ecosystem processes that govern carbon sequestration and their resilience to climate extremes,"" Pillai said.","Green vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and releases it back into the air through respiration.

Delhi Earthquake News: Why did the 4.0-magnitude earthquake in Delhi-NCR feel so strong?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-did-the-4-0-magnitude-earthquake-in-delhi-ncr-feel-so-strong/articleshow/118315557.cms,"Why did the tremors feel so strong?



Epicentre within Delhi: Since the earthquake originated beneath the city, seismic waves had less distance to travel, making the tremors feel more intense.

Shallow depth: Earthquakes that occur closer to the Earth's surface generate stronger shaking compared to deeper quakes of similar magnitude.

Urban infrastructure: High-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad sway more due to their height, amplifying the sensation of shaking.

Soil composition: Soft alluvial soil in some areas of Delhi can amplify seismic waves, further intensifying the tremors.

Why did the earthquake occur?

How earthquake intensity changes with magnitude

NEW DELHI: Residents of Delhi-NCR and several parts of northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings , prompting many to rush outdoors. The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:36 AM IST with its epicentre located within Delhi's Dhaula Kuan, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Though a 4.0-magnitude quake is considered moderate, its impact felt stronger than usual because of its shallow depth and close proximity to densely populated areas. Earthquakes with epicentres within a city result in more intense shaking since seismic waves travel a shorter distance before reaching structures, amplifying the tremors.Delhi, which falls in Seismic Zone IV , is prone to moderate-to-strong earthquakes, making localised tremors more pronounced as the. Experts noted that buildings, particularly high-rises, sway more due to their design, increasing the perceived intensity of shaking.Authorities have reported no major damage or casualties, but the sudden tremors sparked concern among residents. Seismologists continue to monitor aftershocks and have advised citizens to stay informed about earthquake preparedness measures.See how close were you from the epicenter: Dhaula Kuan Delhi sits near active fault lines, including the Delhi-Hardwar Ridge and the Mahendragarh-Dehradun fault, making it prone to moderate seismic activity. The tremors were caused by tectonic plate movement along one of these fault lines, where stress builds up over time and is eventually released as an earthquake.The intensity of an earthquake is measured on the logarithmic Richter scale, where each whole-number increase represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of seismic waves and about 32 times more energy release. This means that even small changes in magnitude can have a dramatic impact.For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 produces 10 times stronger shaking and releases 32 times more energy than a 3.0. Similarly, a 5.0-magnitude earthquake shakes 10 times more than a 4.0 and releases 32 times more energy. By the time an earthquake reaches magnitude 6.0, the shaking is 1,000 times stronger than a 3.0, and the energy released is 32,000 times greater. This exponential increase is why a seemingly small rise in magnitude can lead to severe destruction, especially in urban areas.","Residents of Delhi-NCR and northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings.

Eathquake in Delhi - 'Everything was shaking'

NEW DELHI: North India woke up to strong tremors early Monday morning with 4.0 magnitude first hitting Delhi-NCR at around 5.30 am and then in Bihar at 8 am.The strong tremors caused residents of high-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad to rush out of their homes.The tremor in Delhi occurred at 5.36 am, with its epicentre located near Durgabai Deshmukh College of Special Education in Dhaula Kuan at a depth of five kilometres, officials confirmed. There were no immediate reports of any damage or injuries.The area experiences minor seismic activity every two to three years, with a previous 3.3 magnitude earthquake recorded in 2015. Officials noted that a loud sound accompanied the tremor.Meanwhile, a 4.0 magnitude earthquake also hit Bihar's Siwan district at 8.02 am, the National Center for Seismology informed.Reacting to the strong tremors that hit New Delhi and neighbouring areas, PM Modi urged citizens to ""stay calm and follow safety precautions.""""Tremors were felt in Delhi and nearby areas.

New Delhi station stampede: No steps taken despite early signs of trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-delhi-station-stampede-no-steps-taken-despite-early-signs-of-trouble/articleshow/118314279.cms,"New Delhi Railway Station stampede (AP)

Stranded passengers rely on each other for help in chaos

NEW DELHI: A day after the devastating stampede at New Delhi Railway Station, there were many questions but few answers. While the lack of measures that could have prevented such a situation was apparent, passengers also flagged a range of lapses ranging from absence of proper communication from railway staff to non-availability of trained medical help.There were early signs of trouble. Around 8.15pm, two hours prior to the stampede, several X users began posting about the growing crowd near the platforms. Yet, no measures were taken to manage the situation, it has been alleged.Despite clear warning signs, the congestion only worsened. One user posted, ""Shiv Ganga Express-12560. New Delhi - Overcrowded Platform No. 12 (last-minute change from 14). Despite having a ticket, we can't enter the coach. The first-class TTE has locked the door, but no one is managing the other AC coaches.""Many passengers claimed that they were caught off guard by the last-minute platform change which contributed to the chaos.Railway officials were quick to refute allegations that there was a last-minute change in platform. ""The matter is being investigated by a high-level committee. No train was cancelled, nor was there any change in platform... Let the committee submit its report and findings,"" said a senior railway officer.The sale of around 1,500 general class tickets every hour in such a situation also raised serious questions about accountability. Many passengers claimed that the influx should have been halted in time.The lack of clear announcements regarding train arrivals was another major concern raised by passengers, with many believing it contributed significantly to the stampede -particularly in the case of the special train. Passengers at the station claimed that the announcements were unclear due to background noise.There was little to no visible medical assistance available on the platforms. Stranded passengers were left to fend for themselves, relying on each other for help in the chaos.Several families that TOI spoke to said that doctors or trained responders could have made a real difference. ""Even on normal days, when the station is crowded, there's no one to assist those in need. Getting a wheelchair for the elderly or disabled is always a struggle. Sometimes, porters are paid extra to carry elderly passengers on the trolley,"" said a vendor who didn't wish to be named.Eyewitness Sharda Devi, a resident of Bijwasan, said there was a frantic rush at platforms 13-14. Seeing the chaos, she, along with her daughter and relative, attempted to move away, but security officials stopped them and others from proceeding further near the staircase. This created a bottleneck, forcing passengers at the back to push forward, triggering a ripple effect that led to the crush.At the station, the staircase and escalator are both extremely busy areas, but these aren't the only entry and exit points. There are other bridges and access routes, yet people weren't directed to use them. ""If the authorities had spread the crowd more effectively, the situation could have been much better controlled. Instead, the platforms, bridges and stairs were all packed with people, making it nearly impossible to move,"" said a passenger who had a narrow escape in the tragedy.Passengers also noted that there were inadequate crowd-control measures in place despite the massive overcrowding.","A day after the devastating stampede at New Delhi Railway Station, there were many questions but few answers.

'Baseless and malicious': Ex-CEC clarifies after Elon Musk-led DOGE cancels 'voter turnout' funding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baseless-and-malicious-ex-cec-clarifies-after-elon-musk-led-doge-cancels-voter-turnout-funding/articleshow/118307188.cms,"Elon Musk

NEW DELHI: Former chief election commissioner (CEC) SY Quraishi dismissed claims that a US agency funded efforts to raise voter turnout in India, calling the reports ""baseless"" and ""malicious."" His response follows an announcement by the US department of government efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk , which claimed to have cancelled $21 million in funding for voter participation initiatives in India.Quraishi clarified that during his tenure as CEC in 2012, the Election Commission of India (ECI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). However, he said that this agreement did not involve any financial commitments. ""The report in a section of media about an MoU by ECI in 2012, when I was CEC, for funding of certain million dollars by a US agency for raising voter turnout in India does not have an iota of fact,"" Quraishi wrote on X.He further explained that the MoU was similar to agreements signed with several other international election management bodies to facilitate training at the ECI's Indian Institute of Electoral Democracy and Electoral Management (IIIDEM). ""There was no financing or even promise of finance involved in the MoU, forget X or Y amount.

A US military aircraft landed at Amritsar airport on Saturday night, carrying 116 Indian migrants who had been deported from the United States. Among them was Daljit Singh, who had left his village in Punjab last year with hopes of a better future. Instead, he returned in shackles, his hands cuffed and legs chained throughout the journey.""Our legs were chained and hands were also cuffed throughout the journey. There were three women and three children on board who were not cuffed,"" Daljit told news agency PTI upon arrival. His experience reflects the harsh reality of illegal migration , where many fall prey to fraudulent travel agents and endure gruelling journeys, only to be deported back home.Among the deportees, over 60 were from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.Daljit recounted how he was lured by a travel agent in 2022, who promised to take him to the US legally in exchange for Rs 65 lakh. To secure the deal, he handed over an advance agreement for an acre of his land. His journey began in November 2022, when he was first sent to Dubai. After spending nearly 18 months there, he returned to India, only to be sent to South Africa for four-and-a-half months.From there, he was taken to Brazil on August 26 last year and embarked on a treacherous route through multiple countries. The journey involved walking through dense forests, crossing rivers, and surviving on minimal food. Eventually, he reached Mexico, where he was forced to stay for a month while his travel agent coerced his wife into signing over his land. Finally, he crossed into the US on January 27, only to be caught and detained by US Border Patrol. ""I was given only a bottle of water, a packet of chips, and an apple daily,"" he told PTI.Sourav, a 20-year-old from Punjab's Ferozepur district, also shared his harrowing experience. His family spent Rs 45-46 lakh to send him to the US, selling farmland and borrowing money from relatives. ""We were kept in a camp (detention centre) for 18 days,"" he said. ""A day before our deportation, we were told that we would be shifted to another camp. When we boarded the plane, they said we were being taken to India.""Sourav had travelled through Amsterdam, Panama, and Mexico before attempting to cross the border on January 27. ""Our mobile phones were confiscated, and we had no contact with our families. Our hands and legs were tied. We cooperated with the US authorities, but no one heard our appeals.""Harjit Singh, from Gurdaspur district, was deported alongside his cousin. His family spent Rs 90 lakh in hopes of securing a future in the US. ""We were assured that we would be taken legally, but we were not,"" he told PTI. Harjit was caught while crossing the border on January 27 and detained for 18 days before being deported on February 13.Sahil Preet Singh’s parents, from Kapurthala district, spent Rs 40-45 lakh, selling their farmland and gold to fund his journey. His mother, Harvinder Kaur, accused a travel agent of duping them. ""We demand that the Punjab government give our son a job and take legal action against the agent who deceived us.""Jaswinder Singh, from Dharamkot village in Moga, left for the US 45 days ago.

Established during the Trump administration, DOGE was tasked with eliminating “wasteful” government spending. However it has drawn scrutiny over its broad powers and Musk’s influence.During his recent visit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's discussion with Musk focused on enhancing collaboration between Indian and American entities across various sectors including innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development.The dialogue between PM Modi and Elon Musk , who was joined by three of his children, also encompassed expanding cooperation in emerging technologies, entrepreneurship, and good governance.Trump recently criticised USAID (US Agency for International Development), alleging widespread mismanagement of funds.

The party secured a commanding 48 seats out of 70, sweeping the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) aside and ending its decade-long rule in the capital.BJP Legislature Party meeting scheduled for tomorrow, February 17, was postponed. Now this meeting will be held on February 19. The swearing-in ceremony of the chief minister will also be held on 20th February instead of 18th February, ANI reported quoting sources.BJP's return to power in Delhi after 27 years has raised anticipation over the leadership choice. While several names have been floated, sources suggest the party is likely to select a leader from among the winning MLAs to avoid the necessity of byelections.Parvesh Verma has emerged as a strong contender following his victory over Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi constituency. The son of former chief minister Saheb Singh Verma, Parvesh has twice won the West Delhi Lok Sabha seat and is seen as a strong representative of the Jat community, which played a crucial role in the BJP's electoral success.Also read: Delhi CM likely to be an MLA; Parvesh Verma, Vijender Gupta in race Vijender Gupta, the leader of the BJP in the outgoing Assembly, is also being considered. Gupta secured his third consecutive victory from Rohini and is seen as an experienced leader capable of leading the state government. Additionally, former Delhi BJP chiefs Satish Upadhyay and Virendra Sachdeva have been named as potential choices.The BJP has a history of making unexpected choices for key leadership roles, often selecting lesser-known figures to introduce fresh perspectives. This has fuelled speculation that the party might opt for an unconventional pick. Some reports suggest the possibility of appointing two deputy chief ministers, a strategy previously used in states like uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh to ensure broad community representation.Another name gaining traction is Bansuri Swaraj, the daughter of the late Sushma Swaraj. A prominent lawyer, she has been actively involved in BJP's campaign efforts and secured a victory in the New Delhi constituency during the Lok Sabha elections.Harish Khurana, son of former chief minister Madan Lal Khurana, is also in the running after securing a decisive win against AAP's Shiv Charan Goel. Like Parvesh Verma, he carries strong political lineage and has been a dedicated party worker for years.The recent election results marked a major setback for AAP, which had ruled Delhi for a decade. The BJP secured a two-thirds majority, winning 48 out of 70 seats, while AAP managed to win only 22.

DEHRADUN: Over 45% of Himachal Pradesh's area is highly prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and avalanches, according to a study by researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar. The team recently completed a hazard susceptibility mapping of the state as part of a broader effort by researchers and scientists from multiple IITs to assess multi-hazard vulnerability across the Himalayan states. The goal is to identify regions at high risk from multiple natural hazards simultaneously and aid in targeted disaster risk reduction strategies .The IIT Ropar team presented its findings at the 2nd Indian Cryosphere Meet (ICM), held at IIT Bombay on Feb 14-15, which was attended by nearly 80 glaciologists, researchers, and scientists from around the world.The study, conducted by MTech scholar Daishisha Iawphniaw under the guidance of Reet Kamal Tiwari, an associate professor at IIT Ropar, used geospatial data to evaluate the state's vulnerability. Tiwari told TOI, ""The study found that areas with mean slopes between 5.9 degrees and 16.4 degrees and elevations up to 1,600 metres are particularly prone to both landslides and floods. Meanwhile, higher-altitude regions with slopes between 16.8 degrees and 41.5 degrees are more likely to experience both avalanches and landslides."" He added that steep mountain slopes and elevations above 3,000 metres are at the ""highest risk"". Using GIS-based mapping, the study classified hazard-prone regions, showing that flood and landslide-prone zones are typically located in lower-elevation river valleys, while high-altitude mountains face a greater threat of avalanches.The study also highlighted how one hazard can trigger another due to shared underlying causes and stressed that having this knowledge is crucial for improving disaster planning and risk management.Tiwari said studies to assess multi-hazard vulnerability are being conducted in Uttarakhand, J&K, and northeast states. ""For Uttarakhand, we are collaborating with IIT Roorkee to conduct the study,"" he said.","Over 45% of Himachal Pradesh's area is highly prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and avalanches.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis defended the state government’s decision to form a committee to examine legal options against "" love jihad "". He said that while interfaith marriages are not wrong, deceitful conversions through false identities must be addressed.“The Supreme Court has also acknowledged the reality of love jihad in its decision. Even in Maharashtra, we are seeing an increase in such cases. It is not wrong for a person of one religion to marry a person of another religion. But marrying someone by lying and showing false identity is wrong. These incidents are very serious, and action must be taken,” Fadnavis said, as reported by news agency ANI.The Maharashtra government has established a seven-member panel to explore legal provisions on forced conversions . Led by the state’s Director General of Police (DGP), the committee includes senior officials from departments such as law and judiciary, women and child development, minority affairs, social justice, special assistance, and home affairs. The panel will study similar laws in other states and recommend measures to tackle reported cases.BJP leaders, including Union minister Ramdas Athawale, have welcomed the move, calling for stricter laws to prevent religious conversions through coercion. “There should be a law against love jihad. The conversion of women is not right. Two youngsters of different religions coming together is normal, but girls shouldn’t be forcefully converted,” Athawale said.Maharashtra minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha also expressed support, claiming that the number of such cases has risen, particularly in Mumbai. He said that when he raised the issue in the Vidhan Sabha, Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh opposed it and even filed a court case against him. “Does he want to encourage love jihad?” Lodha questioned. He added that many cases go unreported and thanked Fadnavis for setting up the committee.The government resolution (GR) setting up the committee specifically mentioned 'love jihad' and outlined the panel’s responsibilities, which include examining other states' laws, handling complaints, and developing legal frameworks, TOI had earlier reported. The document noted that the decision was based on requests from public representatives, organisations, and citizens seeking action against forced conversions.Fadnavis had previously indicated plans for such a law when he was deputy chief minister in 2023. He had stated that growing concerns over religious conversions through marriage had prompted demands for legal measures.“Many cases have come up of girls getting married and converting. There is demand from all corners to make a law against this. Earlier, I had made an announcement in the House also. Accordingly, study of laws in various states is on and then the decision about it in Maharashtra will be taken,” he had said at the time.","Devendra Fadnavis: Interfaith marriages are not wrong, deceitful conversions through false identities must be addressed.

Poll How Do You Feel About the Changes in the US Visa Renewal Process? It Could Make the Process More Organized in the Long Run It Makes the Process More Difficult for Applicants

NEW DELHI: Renewing the same class of US visa could now mean a long wait for many applicants in India. Uncle Sam has returned to its pre-Covid policy of allowing travellers to renew their visa without appearing at the embassy/consulate for an interview if their previous same-class visa is still valid or expired within the last 12 months.In Nov 2022, when the wait time for B1/B2 (business and tourism visa ) interview had crossed 999 days (touching almost three years) in India, the US increased the eligibility for same class drop box visa renewal — which does not require interview — from 12 months to 48 months. Since then the waiting period for B1/B2 interview has less than halved, it is currently over 440 days in Delhi & Mumbai; 436 in Chennai; 429 in Hyderabad and 415 in Kolkata.With such a long waiting, the reduction of drop box eligibility for renewal will mean more people again seeking appointments for same class visa renewal and further prolonging the queue. Asked in this backdrop if it planned to take any step in India to reduce the waiting, the US embassy said it had “anything additional”.Anil Kalsi, Travel Agents Federation of India VP, said: “This makes travel difficult for people who were banking on renewal. Since it’s announced and is already in effect, a lot of people have been caught unawares. There are anyway no interview dates available (in India) without a long waiting period. Some time should have been provided before the change took effect.”Repeat travellers to the US may, under some circumstances, renew their visas without appearing at the embassy or consulate for an interview. The visa waiver checklist for applicants, except those 14 years of age and 80 & above includes: “(is) a citizen of India/Bhutan or a lawful resident of India/Bhutan.(Has) a previous U.S. visa in the same class as the visa for which wish to apply and (the) prior visa in the same visa class is still valid or expired within the last 12 months. Most recent visa was issued on or after my 14th birthday,” according to a US Govt website.While India-US travel is reaching new highs post Covid, the travel industry says it remains way below potential due to two factors — long visa interview wait times and few direct flights due to US airlines not using Russian airspace. A record number of Indians travelled to the US last calendar year, more than CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh which had overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh. India has now emerged as the second largest overseas source market of international visitors to the US, after the UK.",Uncle Sam has returned to its pre-Covid policy of allowing travellers to renew their visa without appearing at the embassy/consulate for an interview.

VARANASI: As lakhs of pilgrims from Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj continued to reach Varanasi, district authorities extended restrictions while CM Yogi Adityanath conducted an aerial survey of the congested city roads Saturday afternoon to assess the situation.Ganga aarti at the ghats were suspended until Feb 26. Classes up to 8 remained suspended. Schools will be online only. Traffic restrictions and diversions were strictly enforced to manage the swelling crowd.The influx of pilgrims has led to record-breaking numbers at Kashi Vishwanath temple , which saw more than 8 lakh devotees Thursday alone. The trend continued through Friday and Saturday, keeping the temple premises heavily crowded.After his helicopter sortie, chief minister Yogi adjusted his schedule, forgoing his planned visit to Kaal Bhairav temple and instead reaching Kashi Vishwanath temple.

From there, he returned to Namo Ghat by cruise to inaugurate the Kashi Tamil Sangamam event.With the pilgrimage season in full swing, officials monitored the situation closely to ensure safety and crowd management across the city.

AMRITSAR: An American aircraft carrying 116 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US was delayed and arrived at Amritsar's international airport a little past 11.30pm Saturday, the second such flight after a US military C-17 plane had brought back 104 deportees to the same airport on February 5.At a press conference earlier Saturday, Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Singh Mann had once again expressed anger over the flight landing in the holy city amid allegations of attempts by the Centre to ""tarnish the image of Punjab and Punjabis"". A third US flight carrying Indian deportees is expected to also land on Sunday, PTI reported, quoting official sources.When it was pointed out that the Centre had probably chosen Amritsar as the landing point for deportation flight as it was nearer to the US than other Indian airports, Mann shot back: ""If Amritsar is so close, then it would make sense to start flights from here to the US and Canada as we have been demanding.""Sixty-five of Saturday's deportees are from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, 8 from Gujarat, two each from UP, Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, and one each from HP and J&K , PTI quoted official sources as saying, adding that 119 had been expected but an updated passenger manifest had been provided later.BJP national spokesperson RP Singh had said in a post on X on Saturday, in which Mann was tagged, ""Amritsar is the closest international airport for flights entering India from the US"" and that was why the US plane was landing there"".Mann also questioned the appropriateness of allowing a US military plane to land in a city close to the border, saying, ""Other countries are sending their civilian planes to bring back their deportees, so why are we allowing a US military plane to land here?"" He also asked whether Vatican City would allow a US military plane to land in its territory. [Vatican City has a heliport for VIPs; other visitors use Rome's airports.]Punjab's govt has arranged temporary accommodation for deportees from outside the state, who will leave for Delhi on a 6.30am flight on Sunday. Those from Punjab will be transported to their native places by road.Family members of some deportees who came to the airport expressed dissatisfaction with the Punjab govt's rehabilitation efforts.The relatives of Harjit Singh (22) and Harjot Singh (20), were deeply depressed. They had spent 45 lakh on each of the cousins to send them to the US. Their uncle, Nishan Singh, said the two young men from Khanowal, in Gurdaspur, had reached the US just 10 days ago but were caught and deported. He added that a US-based travel agent had assured them of legal entry into US.CM Mann, Union junior minister for railways Ravneet Singh Bittu and Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjeet Singh Aujla had visited the airport for some time earlier in the day.Mann, asked at Saturday's press conference whether Indian deportees would be in restraints, said state govt did not have any information about this, and that PM Modi should have raised the issue with Donald Trump when he met him.",65 of 116 deportees in 2nd flight are from Punjab.

Army & IAF intensify hunt for advanced anti-drone systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-iaf-intensify-hunt-for-advanced-anti-drone-systems/articleshow/118290751.cms,"-Picture-

NEW DELHI: With the threat from hostile drones and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in both conventional and irregular warfare continuing to expand exponentially, the armed forces are stepping-up induction of a wide array of anti-drone systems but underline the urgent need for more advanced ones.The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (IDD&IS) to add to the ones already inducted under emergency procurements for the frontier with China.The IAF, in turn, wants 10 new kamikaze drones-based anti-swarm drone systems, 10 mobile micro munitions-based anti-swarm drone systems and 100-200 vehicle-mounted counter-UAS .Among other systems, IAF will begin inducting 200 radio frequency jammer guns from next month under a contract inked a year ago, while Army is getting around 30 vehicle-based drone jammers .“But much more advanced anti-drone systems, with multiple `soft-kill’ and `hard-kill’ options as well as much longer interception ranges, are urgently needed,” a senior officer said. These systems range from jamming, spoofing and blinding systems that disrupt the satellite or video command-and-control links of drones to laser-based directed energy weapons (DEWs) for hard-kills.A major problem, however, is that India is way behind other countries in indigenously developing such complex technologies. After DRDO developed anti-drone systems with 2-kilowatt to 10-kilowatt lasers, the armed forces ordered 23 such systems for around Rs 400 crore.“DRDO is developing DEWs with higher power. Many domestic private firms are also tying up with foreign companies for advanced anti-drone solutions. Let’s hope they work out,” another officer said.The Modi-Trump summit, incidentally, welcomed the new partnership between US company Anduril Industries and Indian Mahindra Group on advanced autonomous technologies to co-produce an “advanced AI-enabled counter-UAS”.The Army still relies heavily on old air defence systems, many of which have outlived their operational lives. “Though emergency procurements of anti-drone systems have been undertaken in recent years, they remain inadequate in countering the rapidly evolving threat from drones, which has been repeatedly reinforced by the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts,” he added.There is, for instance, the need to develop more advanced versions of the existing vehicle-mounted IDD&IS inducted by the Army Air Defence, which at present can soft-kill drones by jamming at 2 to 5-km range, with the effective hard-kill range through lasers only around 800-metre. “There is a mounting threat from low radar cross-section UAS and swarm drones,” an officer said.IAF air defence systems, with advanced radars and ground-to-air missile systems, are also geared towards thwarting air intrusions by large UAS, aircraft and helicopters. “The lack of adequate effective multi-sensor, multi-kill systems against smaller drones is an operational gap,” an officer said.A concerted effort is required to reduce the R&D time, fast-track procurement processes and ensure rapid induction of advanced counter-drone technologies. “The domestic defence industry should accelerate the production of advanced and scalable anti-drone systems to protect critical assets, particularly during wartime and heightened tensions,” he added.","The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems.

GUWAHATI/NEW DELHI: The row over alleged Pakistani links of Gaurav Gogoi 's wife escalated on Sunday with the Congress MP saying he would initiate legal proceedings in the matter and Assam govt asking state police to register a case against Ali Tauqeer Sheikh , an advisor of the Pakistan Planning Commission , for his alleged attempts to interfere in domestic matters of the state.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier said a police case was likely to be registered to probe the allegations of Pakistani links of Gogoi's wife Elizabeth Colburn, who is a British national, but the cabinet on Sunday refrained from ordering a case against her.Apart from his engagement with the Pakistani govt, Sheikh also founded Lead Pakistan, a non-profit organisation working on climate change, Sarma said, claiming that Elizabeth was an integral part of Lead Pakistan during her time in Islamabad. tnnIn recent days, multiple news reports, social media posts, and other information in the public domain have surfaced regarding certain comments made by Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh aimed at disrupting communal harmony in Assam,"" Himanta Biswa Sarma told the media.He added that a perusal of his social media activity included exhaustive commentary on India's internal affairs and parliamentary matters, raising serious concerns about Sheikh's intention to compromise and damage India's interests.Responding to BJP's allegations, Congress's Jairam Ramesh said, "" Assam CM and BJP have begun an atrocious smear campaign targeting my colleague Gaurav Gogoi. This is character assassination of the worst type. Legal action is being initiated right away.""Ramesh alleged that the smear campaign was because Gogoi won the Jorhat Lok Sabha seat in 2024 in spite of the Assam chief minister and other ministers camping in Jorhat and campaigning against him. ""It is also because the Jorhat MP has been in the forefront, revealing the blatant corruption and black deeds of the Assam CM,"" he added.Sarma has been targeting Gogoi over the past few days and alleged that the former had ISI links. He has accused Gogoi of ""leading young individuals to the Pakistan embassy for brainwashing and radicalisation"", and also questioned his wife's refusal to take Indian citizenship for the past 12 years.He also alleged that Gogoi had raised questions in Parliament on sensitive defence matters after his marriage with the British citizen, a charge termed by the opposition leader as ""false accusation"".",Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier said a police case was likely to be registered to probe the allegations of Pakistani links of Gaurav Gogoi's wife Elizabeth Colburn.

Goa's job scarcity and allure of the American dream spur desperate youths to trudge and trek via South America's donkey route. Once they cross Mexico-US border , they are smuggled to small towns where they then hope to find work as petrol pump operators, gardeners or delivery agents after paying lakhs to unscrupulous agents.For two young Goans who had left for the US only last month, this dream came crashing as they sat shackled and handcuffed on a US C-17 military transport aircraft on Saturday during their disconsolate journey back to where they started: home.Sarzora lad AC Mascarenhas, in his twenties, found his hopes crushed even before he could make it to US soil. His dangerous trek through several countries and his audacious plan of being smuggled by human traffickers in pursuit of the American dream ended at the US border. For company, he had a compatriot from Shiroda, G Souza. The two returned home quietly on Sunday, accompanied by Goa cops. This was the first instance of Goans being sent back in handcuffs with their legs chained during the flight.""It's unfortunate that Goan youths were part of the group deported. They can't get jobs here, which is why they go to find jobs abroad.

BATHINDA: He tried his hands at a dairy farm but lumpy skin cattle disease put a spanner in his plans. He then got into horse trading but that didn't run, either. Then 32-year-old Gurpreet Singh Bhangu tried to sneak into the US, only for his fortunes to take a turn for the worse.A resident of Baggeana village in Faridkot, Gurpreet was among 116 illegal immigrants deported by the US on Saturday. The family is so shattered that they declined to speak to anyone for the time being. Village residents, too, are at pains to describe the ordeal of Gurpreet, also known as Prince Bhangu. He reached home in the wee hours of Sunday but stayed put inside home.Baggeana former panchayat member Mangal Kumar recalled Gurpreet's failed dairy venture, saying lumpy skin disease killed many of his cattle and led him to shut down the business. The chain of failure extended to horses.Having decided there was no way to make a living at home, Gurpreet tried to settle in foreign shores and reached Italy. The family had earlier told TOI that during his stay in Italy, Gurpreet met a travel agent who promised him entry into the US.Gurpreet arranged Rs 25 lakh & reached US through donkey route. But once there, he was caught and put in a detention centre, from where he was finally deported.

JALANDHAR: Kamalpreet Kaur had once dreamed of a better life. But she and her husband Daljit Singh now stand empty-handed - neither the dreams of America nor the 4.5-acre farmland they once tilled remains theirs. Daljit Singh was among the 116 Indians deported from US for entering and staying in the country illegally. He arrived in Amritsar on Saturday night in shackles. Yet, even heavier than the chains that bound him was the loss he carried in his heart.Daljit had not flown to America but had been sent there through the perilous ""donkey route"" more than two-and-a-half years ago. Stuck in Mexico, he made a desperate call home. ""Give them the power of attorney,"" he had told Kamalpreet. ""Otherwise, they won't let me leave.""A demand wrapped in a threat, leaving them no choice but to surrender their 4.5 acres in Kurala Kalan village in Punjab's Hoshiarpur district to the local travel agent who had promised Daljit a future abroad. The land, worth nearly Rs 1 crore, had slipped from their hands. ""State govt should help us get our land back,"" Kamalpreet pleaded on Sunday.Daljit's village was also home to Urmur MLA Jasvir Singh Gill. ""Our top priority is to restore the land to Daljit's family,"" he said. ""The agent from Chollaang village took advantage of their helplessness, transferring the land while Daljit was struggling in Mexico."" The family's land - their only inheritance - was swallowed by deception and desperation. ""That land was their livelihood, their past and future,"" said Jarnail Singh, the village sarpanch's husband.","Daljit Singh was among the 116 Indians deported from US for entering and staying in the country illegally.

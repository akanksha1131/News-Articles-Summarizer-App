NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming annual UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, representing 134 companies from 27 countries, including India, has urged world leaders to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon resilient economy.The CEO-led alliance, one of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) flagship decarbonisation initiatives, has issued an open letter calling on govts to deepen public-private collaboration to unlock the full potential of the climate economy at a time when the transition is under threat. It underlined the current trajectories that suggest that global warming could exceed 2 degrees Celsius by mid-century, with severe consequences on economies, societies and ecosystems.The Alliance companies have a combined emissions footprint of 5.2 gigatons, accounting for 14% of global emissions — equal to the annual emissions of the US, which second after China. The group represents $4 trillion in revenues and 12 million employees in 134 companies.Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance, launched alongside the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change.CEOs of big tech multi-national companies are also part of the group.The WEF noted that these companies reduced aggregate emissions by 12% while growing revenue by 20% from 2019 to 2023, proving that climate action is compatible with driving growth.Their open letter, released by the WEF this month, calls for 13 action areas to accelerate the transition and drive growth. It highlights the need for policymakers to provide more stable frameworks, shorten permitting processes, scale climate finance, support breakthrough technologies, phase out unabated fossil fuels and invest in nature and resilience.“Climate action is no longer just a moral imperative — it is a powerful driver of green growth, innovation and resilience,” said Sebastian Buckup, managing director, Centre for Nature and Climate, WEF. “We urge govts and business leaders to act decisively and accelerate proven solutions so we can unlock the full potential of the climate economy and secure a more prosperous, sustainable future for all. Our work at the forum aims to connect leaders for people, planet and sustainable progress,” the WEF quoted him as saying.The Alliance’s open letter highlights that the corporate leaders across the world have made significant investments in building low-carbon and climate resilient businesses in the recent years, proving that climate initiatives can drive long-term value for business and society.“However, this momentum now faces strong headwinds. The cost of the transition, combined with policy obstacles and uncertainties, fiscal pressures and geopolitical tensions, is slowing the transition. COP30 presents a pivotal moment for business and government to reignite progress towards a more resilient and environmentally sustainable economy,” say the CEOs in their joint open letter to govts.They suggest that the policy-makers can drive growth and create wealth by accelerating the transition by maintaining a stable and predictable policy environment; mitigating the financial risk of private investments and projects; doubling financing and incentives for breakthrough tech; transitioning away from unabated fossil fuels; removing transition obstacles such as lengthy permitting processes; and supporting investments and policies for nature.Their remaining suggestions in the list of 13 proposed actions include building climate-resilient economies and food systems; adopting science-based targets and reporting transparently on progress on emission reduction; working together across the value chain to drive low-emission end products and business models; leveraging efficiency solutions to reduce energy usage, costs and emissions; strengthen innovation and digital solutions; support creation of demand signals; and investment in climate adaptation and resilience.","Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance.

US President Donald Trump has once again claimed credit for averting a potential war between India and Pakistan, saying he used the threat of steep trade tariffs to stop the two nuclear-armed neighbours from ""going at it. ""Speaking to Fox News on Sunday (local time), Trump said his administration leveraged economic pressure to defuse tensions following India’s Operation Sindoor in May, when forces carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.""They were going at it — seven planes were shot down.

MNS, Sena UBT Hit Back

MUMBAI: Closing ranks ahead of the civic elections, the opposition bloc of Sena (UBT), Congress and NCP (SP) will hold a joint rally with Raj Thackeray-led MNS on Nov 1 against “arbitrary and corrupt administration of Election Commission”.The announcement was made Sunday, just after Raj accused EC of inserting 96 lakh fake voters in the electoral lists across Maharashtra for the benefit of those in office. “An attempt is being made to finish off regional parties... 8-10 lakh fake voters have been added in Mumbai and 8-8.5 lakh in Thane, Pune and Nashik each,” Raj said at a party meeting.This will be the first time Congress and MNS cadres will be marching together amid rumblings in the national party’s city unit over an alliance, even though the two parties have been part of the opposition’s meeting with EC on electoral lists. Left parties have also signalled their support for the initiative aimed at bringing the opposition together and keeping the ‘vote chori’ narrative alive ahead of the local body polls.“We will soon announce the time and route of the march in Mumbai... We are going to show the entire country how Maharashtra is fighting to protect democracy,” said Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut at a joint press conference at Shiv Sena (UBT) Bhavan.The meet was attended by NCP (SP) MLA Jayant Patil, Congress functionary Sachin Sawant, MNS functionaries Bala Nandgaonkar and Abhijit Panse, and CPI functionary Prakash Reddy.Raut said people from every district who had lost their right to vote would join the march. “We will show the strength of the voters to the PM, the Union home minister and EC. It is necessary to give a jolt to EC. We also want to tell EC and the rulers in Delhi that Maharashtra is not sitting idle while so much injustice is happening,” Raut said.Raj also asked EC how it would hold local body polls without cleaning up the electoral list. Addressing MNS booth-level agents, he urged them to verify the lists to weed out fake voters. “If polls have to be held peacefully, then clean the electoral list first,” he warned. Without naming BJP, he said the party in office wanted to contest elections by adding fake names to the voters’ list. “It does not matter whether you cast a vote or not. The match has been fixed. What kind of democracy is this?” Raj said.","The opposition bloc of Sena (UBT), Congress and NCP (SP) will hold a joint rally with Raj Thackeray-led MNS on Nov 1.

SC praises ED for restitution of flats to 213 homebuyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-praises-ed-for-restitution-of-flats-to-213-homebuyers/articleshow/124695237.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has praised the restitution of flats to at least 213 homebuyers who had waited for more than 12 years to get possession of properties they had paid for.The restituted properties are part of 354 flats, 17 commercial units and two plots in Royal Rajvilas project in Udaipur — together worth over Rs 175 crore — restored by Enforcement Directorate to victims of a ‘scam’ in which project promoters had allegedly swindled over Rs 1,267 crore of Syndicate Bank, now Canara Bank.SC lauded ED for helping the homebuyers. The agency had attached Royal Rajvilas after the project got entangled in multiple cases of fraud, cheating and money laundering. ED later approached Rajasthan HC, and subsequently, the apex court seeking to withdraw its attachment partially and restore the properties to the fraud victims.“We place on record our appreciation for the efforts made by the learned counsels for parties and ED in restoring the attached properties to secure the interests of genuine and innocent homebuyers,” an SC bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Alok Aradhe said.ED verified the details of 221 homebuyers and submitted ‘no objection’ in restitution of the properties to homebuyers, except in case of eight, which were marked as beneficiaries of “proceeds of crime”.The restitution will help the 213 homebuyers who had been in throes of anxiety because of protracted litigation of over seven years between the successful resolution applicant Udaipur Entertainment World Pvt Ltd and ED. SC has, however, clarified that it has passed the order on the peculiar facts of the case without going into the merits, and so it shall not be treated as a precedent and questions of law shall remain open to be decided in an appropriate case.","SC lauded ED for helping the homebuyers.

BENGALURU: The feud between Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar and two of Bengaluru’s most prominent corporate captains — Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai — escalated Sunday over the city’s crumbling infrastructure.Mazumdar-Shaw hit back at Shivakumar’s remarks that those criticising govt’s handling of Bengaluru’s civic issues had a “personal agenda” and had remained silent during previous administrations.“Not true. Both TV Mohandas Pai and I have criticised deteriorating infrastructure in our city to previous BJP and JD(S) govts. Our agenda is to clean up and restore roads,” she wrote on X, tagging the deputy CM’s statement.Pai amplified her remarks, reposting several comments slamming the poor state of roads and public infrastructure.Unfazed, Shivakumar said industrialists who built their fortunes in Bengaluru were now turning against the city. “They are forgetting their humble beginnings and how the city helped them grow. We should not forget our roots,” read a statement from his office after his ‘Walk with Bengaluru’ event.He listed ongoing infrastructure projects — tunnel roads, elevated corridors, double-decker flyovers, and buffer roads — costing more than Rs 1 lakh crore, claiming they aim for “integrated development” of the city.“We have formed five corporations to take governance closer to people,” he added.Later in the day, Mazumdar-Shaw softened her tone and responded positively to the Ejipura flyover project update. “This is a positive development which will greatly relieve traffic congestion and has been 10 years in the making, which previous BJP and JD(S) govts did not prioritise. Putting this on a priority track is a good move by DK Shivakumar,” she posted on X.The public spat underscored growing frustration among Bengaluru’s business bosses and citizens over chronic traffic snarls, delayed civic projects, and governance gridlock in India’s technology capital.For his part, Pai had said the city’s infrastructure was “lagging 10-15 years behind its growth”. He stressed that citizens had the right to demand better infrastructure and criticise govt, saying “ministers are representatives, not ‘maliks’ who should fear free speech — they must listen”",Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai clashed over the city's crumbling infrastructure.

Silver market crisis 2025: Panic in London! How the market broke – Is demand in India the cause?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-crisis-2025-panic-in-london-how-the-market-broke-is-india-to-blame/articleshow/124693366.cms,"Silver market crisis 2025:

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Is India leading the buying frenzy?

London in panic!





The perfect storm





Is India to blame?









The global silver market is facing its most severe crisis in decades, and for once, the epicenter of the turmoil isn’t just Wall Street or London— Is India to blame?As the country celebrated Diwali, millions of people flocked to buy silver, turning a seasonal ritual into a market-breaking frenzy. For Vipin Raina, head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, the scale of demand was unprecedented.Raina had been preparing for months for a surge in silver purchases by Indian customers ahead of Diwali, the festival honouring the goddess of wealth. But when it came, it blew everything away. His company, India’s largest precious metals refinery, ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.“Most people who are dealing silver and silver coins, they’re literally out of stock because silver is not there,” Raina, who is head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, told Bloomberg.“This kind of crazy market — where people are buying at these levels — I have not seen in my 27-year career,” Raina added.While India’s Diwali demand is usually gold-heavy, this year saw silver take the spotlight. Social media and market hype fueled the shift. According to the Bloomberg report, investment banker and content creator Sarthak Ahuja, with nearly 3 million followers, promoted silver as the “next big buy” after gold’s historic rally.“It’s never been like this before. The demand this time for silver has been humongous,” Amit Mittal, GM at M.D. Overseas Bullion told Bloomberg.Premiums for silver in India surged above $5 an ounce, far exceeding the usual few cents above international prices. Dealers in Mumbai reported bidding wars, with buyers prioritizing availability over cost.But the frenzy for silver wasn’t confined to India. Global investors and hedge funds joined the surge, betting on a weaker US dollar or simply following the unstoppable rally. By early October, JPMorgan Chase, a key supplier to the Indian market, warned clients that it had no silver to deliver for October, with the next availability only in November.The buying spree hit London, the global hub for silver trading. Traders described a market “all but broken” as banks struggled to quote prices amid repeated client calls and thin liquidity. Robin Kolvenbach, co-CEO of Argor-Heraeus, said, “There is more or less little to no liquidity actually available in terms of leases in London. We have basically stopped all silver intake that is not committed contractually.”The spike in silver prices reached $54 an ounce, before tumbling 6.7%, reflecting extreme stress across the market. Analysts compared it to historical crises, including the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market in 1980, underscoring the severity of the situation.The 2025 silver crisis was not triggered by a single factor but by a convergence of events that drained global inventories and pushed the market to the brink. India’s Diwali demand played a key role, as millions of buyers turned to silver instead of gold, creating unprecedented pressure on domestic and international supplies.Over the past five years, silver demand has consistently exceeded supply from mines and recycled sources, driven largely by a solar industry boom using silver in photovoltaic cells.Since 2021, demand has outstripped supply by 678 million ounces, while London’s total inventories stood at around 1.1 billion ounces at the start of 2021, according to the Silver Institute.Market stress intensified this year as traders rushed to front-run potential U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, moving over 200 million ounces of silver into New York warehouses.Adding to the pressure, more than 100 million ounces flowed into global silver ETFs through September, as heightened investor demand for precious metals fueled a rally that also propelled gold past $4,000 an ounce for the first time in history. This coincided with a surge in investment demand through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), part of the so-called “debasement trade,” as investors sought a hedge against a weakening US dollar.The combined effect of these forces left London’s free-floating silver reserves, metal not tied up in ETFs—dropping to less than 150 million ounces, far below the daily trading volume of roughly 250 million ounces.Even in ideal circumstances, moving silver from Comex to London can take four days, but delays at customs and complex supply chains left traders exposed to high costs when contracts couldn’t be fulfilled on time. Comex inventories fell by more than 20 million ounces in two weeks, the largest drop in 25 years, benefiting logistics firms but stressing the market further.According to the Bloomberg report, some traders hesitated due to the risk of new tariffs on critical minerals, while TD Securities analyst Daniel Ghali noted that the London market had been primed for a squeeze for over a year.After the frenzy peaked, silver prices plunged more than 5% following signs of improving US-China relations, with Ghali suggesting further pressure may ease as silver flows in from New York and China.“The logistics were a little more complex than we initially assumed,” Ghali said. “We certainly did not expect the scale of the retail-buying bonanza across the globe that ensued while the London market was getting squeezed.”At the same time, China, a key supplier of silver, was on a week-long holiday, reducing the flow of metal into global markets.In essence, a perfect storm had formed: festive demand, industrial growth, investment mania, and trade-related hoarding converged, creating a market under extreme stress and unprecedented volatility, reported Bloomberg.While India’s Diwali buying played a major role, the crisis also reflects structural supply-demand imbalances built over years. Since 2021, silver demand has outpaced supply by 678 million ounces, largely due to industrial demand and ETF accumulation.Yet, the timing and scale of India’s purchases acted as the catalyst, turning an already tight market into a full-blown global squeeze, the Bloomberg report said. Analysts like Satish Dondapati, fund manager at Kotak Asset Management, point to the FOMO factor. “Analysts, bullion dealers were all giving bullish calls on silver in Indian media in a way that has not happened in the last 14 years. The FOMO factor has worked,"" Dondapati stated.The silver market remains under stress as the world waits for sufficient deliveries to ease the crunch. While regulators like the London Bullion Market Association have not intervened, citing genuine supply shortages rather than logistics issues, the current situation underscores the fragility of global metals markets in a hyper-connected world.","India's largest precious metals refinery ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.

DURGAPUR/KOLKATA: Two accused in the Durgapur gang-rape case, Sk Riyazuddin and Sk Safiq, moved a plea before a local court on Sunday for permission to confess their role in the Oct 10 incident.Police officers involved in the probe said if the court accepts the plea, the two may be treated as approvers during the trial.The complainant, a 23-year-old MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur, was allegedly gangraped shortly after she had stepped out of the campus with a classmate on Oct 10 evening for dinner.Riyazuddin, Safiq and four other men, including the classmate, Wasef Ali, are in custody.The court on Sunday sent Riyazuddin and Safiq, who had been in police remand since their arrest, to jail custody for two days so they could think over their plea for confession. The court will pass an order on Oct 21.The appeal was filed under Section 183 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, which spells out the procedure for a judicial magistrate to record confessions related to an ongoing criminal investigation.Riyazuddin worked as a guard at the medical college where the survivor studied till he was sacked five years ago for indiscipline. Safiq worked at a local factory.In a detailed statement to police and a magistrate, the survivor said one man pinned her to the ground and raped her in a desolate forested spot, while two others watched. Two other men, who police later identified as Riyazuddin and Safiq, arrived at the spot later.But instead of helping her, they called the rapists to the spot and the five demanded Rs 3,000 from the student. They took Rs 200 that the survivor was carrying and also snatched her cellphone.The other three accused are Nasiruddin Sk, Apu Bauri and Firdaus Sk. The survivor has mentioned in the complaint that classmate Wasef Ali molested her and fled when she was struggling to fight off the attackers.The maximum punishment for gang rape is 20 years in jail and for extortion, seven years in jail.Partha Ghosh, the lawyer representing the survivor, said, “We have filed an appeal that a test identification parade be done quickly.”","Sk Riyazuddin and Sk Safiq moved a plea before a local court on Sunday for permission to confess their role in the Oct 10 incident.

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Upgrading strike capability: India tests 800-km BrahMos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upgrading-strike-capability-india-tests-800-km-brahmos/articleshow/124694864.cms,"‘Pinpoint Accuracy’ Rajnath Singh Praises BrahMos Precision During Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: In what will be a major boost for its precision strike capabilities, India plans to begin inducting the new 800-km extended range BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles in a little over two years, while over 200km Astra air-to-air missiles are also slated for production in 2026-27.Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, to ensure the conventional (non-nuclear) missile is fully ready by end-2027, top defence sources told TOI.The existing 450-km range BrahMos missiles, which fly at almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, were launched from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for the targeted strikes deep into Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in May. “The 800-km BrahMos is more or less developed in terms of the modifications to its ramjet engine. A few more tests are required to test the efficacy of its combination of internal INS (inertial navigation system) and external global navigation satellite systems to ensure high accuracy, resilience and resistance to jamming,” a source said.Navy, for instance, can then begin upgrading the existing 450-km BrahMos missiles on its frontline warships to the 800-km variant, with just some tweaking of the software, the ‘graphical user interface’ of the fire control system and the like.“With the basic missile and launcher remaining the same, Navy and Army will first begin inducting the 800-km missile. The air-launched version will take slightly longer,” the source said.Parallelly, DRDO is increasing the beyond visual range (BVR) of Astra Mark-2 missiles to over 200km from the earlier 160km, while IAF is inducting over 280 Astra Mark-1 missiles with 100km range.“Along with trajectory shaping, the propulsion system is being upgraded to generate more thrust and burn for a longer time. If the trials are successful, Astra Mark-2 production can begin in six months. Otherwise, it will take a longer,” another source said.IAF has already finalised the plan to induct an initial 700 Astra Mark-2 missiles for its Sukhoi-30MKI and Tejas jets. There is also an Astra Mark-3 on the way, with solid-fuel ducted ramjet (SFDR) propulsion to increase the range to 350kmm but it will take three years to become operational. The all-weather day and night capable Astra series of missiles are crucial because they will eventually replace the expensive Russian, French and Israeli BVR air-to-air missiles (BVRAAMs) that are imported to arm IAF fighters.During its strikes on the nine terror hubs on May 7, IAF was initially caught off-guard by Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 BVRAAMs with ranges over 200km, as was reported by TOI earlier.The BrahMos air-to-ground missiles launched from stand-off distances were, however, an unqualified success. The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.In March last year, for instance, defence ministry had inked the largest-ever Rs 19,519 crore deal for procurement of over 220 BrahMos missiles for Navy. Around 20 warships, including the latest destroyers and frigates, are already armed with the vertical-launched BrahMos missiles.After Sindoor, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council in Aug had also given the preliminary nod for IAF to get another 110 air-launched BrahMos missiles for around Rs 10,800 crore.The land variant of the 800-km BrahMos missiles will also eventually be part of the proposed Integrated Rocket Force (IRF), along with the Pralay ballistic missiles (400-km range) and long-range land-attack cruise missiles (derivatives of the original Nirbhay missiles with 1,000-km range), among others.","Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades.

PATNA: The INDIA bloc continues to grapple with mounting internal friction, which is beginning to derail its election campaign in Bihar as the filing of nomination papers for the second and final phase of closes on Monday. Some seats have witnessed INDIA bloc partners fielding candidates against each other and none of them withdrew their nominations even on Sunday. Meanwhile, the RJD and Congress have so far not stepped in to quell the dispute, sending a worrying signal to voters.In contrast, the NDA campaign is in full swing. Union minister Amit Shah has returned to Delhi after a three-day tour while union minister Dharmendra Pradhan is currently camping in Bihar. The chief ministers of Goa, Haryana and Tripura have addressed rallies in various parts of the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch his Bihar poll campaign from Samastipur on Oct 24.“The INDIA bloc leaders need to sit together and tell the people that ‘we are united’ and there is no conflict among us,” Congress MP from Katihar Tariq Anwar told TOI on Sunday, acknowledging the impact of the internal discord.“But we hope everything will be over by Monday, the last date for filing nominations for the second phase. There must not be any scope for a friendly fight,” he added.Despite the mounting tension, top INDIA bloc leaders have been largely absent from the campaign trail. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, perceived as the opposition’s CM face, remains in Patna, chalking out strategy at home, while there is no clarity on the campaign plans of Congress leaders such as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, party president Mallikarjun Kharge and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi.However, state RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan sought to downplay the concerns. “Tejashwi will embark on a poll campaign after Diwali. Every party in the INDIA bloc wants him to campaign for their candidates. Although Tejashwi has filed his nominations from the Raghopur seat, he is, in fact, contesting elections on all 243 seats of Bihar,” Gagan said.Meanwhile, denial of tickets has triggered dramatic protests across the state. Candidates have been seen rolling on the ground, tearing their kurtas, crying bitterly before the camera and threatening to teach lessons to official nominees. The chaos comes just a fortnight before the first phase of polling on Nov 6.In Patna, RJD leader Madan Shah, seeking a ticket from the Madhuban seat, broke down outside the 10,Circular Road residence of former CM Rabri Devi, tearing his kurta in despair. “Lalu ji promised a ticket from the Madhuban seat, but it was given to someone else. I will die… Can’t bear the pain,” he shouted.Another aspirant, Usha Devi, cried bitterly before the reporters outside Rabri’s residence. “I have been associated with the RJD for the past 20 years and have been the torchbearer of the party in the region, but the ticket went to someone else… This is heart-breaking, but I will still campaign for the RJD,” she said, describing RJD chief Lalu Prasad as a “father figure.”In Gopalganj, former RJD legislator Reyazul Haq Raju broke down during a live online session, expressing anguish over not receiving a party ticket while three-time Congress legislator from Kasba in Purnia district, Afaque Alam, accused party leaders of demanding money in exchange for tickets.“The state unit of Congress has now become hostage in the hands of ‘personal brokers of some leaders’. Ground-level workers who have been struggling for the party for years are being ignored for tickets while outsiders have a field day,” Alam alleged on Sunday.", INDIA bloc partners fielding candidates against each other.

Delhi air turns toxic again: GRAP Stage II curbs kick in; AQI crosses 300,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-air-turns-toxic-again-grap-stage-ii-curbs-kick-in-aqi-crosses-300/articleshow/124689532.cms,"Stop Ignoring The AQI Index: Long Exposure To Polluted Air Can Increase Your Risk Of Heart Attack

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Saturday invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR after air quality showed a sharp deterioration, crossing into the ‘very poor’ category. The decision follows an emergency review by the Sub-Committee on GRAP, which observed a steady rise in pollution levels through the day.According to the order, “The AQI of Delhi has shown an increasing trend since morning and has been recorded as 296 at 4.00pm and 302 at 7.00pm. The forecast by IMD/IITM also predicts further deterioration of AQI in the coming days.” The Sub-Committee, therefore, decided to implement all measures under Stage II of GRAP with immediate effect, in addition to those already active under Stage I.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index at 296 on Sunday afternoon—just below the ‘very poor’ threshold of 301. Of the 38 monitoring stations across the capital, 12 reported ‘very poor’ air quality, with Anand Vihar topping the chart at a severe 430. Other hotspots included Wazirpur (364), Vivek Vihar (351), Dwarka (335), and RK Puram (323).The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported maximum and minimum temperatures of 33.3°C and 20.6°C respectively, with humidity touching 91% by evening.Misty conditions are expected on Monday morning, though temperatures are likely to remain steady.Residents have begun expressing frustration over the annual spike in pollution. “Just like every year, pollution in Delhi persists… It causes difficulty in breathing, especially for cyclists like me,” said Aryan Gupta, a resident of Rohini. He attributed the worsening smog to vehicle emissions, stubble burning, and seasonal fireworks, saying that “closing schools and colleges are temporary solutions.”Stage II, applicable when AQI ranges between 301 and 400, includes intensified dust control, public transport expansion, and restrictions on diesel generator sets. Authorities have ordered daily mechanical sweeping and water sprinkling on roads, especially in high-traffic areas.Power supply agencies have been directed to ensure uninterrupted electricity to curb DG set usage. Public transport services—including buses and metro trains—will be augmented, and parking fees increased to discourage private vehicle use.The CAQM also urged Resident Welfare Associations to provide electric heaters to outdoor staff to prevent open burning of waste or biomass. Additionally, only CNG, electric, or BS-VI diesel inter-state buses will be allowed into Delhi.","The Commission for Air Quality Management invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR.

Poll Do you believe the Public Safety Act should be repealed in Jammu and Kashmir? Yes, it should be repealed. No, it is necessary for security.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday launched a sharp attack against Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah over his demand to remove the controversial Public Safety Act in the Union territory.Owaisi reminded Abdullah that the law has been ""misused"" by every elected and unelected government, which has led to ""untold suffering and human rights violations "".Taking a poetic jibe on J&K CM, Owaisi said, ""The Public Safety Act, 1978 (PSA) was introduced by Sheikh Abdullah in 1978 to deal with smuggling. Farooq Abdullah, G M Shah, Mufti Sayeed, GN Azad, Omar Abdullah & Mehbooba Mufti have all been CMs of J&K. They could have easily repealed PSA & prevented untold suffering and human rights violations.""""The law has been misused by virtually every elected CM & unelected Governors. Over 20,000 people have been jailed since 1978 without criminal charges, fair trials or even a proper appeals process. Some detentions were extended for up to 7-12 years. One separatist was detained under the PSA and, when he was later needed, he was served with a court warrant and granted bail. Now there is a truncated elected govt, and it has dawned on it to do away with the PSA,"" he added.""Sab kuch luta ke hosh mein aaye to kya kiya, Din mein agar chiragh jalaye to kya kiya,"" Owaisi further said.This comes after Omar Abdullah said that an elected government must have control over state subjects, including law and order and security, for it to remove the PSA.""We said in the manifesto that we would remove the Public Safety and Security Act (PSA) from Jammu and Kashmir. To remove it, we must have statehood.

We will remove the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) through an ordinance,"" he added.What is Public Security ActUnder the Public Safety Act (PSA), authorities can detain an individual for up to two years without trial. Originally enacted in 1978 to curb timber smuggling, the law was later invoked to detain political leaders and individuals deemed a threat to public order—particularly during the militancy surge in Kashmir in the early 1990s.One of the most recent detentions under the PSA is that of Aam Aadmi Party MLA Mehraj Malik, who has been lodged in Kathua district jail since September 8, 2025, for allegedly disturbing public order in Doda district and using abusive language against the district’s deputy commissioner.","Owaisi reminded Abdullah that the law has been ""misused"" by every elected and unelected government, which has led to ""untold suffering and human rights violations"" This comes after Omar Abdullah said that an elected government must have control over state subjects, including law and order and security.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124683479,imgsize-1024508,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Ayodhya celebrated Deepotsav 2025 on Sunday with grandeur and devotion, drawing thousands of devotees to the city along the banks of the River Saryu in Uttar Pradesh.Organised by the state government’s tourism and culture department, the festival marked the ninth edition of the celebration of Lord Ram’s life and legacy.The event featured Ramayana-themed tableaux, folk performances, laser shows, and devotional rituals, lighting up the city with millions of diyas.CM Yogi Adityanath inaugurated the festivities, which also saw the setting of new Guinness World Records, highlighting the scale, spiritual fervour, and cultural significance of the festival.Deepotsav 2025 witnessed two new Guinness World Records.One was for most people performing simultaneous diya rotations, and the other for the largest display of oil lamps, with 26,17,215 diyas lit by the department of tourism, district administration, and Ayodhya authorities.Across Uttar Pradesh, 1.51 crore diyas illuminated homes and public spaces, adding grandeur to the celebrations.Over 2,100 scholars participated in the Saryu aarti, creating mesmerising visuals at Ram ki Paidi.A grand Ram Leela was performed at Ram ki Paidi, accompanied by a spectacular laser and light show that lit up the ghats with colourful visuals.The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya was illuminated during the occasion.A drone show with 1,100 drones performed synchronised stunts over the River Saryu, creating mesmerising patterns that captivated thousands of devotees.To mark the grand occasion, the skies above Ayodhya lit up with a spectacular display of firecrackers, creating vibrant patterns that complemented the sea of diyas below.During the inaugural ceremony, CM Yogi Adityanath performed the ‘Rajyabhishek’ of Ram and Sita, along with pujan, vandana, and aarti.Addressing the crowd, he criticised opposition parties for their past stance on the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, saying, “Today, Uttar Pradesh does not have to face an identity crisis. We are now lighting lamps where bullets were once fired”.He hailed the city’s transformation as a centre of development and heritage, and described Deepotsav as a symbol of India’s spiritual and cultural leadership.“The construction of a grand temple is an honour to India's faith. It is a symbol of a new India. It is a symbol of a united and superior India,” he said, urging citizens to celebrate with devotion and enthusiasm.Hours before the lighting of lamps, UP tourism and culture minister Jaiveer Singh inaugurated a Ramayana-themed tableau procession from Saket College, waving a 'Jai Shri Ram' flag and beating drums.Crowds thronged the streets as 22 tableaux depicting the life and journey of Lord Ram across all seven Kandas — Balakanda, Ayodhyakanda, Aranyakanda, Kishkindhakanda, Sundarkanda, Lankakanda, and Uttarakanda — moved along the Rampath.Music, dance, and dramatic performances brought the epic to life, while devotees showered flowers, lit diyas, and performed aarti along the route.Folk arts from across India, including Haryana’s Phaag, Kerala’s Kathakali, Rajasthan’s Jhumar, Punjab’s Bhangra, Odisha’s Sambalpuri, and West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh’s traditional performances, added a pan-Indian flavour to the celebrations.Officials said the tableaux also showcased the achievements of the Uttar Pradesh government, merging cultural devotion with modern development narratives.","Deepotsav 2025 witnessed two new Guinness World Records.

From inclusion to isolation

India's political history is packed with turning points, each shaping the course of the next decade. And a very few years proved as crucial as 2013. That summer, two decisions were made within a week, which seemed to rewire Indian politics.On June 9, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) named Narendra Modi the head of its 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign committee, effectively setting him on the path to the prime minister's office.Just seven days later, on June 16, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar walked out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), bringing down the curtain on a 17-year partnership that had helped him rise to power. Three months later, on September 13, BJP formally declared Modi as its prime ministerial candidate.Nitish struck back, calling Modi a ""divisive"" leader and remarking that the BJP’s decision reflected ""(when misfortune strikes, judgment falters). Political observers saw the break as more than a clash of personalities.Some read it as Nitish’s effort to protect his Muslim vote base in Bihar from the polarising politics associated with Modi's BJP. Others believed it was a calculated move to keep his own prime ministerial hopes alive.Cut to 2025. Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), once the dominant partner in Bihar’s NDA, will this time contest the assembly elections on equal footing with the BJP, with 101 seats each.What stands out even more is who gets those tickets. Of JD(U)’s 101 candidates this time, only four are Muslims. The sharp contrast between the Nitish of 2013 and the Nitish of 2025 begs a single question: What changed?Nitish Kumar's evolution from the inclusionist of 2005 to the realist of 2025 is not a sudden shift. It is the outcome of two decades of political recalibration shaped by alliances, arithmetic, and survival instincts.When Nitish came to power in 2005, his slogan ""(development with justice) was aimed at building a broad coalition that could counter the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s ( RJD ) Muslim-Yadav base.Muslims, who make up around 17 per cent of Bihar’s population, were key to this equation.In his early years, JD(U) fielded 8–10 Muslim candidates, and several of them, like Jama Khan and Aslam Azad, won. Nitish’s outreach to Pasmanda (backwards) Muslims and welfare schemes such as scholarships, hostels, and minority commissions earned him goodwill.By 2010, JD(U) had fielded 14 Muslim candidates, the highest in its history, underscoring Nitish’s attempt to project himself as a centrist who could balance development with inclusivity even while in alliance with the BJP.The split with the BJP in 2013 was presented as a stand on ""secular values,"" but it also had a clear political logic. Nitish sought to preserve his minority base at a time when Narendra Modi was rising at the national level and being projected as anti-minority by the opposition.In the 2015 assembly elections, JD(U) allied with the RJD and Congress, giving thegrand alliance) a strong secular image. Although JD(U) itself fielded only 6–7 Muslim candidates (due to seat-sharing), Muslim representation across the alliance was healthy, and Nitish’s image as a moderate remained intact.Nitish's 2017 return to the BJP-led NDA marked the beginning of a slow but clear retreat from minority politics. By then, BJP dominance had grown both nationally and in Bihar, and Nitish's political leverage had shrunk.Muslim voters, disillusioned by his flip-flops, shifted decisively toward the RJD. For JD(U), Muslim candidates now offer little electoral dividend.In the 2020 Bihar elections, JD(U) fielded just 5 Muslim candidates, down from double digits a decade earlier. By 2025, that number stands at 4, the lowest since the party’s formation.JD(U)'s declining Muslim representation also mirrors the changing power equation within the NDA. Nitish, once the “big brother” in Bihar's alliance, now contests the same number of seats as the BJP, a symbolic indication of how much ground he has ceded.Within such a coalition, there's limited room for independent social engineering. The BJP's voter base is heavily majoritarian, and Nitish's attempt to retain Muslim representation risks unsettling that core. His reduced ticket allocation is as much about coalition management as it is about electoral realism.Today, Nitish leans on what party insiders call his ""3W"" base -- women, weaker castes, and welfare beneficiaries.His welfare measures for women, EBCs, and Mahadalits have replaced the old caste-plus-community model with a beneficiary-driven one. In this arithmetic, Muslim representation matters less; welfare visibility matters more.Two decades ago, Nitish Kumar’s politics revolved around bringing people in. Today, it’s about holding ground. His reduced Muslim outreach does not seem to be driven by hostility, but by calculation.At the centenary celebration of the Bihar Madrasa Education Board on August 21, 2025, CM Nitish Kumar made headlines for what he didn’t do. He declined to wear the muslim headgear offered to him on stage.It was a striking image, not least because a decade earlier, Nitish had taunted Narendra Modi for the same gesture. “To run the country, you have to take everyone along,” Nitish had said then, “at times you will have to wear a topi, at times a tilak.”Back then, it was Nitish jabbing Modi on inclusion. This time, it was Modi’s old line that seemed to echo louder, the one he’d delivered in a television interview: “Muslim children should get better education and ideally, they should have the Quran in one hand and a computer in the other.”At that moment, the roles had reversed. The man who once preached symbolism now sidestepped it.Nitish Kumar's journey captures the arc of India’s coalition-era politics itself, from the optimism of inclusion to the pragmatism of survival.His shift seems to be less about ideology and more about adaptation in an age where political space is shrinking for those who once thrived in the middle.For Bihar’s Muslims, the story of Nitish Kumar is no longer about trust lost or gained, but about a leader who adjusted to the times and, in doing so, quietly redrew the boundaries of his own politics.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar walked out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2013. The split with the BJP in 2013 was presented as a stand on ""secular values,"" but it also had a clear political logic. Nitish sought to preserve his minority base at a time when Narendra Modi was rising at the national level.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124688815,imgsize-30304,width-400,resizemode-4/whatsapp-image-2025-10-19-at-31154-pm.jpg"

The bigger picture



Sometimes, the margins of victory can be paper thin — and in a state like Bihar, where allegiances and alliances shift like monsoon clouds, that couldn’t be more true. Every election here is a reminder that even a few hundred votes can redraw political maps.As the 2025 Assembly elections draw closer, attention is turning to constituencies that saw the closest contests last time. In seats like Hilsa, Barbigha, and Dehri, the margins were under 500 votes — outcomes that could have flipped with just a few booths. The JD(U) and RJD had both won and lost such razor-edge battles, and with alliances realigned since then, each of these constituencies is now back in play.Perhaps the most dramatic contest of 2020, Hilsa saw JD(U)’s Krishnamurari Sharan, also known as Prem Mukhiya, edge out RJD’s Atri Muni (Shakti Singh Yadav) by just 12 votes — both polling around 37.35% of the total vote. The seat, part of Nalanda district, has historically swung between the two parties and is expected to be one of the most hard-fought battles this time as well. With Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and RJD once again on opposite sides, Hilsa could become a litmus test for how voters view Nitish’s return to the NDA.In Barbigha, JD(U)’s Sudarshan Kumar barely managed to stay ahead of Congress’s Gajanand Shahi by just 113 votes. Both polled around 33% each, showing how split the electorate was.The Congress had performed strongly here in 2020 despite limited organisational strength in the area. The party’s persistence in contesting the seat again, despite friction with RJD over seat-sharing, underlines its continued importance to the INDIA bloc.RJD’s Sudhakar Singh clinched Ramgarh by a margin of just 189 votes over BSP’s Ambika Singh, while BJP’s Ashok Kumar Singh was only 2,800 votes behind them. With three major parties within 2% of each other, the 2020 result was one of the tightest three-way finishes in Bihar. RJD hopes to consolidate anti-BJP votes this time, but the BSP’s influence among Dalit voters could again make it unpredictable.In Matihani, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) created a surprise when its candidate Raj Kumar Singh narrowly defeated JD(U)’s Narendra Kumar Singh by only 333 votes, while CPI(M)’s Rajendra Prasad Singh was just another 400 votes behind. With three candidates each securing nearly 29% of the vote, Matihani remains one of Bihar’s most unpredictable battlegrounds. The left’s continued presence here means even small shifts in alliances could change the outcome dramatically.JD(U)’s Sunil Kumar won Bhorey by just 462 votes over CPI(ML)’s Jitendra Paswan, with both polling above 40%. The Left’s strong showing reflected CPI(ML)’s growing rural base, particularly among Dalit and agrarian voters. With CPI(ML) now a formal part of the INDIA bloc, Bhorey could see a direct face-off between NDA and the Left once again.Another cliffhanger unfolded in Dehri, where RJD’s Phate Bahadur Singh beat BJP’s Satyanarayan Singh by just 464 votes, both polling over 41%. The constituency has often mirrored the broader state trend — a reason why both alliances are expected to deploy senior leaders here this year.In Bachhwara, BJP’s Surendra Mehata edged out CPI’s Abdhesh Kumar Rai by only 484 votes. The contest was a straight Left-versus-BJP duel, with both commanding nearly 30% each. The CPI’s local base here, built over decades, remains intact. Interestingly, CPI is again pitted against the Congress in some seats this time, exposing fissures within the INDIA bloc even as they attempt coordination.Chakai produced one of 2020’s biggest upsets when independent candidate Sumit Kumar Singh defeated RJD’s Savitri Devi by just 581 votes. Singh has since joined the NDA and could benefit from the combined BJP–JD(U) machinery. However, with RJD determined to reclaim the seat, Chakai is once again poised for a close battle — especially with JMM also eyeing influence in the region.Kurhani’s 2020 contest between RJD’s Anil Kumar Sahni and BJP’s Kedar Prasad Gupta ended with just 712 votes separating the two. RJD polled 40.23% to BJP’s 39.86%. Kurhani, located in Muzaffarpur district, has changed hands multiple times and was even the site of a bypoll in 2022. Its outcome this year could reflect whether Tejashwi Yadav’s message of youth and jobs resonates against the NDA’s stability pitch.In Bakhri, CPI’s Suryakant Paswan defeated BJP’s Ramshankar Paswan by 777 votes, both getting more than 43% of the vote. As one of Bihar’s few remaining Left bastions, Bakhri will be closely watched to see if CPI can retain its grip amid the NDA’s push into Scheduled Caste–reserved seats.As the NDA and INDIA bloc prepare for the 2025 polls — with voting scheduled for November 6 and 11 and results on November 14 — these ten constituencies exemplify Bihar’s deep political fragmentation. With Nitish Kumar back in the NDA and Tejashwi Yadav leading a divided opposition, margins as thin as those from 2020 could once again decide the fate of Bihar’s 243-seat Assembly.","Hilsa, Barbigha, and Dehri were the constituencies that saw the closest contests last time. The JD(U) and RJD had both won and lost such razor-edge battles, and with alliances realigned since then, each of these constituencies is now back in play.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124688881,imgsize-1210752,width-400,resizemode-4/bihar-polls.jpg"

'They called Lord Ram a myth'



‘Why Spend Money On Diyas’: Akhilesh Yadav’s Remark On Ayodhya Deepotsav Sparks Row, BJP Hits Out

'They erased Ayodhya’s identity'



'A festival of truth and faith'



From 1.71 lakh diyas to millions



NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday launched a fierce attack on the Congress and Samajwadi Party, accusing them of “insulting India’s eternal faith” and obstructing the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Speaking at the ninth edition of Deepotsav-2025 in Shri Ayodhya Dham, the chief minister framed the festival as both a spiritual celebration and a symbolic triumph of truth over falsehood.Addressing thousands gathered amid the glow of millions of diyas, CM Yogi alleged that both Congress and SP had worked to “erase Ayodhya’s identity” and hinder the construction of the Ram Temple.“While we are illuminating Ayodhya with millions of lamps, we must not forget that during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the Congress party declared in court that Lord Shri Ram was a myth. The Congress party gave an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that Shri Ram was a myth, and the Samajwadi Party had fired bullets at Ram devotees in this very Ayodhya,” he said.He accused the opposition of double standards, saying, “These are the same people who pray at Babar’s tomb but rejected the invitation to the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla in the temple at Ayodhya.”Continuing his criticism, CM Yogi said the opposition parties had for decades attempted to undermine the spiritual heritage of Ayodhya.“We must remember their double standards. These are the same people who, during the Ram Mandir movement, deployed separate advocates to prevent the construction of the temple in Ayodhya, so they could protest and create obstacles in the path of the Ram Mandir. But today we can say they fired bullets; we are lighting lamps in Ayodhya,” he said.He further claimed that the previous governments had “erased Ayodhya’s identity” by renaming it Faizabad. “We have restored the name and legacy of Ayodhya, making it Ayodhya Dham again,” he added.Reflecting on the origins of Deepotsav, CM Yogi recalled the humble beginnings of the celebration when his government revived the tradition in 2017.“When we decided in 2017 to organise the first Deepotsav in Ayodhya Dham, the sentiment behind it was singular: to show the world how lamp-lighting should be done and on what occasion it should be celebrated,” he said.He added that the festival symbolised a return to India’s ancient roots: “Thousands of years ago, when the world was living in darkness, Ayodhya had lit lamps to welcome its Lord, its deity, and the arrival of its faith--those very lamps became the great festival of Sanatana Dharma in the form of Deepotsav and Deepawali.”The chief minister also recalled the logistical challenges faced during the inaugural Deepotsav.“When we decided to carry forward that campaign again to keep the spirit of Deepotsav alive, in 2017 we did not have sufficient lamps. We collected lamps from across the state and managed to light 1.71 lakh diyas. Today, millions of lamps are lit in Ayodhya Dham,” he said, calling it a symbol of “the awakening of faith and pride in Indian culture.”",Yogi Adityanath launches fierce attack on Congress and Samajwadi Party.

Bihar elections: 5 tips Congress can take from BJP’s pre-poll playbook - from cadre to alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-5-tips-congress-can-take-from-bjps-pre-poll-playbook-from-cadre-to-alliance/articleshow/124687528.cms,"Shah Avoids Naming Bihar CM Face, Says Bihar CM to Be Decided by Elected MLAs

Ground cadre

Alliance discipline and timely seat-sharing

Unified leadership and disciplined message

Candidate selection

Forward-looking campaigning

NEW DELHI: When Chirag Paswan campaigns shoulder to shoulder with BJP leaders, Nitish Kumar fine-tunes his alliance messaging, and BJP’s top brass, from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Union home minister Amit Shah, lead high-pitched rallies, the Congress and its Mahagathbandhan allies still appear tangled in seat-sharing disputes and mixed messaging.As Bihar heads for assembly polls, the contrast between the Congress’s pre-poll uncertainty and the BJP’s methodical campaign machinery could not be starker. While results will tell whether the BJP’s precision planning converts into votes, its playbook offers the Congress five clear takeaways if it wants to regain relevance in the election battleground.The BJP’s biggest strength remains its disciplined network of booth-level workers, nurtured through the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and local shakhas. In the run-up to Bihar elections , both Modi and Shah have frequently interacted with ground volunteers through digital town halls, giving micro-tasks such as voter outreach, welfare-scheme verification, and local mobilisation.In contrast, Congress cadres continue to complain about a top-heavy command structure and weak communication between state and central units, problems that the party’s own post-poll reviews since 2019 have acknowledged.As BJP unveiled its full list of 101 candidates, visuals of Congress workers protesting ticket distribution circulated widely last week, highlighting accusations of bias and lack of transparency within its Bihar unit.To counter BJP’s organisational muscle, Congress must rebuild from the booth up - empower local communicators, reward consistent volunteers, and create digital feedback loops that turn engagement into turnout.In Bihar, the BJP finalised its pre-poll arithmetic well before the nomination window — 101 seats each for BJP and JD(U), 29 for LJP (Ram Vilas), and 6 each for HAM (Secular) and RLM.By contrast, the Congress-RJD-CPI(ML) bloc remains locked in disagreements, with smaller allies voicing frustration over delay and imbalance. Several alliance partners even fielded overlapping candidates as nominations for Phase 1 closed.Early seat-sharing sends a message of clarity and control. Congress needs to close deals before deadlines - visible rifts undermine confidence among voters and cadres alike.The BJP has turned PM Modi into its central brand, letting state leaders campaign under a unified triad of vikas (development), samman (respect), and suraksha (security). In Bihar, it avoided naming a chief-ministerial face, insulating itself from Nitish Kumar’s anti-incumbency while keeping focus on ""Modi ki Guarantee.""The Congress, meanwhile, continues to project fragmented messaging. Its Bihar unit has seen frequent leadership churn, and Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra themes have yet to translate into a coherent local pitch.Elections reward consistency. Congress needs one emotionally resonant storyline, Bihar-specific but tied to national aspirations, that every leader can echo without dilution.The BJP’s ticket distribution appears increasingly data-driven: constituency-level surveys, winnability audits, and digital tracking shape final lists. It has also deployed senior organisational leaders from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand to supervise tough regions.Congress, by contrast, continues to rely on familiar faces and late entrants. Its own internal reviews (AICC, 2022-23) flagged lack of local credibility as a recurring reason for losses.Winnability, not hierarchy, must guide choices. Congress may benefit from focussing on candidates with local connect and accountability, not just name recall.Congress’s current campaign focuses heavily on warnings of “vote chori” and allegations of voter-roll manipulation. While such themes energise the base, they rarely appeal to undecided or aspirational voters who prioritise jobs, growth, and education.The BJP, by contrast, anchors its message in delivery and promises — publicising welfare “guarantees,” housing schemes, and local infrastructure achievements through Modi’s personal brand.A constructive, Bihar-centric vision, job creation, youth opportunities, and agricultural reform, can help Congress shift from grievance to governance mode.As election dates near, Congress risks being squeezed between the NDA’s organisational machine and newer regional fronts seeking to tap disillusioned voters. The party’s revival in Bihar will depend on whether it can blend a forward-looking local agenda with disciplined alliance management and credible grassroots presence.Without that recalibration, it risks remaining a spectator in a contest increasingly defined by clarity of message - something the BJP has mastered ahead of yet another high-stakes Bihar poll.","The Congress and its Mahagathbandhan allies still appear tangled in seat-sharing disputes and mixed messaging.

No undue leniency or excessive severity in sentencing: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-undue-leniency-or-excessive-severity-in-sentencing-sc/articleshow/124695123.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has cautioned trial courts and HCs against undue leniency or excessive severity while imposing punishment on a person convicted of an offence and said that deviation from this time-tested sentencing policy could erode public faith in the judiciary or lead to injustice.“Undue leniency can cause public confidence in the justice system to plummet, while excessive severity may lead to injustice,” ruled a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih while rejecting a plea for reduction of the eight-year sentence imposed on a youth who, in the heat of the moment during an altercation, struck a blow that led to the death of a man.The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister. His sister had given birth to a child on account of the sexual assault. The family of the man who raped the girl was unwilling to accede to the proposal to get the rape survivor married to him. The man was in jail on the charge of sexual assault. When the accused, with his family, was visiting the alleged rapist’s family to resolve the issue of his sister’s proposed marriage to him, an altercation broke out, in course of which the alleged rapist’s brother intervened in an effort to calm the situation.But the accused was so enraged by the sexual assault on his sister, coupled with the alleged rapist’s refusal to marry her, that he picked up an axe and gave a fatal blow to the one attempting to pacify the two sides.Senior advocate Rahul Kaushik told the court that the accused was merely 20 years old when the incident happened.Highlighting that the crime was not pre-meditated, he pleaded for leniency in sentence, which had been reduced to eight years by the HC from 10 years imposed by the trial court.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta agreed that the appellant may have been deprived of self-control because of his sister’s alleged rape at the hands of the man. But he found no sudden provocation in the circumstances to warrant the trial court's converting a murder case into a culpable homicide one.","The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister.

Those organising live events will soon be able to go online to check venue availability, capacity, pre-approved licences, and get clearance within 15 days through a new single-window digital portal being rolled out by the information and broadcasting ministry.This was decided at the joint working group meeting — renamed Live Events Development Cell — this week to make event organisation in India faster, simpler and more transparent.The cell brings together central ministries, nine state govts, leading industry associations and stakeholders under a common framework to streamline permissions, promote creative employment and establish India as a global live entertainment hub. “The portal, expected to go live by Oct-end, will provide end-to-end digital facilitation — from checking available venues and seating capacities to verifying pre-cleared licences and applicable tariffs,” said senior I&B ministry officials, adding that this has been done to remove redundant permissions and overlapping approvals that have long delayed event organisation in the country.The live events industry, valued at over Rs 20,800 crore in FY25, grew 15% in the past year and is projected to double by 2030, according to a white paper, titled ‘India’s Live Events Economy: A Strategic Growth Imperative’, released earlier this year at the WAVES-2025 summit. The sector could generate 15-20 million direct and indirect jobs by 2030, spanning roles in logistics, hospitality, event management, performance and technical services.A model framework is also being prepared by the ministry to serve as a citizen charter, laying out time-bound clearances and grievance redressal mechanisms.The initiative follows PM Narendra Modi’s remarks at the Utkarsh Odisha Summit earlier this year, where he cited the example of international concerts, like Coldplay’s performances in India, as opportunities to harness the country’s growing youth-driven concert culture for economic, employment and cultural growth.The joint working group, chaired by the I&B Secretary, includes representatives from the ministries of culture, sports, skill development, DPIIT, finance, and tourism, as well as govts of Maharashtra, Assam, Delhi, Telangana, Karnataka, and others.","Organisers of live events will soon be able to go online to check venue availability, capacity, pre-approved licences, and get clearance within 15 days.

"In Assam, Zubeen Garg's shrine unites people in grief & anger",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-assam-zubeen-gargs-shrine-unites-people-in-grief-anger/articleshow/124694677.cms,"Thousands visit Zubeen’s ‘ shrine ’ every day



.

GUWAHATI: How deeply can an entire state and its diverse populations transform in a month? No, not from the outside. Not because of sparkling elevated roads that suddenly emerge to make travel lighter, global award-winning airports that attract wide attention, or malls with facades so shiny that they throw back your reflection as if it were a giant mirror. From the inside.There is no way to measure such abstract possibilities. But if you want to witness a phenomenon with little known precedent — just to challenge a theory perhaps, or a long-held belief regarding the nature of change and the time it takes — come to Guwahati and travel across Assam to see what’s happened in the 30 days since one of its most beloved icons, singerEarlier, not too long ago, when a visitor arrived in Assam, relatives, friends and tour guides would nudge the guest to first complete the two most important tasks in an unchanging Guwahati itinerary – darshan at the revered Kamakhya mandir and a stroll along the mighty Brahmaputra. Now, you’ll be asked to do one more thing – head to Sonapur, about 20 km away from the city, where Zubeen’s final resting place has metamorphosed into a shrine that welcomes thousands every day in an unending procession. A grand memorial will be up soon, the people have been promised. But grief can’t wait for monuments.At the site of immense sorrow, an old man with a flowing beard and fraying kurta pock-marked with age, said, “Zubeen spoke for all of us.”Ashraful Syed, 73 years old, had come with his grandson Mobin, and granddaughter Hameeda. There were others from his village in Golaghat, mostly kin, milling around, listening intently to a women’s naam-kirtan group from Nagaon, who had brought along metal cymbals and traditional drums, singing sombre hymns under a shaky canopy where the elderly sat in plastic chairs and the young on bare ground.If lakhs of people from almost all corners of Assam — and even beyond in the north-east — filled highways, community halls and stadiums in mourning over days following Zubeen’s death, and markets, schools and offices closed without concern (old-timers said they hadn’t seen an outpouring of emotions like this even when its other beloved star, Bhupen Hazarika, died in Nov 2011), it was also because of, like Ashraful Syed said, Zubeen’s courage and sense of inclusiveness. He was secular in the most fundamental of ways, and brave – taking on the ULFA who stopped him from singing Hindi songs, the politicians who belittled the marginalized and persecuted, and the powerful who didn’t care for their own people. And Zubeen did all this without a trace of self-importance, often sitting on pavements with some cash to give out to jobless youth, eating poori-sabji from paper plates on roadsides, making light of his drinking habit. Everything that a bona fide A-lister wouldn’t. And he was loved universally for this.“Assam lost its darling child,” Sonalika Hazarika, 66, said at the Sonapur shrine. She’d come from Jorhat with three of her neighbours. “We come in small groups so as not to clutter the place. Others must also be given space. To pray for Zubeen’s peace and happiness. Assam’s too.”At what’s now called Zubeen Dham, there are long rows of cars parked on an uneven, oblong patch of land, a posse of new vehicles sliding in every minute, haggling for space. A newly erected toilet has begun to leak, unable to accommodate the thousands of fans and common folks who troop in daily. There are beggars and ice cream vendors. The kind you find near popular temples.","Thousands visit Zubeen’s ‘ shrine ’ every day in an unending procession.

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: Union home ministry has invited representatives of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) for talks in New Delhi on Oct 22, weeks after both Ladakhi groups withdrew from dialogue following the Sept 24 police firing that left four dead and over 70 wounded during violent protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the Union territory.Ladakhi functionaries welcomed the outreach and confirmed joint participation. “Both LAB and KDA will participate, along with the MP for Ladakh and our lawyer,” LAB co-chairman Chering Dorjay said Sunday in Leh. Chief executive councillor of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) will also attend.The talks are set to discuss constitutional safeguards on land, culture, and environment, according to sources.Dorjay said the groups told the ministry that their key demands — statehood and Sixth Schedule status — remain unmet. “We said there will be talks on these two issues, and we are hopeful that govt will engage sincerely this time with an open mind and in a good atmosphere,” he said. “We expect the discussions will be fruitful… we are hopeful of good results.”KDA’s Sajjad Kargili said: “We are meeting for statehood and Sixth Schedule, justice for the Sept 24 victims, and release of those arrested, including Sonam Wangchuk.We believe only genuine dialogue can restore trust and fulfil Ladakh’s aspirations.”Thupstan Chhewang, a former MP and one of Ladakh’s senior-most Buddhist figures, will lead the LAB delegation. Dorjay will accompany him, while KDA will be represented by Asgar Ali Karbali, Qamar Ali Akhoon, and Kargili.The talks trace back to the creation of Ladakh as a separate UT after the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019. Following sustained protests under LAB and KDA banners, the home ministry formed a high-powered committee on Jan 2, 2023, to address Ladakh’s political and constitutional demands.The last meeting between the committee and Ladakhi representatives took place on May 27, leading to the rollout of a domicile policy. Frustration grew as talks stalled, prompting climate activist Wangchuk — a vocal advocate for Sixth Schedule protection — to begin a 35-day hunger strike on Sept 9, accusing Centre of delaying dialogue on restoring Ladakh’s democratic rights.The home ministry had announced a new round of talks for Oct 6, but violence erupted on Sept 24 when police and paramilitary forces opened fire on protesters in Leh — prompting Wangchuk to break his fast. Authorities later imposed curfew-like restrictions, suspended internet, and arrested over 70 people, including Wangchuk, who was charged under National Security Act and moved to Jodhpur jail.LAB and KDA withdrew from talks soon after, demanding a judicial probe led by a retired Supreme Court judge and the release of all those arrested.

Government to consider providing highway builders with additional funds for BOT projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-consider-providing-highway-builders-with-additional-funds-for-bot-projects/articleshow/124691810.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The government is looking to provide additional funds to highway builders to make projects under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model more financially viable, allowing private players to recover their investments through toll collection.Currently, such funding, known as Viability Gap Funding (VGF), is capped at 40% of the project cost. TOI has learnt that under the proposed plan, VGF beyond the 40% cap would be paid by highway authorities in instalments, through annuity payments.The matter was discussed at a high-level committee meeting held recently at NITI Aayog . A framework for the revised VGF mechanism will be developed, as the government is keen to attract more private investment in the infrastructure sector, sources said.The timing of the proposal is significant, considering that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the highways ministry are finalising an overhaul of the contract document for projects built under Build Operate and Transfer (BOT-Toll) mode to attract more investment in the highway sector. The NHAI leads among agencies with the maximum number of BOT-Toll projects (182), of which 25% have had to be terminated.Officials said the government has modified several provisions in the contract document to make the highway sector more attractive to investors. More changes are being made after getting feedback from private highway builders and project financing entities, including the proposal to make 95% of land available before start of construction work in BOT-Toll projects.“Provisions will be introduced to compensate for revenue shortfall annually, with a cap on such payment, if actual traffic flow is 10% less than the projected traffic in the first seven years and the concession period to collect toll would be increased or reduced by linking it to rise or fall in traffic. Now with FASTag tolling, there is hardly any scope for reporting wrong traffic data,” said an official.Modifications have also been proposed for termination payment by highway agencies to protect lenders’ interests. In a move aimed at curbing accidents, failure to correct faults to prevent recurrence of road crashes will be treated as a “default” by concessionaires.Striking a balancing act, the road transport ministry has also proposed to compensate private highway builders for delay on the part of NHAI and other agencies, including interest on debt due and operation and maintenance expenses, and through extension of contract period.","Currently, such funding, known as Viability Gap Funding (VGF), is capped at 40% of the project cost.

Opposition disarray, PM Modi to launch BJP campaign



NEW DELHI: The political battle for Bihar intensified on Sunday with a flurry of developments — from the AIMIM releasing its first list of 25 candidates to Giriraj Singh stirring controversy with his remarks on Muslims. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) faced embarrassment over a last-minute candidate swap, while Chirag Paswan redefined his “MY” formula ahead of the polls. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to kick off the BJP’s campaign on October 24.The Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM announced its first list of 25 candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections, including two non-Muslims. The list features state party chief Akhtarul Iman, its lone MLA, who will again contest from Amour.The party posted on X: “We are happy to announce the list of AIMIM candidates for the upcoming Bihar elections... Inshallah, we will be a voice of justice for Bihar’s weakest and most neglected.”Most of AIMIM’s seats are concentrated in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region. The party has also fielded Manoj Kumar Das from Sikandra in Gaya and Rana Ranjeet Singh from Dhaka in East Champaran.In 2020, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four MLAs later joined the RJD. Its overtures to the INDIA bloc this year were ignored, prompting the party to go solo in 2025.Union minister Giriraj Singh triggered outrage by saying he does not need the votes of “namak haraams” (betrayers) while addressing a rally in Arwal district.“Muslims take the benefits of all central schemes but don’t vote for us... Such people are called ‘namak haraam’,” the BJP MP from Begusarai said.He added, “I asked a maulvi whether he had an Ayushman Bharat card and whether Modi abused him. He said no. Then I asked, what was my fault? Someone who doesn’t acknowledge kindness is a ‘namak haraam’.”JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Singh was “free to use words as per his choice” but admitted it was “a matter of concern” that some communities benefited from schemes yet did not vote for the BJP.RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwary slammed Singh, saying, “BJP leaders can’t say anything except Hindu-Muslim... They divert attention from issues like unemployment and education.”Independent MP Pappu Yadav also attacked the minister, saying, “Giriraj babu must tell us who supported the British during India’s freedom struggle... Those who supported the enemy should be called ‘namak haraam’.”The JD(U) found itself in an awkward position after withdrawing Sabir Ali’s candidature from Amour just a day after announcing it. The party reinstated Saba Zafar, who had already filed his nomination on the JD(U) ticket.Zafar told reporters, “There should be no confusion. I filed my nomination papers yesterday. I was never asked to return my poll symbol.”Ali, who had been expelled from the JD(U) in 2014, said, “Admittedly, the news of my candidature had been disseminated from official channels... But I am ready to campaign for JD(U) wherever I am told, even on the Siachen glacier.”The confusion comes as both the NDA and INDIA bloc face internal turmoil over seat sharing and candidate selection ahead of the November 6 and 11 polls.Former RJD candidate Madan Shah broke down outside the residence of RJD chief and former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday, alleging betrayal over the Bihar Assembly Elections 2025 ticket.Speaking to the media, Shah claimed, “Lalu Prasad Yadav promised to give me a ticket for the Bihar Assembly Elections 2025. RJD leader Sanjay Yadav had demanded Rs 2.7 crore, and when I refused to pay, the party ticket was given to someone else.”Overcome with emotion, he tore his clothes, fell to the ground, and said, “They will not form the government; Tejashwi is very arrogant, doesn’t meet people. They are giving away tickets. Sanjay Yadav is doing all this. I have come here to die. Lalu Yadav is my Guru.”Shah added that in 2020, Lalu Prasad had promised him a ticket after a community survey.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan unveiled a new meaning for his “MY” formula, saying it stands for “Mahilayein and Youth,” under his “Bihar First, Bihari First” vision.“When I talk about ‘MY,’ ‘M’ stands for ‘mahilayein’ (women) and ‘Y’ for youth. Both face similar issues,” Paswan told ANI. “Unlike others who divide youth on caste lines, my focus is on empowerment and development.”Speaking in Patna, Paswan told ANI, “Every party wants its leader to become the chief minister. I myself wanted my father to become the chief minister or even the Prime Minister. Discussions on these topics should be held at the right occasions.”He said his party is contesting 29 seats — the same number his father Ram Vilas Paswan had won in 2005 — calling it a “spiritual connection.” One of the party’s candidates, Seema Singh, had her nomination rejected on technical grounds, and Paswan said the party had approached the Election Commission to reconsider.“If the Mahagathbandhan cannot resolve its internal confusion, how will it work for Bihar’s development? The public has faith in the NDA,” he said, expressing confidence of achieving a “100 per cent strike rate.”The INDIA bloc continued to struggle with seat-sharing talks as the JMM decided to contest six seats independently. The Congress, meanwhile, released five new names, replacing some sitting MLAs amid internal protests over ticket distribution.Senior Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “We are close to reaching an agreement... Things should become clearer by the time withdrawal of nomination papers takes place.”With confusion persisting in both camps, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch the BJP’s campaign on October 24, signalling the start of the high-octane phase of Bihar’s two-phase election. Polling will take place on November 6 and 11, and results will be announced on November 14.",The AIMIM releases its first list of 25 candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections.

I myself wanted my father to become the chief minister or even the Prime Minister. Discussions on these topics should be held at the right occasions.”Paswan reaffirmed his support for the current NDA leadership in Bihar, adding that “many leaders of the NDA alliance have made it clear that we are contesting the elections under the leadership of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, and after the elections, the elected MLAs will once again choose Nitish Kumar as the chief minister.” He said his focus remains on Bihar’s development, noting, “I wanted to contest the Bihar elections , but the prolonged negotiations shifted my priority to focusing on the candidates of my party. In the next four to five years, I will try to focus on Bihar even more.”Ahead of the polls, Paswan has also redefined the “MY” equation — traditionally associated with the RJD’s Muslim-Yadav base — to represent Mahilayein (women) and Yuva (youth). Explaining his “Bihar First, Bihari First” vision, he told ANI, “When I talk about 'MY equation', 'M' stands for 'mahilayein' and 'Y' stands for youth. I believe both face similar issues.I am moving forward with the idea of 'Bihar First - Bihari First', where we can progress toward building a 'Viksit Bihar'. ”Paswan said his party’s contest on 29 seats — the same number his father won in the 2005 assembly elections — was a “spiritual signal.” “I believe in manifestations and stay spiritually connected. It cannot be a mere coincidence that after all the negotiations, my party is contesting elections on 29 seats, and my father also won elections on 29 seats,” he said.The LJP (RV) chief added that his party is exploring legal options after one candidate’s nomination was rejected due to “human error”. He expressed confidence in the NDA’s prospects, saying the opposition’s internal discord would only strengthen his alliance. “If the Mahagathbandhan is not able to resolve confusion within the alliance, how will they work for the development of the people of Bihar?” he asked.Paswan said he believes the NDA could perform even better than expected, adding, “Until now, we were measuring ourselves based on our hard work. Now, in the way the opposition has become complacent, the advantage of that will also go to us.”Polling in the Bihar Assembly elections is scheduled for November 6 and 11, with results to be declared on November 14.",Paswan reaffirmed his support for the current NDA leadership in Bihar.

Skipped Sharm el-Sheikh. 5.

Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India. Don’t damage the country’s relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties',"" Congress posted on X.Trump claimed on Wednesday that PM Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after he imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican leader added.Meanwhile, Russia remains India's single-largest source of oil, accounting for 34% of inbound shipments in September, although volumes have slipped 10% in the first eight months of 2025, according to commodities and shipping markets tracker Kpler.The agency’s latest report pegs India’s crude imports in September at more than 4.5 million bpd (barrels per day).This is an increase of 70,000 barrels over August but flat when compared to the year-ago period, says the report, adding Russian oil accounted for a tad under 1.6 million bpd, or 34% of crude imports. India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

"COP29 gets momentum with consensus on creation of carbon credits standards, India wants to conclude work on carbon market",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cop29-gets-momentum-with-consensus-on-creation-of-carbon-credits-standards-india-wants-to-conclude-work-on-carbon-market/articleshow/115236579.cms,"BAKU: With countries reaching a consensus on the standards for creation of carbon credits for the larger issue of setting up carbon markets, India on Tuesday expressed that it expects to conclude the work on the issue at the ongoing COP29 and pitched for ""adequate, predictable and accessible"" finance under the new post-2025 climate finance goal. The remarks came as a group of developing countries (G77, including India, plus China) rejected an existing text on finance goals as it did not have clarity on the quantum as well as sources of finance.In the backdrop of such a development on the second day of the UN climate talks, Indian negotiators said since the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance is a key element in the discussions at the COP29, India would continue to be vocal about the need for adequate finance for the Global South (developing countries).""COP29 should ensure that climate finance is adequate, predictable, accessible, grant-based, low-interest and long-term,"" said an Indian negotiator. His remarks reflect the sentiments of developing countries, represented by the G77 plus China grouping, which want the NCQG text to clearly specify an amount of at least $1.3 trillion per year from developed to developing countries, with a significant provision component for adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage.""At present, much of climate finance discussions are focused on investments in mitigation actions. The COP29 should maintain balance and highlight the urgency of addressing adaptation needs, particularly for vulnerable communities in developing countries,"" said the negotiator, spelling out India's stand on NCQG and carbon market — two issues which are considered yardsticks to judge the outcome of this round of the climate conference. India has already sought a clear definition of climate finance, as reported by TOI on Monday, to bring clarity on the entire issue.Article 6 of the Paris Agreement deals with the global carbon market issue. Late Monday, countries agreed on the article’s sub-section 6.4, which will enable climate action by increasing demand for carbon credits and ensure that the international carbon market operates with ""integrity under the supervision of the United Nations"".“This will be a game-changing tool to direct resources to the developing world. Following years of stalemate, the breakthroughs in Baku have now begun. But there is much more to deliver,"" said COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev while identifying the full operationalisation of Article 6 as a key negotiating priority this year. It is believed that the finalising Article 6 negotiations could reduce the cost of implementing national climate plans by $250 billion per year by enabling cooperation across borders.On the carbon market, Indian negotiators said the COP29 should be able to agree to a mechanism which uses market-based instruments (such as carbon credits) to incentivise low carbon development. ""Countries should establish clearer rules for global carbon markets which do not create unfair barriers to trade or development. It instead addresses the technology and finance gaps for supporting developing nations,"" said a negotiator while speaking on India's stand.","India has pitched for ""adequate, predictable and accessible"" finance under the new post-2025 climate finance goal.

Wayanad bypolls: Voting under way for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's electoral debut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wayanad-bypolls-voting-under-way-for-priyanka-gandhi-vadras-electoral-debut/articleshow/115236152.cms,"NEW DELHI: Voting is currently under way in Kerala’s Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency as Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra makes her highly anticipated electoral debut.Polling started at 7 am and will continue until 6 pm.This bypoll gained importance after Rahul Gandhi , who held the seat since 2019, decided to vacate Wayanad to retain Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh, a seat he also won in the 2024 general elections. Days after the June 4 election results, Congress announced Rahul’s decision to vacate Wayanad, paving the way for Priyanka’s entry into the constituency.Priyanka is competing against 15 candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Navya Haridas of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The Election Commission has prepared extensively for this bypoll, distributing polling materials across 1,354 booths, all equipped with webcasting facilities to monitor the voting process.Historically a Congress stronghold, Wayanad has consistently elected Congress MPs since its establishment in 2008, with Rahul Gandhi securing landslide victories in both 2019 and 2024, with margins of 4.3 lakh and 3.6 lakh votes, respectively. The United Democratic Front (UDF) is now mounting an intensive campaign to secure a substantial win for Priyanka, banking on her appeal and the traditional Congress support base of minorities, settler farmers, and tribal communities. Her campaign rallies have drawn large female audiences, which the UDF interprets as a promising indicator for her chances in the election.Sathyan Mokeri, the LDF candidate, is focused on retaining the Left’s voter base, as he did in 2014 when he reduced the Congress's victory margin. Meanwhile, NDA candidate Navya Haridas has conducted a targeted campaign, focusing on key areas of support and reaching out to Christian voters by addressing issues like the waqf dispute.The campaign concluded with a “Kottikalasham” (festive closing ceremony), followed by a day of silent campaigning. Priyanka chose a low-key approach on election eve, visiting a farm and the Banasura Sagar dam, while her LDF and NDA counterparts engaged with voters across the constituency. UDF is hopeful for a turnout exceeding the 73.5% recorded in 2024, ideally reaching the 80.3% turnout seen in 2019.The LDF is relying on its organisational strength and Mokeri’s local recognition, while NDA aims to maintain the increased vote share it achieved in the 2024 general elections. With polling well underway, Wayanad’s 14.7 lakh voters will determine the outcome of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s first step into electoral politics.","Priyanka is competing against 15 candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Navya Haridas of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) The Election Commission has prepared extensively for this bypoll, distributing polling materials across 1,354 booths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115236250,imgsize-739793,width-400,resizemode-4/115236250.jpg"
"Adani, Sharad Pawar, Shah and Praful were at BJP-NCP talks 5 years ago: Ajit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adani-sharad-pawar-shah-and-praful-were-at-bjp-ncp-talks-5-years-ago-ajit/articleshow/115234315.cms,"NCP chief Ajit Pawar (File photo)

We do what our seniors tell us to: Ajit on 2019 BJP talks

Proof Maharashtra sarkar is Adani sarkar: Opposition

MUMBAI: Industrialist Gautam Adani was part of political talks between BJP and the undivided Sharad Pawar-led NCP five years ago, Ajit Pawar said on Tuesday. He was referring to discussions that happened just before he joined hands with BJP and formed a short-lived govt with Devendra Fadnavis as CM and himself as deputy CM in 2019. “Amit Shah, Gautam Adani, Praful Patel, Fadnavis & Pawar Saheb... All were there...,” Ajit Pawar said in an interview to Newslaundry.When asked about the ideological incompatibility between NCP and BJP and his having gone with BJP in spite of it, he said BJP formed the govt in Maharashtra in 2014 after NCP declared outside support. “When results of the 2014 assembly polls were out, NCP spokesperson Praful Patel declared we will support BJP from outside,” Ajit said.After 2014 assembly polls, NCP spokesperson Praful Patel had declared support for BJP from outside, Ajit Pawar said, adding NCP later declared the support was not permanent but only for forming govt, resulting in BJP and Sena coming together again.Asked further on the subject, he said, “we do what our senior functionaries tell us” and referred to the ‘meeting’ before his early morning swearing-in with Fadnavis. “It has been five years, everyone knows where the meeting happened, it was in Delhi at a businessman’s house, everyone knows it. Yes, there were five meetings… Amit Shah was there, Gautam Adani was there, Praful Patel was there, Devendra Fadnavis was there, Pawar Saheb was there… All were there... Everything was decided.” He further said, “Blame for it has fallen on me, and I have taken it. I took blame and made others safe.”Asked why Pawar Senior then later hesitated and didn’t go with BJP, Ajit said he didn’t know the reason. “Pawar Saheb is a leader whose mind no one in the world can read. Not even our aunty (Sharad Pawar’s wife Pratibha) or our Supriya (Sule).” Sharad Pawar has consistently denied any involvement with power-sharing talks with BJP in 2019. BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis had alleged last year that Pawar had had a series of meeting with BJP between 2017 and 2019.Asked about him having split NCP, Ajit said there was no question of a split and “one who has the majority controls the party.”Questioned if the Pawar family could get together again, he said, “I haven’t thought about it now. Right now my focus is on the elections and on Mahayuti winning 175 seats.”On the matter of ideology, Ajit asked how Shiv Sena had allied with Congress and NCP for 2.5 years during MVA rule. “When we were told to work with them, we did.” He subsequently said, “Don’t ask about ideology. Maharashtra’s politics has changed. Everyone wants power and has kept ideology aside. They want to form and run a govt.”He denied that charges of corruption made against him had anything to do with him going with BJP. “Allegations were made in 2009 and I went with BJP in 2023,” he said. He further said he was cleared in cases because there was no evidence against him at all. “If I had been guilty, there would have been action against me,” he said.Ajit went back to Sharad Pawar after the swearing-in in 2019 as he could get the support of only a few NCP MLAs, with most party legislators sticking to Pawar Senior. Later in 2023, he carried a majority of the party’s legislators with him when he joined the Eknath Shinde-led Mahayuti govt.Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) functionaries reacted sharply to Ajit Pawar’s revelation about industrialist Gautam Adani being part of BJP-NCP talks in 2019, saying it was proof the Maharashtra govt was “Adani sarkar.” Gautam Adani was not available for comment.Mumbai Congress president and MP Varsha Gaikwad said information had “come from the horse’s mouth” now. In a post on X, she said, “What was Gautam Adani’s locus standi, why was he sitting in the meetings regarding the formation of govt? I reiterate, MVA govt was destabilised only for Adani, so that he could get Dharavi and any other projects he wanted. This is why we say, this is not Maharashtra sarkar, but Adani sarkar. Now, the truth is there for everyone to see.”UBT Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Priyanka Chaturvedi stated in a post, “As per Ajit Pawarji, this meeting was in 2019 when Devendra Fadnavis became the shortest duration chief minister in a very early morning ceremony… Adani sarkar for a reason. As per the interview given to a digital platform by a senior minister, Gautam Adani sat through in meetings to decide how to get BJP to power in the state by trying to fix unlikely alliances, it raises some serious questions. Is he a BJP authorised negotiator, has he been given the responsibility to fix alliances, why is a businessmen so keenly and closely working to bring BJP to power at any cost in Maharashtra?..Bol Dharavi Bol.”BJP did not comment but in the past, Fadnavis has said Sharad Pawar has had a series of meetings with BJP between 2017 and 2019.",NCP chief Ajit Pawar says industrialist Gautam Adani was part of political talks between BJP and undivided Sharad Pawar-led NCP five years ago.

MUMBAI: NCP candidate from Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar , Nawab Malik , said on Tuesday that the anti-conversion law mooted in BJP’s manifesto for Maharashtra is just being used to misguide people and his party will not join a govt with the saffron party “if it does politics on divisive and disputed issues”. Malik also did not rule out NCP joining hands with the opposition MVA in the event of a hung assembly.Though NCP is part of Mahayuti , BJP, the seniormost partner in the governing alliance, is backing Shinde Sena’s Suresh Patil in Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar.Stressing that if Mahayuti gets a majority, the govt will not be formed on BJP’s policies alone but on a Common Minimum Programme, Malik told TOI in an interview: “BJP will have to leave out some issues.”When asked about UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s ‘Batenge toh Katenge’ call, which is seen as anti-Muslim, Malik said: “I condemn this slogan. Religion based on politics is short-lived.” On BJP’s promise to bring anti-conversion law, Malik said: “Right to religion is a fundamental right and conversion cannot be stopped. BJP is playing with words to misguide people.”Malik said NCP chief Ajit Pawar will get enough seats to become a ‘kingmaker’ and dictate terms. “It’s possible that there will be a situation like 1999 when neither side has absolute majority.”When asked whether NCP could back MVA in a post-poll scenario, he said: “Anything is possible. Anyone can go with anyone.”",Nawab Malik says anti-conversion law mooted in BJP's manifesto is just being used to misguide people.

PUNE/NAGPUR: Congress continues to speak Pakistan’s language on J&K and the only way to permanently defeat such “anti-India forces” is to replicate the Haryana poll verdict in Maharashtra, PM Narendra Modi said Tuesday while campaigning for BJP in Pune.“Congress and its allies are trying to restore the provision (Article 370) that promoted terrorism and separatism in J&K,” he said. “They (Congress) are displaying a copy of the Constitution at every rally. I want to ask why they couldn’t implement the same Constitution in the entire country when they were in govt for several decades.”Modi accused Congress’s leadership of being “slaves” to a colonial mindset. “Maharashtra is the land of Shivaji Maharaj, but Congress prefers to praise Aurangzeb. Its figureheads curse Veer Savarkar. I challenge yuvraj (Rahul Gandhi) to hail Veer Savarkar and Balasaheb Thackeray in his speeches.”The PM branded Congress “a party devoid of integrity, only involved in appeasement politics”. “It is only interested in being in govt and, in to achieve that, it is dividing society based on caste,” he said.Modi alleged that the Congress govt in Karnataka was funding the party’s Maharashtra campaign. “Congress made tall promises and formed the govt in Karnataka, but now they are looting the people there. A part of that loot is being sent to Maharashtra for the elections.”At Chimur, Modi spoke of Congress’s “historical bias” against reservation and tribals. In Solapur, Modi described the opposition MVA as an alliance “trying to ride a vehicle with no wheels or brakes”. “It is quite clear that MVA cannot give a stable govt,” he said.","Modi accuses Congress’s leadership of being “slaves” to a colonial mindset. “Maharashtra is the land of Shivaji Maharaj, but Congress prefers to praise Aurangzeb.

Delhi's Air Quality Crisis: GRAP-II Continues with 'Very Poor' AQI Levels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhis-air-quality-crisis-grap-ii-continues-with-very-poor-aqi-levels/articleshow/115190484.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi environment department has identified 57 significant pollution sources across 13 hotspots in the city that are receiving priority attention this winter season.According to officials, they successfully addressed 10 major pollution sources in the previous year.An analysis by Delhi Pollution Control Committee has revealed that after GRAP Stage-II came into force on Oct 22, the average AQI has remained in the upper end of the 'very poor' range across most of the 13 identified pollution hotspots . From Oct 22 to Nov 11, data showed Anand Vihar registering the highest average AQI of 394, with Jahangirpuri following at 376.During a review meeting on air pollution held by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Nov 8, Delhi environment department said that out of 57 sources, the highest were identified at Mundka and Anand Vihar, which was seven each.A senior official said a fresh mapping of sources was done ahead of this winter, along with a survey on the old sources existing at the hotspots. ""We have revised the sources at each hotspot. The new sources have been shared with agencies concerned... to resolve the issues soon,"" the official said.At Anand Vihar, the pollution sources include a damaged road at the bus station, congestion on Chaudhary Charan Singh Marg, a construction site, a broken divider under the foot overbridge and roadside dust. Jahangirpuri's five major pollution sources are biomass burning, heavy congestion and road dust, Bhalswa sanitary landfill, a construction site and an unpaved road, construction and demolition plant, and DMRC casting plant.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director for research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said: ""It is important to take hyperlocal action at hotspots....

The Perfect Pet Match for Each Zodiac Sign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/zodiacs-astrology/the-perfect-pet-match-for-each-zodiac-sign/articleshow/115139758.cms,"When it comes to finding the ideal pet, each zodiac sign has a unique energy that aligns perfectly with certain animals. From the adventurous Aries to the peace-loving Pisces, every sign has a pet companion that can match its vibe and keep its spirits high.Aries, with its endless energy and passion for adventure, finds a loyal partner in an active dog breed, like a Border Collie or Jack Russell Terrier. This dynamic duo is always on the move, ready for hikes, runs, and playtime galore. Taurus, the comfort-seeker, pairs wonderfully with a cat, especially one with a calm and loving temperament. A Taurus and their feline friend can easily spend hours lounging together, basking in the good life.Gemini’s quick-witted personality is perfectly matched with a parrot. These chatty birds keep Gemini entertained with their ability to mimic sounds and engage in playful banter. Meanwhile, Cancer, the nurturer of the zodiac, feels a deep connection with rabbits. Soft, gentle, and a bit shy, rabbits complement Cancer’s caring and protective nature, creating a bond that’s truly heartwarming.Leo , the showstopper, needs a pet that loves attention as much as it does. An exotic pet, like a colorful fish in a grand aquarium, suits Leo’s flair for the dramatic, bringing beauty and a bit of spectacle into their space. Virgos, who appreciate structure and intelligence, resonate well with a well-trained dog breed, like a Labrador or German Shepherd. Loyal and easy to train, these pets offer companionship and a sense of order.Libra’s love for harmony makes a gentle, low-maintenance pet like a guinea pig an ideal choice. Calm and social, guinea pigs align with Libra’s need for peace and balanced vibes. Scorpios, known for their mystery, feel an affinity for reptiles, especially snakes. A snake’s reserved nature and unique charm mirror Scorpio’s depth and fascination with the unconventional.Sagittarius, the adventurer, finds joy in having a pet with an adventurous spirit, like a horse. There’s nothing quite like the freedom of riding, and Sagittarians thrive with a pet that can join them on explorations. Capricorn’s practical nature is a great match for a fish tank, especially with low-maintenance fish that create a serene environment without demanding too much attention.Aquarius, always drawn to the unique, connects well with exotic pets, like a ferret. Ferrets are quirky, intelligent, and enjoy a good play session, making them the ideal buddies for the zodiac’s free spirits. Finally, Pisces, the dreamer, feels right at home with a pet that exudes calmness, like a betta fish. The peaceful movements of a betta in a beautifully decorated tank resonate with Pisces' gentle and imaginative soul.Each sign finds something unique in their perfect pet companion, a little mirror of themselves in animal form.","Aries, with its endless energy and passion for adventure, finds a loyal partner in an active dog breed.

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for first phase of voting on 43 assembly seats in Jharkhand spread over 15 districts. The Phase 1 of elections in the state on Wednesday will decide the fate of several key leaders, including former chief minister Champai Soren who is contesting on a BJP ticket after ending his over four decades of association with the JMM. Chief minister Hemant Soren is going all out to retain power and faces a stiff challenge from the BJP which is keen to regain power after 5 years. Both the ruling ruling JMM-led INDIA bloc and the BJP led a high-decibel often bitter campaign to woo voters, especially tribals who hold the key in several seats.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who has anchored BJP's campaign in the state, has made Bangladeshi infiltration a key poll issue. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, all senior BJP leaders have attacked the Hemant Soren government for encouraging infiltration for political gains. Hemant Soren, with the help of Congress's top leadership, has countered BJP's offensive by accusing the saffron party of spreading the poison of communalism in the state.The BJP, which has ruled the state longest since it was carved off from Bihar in 2000, was voted out of power in 2019 as it could win only 25 of the 81 seats in Jharkhand assembly. The JMM, led by chief minister Hemant Soren, won 30 seats five years back and emerged as the single largest party. It joined hands with the Congress (16 seats) and Lalu Prasad's RJD, which had one seat, to lead a coalition government for five years. Hemant Soren, who had to quit the top post briefly after his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate in an alleged corruption case, returned on time to lead the INDIA bloc campaign and is confident that people of the state will give him another term.1.

If they call my OBC community dogs, I said I would turn BJP into a dog as well.

She was in the BJP all her life and now she went to another party. Imported 'maal' doesn't work here; only original 'maal' does.""

Dick served as a lieutenant at Seringapatam in the 75th Highland Regiment of Foot. The regiment formed part of the storming party at the battle, their objective to breach the walls by use of ladders. Lt Dick is therefore likely to have been amongst the first of the British forces to enter the city, and it was his regiment that assisted with the search for Tipu’s body after the battle.A silver-hilt Seringapatam medal belonging to Peter Cherry, who was present at the siege in the capacity of paymaster, which depicts a “British lion overcoming the tiger”, sold for £23,040 (Rs 24 lakh).A report on the secret alliance between Tipu Sultan and the nawabs of the Carnatic, signed by N B Edmonstone, Persian translator to govt of Bengal, dated April 6, 1800, sold for £35,840 (Rs 38.6 lakh).The Edmonstone document is a manuscript copy of the report to the govt of Bengal on the cache of correspondence between Tipu Sultan and his ministers which was found at Seringapatam after the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and is believed to reveal a secret alliance between Tipu Sultan and two successive nawabs of the Carnatic, Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah and Umdat al-Umara, who were notionally allied with the British. The findings were used to compel Umdat al-Umara's successor, Azim ud-Daul, to sign the Carnatic Treaty , one of the treaties by which the British Empire acquired its rule over the Indian subcontinent.",The sword has an unbroken provenance taking it back to the 1799 battle in which Tipu Sultan met his end.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Enforcement Directorate went after a group of land grabbers in Chennai that had encroached upon a plot worth Rs 13 crore in Saidapet area, and restituted it to its owner, a significant development in the face of several such cases of usurpation taking several decades to be disposed of and many remaining unresolved.These land grabbers had sold the encroached property to a third party by forging documents and fraudulently claiming ownership. Though an FIR was registered in the case by the Chennai Police in 2009, not much progress was made.Subsequently, in 2017, ED registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), attached the property, traced the money trail to establish proceeds of crime, filed a chargesheet, and with court permission, restituted the land to its owner.“The current value of the property stands at Rs 12.7 crore and its restitution to the rightful claimant and victim marks a significant step in ED’s ongoing efforts to ensure that the proceeds of crime are returned to those affected,” the agency said on Monday.ED is investigating a number of land grab cases in different parts of the country and is in the process of restoring them to their rightful owners. The restitution of assets and money to individual victims of scams started with the disbursement of nearly Rs 12 crore of attached fixed deposits (FDs) of the Rose Valley group of companies in Kolkata to around 22 lakh small depositors, who had filed their claims before a court-monitored committee.In Aug, ED restituted at least 78 flats worth more than Rs 20 crore to homebuyers of SRS group’s SRS Pearl, SRS City and SRS Prime in Gurgaon. This was just the beginning as the agency has attached properties worth Rs 2,215 crore of SRS group... The restitution process began following a directive from SC and the Punjab and Haryana HC.In another case, the agency has allowed the sale and refund of Rs 185 crore worth of attached property of Jammu-based Surya Pharmaceuticals to SBI in a money laundering case against the company and its directors.","In a first, Enforcement Directorate went after a group of land grabbers in Chennai.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Police on Tuesday arrested a 24- year-old man for sending threat messages to Bollywood actor Salman Khan , according to news agency PTI. This arrest follows a series of threatening messages received by the actor in recent weeks.Last Thursday, Bollywood star Salman Khan received a death threat from the Lawrence Bishnoi gang , delivered via a message sent to the Mumbai Traffic Control Room in Worli. The message referenced the songwriter of ""Main Sikandar Houn"" and demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore from Khan, allegedly on behalf of the gang.Previously, on October 24, Mumbai Police had apprehended a man in Jamshedpur for issuing threats to Salman Khan in Lawrence Bishnoi's name. Following this series of threats and an earlier shooting incident in April, Khan’s security was elevated to Y+ level.The shooting occurred on April 14 outside Salman Khan's Galaxy Apartments residence in Bandra, Mumbai. Subsequent investigations linked the incident to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, prompting police to apply the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) to those involved.Law enforcement agencies also revealed that Lawrence Bishnoi’s brother, Anmol Bishnoi, played a key role by encouraging the attackers. Anmol reportedly delivered weapons to the shooters in Panvel on March 15, 2024, and provided them with details about the target, directing them to carry out the attack at Khan's residence.","Mumbai Police arrest a 24-year-old man for sending threat messages to Bollywood actor Salman Khan.

This set off an investigation by the local police. Local cops, seemingly unaware of Dalla’s antecedents, soon found out the truth. By the time Royal Canadian Mounted Police , Canada’s federal police which ought to have been aware of India’s interest in Dalla because of his involvement in serious crimes, had been alerted, local cops had already requested his three-day remand, besides carrying out a search-and-seizure operation at his home. He was held at Oakville police station pending bail. Dalla and his aide will be produced in a local court on Wednesday.According to the case file, the duo arrived at Guelph Hospital around 4am on Oct 28. The hospital informed the police around 4.17am about a man with a gunshot wound. Dalla and Singh arrived at the hospital in a Dodge Durango SUV. They told police that while driving on Guelph Line, north of Highway 401 in Milton, Region of Halton, an unknown vehicle drew up beside their SUV and several shots were fired into their vehicle, resulting in the gunshot wound to Dalla.Dalla had a non-life threatening gunshot wound to his right bicep, which was treated by hospital staff.“...Dalla and Singh were arrested for the offence of discharging a firearm with intent. Both were cautioned, given rights to counsel, and transported to central lock-up at Oakville police station. The accused’s clothing and phones were seized by police. Both accused were held in custody pending a bail hearing. The police sought their remand for three days,” the case file said.","Arshdeep Singh Gill, alias Arsh Dalla, was arrested in Canada following a mysterious shooting incident that left him injured in the arm.

Jharkhand elections: How rebels-turned-Independents may play the spoilsport in some key seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-elections-how-rebels-turned-independents-may-play-the-spoilsport-in-some-key-seats/articleshow/115226618.cms,"Also See:

NEW DELHI: Raghubar Das , governor of Odisha and former chief minister of Jharkhand, is neither contesting the 2024 assembly elections nor is a part of the election campaign, but when voters of the state go out to cast their ballot tomorrow he will be keeping his fingers crossed.Raghubar's daughter-in-law Purnima Das Sahu is the BJP candidate from Jamshedpur East assembly seat against Congress 's Ajoy Kumar. However, despite the high-profile candidature, her road to the state assembly has been made difficult by the presence of a BJP rebel Shiv Shankar Singh, who has resigned from party's primary membership accusing the saffron party of promoting dynasty politics and is contesting as an Independent.55-year-old Singh, who has an RSS background, voiced strong opposition to the BJP's decision to field Purnima from Jamshedpur East. He also pointed to several family members of influential figures who had been given tickets in the state, such as Meera Munda (wife of former Union minister and former Jharkhand CM Arjun Munda) from Potka and Babulal Soren (son of ex-CM Champai Soren) from Ghatsila.""How can the BJP criticise 'Pariwarvad' when they are practicing it themselves?"" Singh asked, adding that the party had no right to speak against it.Like Jamshedpur East, several other seats of the state may also see a three-cornered contest with parties failing to convince the rebels to withdraw from the race. As parties gear up for the battle of ballots, they are wary of rebels-turned Independents impacting the prospects of their official candidates.The state BJP has expelled 30 leaders from the party for contesting as Independent candidates against party nominees in various assembly seats. While not all of them may be in a position to impact the outcome, but they could damage the prospects of official candidates in seats where there is a close contest. The saffron party has already lost several leaders in the run up to the polls with many of those who were denied tickets quitting the party.The ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morch (JMM) also faces the problem of rebels, though not to the extent of the BJP. Several JMM leaders have also turned rebels and pose a challenge to the official candidates.Meanwhile, the Congress, which suffered a shock defeat in Haryana assembly elections by ignoring the threat posed by Independents, faces relatively less pressure on this front as it is the junior partner in the ruling coalition.AICC Jharkhand in-charge Ghulam Ahmad Mir interestingly admitted to the Haryana fiasco as he asserted there was no factionalism in the state unit like in Haryana and all decisions in the run up to the elections were taken by consensus among senior leaders.The Congress general secretary also claimed that there was ""pro-incumbency"" in favour of Jharkhand's INDIA bloc government which was moving forward under the leadership of Hemant Soren, while the BJP had ""headless voices"" with no one projected to lead the state.(With agency inputs)",Raghubar Das is neither contesting the 2024 assembly elections nor is a part of the election campaign.

NAGPUR/AMARAVATI: Rallying voters at RSS ’ Smruti Mandir in Reshimbagh here, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath appealed to citizens to give a decisive mandate to BJP, while emphasising the symbolic and strategic importance of Nagpur for BJP and the Sangh. Adityanath urged people to secure a victory strong enough to forfeit deposits of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidates.Launching a blistering attack on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , he said, “Instead of being angry with me, Kharge ji, direct your anger towards the Nizam. Under Nizam’s tyrannical rule, mothers and sisters faced widespread atrocities. You are attacking me because you can’t attack Razakars who burnt down your house and killed your family, for fear of losing votes. The Razakars burnt and killed Kharge ji’s mother, uncle and sister. Why does Congress hide this truth? Were historical injustices suppressed for vote-bank politics? Shouldn’t people know this reality now?” he asked.Using Reshimbagh as an electoral vantage point, he rallied people across the city and outskirts to vote for Chandrashekhar Bawankule (Kamptee), Pravin Datke from Nagpur Central, where RSS Bhavan is situated, and Mohan Mate for Nagpur South. Adityanath praised the “double-engine” BJP govt, referring to the alliance between the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre and Mahayuti govt in Maharashtra, as a partnership that benefits the state and nation. Highlighting the state’s historical legacy, he praised Maharashtra’s contribution to the nation, referencing figures like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who gave India a unified identity. The UP CM further invoked Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, stating Maharashtra and Nagpur are lands with deep national significance, adding “Who in India would not honour these figures with gratitude?”Earlier, addressing a crowded rally at Achalpur in Amravati district, he warned against division of Hindu votes. Reflecting upon the Lok Sabha loss in Amravati, he said this harmed Hindu pride and urging voters to support Mahayuti candidates Pravin Tayade (Achalpur), Kewalram Kale (Melghat), and Umesh Yawalkar (Morshi). “If Hindu votes split again, the community will once again face humiliation,” he cautioned, adding that a united vote would uphold Hindu dignity across Maharashtra.Criticizing MVA as a ‘Mahaanadi’ or ‘illiterate’ alliance, Adityanath accused it of turning Maharashtra into a “laboratory for dividing Hindu votes” and warned of cultural disruption that could impact the future of Hinduism. “A clear mandate for Mahayuti is essential to preserving Maharashtra’s legacy as a land of unity and pride for Hindus,” he said.In Nagpur, Adityanath turned his attention to national security and Congress’ alleged failures, claiming India became safer under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. “Before 2014, Pakistan would launch terror attacks here. Today, this new India knows how to protect its borders and deal with terrorism, especially in Kashmir,” he said.He criticised Congress' approach to national security and accused them of compromising for political gain. “They compromised the security of the country for vote-bank politics. It didn’t want to scrap Article 370 because it wanted to secure votes in Kashmir rather than uphold Dr Ambedkar’s vision for India,” he argued.Referencing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Adityanath said, “After 500 years, Ram Lala’s presence in Ayodhya is a reality. Congress even questioned the existence of Ram and Krishna.”","Yogi Adityanath urged people to secure a victory strong enough to forfeit deposits of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidates.

Must be ready for grey zone and hybrid warfare: Rajnath Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/must-be-ready-for-grey-zone-and-hybrid-warfare-rajnath-singh/articleshow/115232096.cms,"Defence minister Rajnath Singh

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh Tuesday said India needs to be prepared for adaptive defence and its strike forces should be ready for ‘grey zone’ and ‘hybrid’ warfare where traditional ways to defend have been challenged.Speaking at inaugural Delhi Defence Dialogue on the theme ‘Adaptive Defence: Navigating the Changing Landscape of Modern Warfare ’, organised by Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Singh stressed on continuous adaptation by defence forces to deal with emerging challenges. The terms ‘grey zone’ and ‘hybrid warfare’ refer to conflicts between peace and full-scale military battles.From traditional border-related threats, the challenges have shifted to unconventional warfare such as terrorism , cyber attacks and hybrid warfare. “Govt recognised the need for an adaptive defence strategy in a changing geopolitical and technological scenario, and has taken several initiatives to build a robust and self-reliant ecosystem,” he said.This includes establishing the institution of Chief of Defence Staff , promoting jointness among the three services, improvising the training curriculum and forging new defence partnerships around the world, he added.Singh described ‘adaptive defence’ as not merely a strategic choice but a necessity. “As the threats to our nation have evolved, so too must our defence systems and strategies. We should be prepared for all future contingencies. It is more than just protecting our borders; it is about securing our future,” he said.He stressed the need for the nation’s military and defence mechanisms to continuously evolve to effectively counter emerging threats. “Adaptive defence is not merely responding to what has happened but anticipating what could happen, and preparing for it proactively. In essence, it involves cultivating a mindset and capability to adapt, innovate and thrive, even in the face of unpredictable and evolving circumstances,” he said.Singh said in the present age of digitisation and information overload, the world is facing an unprecedented scale of psychological warfare. There is a need for employing adaptive defence strategies to counter the menace of information warfare, he said.“India is aiming to become a drone hub of the world as drone and swarm technologies are bringing fundamental changes in modern warfare. We are working to improve R&D through reliable certification mechanisms, and facilitate Indian intellectual property creation in this sector,” he said.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said India needs to be prepared for adaptive defence.

Hundreds fall victim to Goa cash-for-job scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hundreds-fall-victim-to-goa-cash-for-job-scam/articleshow/115231886.cms,"Goa CM Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Hundreds of Goans have been duped of crores of rupees in a cash-for-jobs scam. Goa police have so far registered 20 cases across state — including 12 in North Goa district and eight in South Goa district — and arrested 19 people for promising to secure govt jobs in exchange for cash. The scam also saw a govt employee taking his life after his name figured in the case.Over the past few weeks, a new case has been registered almost every day, with a maximum of three FIRs each at Ponda, Agassaim and Bicholim police stations.Among those arrested include police personnel, senior govt officers, teachers and other persons claiming to have strong political links. The accused in different cases assured jobs in various state departments including public works, water resources, education, transport, revenue, police and health.The scam came to light last month when Goa police registered a case against one Pooja Naik for duping several people across state of crores of rupees by promising them govt job. Soon after Naik’s arrest, Goa CM Pramod Sawant warned politicians and govt employees of strict action in case of their involvement in the scam. Sawant also requested citizens to file complaints if they had paid to secure a govt job. “Govt jobs are not for sale,” the CM had said.Modus operandi in each case has been different. Naik, for instance, had allegedly told some acquaintances that since she worked at office of a regional political party in Panaji, she could obtain govt jobs for a certain consideration via senior govt officials in transport and public works departments.The latest on the long list of people arrested is a Porvorim resident, Shruti Prabhugaonkar, who claimed that she is BJP mahila block president for Nuvem constituency in South Goa. Though BJP accepted her association with the party, it was quick to add that she was not part of the party “today”.After Shruti’s arrest Tuesday, CM Sawant, without naming anyone, said: “BJP has five lakh general members. Even former party members, if found involved (in the job scam), will not be spared. That (person) was arrested.”In a stern message, the CM also said govt will seize and attach properties of those involved in cash-for-jobs scam and ensure victims get their money back. “ We will not stop just by filing cases. Property will be seized and attached. To ensure that money is returned, we will follow up every case till the end. We will ensure that the victims get their money back,” he said.Investigations revealed that victims were either known to the accused or have relatives who have been hunting for permanent govt jobs. Accused were using the money to pursue plush lifestyles of their own by purchasing gold ornaments and high-end cars.The scam also saw a 51-year-old attendant at OBC Corporation, Shridhar Kerkar, die by suicide after his name figured in the case. Shridhar had been missing from his house since Oct 30, a day after Naik and her accomplice, Ajit Shashikant Satarkar (49), were released on bail.Congress demanded a special probe but BJP maintained that it was its govt that unearthed the scam.","Goa police have so far registered 20 cases across state and arrested 19 people.

NEW DELHI: Any food item that is delivered online should have a minimum shelf life of 30% or 45 days before expiry at the time of delivery, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has said.For example, if a packet of butter has a shelf life of 10 days, it should have a minimum three days’ shelf life left when it is delivered to the customer by an e-commerce platform.In cases of food items that have longer shelf life, say three or six months, the FSSAI says, a minimum 45 days of shelf life should be there at the time of delivery of the item to the customer.The apex body for regulating food business in the country held a meeting of e-commerce food business operators on Tuesday where this mandate was highlighted and reiterated, sources said.“There have been complaints in the recent past that food items had negligible shelf life at the time of delivery. That’s why we have reiterated to the e-commerce Food Business Operators (FBOs) to adopt practices to ensure minimum shelf life of 30 percent or 45 days before expiry at the time of delivery to the consumer,” said an official.According to sources, Ganji Kamala V Rao, the CEO of FSSAI also cautioned the FBOs against making unsupported claims online in the meeting. He reiterated the mandate that no FBO can operate on any e-commerce platform without a valid FSSAI license or registration, emphasising the critical need for regulatory compliance.Further, Rao clarified that any product claims made on e-commerce platforms must align with the information provided on the product labels and in adherence to FSSAI’s Labelling and Display Regulations.Additionally, he emphasised the importance of delivering food items and non-food items separately to the consumers to avoid potential contamination.",The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has said food items delivered online should have a minimum shelf life of 30% or 45 days before expiry at the time of delivery.

SRINAGAR: Nine daysafter being injured in a blast from a grenade hurled by terrorists in a buzzing roadside Sunday flea market in Srinagar, a 45-year-old woman succumbed Tuesday to her wounds in a hospital here.Bandipora’s Abida was among the swarming throngs at the market near the heavily fortified Tourist Reception Centre (TRC) in central Srinagar, shopping for winter clothes for her three kids when the attack took place on Nov 3, injuring her and 11 others.Three militants of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) were arrested last week for allegedly hurling the grenade towards a CRPF mobile bunker. The grenade missed the target and landed on the road abuzz with people in the market.The attack occurred a day after the killing of a Pakistani LeT commander by security forces in Srinagar and a day before the J&K assembly was scheduled to begin a five-day session. In March 2022, a grenade attack at the same spot had left two people dead and 30 wounded.Sunday’s flea market typically draws large crowds from neighbouring districts for its affordable household items and winter clothing, making it a soft target for such attacks.Back in Naidkhai area of Bandipora’s Sumbal, home to Abida and husband Zubair Ahmad Lone, everyone’s eyes were moist Tuesday looking at their three children: a six-year-old daughter and two sons, one seven and the other five.“Why are so many people coming to our house,” the seven-year-old son asked his uncle, who struggled for an answer. The kids were unaware of the tragedy that had struck the family. “My mummy has gone to the Sunday market to buy clothes for me and my younger brother and sister. She promised me a blue jacket and long boots for winter,” the son said.A little later, some relatives took the kids away from their single-storey house to spare the children the trauma of seeing their mother’s body.",Bandipora’s Abida was among the swarming throngs at the market near the heavily fortified Tourist Reception Centre.

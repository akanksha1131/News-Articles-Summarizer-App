What happened so far

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday expressed willingness to hold talks ""for peace"" with India, even as tensions remained high following a recent spell of military confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.""We are ready to talk with it for peace,"" Shehbaz said during a visit to the Kamra air base in Pakistan's Punjab province.Top leaders and military officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Army Chief Gen Asim Munir, and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu accompanied him.There, he met with officers and soldiers involved in the recent confrontation with India.However, Sharif reiterated that the ""conditions for peace"" must include addressing the long-standing Kashmir issue India has always maintained that the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are ""integral and inalienable parts"" of it.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said that the only issue which remains to be discussed on Kashmir is return of part of J&K that is under the illegal occupation of Pakistan (PoK).""We are open to discussing that (return of PoK) with Pakistan. So I want you to spell out our positions very clearly. The government's position is very, very clear,"" he told media at the inauguration of the Honduras embassy.He added that India's relations and dealings with Pakistan will remain strictly bilateral with a focus on cross-border terrorism. Jaishankar further called upon Pakistan to hand over terrorists accused of attacking India.""That (bilateralism) has been a national consensus for years, and there is absolutely no change. The prime minister made it very clear that talks with Pakistan will be only on terror. Pakistan has a list of terrorists that needs to be handed over, and they have to shut down the terrorists’ infrastructure. They know what to do. We are prepared to discuss with them what is to be done about terrorism. Those are the talks which are feasible,"" said Jaishankar.This was Sharif's second visit to a defence facility following the understanding reached between India and Pakistan on May 10.To avenge the killings of 26 people in J&K's Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Under the operation, the armed forces targeted nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists.Pakistan then launched several missile and drone attacks on May 8, 9 and 10. Indian armed forces , in response, launched a fierce counter-attack on several Pakistani military installations, including Rafiqui, Murid, Chaklala, Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur and Chunian.","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday expressed willingness to hold talks ""for peace"" with India.

"Conflict to closet, Operation Sindoor sparks boom in patriotic merch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/conflict-to-closet-operation-sindoor-sparks-boom-in-patriotic-merch/articleshow/121198842.cms,"Operation Sindoor

After two sharp oneliners by Air Marshal A K Bharti lit up social media following the May 10 India-Pakistan ceasefire, Adi Arora, a 34-year-old entrepreneur based in Parwanoo, Himachal Pradesh, quickly turned them into T-shirts. One bears director general air operations Bharti’s now-iconic line, “Our job is to hit the target, not to count the body bags.”Another reads, “I don’t know what’s there in Kirana Hills,” Bharti’s deadpan reply to whether the Air Force had struck Pakistan’s nuclear site. A third design — now a bestseller — has the emblems of the armed forces with the tagline ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ on Arora’s company Kadak Merch ’s website.Operation Sindoor not only marked a bold shift in India’s counter-terrorism stance, it also led to a surge in commerce with many keen to wear patriotism on their sleeve. Or carry it on their arm in the form of tote bags. TOI reported that even sales of sindoor powder surged in Bhubaneswar. There was even a controversial trademark registration of Operation Sindoor but a PIL has been ﬁled against it.For Prasad Narayan Kamkar, a handloom cotton saree wholesaler from Belagavi, Karnataka, this offered an unexpected ‘rebranding’ opportunity. His stock of unsold red and maroon sarees is now being sold as ‘Sindoor sarees’. “What else can I do? Ever since the war broke out, my market has been bad. My shopkeeper clients in Jodhpur and Udaipur, near the border areas, were not taking orders or responding to my calls,” says Kamkar, whose sindoor range of sarees featured in local news as well. “Now, there are new sindoor sarees in check patterns in production,” he adds.Anish Agarwal, commercial pilot and founder of Kolkatabased Aero Armour which has been selling military-inspired apparel for the last ﬁve years, has gone a step further with his Sindoor T-shirts. “On the tees, we have mapped the sites where India struck,” he says. The brand has previously created collections around defence operations such as Kargil, Meghdoot and Black Tornado. Aero Armour’s ﬂagship Kargil Collection is even sold at the Kargil War Memorial in Drass.Upcoming designs for its Operation Sindoor collection will include aerial views of the strike zones and illustrations of defence equipment like the BrahMos missile and Rafale jet, alongside video podcasts with ex-servicemen on Instagram. “We will map Pakistan’s terror HQs like Bahawalpur and Muridke,” says Agarwal. But isn’t this using patriotic fervor for proﬁt? “Yes, we are criticised occasionally. But the forces themselves have appreciated our work. That matters more.”Arora from Kadak Merch insists he is not doing this to monetise war. “I believe merchandise is the best way for civilians to support the armed forces. We want to continue this and build a fund to donate to the Indian armed forces ,” he says. Kadak Merch’s Operation Sindoor range — designed in under an hour on May 12— is selling fast, he claims. “I have already sold more than 1,000 units. Orders are coming from all over India,” says Arora, whose company usually riffs on memes and pop culture trends for its merch.Ad guru Piyush Pandey says brands selling merchandise under names like Operation Sindoor is insensitive. “At the end of the day, however successful we were, we also lost people — ﬁrst in Pahalgam, and even after that. Don’t turn it into a business,” Pandey adds.Navin Israni of Mansa Sarees in Kolkata’s New Market area had a change of heart and withdraw his special edition crepe saree featuring the phrase ‘Mera Bharat Mahan’ in 21 Indian languages, with motifs like the Ashoka Chakra, Tricolour and peacock printed. “We had made 50 pieces for sale, but there were second thoughts in the family. Some pointed out, ‘Our army men are out there sacriﬁcing their lives, and you want to mint money out of it?’ That hit home,” says Israni, who has decided to donate the sarees instead.",Operation Sindoor marked a bold shift in India’s counter-terrorism stance.

Desi diaspora set to take $1.6 billion hit as US plans bill to tax remittances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desi-diaspora-set-to-take-1-6-billion-hit-as-us-plans-bill-to-tax-remittances/articleshow/121198369.cms,"A proposed US bill, dubbed 'The One Big Beautiful Bill,' threatens to impose a 5% remittance tax on non-US citizens, including H-1B and green card holders, sending money abroad. This could significantly impact the Indian diaspora, who remit approximately $32 billion annually to India. If enacted, Indians in the US could face a $1.

‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’ calls for tax equal to 5% of remittance amount

Its official title is — The One Big Beautiful Bill — but it contains a sting for lakhs of Indians in the US, be they non-immigrant visa holders (like H-1B) or green card holders. Once this bill is enacted, anyone who is not a US citizen and who remits money outside the country will have to pay a remittance tax of 5%.Lately, the US has emerged as the largest source country for remittances into India, attributed to both the size of Indian diaspora and their income levels in America. According to Indian foreign ministry, there are nearly 45 lakh overseas Indians in the US, including nearly 32 lakh PIOs.According to a remittance survey published by RBI in March, of the total remittances of $118.7 billion in 2023-24, nearly 28% or $32 billion were from the US. If this bill is enacted, even if we assume the remittance figure from the US to be constant, the Indian diaspora will end up paying $1.6 billion as remittance tax.The bill is the proposed tax plan released recently by the US House Ways and Means Committee. Tucked away in page 327 of the 389 page document is a section on remittances, which calls for a ‘tax equal to 5% of the amount of such transfer’. As no exemption threshold limit has been set, it would also impact transfers of small denominations. It adds that this shall not apply to any remittance-transfer where the remittance transfer provider is a ‘qualified remittance transfer provider’ and the sender is a ‘verified US sender’. The latter is then defined to mean a citizen or national of the US.In other words, if an H-1B holder or an L-1 (who is in US on an intra company transfer) or even a green card holder remits money to his family (say parents) in India, or remits money for the purpose of investments – say in Indian securities or real estate, the remittance will be subject to a 5% withholding by the transfer provider (say US bank).The House of Representatives aims to pass this bill in May itself and it will then move to the Senate. According to cross-border investment experts, the bill is likely to sail through and may be law by June-July. They are advising the Indian diaspora to try and remit larger funds in the coming weeks to escape the remittance tax.","The bill is the proposed tax plan released recently by the US House Ways and Means Committee.

US shipments major driver

NEW DELHI: India’s goods exports rose 9.1%, the fastest pace in six months, to $38.5 billion in April, while the trade deficit widened to $26.4 billion, the highest since last Nov. Latest data released by the commerce department pegged imports at $64.9 billion in April, which was 19% higher than the corresponding period last year.“We have opened this year with a bang… I hope India will maintain this export momentum and it should be a good year despite global uncertainties,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said.A part of the increase in exports may have been driven by front-loading of shipments to the US ahead of the deadline for reciprocal tariffs that kicked in on April 9, only to be paused for 90 days.Shipments to the US went up 27% to $8.4 billion, the latest numbers showed.Overall, electronics exports , a large part of which is through air cargo, shot up nearly 40% to $3.7 billion. Engineering goods, the largest item in India’s export basket, rose over 11% to $9.5 billion, while petroleum products (the second biggest group) were 4.7% higher at $7.4 billion.Some shipments into the country were also advanced, pushing up imports.“The merchandise trade deficit in April 2025 exceeded our expectations despite a healthy growth in exports, partly on account of a front-loading of crude oil imports amid softer prices, as well as a sharp increase in electronics,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA.Petroleum imports soared 25.6% to $20.7 billion, while chemical material more than doubled to $2 billion. Import consignments of metalliferous ores and other minerals zoomed 77% to go past the $1 billion mark in April and non-ferrous metal imports were 30% higher at $2.3 billion. Electronics shipments are estimated to have increased 31% to $9.5 billion.Gold imports were estimated to be 4.9% higher at $3.1 billion.China cemented its position as the top source of imports with a 27% increase to $9.9 billion in April, although Russia just about managed to stay at the second spot with overall shipments valued 18% higher at $6.2 billion. UAE, with an 89% jump, was just $540,000 short of Russia’s level. Imports from the US were also up 64% to $5.4 billion.","India's goods exports rose 9.1%, the fastest pace in six months, to $38.5 billion in April.

Won’t permit any challenge to 1995 Waqf Act: SC bench

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said it will on May 20 hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners who have challenged the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, only for the purpose of deciding the necessity and contours of any interim order required to be issued by the court.SG Tushar Mehta said govt has filed a comprehensive affidavit on the three issues flagged by the court in its April 17 order: nomination of non-Muslims to Central Waqf Council and boards, validity of waqf-by-user without valid documents, and the process for identification of govt land under waqf.Perturbed after seeing a number of senior advocates appearing for the Muslim parties and speaking in different voices, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih said if merely scheduling the hearing takes so much of time and if this there is so much confusion as to who all should be permitted to argue, then the hearing cannot commence.The bench asked lead counsel for the Muslim side, senior advocate Kapil Sibal , to coordinate with other counsels who are arguing against the amendments and file by Saturday a consolidated written submission on the need and shape of interim order. It asked Mehta to articulate his response and submissions by Monday.During the hearing, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said the court should allow him to argue a petition challenging the Waqf Act, 1995, as well as the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, both of which are discriminatory based on religion. The bench, however, asked, “How can you challenge the 1995 Act after 30 years?”Jain said the petition also challenges certain provisions of the new waqf law as it has not addressed the unequal situation created in favour of Muslims by the 1995 Act.The bench said, “Do not mix the issues. We will not consider any request for stay of any provision of the Waqf Act, 1995. Just because the Amendment Act, 2025 is challenged, no one can be allowed to jump in to challenge the 1995 legislation.”Sibal said the assurance of the Union govt through the solicitor general on certain aspects should continue till May 20. Mehta said it will continue till May 20.","Supreme Court will hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners on May 20.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday slammed MP minister Vijay Shah for his disparaging remarks aimed at Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, who had briefed the media along with foreign secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh on ‘Operation Sindoor’.When Shah’s counsel Vibha D Makhija sought urgent hearing of his petition questioning high court’s suo motu order directing registration of FIR against the minister, a bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice AG Masih asked whether such a comment behoves the constitutional post held by the petitioner.“When the country is going through a situation, he (Shah) should have been more careful in his speech. Persons holding constitutional office are expected to observe certain standards and exercise restraint in their public speeches,” the bench said.When Makhija sought stay of the HC order directing registration of FIR against Shah, the bench asked, “Why should he not approach the HC under Article 226 of the Constitution? Just because someone is a minister, should we entertain his petition under Article 32?”With persuasion, the bench agreed to list the petition for hearing on Monday but squarely refused to stay the HC order, saying nothing will happen between today and Monday. Makhija said the minister’s remarks were over-hyped by the media and that Shah has apologised publicly for remarks. In a video message on X, Shah had said he was “not only ashamed and saddened by my statement which has hurt the sentiments of every community but I also apologise from the bottom of my heart. Our country’s sister Sofiya Qureshi ji has worked rising above caste and society while fulfilling her national duty”.",Supreme Court slams MP minister Vijay Shah for his disparaging remarks aimed at Colonel Sofiya Qureshi.

US military strategist slams Trump admin for not blocking IMF aid to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-military-strategist-slams-trump-admin-for-not-blocking-imf-aid-to-pak/articleshow/121196427.cms,"US President Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: Michael Rubin, a military strategist with a conservative-leaning US think tank, American Enterprise Institute, has faulted the Trump administration for facilitating a $1 billion IMF bailout package to Pakistan, particularly at a time when the latter is seen as sponsoring terrorists’ as a state policy.“By sending money to Pakistan, the IMF is also effectively bailing out China. Pakistan is today a satrapy of China, its Gwadar port was the original pearl on China’s string, and its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has put Islamabad $40 billion in the red,” said Rubin, who taught at the Naval Postgraduate School till 2021.Rubin joined other international American security experts in asserting that India scored a victory in the four-day limited conflict with Pakistan, calling out the latter’s bluff on inflicting a cost on New Delhi. Instead, he said, it was Islamabad that “went running like a scared dog with its tail between its legs” to achieve a ceasefire.“There is absolutely no spin Pak military can put on what occurred to shield themselves from the full reality of the fact that they not only lost, but they lost very, very badly,” Rubin says in a video comment, dismantling the propaganda peddled by Islamabad, still smarting from a complete defeat under Indian attack on its crucial air bases and critical military installations.In an Op-Ed on Wednesday, Rubin blasted US for not blocking IMF releasing a $1 billion bailout package to Pakistan, one of the “world’s most corrupt countries”. He further says that the IMF move came after Pak-based terrorists infiltrated India and executed non-Muslims in front of their families.The military strategist said that to release $1 billion to a terror-addled, pro-China regime at a time the White House has been seeking to de-escalate tensions between two nuclear states was not just about Pakistan; it was about the IMF thumbing its nose at President Donald Trump.","Michael Rubin, a military strategist with a conservative-leaning US think tank, American Enterprise Institute, has faulted the Trump administration for facilitating a $1 billion IMF bailout package to Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday decided to continue their confidence building measures (CBMs) to gradually reduce the high alertness levels between the rival militaries ranged against each other on the Line of Control as well as the international boundary on the western front.After Indian director-general of military operations Lt General Rajiv Ghai and his Pakistani counterpart Major General Kashif Abdullah reached the understanding on May 10 to cease cross-border hostilities , the CBMs are being strengthened to ensure neither side “fires or initiates any aggressive and inimical action”, an officer said.Follow live updates: Islamabad says Pakistan and India agree ceasefire until Sunday Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar told the media that the Pakistan Army had agreed to extend the ceasefire with India till Sunday during a phone call between the two DGMOs on Thursday. There was, however, no clarification from the Indian Army on this.India has repeatedly stressed that Operation Sindoor has only been “paused” and the armed forces are maintaining full operational readiness to respond to any misadventure from Pakistan.Also read: Operation Sindoor: India and Pakistan agree to continue confidence-building measures, reduce alertness levels India had earlier asked Pakistan to desist from any further aggressive action along the western front and reduce the number of its troops and heavy weapon systems mobilised in forward locations.Both sides had agreed to consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas during the May 10 understanding.

"‘Khet mein tank, jeet ka prank’: Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif ridiculed for airbase visit after PM Modi’s Adampur tour, netizens call it ‘TikTok war PR stunt’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khet-mein-tank-jeet-ka-prank-pakistans-shehbaz-sharif-ridiculed-for-airbase-visit-after-pm-modis-adampur-tour-netizens-call-it-tiktok-war-pr-stunt/articleshow/121188249.cms,"NEW DELHI: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Adampur airbase in Punjab to boost troop morale following India's decisive Operation Sindoor , Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif attempted a similar show of support by visiting troops at the Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot. However, Sharif's move was widely mocked and criticised as an unsuccessful attempt to match PM Modi's leadership display.He visited Pasrur and Sialkot airbases (or what’s left of them) to declare an alleged “victory” under the theatrically named “Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos.”But the Pakistani PR attempt backfired. Social media exploded with memes, calling Sharif a “copycat,” mocking the barren backdrop of his speech from atop a tank, and asking whether he was addressing soldiers or scarecrows on a field.“Shehbaz Sharif’s obsession with India is unreal. Modi visits a real airbase, Shehbaz rushes to a random farm like: ‘Look! No damage here!’ From PM to PR clown, Shehbaz is the only leader who treats national security like a TikTok trend,” one user posted.In the viral video of his visit, flanked by Pakistan army chief general Asim Munir and what appeared to be borrowed tanks, Sharif boldly claimed Pakistan had “defeated India,” framing it as revenge for 1971. That’s when the memes really took off.“War khud hi announce karo, khud hi jeet jao, aur khud hi tali bhi baja lo, kya baat hai Pakistan!” a user joked.“PM Shehbaz Sharif: ‘We have won the war.’ Meanwhile, even their GPS can't find the airstrip,” quipped another.While PM Modi walked shoulder-to-shoulder with IAF personnel and was pictured beside S-400 systems and MiG-29 fighters, Sharif’s visuals featured him standing solo atop a tank in what users called a “crop field.” No runway, no radar, no aircraft — just dusty ground and declarations.“Picture of Shehbaz Sharif from Kirana Hills,” mocked one user, referencing unverified reports of a nuclear radiation leak in the region — which India has denied striking.“They will do everything India does, even if they don’t have the resources,” another added.The trolling continued with users dubbing the Pakistani leader as “PR Minister” and drawing parallels with Bollywood and sitcom characters. Clips from Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, Gangs of Wasseypur, and Welcome were edited to mock the speech.“Udit Bhai feat,” wrote a user, referencing the viral “Welcome” meme.“Modi to Shehbaz Sharif,” another captioned a Gangs of Wasseypur clip showing a character laughing uncontrollably.The Pakistani PMO posted filtered photos of Sharif with troops but conspicuously avoided any shots of runways or airstrips, a fact not lost on online commentators, many of whom believe this confirms the heavy damage inflicted by India during Operation Sindoor.India has denied Pakistan’s counter-claims of downing jets or damaging airbases. PM Modi’s landing in a Hercules aircraft and speech from a fully operational airstrip was seen as a mic-drop moment.“Shehbaz Sharif trying to copy Modi is like a school kid copying homework but forgetting the main question,” a meme read.Notably, this isn’t Sharif’s first Modi mimicry. After Modi restructured India’s National Security Advisory Board with a former RAW chief, Sharif made headlines for appointing ISI chief Gen Asim Malik as NSA. His speeches post-terror attacks often echo PM Modi’s tone - minus the audience, impact, or airpower.“From Kirana Hills to copycat thrills, Shehbaz Sharif’s only battlefield is Twitter,” one user said.India’s Operation Sindoor, launched after Pakistan’s drone and missile attacks, reportedly damaged multiple airbases across Pakistan. International media like The New York Times and The Washington Post acknowledged India’s upper hand.PM Modi, addressing IAF personnel, declared, “Ghar mein ghus ke maarenge,” while Sharif was left fending off online laughter.","Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif attempted a similar show of support by visiting troops at the Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot.

"Operation Sindoor: How India delivered devastating blow to Pakistan’s air defence with dummy jets, BrahMos missiles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-how-india-delivered-devastating-blow-to-pakistans-air-defence-with-dummy-jets-brahmos-missiles/articleshow/121192203.cms,"brahmos missile

NEW DELHI: In one of the most daring and technologically advanced operations, the Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor on May 10. According to sources quoted by ANI, approximately 15 BrahMos missiles were launched in precision attacks that targeted critical infrastructure across 11 of 12 key Pakistani Air Force bases, effectively paralysing its air defence and strike capabilities.The missile strikes came as part of Round 2 of India's counter-offensive following the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which was carried out by Pakistan-backed groups. On the night of May 9–10, as Pakistan tried to target civilian and military infrastructures in India, New Delhi escalated military response under the broader Operation Sindoor with the BrahMos missiles spearheading the IAF's multi-layered assault strategy.“This was the first time the BrahMos missile system was used in an active conflict,” sources in the defence establishment told ANI. “Its performance exceeded expectations, delivering high-precision strikes that crippled key Pakistani air assets and defence networks,” they said.The IAF’s plan began with the launch of dummy aircraft, designed to simulate an incoming fighter threat. This decoy tactic prompted Pakistan to activate its radar and air defence systems, including the HQ-9 missile batteries. Once these systems were exposed, Indian forces launched loitering munitions, such as the Israeli Harop drones, to neutralise the air defence grid.With the Pakistani radar network compromised, the IAF then followed up with long-range precision strikes. The BrahMos cruise missiles, alongside Scalp, Crystal Maze, and Rampage munitions, were used to devastating effect. These were launched from fighter aircraft operating under the Western and Southwestern Air Commands.“The BrahMos missiles played a central role in disabling runways, hardened shelters, and command centers, significantly degrading the Pakistan Air Force’s ability to launch counter-operations,” ANI reported, citing multiple defence sources.The aftermath of the strike forced the Pakistani military to relocate many of its aircraft to rear bases and reportedly resulted in the loss of several high-value assets, including long-endurance UAVs and an airborne early warning system destroyed in a hangar in Sindh province.According to ANI, the intensity of the BrahMos-led strikes forced Pakistan to abandon its plans for further retaliation. In a telling sign of the damage inflicted, Pakistan urgently sought a Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level meeting to propose a pause in hostilities and explore an understanding with India.The operational use of BrahMos in this conflict marks a historic milestone for India's missile capabilities. Developed jointly by India and Russia, the BrahMos is known for its Mach 2.8 speed, precision strike capabilities, and versatility across land, sea, and air platforms.“This operation has not only validated the BrahMos missile’s deterrent value but also demonstrated its potency as a first-strike option in modern warfare,” a senior defence official told ANI.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor.

Despite warning, Dhadda helped Dalla get bail

NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi group claimed the killing of a Sikh businessman in Ontario’s Mississauga early Thursday. The victim, Harjit Singh Dhadda , was shot multiple times near his office. Bishnoi’s aide, Rohit Godara , owned up to the killing, accusing Dhadda of furnishing a bail bond for Khalistan Tiger Force chief Arsh Dalla.“I, Rohit Godara, along with Goldy Brother, am taking responsibility. This man was close to our enemies. He got his brother Mehal Singh Uttarakhand murdered by giving money to Arsh Dalla and Sukha Dunuke. All were named in that case,” Godara said in a post.Godara’s post said Dhadda was given a warning a year ago but despite that he helped Arsh Dalla’s release on bail two months ago. “This will be the fate of whoever supports our enemy,” it added.Dhadda, a businessman in the trucking services industry, was shot dead near the intersection of Telford Way and Derry Road in Mississauga, Canada, the local police said. Dhadda was standing near his car when unidentified assailants, believed to have been lying in wait, approached and fired around 20 rounds before fleeing the scene. The gunfire caused panic in the parking lot.A staffer of a local office narrowly avoided injury when a stray bullet entered their office and hit an empty chair, just moments after they stood up. An eyewitness described the scene, saying the gunmen exited a parked car, fired many shots at close range. Dhadda was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but later succumbed to his injuries.Dalla, who replaced slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, fled to Canada in July 2020. He was linked to multiple heinous crimes such as murder, extortion, and targeted killings, with more than 13 FIRs registered against him. In January 2023, he was designated a terrorist by the Union home ministry for his involvement in a series of murders, extortion, terror funding, and targeted killings besides terrorist activities.Godara, on the other hand, is on Interpol’s list of wanted men. Interpol issued a red corner notice against Godara in December last year following a request from Indian law enforcement agencies. “On June 13, 2022, Godara is learnt to have fled from Delhi to Dubai on a forged passport issued in the name of one ‘Pawan Kumar’. He is learnt to have taken the same route as his associate, Sachin Bishnoi, who also went to Azerbaijan and was staying in Baku,” said an official.","Harjit Singh Dhadda was shot multiple times near his office.

'Army uniform should not be seen through casteist lens': Yogi Adityanath

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav on Thursday sparked a controversy with a remark on the caste of Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force.Wing Commander Singh was a regular face in the press briefings on the Indian armed forces' ""Operation Sindoor,"" along with foreign secretary Vikram Misri and Colonel Sofiya Qureshi. Already, there is nationwide anger over the statement by a Madhya Pradesh BJP leader targeting Colonel Qureshi.Yadav made the remark while addressing a programme in Moradabad. He took a dig at the ruling BJP for its pan-India ""Tiranga Yatra"" celebrating the successful military operation.""These people (BJP) are taking out the Tiranga Yatra... They do everything only for elections. What is the need to take out the Tiranga Yatra? If there is a need, then the whole country should be taken into confidence, all the political parties should be taken into confidence. Those who fought there (in Operation Sindoor), are they from the BJP?"" news agency PTI quoted him as saying.Referring to the objectionable comment made by Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for Colonel Qureshi, the Rajya Sabha MP added, ""One of their ministers abused Colonel Qureshi. The high court has ordered registration of a case against him again. But he did not know who Vyomika Singh was and neither did he know about Air Marshal AK Bharti, otherwise these people would have abused them too.""Yadav further stated, ""Let me tell you. Vyomika Singh is a Jatav from Haryana and Air Marshal Bharti is a Yadav from Purnia. So all three are from PDA (Picchda, dalit, Alpsankhyak or Backwards, dalits and minorities). One was abused as she is a Muslim. The other was spared as the abusers thought she is a Rajput.""Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the SP national general secretary should not see the army through ""casteist lens.""""The uniform of the army is not to be seen through 'casteist lens'. Every soldier performs 'Rashtradharma' and is not a representative of any caste or religion. Binding a brave daughter within the ambit of caste is not only a display of his party's narrow-mindedness but is also a grave insult to the valour of the army and the country's,"" Adityanath posted on X.People would definitely respond to this ""distorted casteist thinking,"" he added.","Ram Gopal Yadav sparked a controversy with a remark on the caste of Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo has defended its tie-up with Turkish Airlines amid the anti-Turkiye mood in the country after Recep Tayyip Erdogan openly supported Pakistan.Besides, the partnership could face the heat after govt withdrew security clearance to Celebi for offering ground handling services at nine Indian airports.“The India-Turkey air services agreement (ASA or bilaterals) allows carriers of Turkey and India to operate a total of 56 flights per week between India and Turkey. Currently, IndiGo operates direct flights to Istanbul via leased 500 plus seater aircraft and offers codeshare seats to travellers to more than 40 points in Europe and USA supported by its domestic network. This arrangement provides multiple benefits to Indian travellers, and the country’s economy. The additional long-haul capacity has enabled availability of seats for Indian passengers at reasonable airfares, coming at a time when long-haul international airfares have increased substantially owing to the impact of Covid,” IndiGo said.The airline said before it commenced operations, Turkish Airlines was the sole carrier on this route. “The codeshare has enabled IndiGo to build its presence in long haul markets in Europe and USA, putting in place the foundation for self-sufficiency — its long-haul foray with the 40 A321XLR and 30 A350 aircraft ordered by the airline.This arrangement not only enhances the connectivity of Indian hubs like Delhi and Mumbai, but the additional revenue has also led to increased tax contributions to the Indian exchequer, supporting economic growth,” IndiGo said .",IndiGo has defended its tie-up with Turkish Airlines amid the anti-Turkiye mood in the country after Recep Tayyip Erdogan openly supported Pakistan.

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav on Thursday stoked a controversy as he invoked the castes of Wing Commander Vyomika Singh and Air Marshal A K Bharti — who were part of the media briefings on Operation Sindoor — to mount an attack on BJP , with the latter shredding him for using “casteist glasses” to look at the armed forces.Talking to the media in Moradabad, Yadav accused BJP of carrying out ‘Tiranga Yatras’ to use Operation Sindoor for political mileage. He said BJP members, who had attacked Col Sofiya Qureshi — who was also part of the briefings along with Wing Commander Vyomika — because of her religion, would have done the same to the two IAF officers, too, if they knew about their castes.“They didn’t even know who Vyomika Singh was or what her caste is, nor did they know about Air Marshal A K Bharti. Otherwise, they would’ve hurled abuses at them, too. Let me tell you, Vyomika Singh is a Jatav from Haryana, and Air Marshal Bharti is a Yadav from Purnia,” he said, grouping the three armed forces officers as “constituents of the Pichhda-Dalit-Alpsankhyak (PDA) bloc”.Referring to Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah’s objectionable comment on Col Sofiya, the SP veteran said: “One was abused because she was a Muslim. One (Wg Cdr Vyomika) was thought to be a Rajput, so nothing was said.”Yadav’s comments evoked a sharp response from Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath , who hit out at the SP neta saying his statement showed his “narrow-mindedness”, and was against the honour of the armed forces. “Every soldier of the Indian Army performs ‘Rashtradharma’ and is not a representative of any caste or religion,” Yogi said in a post on X, admonishing the SP politician for confining a “veerangana (brave) daughter” within the confines of caste.Yogi said it was this “distorted casteist mentality” that divided even patriotism just for the sake of appeasement and vote bank politics.BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia called Yadav’s statement “shameful, reprehensible and criminal.”UP BJP president Bhupendra Chaudhary said Yadav’s remarks were an insult not just to Army and valour of soldiers, but also to crores of Scheduled Caste people. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Ram Gopal Yadav could not digest Pakistan’s defeat, and that’s why “they are looking for caste in the Army”, he alleged.Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said, “Army is beyond caste and religion. Their religion is to protect the country.

The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets.

LUCKNOW: Farmers of Jalaun in UP’s parched Bundelkhand will not have to toil too much this season to get water for crops. They have almost revived an 81km-long local river that had dried up completely, four years after PM Modi extolled the mission in his Mann Ki Baat radio programme as a brilliant example of “people’s will doing wonders”.Community members have restored the drainage basin over a 14km course of Noon river to create a funnel through which water has again entered it. The river had dried up to encroachments and poor rainfall.The revival commenced in 2021 and reached the final stage only recently, with voluntary labour contributions from thousands of local men and women. Officials said the water would start flowing through the entire course of the river in a fortnight. The river is expected to help more than 15,350 farmers.PM Modi had pointed out that the formation of a committee of thousands of villagers from various panchayats in Jalaun set the ball rolling for the river’s revival.Noon meandered across 47 villages before merging with Yamuna on the other side of Jalaun. The river was earlier a key source of irrigation for agricultural fields spread over 2,780 hectares, as well as for animals looking for a waterbody in the dry region. But dwindling rainfall and sporadic construction activities changed the river’s contours, preventing water collected during the monsoon from funnelling down into the riverbed.Jalaun DM Rajesh Kumar Pandey noted that local politicians, social workers, and professionals played a crucial role in the river’s revival. “Having realised the consequences of unplanned activity, they all were equally committed to removing the hurdles and roadblocks that stalled the progress,” said Pandey.",Community members have restored the drainage basin over a 14km course of Noon river to create a funnel through which water has again entered it.

LONDON: A high court judge in London on Thursday has refused fugitive Indian businessman Nirav Modi bail for the eighth time.Justice Fordham said: “There are substantial grounds for believing that if released by me on bail that applicant would fail to surrender and interfere with witnesses.”Nirav has been in prison in the UK for over six years since he was arrested on an extradition warrant in March 2019 charged with defrauding Punjab National Bank of over $1 billion.Nirav’s barrister Edward Fitzgerald KC argued that Nirav had been held as an undertrial a disproportionate length of time, that all his co-defendants in India, including one Shetty, who Fitzgerald described as “the main mover” in the scam, had got bail, and that there was no chance of Nirav absconding.“What the Christian Michel and Jagtar Johal and Latifa case, and countless others, show, including the murder and attempted murder in Canada and America, is that the reach of the Indian govt is practically limitless. The idea he could go to Vanuatu and there be safe from the govt of India is utterly ridiculous,” Fitzgerald said. “They will either send a hit squad to get him or kidnap him or lean on govt to deport him to India.”The judge questioned this, saying if the Indian govt’s power were limitless, couldn’t they get him in the UK?“He is safe in the UK as police give Osman warnings,” he said.Fitzgerald claimed Michel was “blindfolded, handcuffed and flown on private jet from the UAE to India”, that Johal was “kidnapped on the street”, and Latifa was “kidnapped” by the Indian authorities “These make the danger of extrajudicial retaliation or reprisals even greater,” he said.He said Nirav did not have the resources to flee as his assets had been depleted through being frozen and confiscated. He also said the alleged interference with witnesses was seven years ago, and since then there had been no further such incident even though he has a phone in prison.“Six years in jail is too long” he said, explaining a “confidential legal matter” that began in April 2018 was holding up his extradition.Nicholas Hearn, representing the Indian govt, said if his fears of state reprisals were genuine, what were the chances of him voluntarily surrendering to go back to India?",Nirav has been in prison in the UK for over six years since he was arrested on an extradition warrant in March 2019 charged with defrauding Punjab National Bank of over $1 billion.

He wants its nuclear arsenal under IAEA watch. Singh says Pakistan's nuclear threats failed to deter India's response to terrorism. He calls Operation Sindoor the biggest action against terrorism.

Pak’s been deceiving India for long: Rajnath

NEW DELHI: Calling Pakistan a rogue nation with nukes, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Thursday its nuclear arsenal should be placed under the watch of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ), and stressed that Islamabad’s nuclear blackmail failed to deter India’s response to terrorism under Operation Sindoor “PM Modi has redefined India’s policy against terrorism which now says that any attack on Indian soil will be considered as an act of war,” said Singh, addressing troops at Badami Bagh Cantonment in Srinagar on his first visit to J&K since Op Sindoor was launched May 7. Singh’s comments come soon after the PM drew a new red line, stressing that Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail will no longer work and India would continue to give cross-border kinetic responses to terror attacks.India has a clearly stated ‘no first-use’ nuclear weapons policy but Pakistan has deliberately left it ambiguous and often indulges in nuclear sabre-rattling. It brandishes, for instance, its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other missiles as a counter to India’s conventional military superiority.Pakistan, of course, has steadily built up its nuclear arsenal due to its well-documented proliferation nexus with China and North Korea. This nuclear option as a leverage against India came to the fore even last week when Islamabad first announced a meeting of its nuclear National Command Authority but then subsequently backed down amid global concern.At Srinagar, noting that the world has witnessed how irresponsibly Islamabad has issued nuclear threats to New Delhi several times, Singh said, “I raise this question before the world: Are nuclear weapons safe in the hands of such an irresponsible and rogue nation? Pakistan’s nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of the IAEA.”The defence minister called Operation Sindoor the “biggest action” taken by India against terrorism in history, and a testament to the nation’s commitment to go to any extent to eliminate the menace. “Our forces have shown to the world that their aim is precise and pinpointed, and the task of counting (the body bags) is left to the enemies,” he said.Terrorists targeted tourists in Pahalgam based on their “dharma” (religion), but the Indian forces killed terrorists based on their “karma” (deeds) in the long-range strikes conducted in Pakistan and PoK on May 7, Rajnath said. “It was the dream of every soldier that we will reach terrorist hideouts and destroy them. It was our dharma to eliminate the terrorists.” Addressing the troops, chief minister Omar Abdullah and Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Singh said India has always prioritised peace and never supported war but when its sovereignty is attacked, it is necessary to respond. “If Pakistan continues to support terrorism, it will pay a heavier price,” he said. Recalling Pakistan’s declaration about 21 years ago in front of then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee that terrorism will no longer be exported from its land, Singh said Pakistan has been “deceiving India” for long. Pakistan must stop sheltering anti-India terrorist organisations and not allow its land to be used against India, he said.Pakistan has reached an abysmal state where it seeks loans from the IMF, while India falls in the category of those countries which provide funds to the IMF so that they can help poor countries, he added.",Rajnath Singh calls Pakistan a rogue nation with nukes.

Indus treaty on hold till Pak stops exporting terror: Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indus-treaty-on-hold-till-pak-stops-exporting-terror-jaishankar/articleshow/121196820.cms,"External affairs minister S Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar reiterated Thursday that the only issue which remains to be discussed on Kashmir is return of part of J&K that is under the illegal occupation of Pakistan (POK), while underlining that Indus Waters Treaty will remain in abeyance till Pakistan stops promoting cross-border terrorism irrevocably.“We are open to discussing that (return of PoK) with Pakistan... So I want you to spell out our positions very clearly... The govt’s position is very, very clear,” he told media at the inauguration of the Honduras embassy.Reiterating India's stand, external affairs minister said Thursday that India's relations and dealings with Pakistan will remain strictly bilateral with a focus on cross-border terrorism. He called upon Pakistan to hand over terrorists accused of attacking India.US President Donald Trump has offered mediation on the J&K issue, something India has rejected outright.“That (bilateralism) has been a national consensus for years, and there is absolutely no change. The prime minister made it very clear that talks with Pakistan will be only on terror. Pakistan has a list of terrorists that needs to be handed over, and they have to shut down the terrorists’ infrastructure. They know what to do. We are prepared to discuss with them what is to be done about terrorism. Those are the talks which are feasible,” said Jaishankar.Asked about Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), he said it was was very clear that the treaty is held in abeyance and will continue to be held in abeyance until cross-border terrorism by Pakistan is credibly and irrevocably stopped. The World Bank-brokered IWT allocates the eastern rivers (Beas, Ravi, and Sutlej) to India and the western rivers (Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum) to Pakistan, with some provisions for India to use the western rivers for limited irrigation and non-consumptive uses like power generation.The ministry of external affairs had said earlier this week that IWT was concluded in the spirit of goodwill and friendship as specified in the preamble of the treaty. “However, Pakistan has held these principles in abeyance by its promotion of cross-border terrorism for several decades now,” it had said, adding that climate change, demographic shifts and technological changes have created new realities on the ground as well.","S Jaishankar says only issue to be discussed on Kashmir is return of part of J&K.

DOHA: US President Donald Trump on Thursday repeated his claim yet again that he helped ease tensions between India and Pakistan.“…And by the way, I don't want to say I did, but I sure as hell helped settle the problem between Pakistan and India last week, which was getting more and more hostile,” he said while addressing US military personnel at al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar. “And all of a sudden, you'll start seeing missiles of a different type.

‘Trump’s tariff remarks may be a negotiating tactic by White House’

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he has asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing iPhones in India, and make them in the US instead.Apple has no smartphone production in the US — most of its iPhones are made in China while facilities in India produce around 40 million units per year (about 15% of Apple’s annual output). Cook had previously stated that Apple will source the majority of iPhones sold in the US from India in the June quarter while China will produce the vast majority of the devices for other markets.Speaking on Thursday at an event with business bigwigs in Doha, Trump also said India had “offered us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariff” on US goods.Trump didn’t provide further details of the apparent offer, nor was there any comment from Indian officials. Trump’s comments came days after India threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs in response to higher US duties on steel and aluminium.Some analysts in New Delhi suggested that President Trump’s remarks could indicate either that India is close to finalising a deal, or that the comments are a negotiating tactic by the White House.While PM Modi and Trump share a strong personal rapport, there is growing frustration in New Delhi in recent days over the US president’s insistence he used trade as a bargaining tool to secure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Indian officials have disputed that.Talking about his conversation with Tim Cook, Trump said, “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very well. You’re coming in with $500 billion (investment). But now I hear you're building all over India. I don't want you building in India.”The company had earlier this year pledged to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years.As a result of discussions with Cook, Trump said Apple will be “upping their production in the United States”.Cheaper skilled labour and availability of precision-engineered product supply chains have driven Apple to China and India for manufacturing iPhones. American labour and manufacturing in comparison is expensive.Trump suggested that Apple could make its products in India for the Indian market. But made-in-India iPhones being sold in the US has to stop. “You can build in India if you want, to take care of India,” Trump said he told Cook.According to an analysis by S&P Global, iPhone sales in the US were 75.9 million units in 2024, with exports in March from India at 3.1 million units.The Apple ecosystem in India is one the biggest job creators in the country. It is estimated to have employed around two lakh people across various vendors in the country.Since returning to the White House, Trump has pledged to impose “reciprocal” tariffs of 26% on India. Those tariffs are currently on hold until early July.India has made several moves to satisfy Trump’s grievances this year, including overhauling its tariff regime to reduce import duties on prominent American goods like bourbon whiskey and high-end motorcycles made by Harley-Davidson Inc. As part of its trade negotiations, New Delhi has also proposed zero tariffs on some goods like auto components and pharmaceuticals on a reciprocal basis up to a certain quantity of imports.","US President Donald Trump said he has asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing iPhones in India, and make them in the US instead.

NEW DELHI: Reading the riot act to Telangana govt, Supreme Court on Thursday said it would hold the state chief secretary and other officials accountable and send them to jail if the part of Kancha Gachibowli forest adjacent to Hyderabad Central University that was levelled for an information technology centre is not restored with afforestation in two months.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih asked senior advocate A M Singhvi, who appeared for Telangana govt and attempted to persuade the court about the necessity of setting up the IT centre with protection of forests, whether any forest clearance was taken before trees were felled in a “tearing hurry on a long weekend knowing fully well that the SC’s forest bench would not be available for hearing the matter”.“Did you (Telangana govt) have environment clearance ? If you want to save yourself from contempt, take restoration measures. Otherwise, your chief secretary must get ready to go to jail,” the CJI-led bench cautioned. The bench was not moved when Singhvi said huge afforestation and plantation activities are being undertaken by the state. “Not in the area where the deforestation was carried out,” said Justice Masih . The CJI posted the matter, which the court had taken cognizance of suo motu, for further hearing on July 23.The CJI said, “If you try to defend your action, the chief secretary and dozen other officials responsible for deforestation will stand in danger of contempt.”“You took advantage of a long weekend and brought in a dozen bulldozers to cut down the trees and level the forest area. Prima facie it appears pre-planned. You did so knowing fully well that the bench was not available on the long weekend. Why didn’t you start work on a Monday,” the bench asked.Singhvi said he would like to persuade the court about IT and forest going together. CJI Gavai said, “We are for sustainable development but in this case the state must restore the land to its original shape during the monsoon period.”It was amicus curiae in forest matters, senior advocate K Parameshwar, who brought the illegal felling of trees in the forest patch, leading SC to send an HC registrar for an on-the-spot inquiry. In his report, the registrar informed court around 100 acres of forest land has been destroyed even though wildlife was seen in the area.SC had taken umbrage at Telangana govt’s audacity in carrying out deforestation when the state on March 15 had constituted the forest committee, as directed by SC on Feb 3, for identification of forest areas which have not been so notified.

NEW DELHI: Arbitration is hailed as the best way to settle commercial disputes , and efforts are being made to make India a global hub of arbitration. However, poor drafting of arbitration clauses in India often leads to parties litigating for years over the method of dispute resolution itself. SC Thursday said those responsible for such poor drafting — including lawyers — should be penalised, and that courts should reject shoddily drafted clauses at the very threshold.Taking note of the fact that a legal dispute between Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and three private contractors went on for a decade on the issue of whether the agreement allowed arbitration proceedings or not, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh said the courts must show an unwavering tendency towards rejecting shoddily drafted clauses and must be thrown out of the court.“The drafting of arbitration clauses in commercial agreements in India leaves much to be desired. Despite arbitration being introduced as a means of ensuring speedy and effective dispute resolution, it is evident and ironic that, in certain cases, the process has been misused to further complicate and prolong the resolution of disputes. The manner in which ambiguity is embedded into such agreements raises serious concerns,” SC said.The bench said it is high time arbitration clauses be worded with piercing precision and clarity, and not couched in ambiguous phraseology which is a responsibility of every legal counsel and advisor.In the present case, the court said the willful and wanton wastage of judicial time was highly deplorable.",Poor drafting of arbitration clauses in India often leads to parties litigating for years over the method of dispute resolution itself.

This direction could create ripples across states and for allottees who have manipulated rules to get forest lands.SC said, “This is a classic example as to how the nexus between the politicians, bureaucrats and builders can result in the conversion of precious forest land for commercial purposes under the garb of resettlement of people belonging to the backward class from whose ancestors, agricultural land was acquired for public purpose.”Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, “We hold that the allotment of 11.89 ha (30 acres) of reserve forest land in Survey No.21, Kondhwa Budruk in district Pune for agriculture purposes on Aug 28, 1998, and subsequent permission given for its sale in favour of RRCHS on Oct 30, 1999, was totally illegal.” It also quashed the Union forest ministry’s July 2007 clearance to the project terming it illegal.“We direct that the possession of the subject land, which is reserved as a forest land, but is in possession of the revenue department, should be handed over to the forest department within a period of three months,” the bench said.While adjudicating this case, SC noticed that vast stretches of notified forest land continue to be in possession of revenue departments.","SC cancels Maharashtra govt’s illegal allotment of 30 acres of reserved forest land in Pune, valued at more than Rs 200 crore, for just Rs 2 crore to Richie Rich Cooperative Housing Society (RRCH) in 1998-99.

First monthly PLFS Bulletin

NEW DELHI: The unemployment rate for those in the 15 years and above age group in the country was estimated at 5.1% in Apr while in rural areas it was at 4.5% and urban centres at 6.5%, the first monthly bulletin of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) showed on Thursday.PLFS has been revamped since Jan this year and the latest addition to the jobs data in the form of a monthly bulletin has been done to ensure availability of high frequency labour market data with enhanced coverage to aid timely policy intervention. It contains data for both urban and rural areas.Among males in the 15 years and above age group the joblessness rate was 5.2% while it was 5% for females in this category.The unemployment rate among rural male of age 15 years and above was 4.9% during Apr while it was 3.9% for females. In urban areas the joblessness rate among females in the 15 years and above age group during Apr was 8.7% compared to 5.8% for males in the same age group.The estimates of unemployment under the current weekly status (CWS) provides an average picture of joblessness in a short period of seven days during the survey period. A person is considered as unemployed in a week if he/she did not work even for one hour on any day during the reference week but sought or was available for work at least for one hour on any day during this period.The statistics office said that the results of the PLFS post Jan 2025 needs to be understood and used in the context with which the sample selection methodology of the survey has been designed. Previous data for the Oct-Dec quarter had shown that unemployment in urban areas was at 6.4%.The monthly data showed that the unemployment rate in the 15-29 years age group across the country was at 13.8%. In rural areas the rate was higher among females at 14.4% while among males it was at 13.6%.The Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) under the current weekly status (CWS) among those in the 15 years and above age group was 55.6% during Apr.

BIJAPUR: A four-legged CRPF soldier, adept at taking the sting out of Maoist attack plans with its infantry patrolling, explosive detection and assault skills and manoeuvres, fell to a sting-assault by 200 honeybees to attain martyrhood in the biggest-ever anti-Naxal operation .K9 Rolo, a handsome Belgian Malinois who got past its second birthday only last month, was part of the 21-day operation by the CRPF and Chhattisgarh police at Karreguttalu Hills on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border. Trained at the CRPF dog breeding and training school (DBTS), Bengaluru, it was drafted into anti-Naxal duties in CRPF 228th battalion in April 2024.During the special operation at KGH, while Rolo and other CRPF troops were in the midst of an intensive search operation, a swarm of bees waylaid the dog, embedding scores of stings into his otherwise combat-trained body.Handlers of the K9 soldier moved fast, shielding it with a polythene sheet to cut off the bee attack . Unfortunately, this did not help as the bees managed to sneak inside the cover to resume their stinging assault with added force.Rolo, by then overwhelmed with pain and irritation, went berserk and shook the cover off, making itself vulnerable to even more bites. By the end of the ordeal, it had around 200 bee stings inside him, which rendered it unconscious. An immediate medical evacuation was performed by its human co-soldiers. Emergency treatment was administered by the handlers. However, Rolo succumbed to the pain and suffering while still being evacuated.K9 was declared ‘brought dead’ by the veterinary doctor. The canine martyr laid its life being a loyal soldier and assisting CRPF in busting hideouts and sniffing out explosives dumps dotting KG Hills. K9 Rolo’s sacrifice received a fitting tribute; it was laid to rest with a guard of honour and shall now be posthumously awarded a commendation disk by CRPF director general.",K9 Rolo was part of the 21-day operation by the CRPF and Chhattisgarh police at Karreguttalu Hills.

India wants US to cut duties for labour-intensive sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-wants-us-to-cut-duties-for-labour-intensive-sectors/articleshow/121196477.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar on Thursday asserted that a trade deal has to be mutually beneficial, and he expected that the proposed agreement with the US should help both countries gain from it.“These are very complicated negotiations, they are very intricate, and nothing is decided till everything is,” Jaishankar said. The comments come just ahead of commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal ’s meetings with US trade representative Jamieson Greer and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.But any trade deal has to work for both the countries, and I think that would be our expectation from the trade deal, and until that is done, I think any judgment on it would be premature,” he said on the sidelines of an event.Besides, a team of officials led by India’s chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal will hold detailed discussions on technical aspects of the proposed bilateral trade agreement , including tariff cuts , removal of non-tariff barriers and rules of origin.“The talks are continuing, they are progressing very well and a team is slated to go to the US to conduct further talks,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters.In the past, too, Trump is seen to have spoken out of turn to claim major gains in negotiations even when officials were still busy finalising the rules of engagement.While India is widely expected to lower tariffs on several products of interest to the US, it also wants duties for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles and leather lowered and EAM S Jaishankar’s comments may have been an indication of that.How much of India’s demands are accepted are unclear given that the UK managed to get just around 100 items while the US lowered tariffs in return for levies being slashed for nearly 2,500 American goods. Besides, the UK agreed to buy more planes and other goods from the US to narrow the trade gap.Many trade experts see that as the template for other trade deals as Trump keeps the sword of reciprocal tariffs hanging. Through the discussions, both sides are seeking to take advantage of the 90-day tariff pause that ends on July 9, with an “early deal” also on the horizon to cover a limited set of products.",Foreign minister S Jaishankar says a trade deal has to be mutually beneficial.

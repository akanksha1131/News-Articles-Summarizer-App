Brand experiences, like mornings, must feel fresh

The myth of the brand: Nostalgia, aspiration, and the power of print

Advertising without print is a body without a core

Let truth prevail.

The writer is CEO, The Times of India

Over the last few weeks, three major advertising agencies released their Advertising Industry Forecasts for 2025. Across all reports, one thing remains clear: while business decisions bow before data and analytics, very well presented across all three much awaited industry reports, advertisement is more of an art than a science driven by cold numbers. Human behaviour is driven by emotions, desires, and aspirations, which drives the art of advertising. The essence of advertising, therefore, is not in mere product placement, but in the alchemy of desire, the art of turning an offering into a myth that consumers long to be part of.But where do these desires begin? Not on the fleeting glow of a screen, not in the ephemeral swirl of social media, but in the tactile, immersive world of Print. The only medium one wakes up to, the only medium that awakens desire before the first sip of morning coffee.On a digital screen, rather than as an aspiration. But advertising is not about features; it is about longing, seduction, and storytelling.Consider the moment one unfolds a newspaper in the quiet of the morning. Unlike the frantic, ceaseless scrolling of digital, where headlines evaporate as quickly as they appear, print lingers, whispers, immerses. Its experience is not an accident — it is by design.Print possesses the two primal forces of aesthetic experience: sight and touch. The grand canvas of a broadsheet allows for narrative elegance — each advertisement is a story, unmarred by pop-ups, unhurried by the tyranny of the next notification. A well-crafted print ad does not beg for attention — it commands it. Unlike digital banners, which scream for a second’s worth of engagement, a print ad is a visual embrace, an invitation to linger. And therein lies its power: it builds desire not in a flash, but in a slow-burning flame that remains.Advertising thrives on freshness — the currency of memory. Infinite repetition in digital breeds indifference. The endless scroll of ads may create awareness, but it does not build longing. Print does not repeat — it reinvents. Every morning, it reintroduces the brand with a different story, a new aesthetic, a renewed call to desire. It nurtures the consumer’s relationship with the brand like a morning ritual — familiar, yet always full of possibility.To ignore this is to misunderstand the rhythm of consumer longing. A brand, like an enduring romance, must not demand attention — it must seduce, intrigue, and unfold itself in layers.Every consumer, whether they admit it or not, wants to do things history could only dream of. Every great brand taps into this primal longing for legacy, for transcendence, for a connection between past and future. And this is where Print wields its ultimate advantage.Unlike digital, ephemeral by nature, Print creates permanence. A beautifully designed newspaper spread does not vanish; it lingers on the table, it’s folded into memory, it’s clipped and saved. It invites nostalgia, but it also speaks to futures yet to be written.This is why advertising cannot simply sell a product; it must sell a desire. It must turn an object into a story, an experience into a destiny. The brands that live forever — high end phones, luxury watches, automobiles, premium real estate or that premium travel destination — do not sell transactions. They sell tradition, elegance, and the idea that to own their product is to belong to something greater.Only Print — with its immersive, unhurried storytelling — can give this myth the weight it deserves.Advertising is an exercise of power, and power must be built on a strong core. While digital may flash its brilliance, while social media may spark momentary curiosity, Print remains the foundation. It is the core muscle of advertising — unseen, yet essential; silent, yet the very thing that holds everything together. Building awareness is simple; building longing is an art.Digital awareness is instantaneous, like quick commerce — integral to modern society but fleeting. It is the surface, the introduction, the passing wave. But desire — true, deep, soul-stirring desire — is cultivated slowly, rhythmically, until it becomes inseparable from the brand itself.This is the role of Print. It does not demand attention — it earns it. It does not fight for relevance — it possesses it. It does not fade — it becomes part of the morning, part of the ritual of being alive.Let other mediums chase the moment. Print creates eternity.All three major advertising agencies predict Print to have an 18% market share in 2025, with Auto, Real Estate, FMCG, Retail and Education being major spenders. But beyond predictions, our conviction is that new-age brands seeking to build legacy, myth, and meaning will still turn to Print — because in branding, the core must always be strong.And in the end, the myth of the brand and the truth of the brand must become one.","Advertising is more of an art than a science driven by cold numbers.

Global democracy under threat?

Speaking at 'Live to Vote Another Day: Fortifying Democratic Resilience ', the foreign minister expressed confidence in India's electoral process and said that ""for us democracy is actually delivered"".""Well before I do that, I appeared to be an optimist in what is relatively a pessimistic panel, if not room. I will begin by sticking up my finger and don't take it badly, it is the index finger. This, the mark you see on my nail, is a mark of a person who has just voted. We just had an election in my state just over. Last year, we had a national election. In Indian elections, roughly two-thirds of the eligible voters vote. At the national elections, the electorate of about 900 million, about 700 million voted. We count the votes in a single day,"" he said, speaking at the Munich security conference .""Nobody disputes the result after it's announced and by the way, from the time we started voting in the modern era, 20% of people more vote today than they did decades ago.

Actually, in my part of the world, it does because it actually, today because we are a democratic society, we give nutrition support, and food to 800 million people and for whom that is a matter of how healthy they are and how full their stomachs are. So, the point I want to make is look different parts of the world are going through different conversations.

Maha panel to frame law on 'love jihad'

MUMBAI: Maharashtra govt on Friday set up a special seven-member committee headed by the DGP to frame a law against 'love jihad.'A government resolution (GR) said that apart from the DGP, the panel would have six other members from various departments: one member each from the women and child development, minority development department, law and judiciary, social justice and special assistance department, and two home department representatives. The GR contained the term 'love jihad.'CM Devendra Fadnavis had said in the past that Maharashtra was planning to introduce a law against forced religious conversions , particularly in cases of inter-faith marriages through conversion ('love jihad'), following similar legislations enacted in Uttar Pradesh and other states.Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh has opposed this move. He said the state govt lacks statistical evidence for such cases and is politicising the issue of forced conversion by labelling it as 'jihad.'The GR specified the committee's responsibilities: evaluating the current situation, handling complaints about 'love jihad' and forced religious conversions, examining other states' laws, establishing legal frameworks, and reviewing legal implications. The document mentioned requests from public representatives, organisations and citizens to prevent 'love jihad' and forced religious conversions.The committee will analyse current circumstances and recommend measures regarding 'love jihad' complaints and forced conversions, whilst studying existing legal structures in other states to develop suitable legislation.Shaikh said, ""Earlier the govt came up with a proposal after stating that there were over one lakh cases of 'love jihad' in the state, but they were unable to find a single instance where they could file a police case. There is no data available to support any such claim, and I had raised this issue in the assembly. The govt is playing politics over the issue.""When Fadnavis was deputy chief minister in the Mahayuti government in 2023, he had said, ""Many cases have come up of girls getting married and converting. There is demand from all corners to make a law against this. Earlier, I had made an announcement in the House also. Accordingly, study of laws in various states is on and then the decision about it in Maharashtra will be taken.""",Devendra Fadnavis had said in the past that Maharashtra was planning to introduce a law against forced religious conversions.

'Govt likely to move court to withdraw all such cases'

NEW DELHI: Days after BJP defeated AAP in the assembly polls, the law department of Delhi government has sought details of all court cases filed by the outgoing dispensation against the Centre and lieutenant governor in the last few years.Sources claimed more than Rs 300 crore was spent on ""inter-department"" litigation and court battles between the AAP govt and the Centre or the LG in the last few years. It also resulted in the loss of precious man-hours, which now needed to be cut down. They added that a comprehensive report on the ongoing litigation would be placed before the new dispensation to take a view.The AAP govt, the LG, and the Centre were involved in frequent tussles over various issues related to governance, resulting in a number of court cases. There was an increase in the number of court cases after V K Saxena was sworn in as LG of Delhi in May 2022. Some of the prominent cases being heard in Supreme Court and high court include the outgoing AAP dispensation challenging the law bringing 'services' under LG's domain and the formation of a high-level committee, with Saxena as its chairman, to prevent pollution in the Yamuna.A senior Delhi govt official said it was the BJP-led central govt that decided that the services-related matters in Delhi govt should come under the direct control of the LG and brought an ordinance after the Supreme Court decided otherwise, subsequently backing it up with a law on the issue.""With BJP now in office in Delhi, there will be no need to continue such cases. The new dispensation may like to move the court to withdraw such cases,"" said an official. ""The withdrawal of these cases will also do away with unnecessary friction between the Centre/LG and the elected dispensation, and the two will be able to develop a cordial relationship and work towards the development of the city,"" he added.In an internal communication to all additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries, the law, justice and legislative affairs department of Delhi sought the detailed list of all cases, mentioning the issue involved in the case, the last directions issued by the respective court, and the replies filed by the department concerned.The law department also sought to know the names of the counsel engaged by the Chief Minister or ministers in the outgoing dispensation, the details of the defence counsel of the administrative department, and the next date of hearing in each case.In a separate office memorandum, the law department advised the standing counsel, additional standing counsel, and empanelled counsel to ensure that written and verbal statements made by them before any court are strictly in consonance with the written instructions given to them with the approval of the administrative secretary of the department concerned.","Law department of Delhi government has sought details of all court cases filed by outgoing dispensation against Centre and lieutenant governor.

Students sought cancellation of book fair due to exams: University

DEHRADUN: A book fair scheduled for Feb 15-16 at Uttarakhand's HNB Garhwal University , the state's only central university situated in Srinagar (Pauri Garwhal), has been cancelled, with organisers alleging pressure from right-wing groups for the cancellation. The event, titled 'Kitab Kauthik', a popular platform for book lovers which is annually organised by the group Creative Uttarakhand, was initially scheduled for Jan at Govt Girls' Inter College.""We had received permission from the school, but the management later cancelled it without assigning a reason. Since elections were approaching, we postponed the event to Feb,"" said Hem Pant, the fair's coordinator.The organisers then approached the central university for permission to hold the event at its premises and initially claimed to have received a go-ahead, which they said was later revoked. ""Representatives of the students' union and ABVP told us that 'books on Gandhi and Nehru were not fit to be sold'. They convinced the university to revoke the permission,"" Pant alleged.University spokesperson Ashutosh Bahuguna denied that permission was revoked due to pressure from any group. ""Our students' body suggested that holding a book fair may interfere with the ongoing exams and distract students, which is why the organisers were asked to find an alternate location,"" he said.Ashish Pant, a student union representative from RSS-backed ABVP, claimed there were no ideological reasons for the event's cancellation. ""Initially, approval was given to them for a small setup near the university library, but we later learned they had planned multiple cultural programmes. All of this was happening in the middle of exams. It was students themselves who raised concerns, which led to the university revoking the permission based on our recommendation."" He also rejected claims that ABVP had objected to the nature of the books that were to be sold.Meanwhile, the organisers tried to shift the fair to Ramlila Ground in Srinagar but met with a roadblock there too. ""The Ramlila Ground committee okayed holding the event but later we were told that RSS had already booked the venue for the same dates. We subsequently found that their application was dated Feb 10, while we had applied on Feb 9,"" said Hem Pant. He also alleged that the right-wing group covered book fair banners with their own posters.""When we sought clarification from the administration, we did not get a satisfactory response. This is a simple book fair designed for students and youngsters.. We bring over 50,000 books to small towns and the last edition was held in Tehri. Even CM Pushkar Singh Dhami encouraged us to organise more of them. Against this backdrop, such politically motivated discouragement is disheartening,"" he added.SDM Srinagar, Nupur Verma, when contacted, said, ""No application came to me from the book fair organisers, and the RSS event was already scheduled much earlier.""",Book fair scheduled for Feb 15-16 at Uttarakhand's HNB Garhwal University has been cancelled.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay?

For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315.

"Delhi-Mumbai Expressway: Delhi Mumbai Expressway completion delayed by 2 years, Gujarat sections hold up progress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-mumbai-expressway-completion-delayed-by-2yrs-gujarat-sections-hold-up-progress/articleshow/118223485.cms,"Delhi-Mumbai expressway

NEW DELHI: The completion of the entire Delhi-Mumbai Expressway would take around two more years as there has been delay in construction of around half a dozen stretches of the project, particularly three sections with a total length of 87 km in Gujarat . In one of these sections (35 km), there is no physical progress and in the remaining two, it’s barely 7% and 35%.The 1,382-km expressway project was divided into smaller packages for carrying out construction simultaneously. Separate packages were bid out for construction at different points of time with the deadline set for March 2024. Subsequently, the deadline was extended and Oct 2025 was set as the revised deadline for the entire project. Just before the Delhi polls, Harsh Malhotra, MoS for road transport and highways, had said the entire expressway would be ready in 2026. He had cited logistical and technical challenges, particularly issues with land acquisition for the delay.Going by the trend of highway construction , it takes at least two years for a section of NH or expressway to be complete from the start of work. So, one can expect that the much delayed 35-km section in Gujarat may be complete for traffic by Feb 2027, sources said. These three packages have been awarded to one highway builder.Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari reviewed the progress of the ambitious Rs 1 lakh crore project on Tuesday evening with top officials from NHAI and his ministry. The minister directed officials to expedite the work. The project passes through Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Once completed, the expressway will reduce the travel time from Delhi to Mumbai to barely 12 hours.Sources said while work in the Haryana section is complete, all packages falling under Rajasthan would be ready for traffic by March-April 2026. “With this, one can travel from Delhi to Vadodara nonstop using the expressway by March next year. All agencies concerned are putting their best effort to expedite delayed works in Gujarat,” said an official.TOI has learnt that all packages of the expressway project in Maharashtra are likely to be completed by this year-end, except the 21-km link to Jawaharlal Nehru Port. Sources said while as per the original plan the construction of this section was to be taken up by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), the highway ministry gave in-principle approval for NHAI to build this stretch.Sources said detailed cost of this stretch would be worked out soon for getting necessary approval.","The 1,382-km expressway project was divided into smaller packages for carrying out construction simultaneously.

'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

NEW DELHI: Eyebrows were raised when India announced five spinners in the team for the ICC Champions Trophy . Historically, the pitches in Dubai do not overly favour spinners. However, the venue has also just got done with the month-long ILT20 league which may have left the pitches tired and more amenable to spin. Predominantly, though, India’s spinner-heavy squad was chosen to lengthen the batting lineup, TOI has learnt.The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats. Gambhir has been vocal about the need to bat deep. Seambowling allrounders are a rarity at the moment. Hence, Washington Sundar too has made the cut along with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja Interestingly, it was Gambhir who insisted on having Shivam Dube back in the ODI scheme of things by adding him to the list of non-travelling reserves, say insiders.Gambhir is someone who prefers to have more options in the playing XI. More allrounders give him the chance to be flexible. If India advance in the tournament, spinners are likely to play a greater role.The idea, according to those in the know of developments, is simple — play two steady finger-spinners who can bat well to complement either Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy . Kuldeep and Chakravarthy are seen as genuine strike options. If the pitches at the start look like they can produce big runs, one might see Chakravarthy in the XI ahead of Kuldeep. The majority of Chakravarthy’s wickets have come while the batters have been looking to push the scoring rate. Kuldeep is seen as someone who can deceive the batter in the air and lure him into a false shot, like he did against England in the last ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 There are other factors too. India have played two Asia Cups at the venue over the last seven years and never played more than two frontline spinners in the XI.Jasprit Bumrah’s absence and Mohammed Shami being rusty after a long injury layoff has played a part in India picking a spin-heavy attack which can compensate for the inexperience of the two new pacers, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. It will be interesting to see how India’s campaign unfolds on the Dubai pitches, which usually sport a layering of grass to prevent the surface from cracking up.","The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats.

Trump announces extradition of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana: What it means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-announces-extradition-of-26/11-accused-tahawwur-rana-what-it-means-for-india/articleshow/118250603.cms,"26/11 attacks accused Tahawwur Hussain (File photo)

Who is Tahawwur Rana?



'Every 3rd fugitive, terrorist wanted by India hiding in US'



Trump message on Khalistani elements in US



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana , a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks . After meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a joint press conference at the White House, Trump confirmed the decision and hinted at more extraditions in the future.“We are giving a very violent man (Tahawwur Rana) back to India immediately. There are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. We work with India on crime, and we want to make things better for India,” Trump said.This decision comes after the US Supreme Court rejected Rana’s final appeal on January 21, removing the last legal hurdle for his extradition.On the timeframe of Rana's extradited, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said: ""We are working on the logistics of his surrender and extradition to India. There are a few final steps to be completed. The two sides are in touch on this particular issue.”The India-US joint statement notes that PM Modi and Trump reaffirmed that the global scourge of terrorism must be fought and terrorist safe havens eliminated from every corner of the world.“They committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups, including Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Jaish-e Mohammad, and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in order to prevent heinous acts like the attacks in Mumbai on 26/11 and the Abbey Gate bombing in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021,"" the joint statement said.“Recognising a shared desire to bring to justice those who would harm our citizens, the US announced that the extradition to India of Tahawwur Rana has been approved,"" it said.Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian citizen, was convicted in the US for supporting the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and is wanted in India for his alleged role in facilitating the Mumbai attacks that killed over 174 people. His extradition had been a long-pending demand from India.Rana’s role in the 26/11 attack involves helping his friend David Coleman Headley alias Daood Gilani, a US citizen who was born to an American mother and a Pakistani father. Headley was arrested by the US authorities in October 2009.Rana was allegedly not only aware of Headley’s links to the Pakistan-based banned terror organisation LeT, he also actively helped Headley. Rana provided Headley with a fake identity that helped the latter visit India and identify targets for LeT’s 2008 attack.MoS Nityanand Rai had informed Lok Sabha in December that 65 of the 178 pending extradition requests by Indian investigative agencies were currently under US government consideration. Despite a treaty signed between the two nations in 1997, only 11 requests were honored between 2002 and 2018.Among the unfulfilled requests is the extradition of David Coleman Headley, the Lashkar operative and key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Citing data from the Ministry of External Affairs, Rai stated that in the past five years, India sought the extradition of several fugitive criminals from the US, with only 23 requests approved.Anmol Bishnoi, Lawrence Bishnoi’s younger brother, was arrested in the US last year in November. He is suspected of planning terror attacks and targeted assassinations in film and business sectors. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had listed him as one of its most wanted fugitives and announced a Rs 10 lakh reward for his capture.During the joint press conference, Trump was asked about Khalistanis in the US. While the US president did not give a direct reply, he said India and the US worked together on crime.On a question related to Washington's recent accusations of India's involvement in a foiled assassination plot against Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Trump said India didn’t have a good relationship with the Biden administration. ""Very inappropriate things happened between them,"" Trump said before moving on to the announcement of Tahawwur Rana's extradition.On January 15, a high-powered Indian inquiry committee had also submitted its report on the activities of organised criminal groups and terrorist organizations impacting both India and the US. The probe was initiated following US allegations regarding the attempted killing of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who faces 104 cases across India.In an official statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs had confirmed that the committee, which worked in full cooperation with US authorities, recommended legal action against an individual with known criminal ties. While the ministry did not disclose the person’s identity, it assured that swift action would follow.","US President Donald Trump has approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.

Concerns over Constitutional interpretation



NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday questioned the involvement of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in executive appointments , such as that of the CBI director, stating that it was time to ""revisit"" such norms. Speaking at the National Judicial Academy in Bhopal, he also raised concerns over the jurisprudential basis of the ‘doctrine of basic structure.’“To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director?” Dhankhar said, according to PTI reported. “Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit. This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India with any executive appointment!"" he added.The Vice President criticised what he termed as ""executive governance by judicial decree,"" calling it a ""constitutional paradox that the largest democracy on the planet cannot afford any longer."" Dhankhar emphasised that all institutions must function within their constitutional boundaries.“Governments are accountable to the legislature and periodically to the electorate. But if executive governance is arrogated or outsourced, enforceability of accountability will not be there,” he said. He added that any interference in governance by the legislature or judiciary was “antithetical to constitutionalism.”Dhankhar acknowledged the importance of judicial review, stating, “Judicial review is a good thing as it ensures that laws conform to the Constitution.” However, he stressed that the ultimate authority to amend the Constitution rests with Parliament.“The judiciary’s public presence must be primarily through judgments. Judgments speak for themselves… Any other mode of expression… undermines institutional dignity,” he remarked.On the basic structure doctrine , which restricts Parliament from altering certain fundamental features of the Constitution, Dhankhar said its jurisprudential basis was “very debatable.” Citing a book by former Solicitor General Andhyarujina on the Kesavananda Bharati case, he noted, “Having read the book, my view is that the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution has a debatable, very debatable, jurisprudential basis.”Recalling his tenure as Parliamentary Affairs Minister in 1990, Dhankhar pointed out that the Supreme Court had only eight judges at the time, yet constitutional interpretation required a five-judge bench. “Please note, when this strength was eight, it (size of constitutional bench) was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution,” he said.However, he warned against the misuse of constitutional interpretation. “Under the guise of interpretation, there can be no arrogation of authority, and the essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected,” he asserted.Referring to the expansion of the Supreme Court, he stated, “If I analyze arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by a majority of judges, because the (total) strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold.”Dhankhar also underscored the importance of free expression in a democracy. “If the right to express oneself is throttled or diluted, democracy gets thinner and thinner and thinner,” he remarked.","Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned the involvement of the Chief Justice of India in executive appointments.

Teams of Mumbai and Assam police visited the Versova residence of YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia , popularly known as BeerBiceps , on Friday as part of an investigation into his controversial remarks on a now-deleted YouTube show. However, officials found the flat locked, an officer said.Allahbadia is facing backlash over crass remarks about parents and sex on comedian Samay Raina 's YouTube show, ' India's Got Latent ', which has since been taken down. Amid mounting complaints, Mumbai police had summoned him to appear at Khar police station on Thursday, but he failed to show up, prompting a second summons for Friday.Instead of appearing, Allahbadia requested that his statement be recorded at his residence, a request that police denied, the official added. When Mumbai and Assam police teams arrived at his flat, they found it locked and returned to Khar police station.Meanwhile, the Assam police are also pursuing a case in Guwahati following a complaint by a local resident, accusing Allahbadia of promoting obscenity in a publicly accessible online show.Apart from Allahbadia and Raina, Ashish Chanchlani, Jaspreet Singh, and Apoorva Makhija have also been named in the Guwahati case. The Assam police team met with Maharashtra Cyber Department officials on Thursday.Mumbai police, who have not yet registered an FIR, have so far recorded seven statements, including those of Makhija, Chanchlani, and Allahbadia’s manager, based on a complaint from a BJP functionary.Additionally, Mumbai police have summoned Pratham Sagar, the video editor of 'India’s Got Latent,' for questioning on Friday afternoon.The Maharashtra Cyber Department has also summoned at least 50 individuals connected to the show. Among them is actor and television personality Raghu Ram, who was on the show’s judging panel and recorded his statement on Thursday.With mounting legal scrutiny and police expanding their probe across multiple states, Allahbadia and others involved in the show may face further questioning in the coming days. Whether an FIR will be registered remains to be seen.","Ranveer Allahbadia is facing backlash over crass remarks about parents and sex on comedian Samay Raina's YouTube show,'India's Got Latent ', which has since been taken down.

India needs to weigh pros & cons of F-35 pitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-needs-to-weigh-pros-cons-of-f-35-pitch/articleshow/118258672.cms,"F - 35

NEW DELHI: India will have to very carefully evaluate US President Donald Trump’s offer of the fifth-generation F-35 fighter, even though the IAF would love to grab it with both hands given the China factor, while the two countries take forward the procurement of six more P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft as well as joint production of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles and Javelin anti-tank guided missiles this year.The expansive India-US defence relationship will get a further boost with PM Modi and Trump “pledging to elevate” military cooperation across air, land, sea, space and cyberspace, institute the ‘Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA)’, streamline defence trade and technology exchange, and sign a 10-year major defence partnership framework to renew the one inked in 2015.The sales pitch for the F-35, which is sold only to Nato countries and close allies, however, was the key takeaway. It might just be “a proposal” at this stage with the long-drawn formal process yet to even begin, as foreign secretary Vikram Misri said, but India will have to increasingly contend with a pushy Trump, whose deal-oriented transactional approach to geopolitics is well-known.“Starting this year, we will be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We are also paving the way to ultimately provide F-35 stealth fighters,” said Trump. The joint statement also noted the US’s “review of its policy on releasing fifth-generation fighters and undersea systems” to India.The pros and cons will have to be weighed. “India will inexorably be drawn into the US’s sphere of influence with the F-35 acquisition, impinging on its strategic autonomy. Why do you think successive Indian govts over the years have acquired Russian, French and other fighters but never American ones?” a senior official said.If India indeed pursues the F-35 offer, it will also have to factor in several things like the off-the-shelf price, the technologies being given, life-cycle costs, maintenance and the like, apart from the strategic benefits it can reap.Utmost care will have to be taken that India’s own 5th-Gen fighter project of the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), the development of which for over Rs 15,000 crore was cleared by the cabinet committee on security last March, is not adversely impacted.The operational 5th-Gen jets currently are the American F-35 Lightning-II and F/A-22 Raptor, the Chinese Chengdu J-20 and Russian Sukhoi-57. China has deployed J-20s at its airfields facing India and is even going to soon supply a variant to Pakistan, while it also conducted maiden flights of two new 6th-Gen prototypes in Dec.With the IAF grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorized 42.5, and Hindustan Aeronautics struggling to produce even a 4th-Gen Tejas, Indian national security planners are obviously concerned. “With AMCA still at least 10-12 years away from production, IAF will obviously be deeply interested in getting two to three squadrons (36 or 54 jets) of F-35s in the interim. If you need deterrence to prevent wars, you obviously need capabilities,” another official said.The F-35 could now even fly its way into IAF’s long-delayed project for 114 new multi-role fighter aircraft to be produced in India with foreign collaboration at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore. The defence ministry is working to break the logjam over this project, where French Rafale, Russian Sukhoi-57, Swedish Gripen-E, Eurofighter Typhoon and American F-15EX are the contenders.There is also the lingering question of the Russian S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems being inducted under the $5.43 billion contract in Oct 2018. The US is wary of any country operating F-35s and S-400s together since the latter’s powerful radars can “map or record” data of the former’s stealth characteristics, electronic warfare and other capabilities. This, too, will need to be resolved.","The sales pitch for the F-35, which is sold only to Nato countries and close allies, was the key takeaway. India will have to increasingly contend with a pushy Trump, whose deal-oriented transactional approach to geopolitics is well- known. “India will inexorably be drawn into the US’s sphere of influence, impinging on its strategic autonomy,” a senior official said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118258692,imgsize-35708,width-400,resizemode-4/118258692.jpg"

Poll How Do You Feel About the Changes in the US Visa Renewal Process? It Could Make the Process More Organized in the Long Run It Makes the Process More Difficult for Applicants

NEW DELHI: Renewing the same class of US visa could now mean a long wait for many applicants in India. Uncle Sam has returned to its pre-Covid policy of allowing travellers to renew their visa without appearing at the embassy/consulate for an interview if their previous same-class visa is still valid or expired within the last 12 months.In Nov 2022, when the wait time for B1/B2 (business and tourism visa ) interview had crossed 999 days (touching almost three years) in India, the US increased the eligibility for same class drop box visa renewal — which does not require interview — from 12 months to 48 months. Since then the waiting period for B1/B2 interview has less than halved, it is currently over 440 days in Delhi & Mumbai; 436 in Chennai; 429 in Hyderabad and 415 in Kolkata.With such a long waiting, the reduction of drop box eligibility for renewal will mean more people again seeking appointments for same class visa renewal and further prolonging the queue. Asked in this backdrop if it planned to take any step in India to reduce the waiting, the US embassy said it had “anything additional”.Anil Kalsi, Travel Agents Federation of India VP, said: “This makes travel difficult for people who were banking on renewal. Since it’s announced and is already in effect, a lot of people have been caught unawares. There are anyway no interview dates available (in India) without a long waiting period. Some time should have been provided before the change took effect.”Repeat travellers to the US may, under some circumstances, renew their visas without appearing at the embassy or consulate for an interview. The visa waiver checklist for applicants, except those 14 years of age and 80 & above includes: “(is) a citizen of India/Bhutan or a lawful resident of India/Bhutan.(Has) a previous U.S. visa in the same class as the visa for which wish to apply and (the) prior visa in the same visa class is still valid or expired within the last 12 months. Most recent visa was issued on or after my 14th birthday,” according to a US Govt website.While India-US travel is reaching new highs post Covid, the travel industry says it remains way below potential due to two factors — long visa interview wait times and few direct flights due to US airlines not using Russian airspace. A record number of Indians travelled to the US last calendar year, more than CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh which had overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh.

'India not neutral, on the side of peace': PM Modi on Russia-Ukraine war



Hugs, handshakes and gifts



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday concluded his two-day visit to the US where he held bilateral talks with President Donald Trump. The two leaders discussed key issues including trades, tariffs, extradition of 26/11 accused, Russia-Ukraine war, purchase of F-35 fighter jets and India's border dispute with China.Setting the tone of the ""MEGA partnership"", PM Modi highlighted India and US's shared commitment to economic growth and global leadership.""President Trump often talks about MAGA. In India, we are working towards a Viksit Bharat, which in American context translates into MIGA. And together, the India-USA have a MEGA partnership for prosperity!"" he said.India and the US set a bilateral trade target of $500 billion by 2030 in a effort to ensure joint development, joint production and transfer of technology. The terms of the agreement would be decided soon, said PM Modi.""The people of America are well aware of President Trump's motto 'MAGA - Make America Great Again.' The people of India too are focusing on heritage and development as they move forward at a fast pace and with a firm resolve towards the goal of Viksit Bharat 2047,"" PM Modi said.""In the language of America, it's Make India Great Again - MIGA. When America and India work together, this MAGA plus MIGA becomes a 'mega partnership for prosperity' and it is this mega spirit that gives new scale and scope to our objectives. Today, we have also set a target to increase our bilateral trade to more than double, reaching $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on finalising very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement,"" he addedMarking a significant boost to defense cooperation, Donald Trump said that the US would sell F-35 stealth fighter jets to India, placing the country among an elite group operating the advanced aircraft.""Starting this year, we'll be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters,"" Trump said.The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, the most extensively deployed fifth-generation fighter jet, participated in the 15th edition of Aero India, Asia's largest aerospace and defense expo earlier this month.In a significant boost to the energy sector, India is set to buy US energy of almost $25 billion in the near future.""Last year, we purchased about $15 billion in US Energy output. There is a good chance that this figure will go up to as much as 25 billion dollars in the near future,"" ministry of external affairs said in a presser.The talks between the two leaders focused also on increasing energy purchases, which could play a key role in balancing the trade deficit between India and the United States. Officials indicated that expanded energy trade is a strong possibility and could contribute to narrowing the gap in bilateral trade.The US president has offered to mediate in the India-China border dispute and has called for a de-escalation.""I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on. If I could be of help, I'd love to help, because that should be stopped,"" Trump said.PM Modi talked about the issue of illegal immigration and expressed India's readiness to take back those citizens living unlawfully in the US. However, he emphasized that the issue extended beyond deportation, highlighting the role of human traffickers who mislead individuals with false promises.There were no comments on the ""inhuman treatment"" given to the recent deportees when they were restrained and sent back to the country.""Those who stay in other countries illegally do not have any legal right to be there. As far as India and the US are concerned, we have always said that those who are verified and are truly the citizens of India - if they live in the US illegally, India is ready to take them back,"" PM Modi said.US approved the extradition of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana to India, marking another key takeaway from the visit.""Today I am pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and very evil people of the world, and having to do with the horrific Mumbai terrorist attack, to face justice in India. So, he is going back to India to face justice,"" Trump said.In January, the US Supreme Court had approved Rana's extradition by dismissing his review petition in the case.PM Modi's visit to the US did not have a significant impact on Donald Trump's recent move to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from India.Rather, Trump said that the States would prefer a ""reciprocal approach"" on tariffs. ""We are, right now, a reciprocal nation. We are going to, if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them. Whatever another country charges, we're charging them,"" Trump said.He also reiterated his ""100% tariffs"" on Brics nations threat if they tried to replace the US dollar with any other currency.""I don't care, but Brics was put there for a bad purpose and most of those people don't want it. They don't even want to talk about it now. They're afraid to talk about it because I told them if they want to play games with the dollar, then they're going to be hit with a 100 per cent tariff. The day they mention that they want to do it and they will come back and say we beg you, we beg you not to do this. Brics is dead since I mentioned that. Brics died the minute I mentioned that and I know I remember when Obama and Biden, in particular, I guess he said that oh, they have us over a barrel,"" he said.PM Modi reiterated India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war and said that the country was in favour of establishing peace.""I have always been in close contact with Russia and Ukraine. I have met the leaders of both countries. Many people are in a misconception that India is neutral, but I want to reiterate that India is not neutral; we are on a side, and that is peace,"" he said.He lauded Trump's efforts to resolve the conflict through dialogue, and said that negotiations were the key to ending the crisis.""I have said that 'this is not a time of war' in front of the media when President Putin was with me. Even today, my conviction is that the solutions to war cannot be found on the battlefield, and ultimately, we have to be at the table,"" he said.PM Modi and US President Trump shared a warm moment with hugs and handshakes at the White House.Trump also gifted PM Modi a book titled 'Our Journey together' which featured images from key events like 'Howdy Modi' and 'Namaste Trump'.The book signed by Trump said, ""Mr Prime Minister, you are great.""","India and the US set a bilateral trade target of $500 billion by 2030 in a effort to ensure joint development, joint production and transfer of technology.

NEW DELHI: Amid pressure from the United States, govt has slashed the import duty on bourbon whiskey from 150% to 100% and lowered tariffs on several varieties of wines.Duty on wines made of fresh grapes, and vermouth, as well as some other fermented beverages and unadulterated ethyl alcohol with 80% alcohol strength have been cut to 100%. The import of these products together added up to around $1 billion during the last financial year.In case of bourbon, the basic customs duty has been fixed at 50%, while agricultural cess of 50% has also been imposed. Last year, the imports of the two tariff lines related to bourbon were estimated at $2.6 million, while those from the US were pegged at $0.8 million.The duty cuts were notified on Thursday, hours before PM Narendra Modi's meeting with US president Donald Trump, where tariffs were at the centerstage of the discussions. Trump reiterated his promise to impose what he called reciprocal tariffs to keep American industry competitive. Just before meeting Modi, he had also said that India had among the highest tariffs in the world.India's duty on whisky and other alcoholic beverages have been an area of concern for most - from Australia to the UK, the European Union, Switzerland and the US. While India has slashed duties on Australian wine as part of the trade agreement, the UK has been putting pressure to lower the levy for Scotch as part of the trade negotiations. Similarly, EU has been demanding a cut for wine produced in the trading bloc.In the Budget presented on February 1, government had slashed import duty on a range of products, including high-end bikes, such as the iconic Harley Davidson, in a move seen to be focused on escaping the heat on tariffs. But that has not stopped Trump from raising concerns over duties in India as he cited Harley Davidson as an example during an interaction with the media.","Duty on wines made of fresh grapes, and vermouth, as well as some other fermented beverages and unadulterated ethyl alcohol with 80% alcohol strength have been cut to 100%.

THIRVANANTHAPURAM: The Centre has approved an interest-free capital investment loan of Rs 529.5 crore for rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in landslide-hit Wayanad under a special scheme for providing financial assistance to states. The loan, with a repayment period of 50 years, is earmarked for 16 projects, including township development, road infrastructure and construction of public buildings. It was was formally communicated to state govt on February 11.The Centre has sought detailed expenditure estimates by March as the loan is sanctioned for the 2024-25 financial year. It also specified that the allocated funds should be fully utilised before March 31.State finance minister K N Balagopal said the tight deadline would be a problem. ""This is a loan, not a grant, and must be used before March 31. It's an impractical solution as the funds are meant for infrastructure projects like roads,"" he said, adding that the issue would be raised with the Centre.The Centre has warned that any diversion of funds could result in the reduction or withdrawal of the sanctioned amount. The disbursal and utilisation of the loan will be closely monitored to ensure compliance with the outlined guidelines, it said.The landslides that occurred in Punchirimattam, Mundakkai and Chooralmala villages in Meppadi panchayat of Wayanad on July 30 last year had claimed 298 lives (including 44 people reported missing), besides causing widespread destruction. State govt had sought a special package of Rs 2,000 crore for rehabilitation, but the request remains under judicial review.","The loan, with a repayment period of 50 years, is earmarked for 16 projects, including township development, road infrastructure and construction of public buildings.

Trump Military Plane 'Throws Out' 104 'Illegal Indians' At Amritsar Airport | US Mass Deportations

AMRITSAR: Two more planeloads of Indians deported from the US are scheduled to land in Amritsar over the weekend, with the first of these flights expected around 10am Saturday with 119 illegal immigrants.The impending sorties, just over 10 days after a US military C-17 Globemaster aircraft brought back 104 deportees, led CM Bhagwant Mann to slam Centre for allegedly trying to ""defame Punjab and Punjabis"" by turning holy city of Amritsar into what he termed ""a deportation centre"".Sources said 67 of 119 passengers on the second deportation flight were from Punjab, while Haryana accounted for second-largest group with 33. Rest of deportees are from Gujarat (8), UP (3), Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan (2 each), and Himachal and J&K (1 each).There was no official confirmation of the break-up and the arrival time of the third US aircraft until late Friday.When the first flight from US landed on February 5, Congress & AAP questioned why Amritsar was picked as the destination.Mann said despite his criticism of the move, he would welcome deportees, take them to Golden Temple langar and do everything possible to rehabilitate them. ""This is a deliberate attempt to send out the message that only Punjabis travel illegally,"" he alleged, saying foreign ministry should ""divert the aircraft to Delhi or Ahmedabad.

MHA seeks President’s approval to prosecute former Delhi minister Satyendar Jain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mha-seeks-presidents-approval-to-prosecute-former-delhi-minister-satyendar-jain/articleshow/118240478.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs ( MHA ) on Friday sought the President of India ’s approval to prosecute former Delhi minister and AAP leader Satyendar Jain under Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Suraksha Sanhita (BNS), 2023, officials said.According to PTI sources, the request is based on evidence provided by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has found sufficient grounds for prosecution in the case.Officials said, “On the basis of the material received from the Enforcement Directorate, sufficient evidence has been found to grant the sanction.”The MHA’s move comes after reviewing findings from the ED’s investigation into alleged financial irregularities linked to Jain. The final decision now rests with the President.The ED’s case against Jain stems from a 2017 FIR filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under Section 13(2) (criminal misconduct by a public servant) read with Section 13(e) (disproportionate assets) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.The agency alleged that Jain, with the help of his family members and associates, amassed disproportionate assets between February 14, 2015, and May 31, 2017, while serving as a minister in the Delhi government. The ED further claimed that several companies owned and controlled by Jain received accommodation entries amounting to ₹4.8 crore from shell companies in exchange for cash routed through Kolkata-based hawala operators.Two other accused, Vaibhav Jain and Ankush Jain, were said to be major shareholders and directors in three of these companies. The Delhi high court had recently dismissed their default bail pleas on October 1.The court highlighted the importance of individual liberty, particularly in cases governed by stringent laws such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). It relied on the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Manish Sisodia case, which underscored the fundamental right to a speedy trial.Jain’s counsel, senior advocate N Hariharan and advocate Vivek Jain, argued that he had spent 18 months in custody, while former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia, arrested in the alleged excise policy scam, had spent 17 months before being granted bail. They pointed out that the case involves 108 witnesses and over 5,000 pages of documents, making the trial a lengthy process.Opposing the bail plea, the ED contended that Jain could influence witnesses if released. However, the court imposed strict conditions, barring him from travelling outside India without permission, contacting witnesses, or influencing the trial in any way.Jain’s legal team also cited previous judgments in interim PMLA cases where bail had been granted despite stringent conditions. They noted that almost all accused in the Delhi excise policy case, which allegedly involves hundreds of crores, have been granted bail.","The request is based on evidence provided by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has found sufficient grounds for prosecution in the case.

Amid the launch of new initiatives, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump reaffirmed in a joint statement that the India-US partnership is central to a free and open Indo-Pacific. However, as Trump takes upon himself to resolve conflicts and in his own way, a glaring omission from the statement was any mention of the Russia-Ukraine war, or any stock reference to the UN Charter or territorial integrity on that issue, that had featured prominently in such bilateral and even multilateral documents with the Biden administration.According to the joint statement, the leaders also committed to strengthening law enforcement cooperation to take decisive action against illegal immigration networks, organized crime syndicates, including narco-terrorists human and arms traffickers, as well as other elements who threaten public and diplomatic safety and security, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both nations. India sees this as important for putting a check on the activities of Khalistan separatists on US soil. “There's a commitment to strengthening law enforcement cooperation in this regard and this is especially significant from our perspective given some events that have taken place,’’ said foreign secretary Vikram Misri. The leaders also publicly called upon Pakistan to stop cross-border terrorism.According to government sources, Modi had detailed discussions with Trump about concerns on both sides regarding market access and the problems arising out of Chinese industrial overcapacity, while asking officials to conclude a mutually beneficial trade deal by fall this year. “They discussed concerns arising from other territories with over capacities that take advantage of consumption in countries like India and the US. They discussed ways and means to address these issues in an overall context,’’ said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The joint statement was also shorn of any focus on climate or global health, issues that made the cut with the previous administration.The Trump administration strongly backed initiatives like IMEEC and iCET although the latter seemed to have been rechristened TRUST (transforming the relationship utilising strategic technology). TRUST, according to the joint statement, will catalyse government-to-government, academia and private sector collaboration to promote application of critical and emerging technologies in areas like defence, AI, semiconductors and quantum computing, while ensuring protection for sensitive technologies. They agreed to finalise a US-India roadmap on accelerating AI infrastructure.While there was no direct mention of the conflict in West Asia, the leaders agreed to increase cooperation, enhance diplomatic consultations, and increase tangible collaboration with partners in the region. They highlighted the importance of investing in critical infrastructure and economic corridors to advance peace and security in the region, pledging new announcements this year to take forward IMEEC and I2U2 – comprising India, Israel, UAE and US – initiatives.On cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, as Quad partners, the leaders reiterated that this partnership is underpinned by the recognition of Asean centrality, adherence to international law, support for safety and freedom of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the seas, and unimpeded lawful commerce.“PM Modi looks forward to hosting President Trump in New Delhi for the Quad leaders’ Summit, ahead of which the leaders will activate new Quad initiatives on shared airlift capacity to support civilian response to natural disasters and maritime patrols to improve interoperability,’’ said the joint statement. The 2 sides also launched the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture, a new bilateral forum to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce.The leaders welcomed the proposed Indian amendments of the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) for nuclear reactors, saying this path forward will unlock plans to build large US-designed reactors and enable collaboration to develop, deploy and scale up nuclear power generation with advanced small modular reactors.As expected, there was a strong condemnation of terrorism with Trump and Modi backing action against groups like LeT, JeM, ISIS and al Qaeda. As the US formally announced the extradition of Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana, the leaders called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, and Pathankot attacks and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.","PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump reaffirmed in a joint statement that the India-US partnership is central to a free and open Indo-Pacific.

She said Centre has provided financial assistance to the tune of Rs 100 crore to states and UTs for upgrading and setting up of anti-human trafficking units covering every district to address 'prevention, protection and prosecution' aspects of the child kidnapping cases.But the data provided by states and collated by Centre narrated a heart-rending story of thousands of parents waiting for years for the return of their missing children.

On Friday, they cradled the little one and celebrated her new birth.Little Pihu will live.According to police, Pihu's grandmother had slit her throat and dumped her in a trash bin in Madhya Pradesh's Rajgarh town soon after her birth. Her mother and the granny have since been arrested and charged with attempted murder and abandonment.Thanks to tireless efforts of doctors and nurses at Bhopal's Kamla Nehru Hospital , Pihu survived. The cut in her neck was deep but miraculously missed vital veins and arteries. Surgeons sutured her cuts and repaired blood vessels in multiple surgeries. Over the past month, the little one was never left alone, not even for a moment. Like the medics, the baby didn't give up.A month later, doctors declared her out of danger and discharged her on Friday.On Jan 11, passersby found a newborn abandoned in a dustbin in Rajgarh district, around 100km from Bhopal. Blood was still pouring from her slit throat. Locals informed cops, who rushed the baby to district hospital and then brought her to Bhopal.""It took us more than a month. She had severe injuries, but she braved it and survived,"" said Dr Dheerendra Shrivastav, HOD, Kamla Nehru Hospital. ""We handed her over to a shelter home in Rajgarh with permission of Child Welfare Committee,"" he added. ""This is the third such case in the past few months. We named one of the girls Khushi, and this infant Pihu.""For the past four years, MP has recorded the highest number of baby abandonments in the country. At least one infant was dumped every second day in the state during this period. Most die - some are eaten by dogs and wild animals, while others die from exposure. As per 2022 NCRB report, 175 newborns were abandoned or thrown into bushes after birth in MP and 174 cases were registered - highest in the country.","Pihu's grandmother slit her throat and dumped her in a trash bin soon after her birth.

AHMEDABAD: An insurance company is liable to pay compensation in an accident case involving a truck driver without a proper licence if it fails to establish negligence on part of the vehicle owner in verifying the driver's licence, Gujarat high court has ruled.The observation came while dismissing a petition by ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co Ltd, which challenged a motor accident claims tribunal 's order awarding compensation to an accident victim.One Jayesh Dharavia of Jamnagar died in a road accident involving a truck in 2010. The truck driver, Ramsingh Yadav, had a licence to drive a two-wheeler and a light motor vehicle, but not a truck, which falls in the category of a heavy motor vehicle. In 2014, a motor accident claims tribunal ordered truck owner Sureshchandra Aum Prakash and his insurer, ICICI Lombard, to pay Rs 19 lakh, along with 7.5% interest, as compensation to the deceased's family.The insurance company moved HC, contending that the driver was not authorised to drive the truck. Citing breach of policy terms and the vehicle owner's failure in employing a qualified driver with a valid licence, the company argued that it could not be held liable to pay the compensation.The HC said the insurer had failed to establish that it had requested the vehicle owner to verify the driver's licence, or that it had drawn the owner's attention to be vigilant in this regard. The insurer also could not prove that the owner knew that the driver's licence was not valid, or that he employed the driver despite knowing.","ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co Ltd challenged a motor accident claims tribunal's order awarding compensation to an accident victim.

Facing flak, Kerala restores full funding for

minority scholarships

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The LDF government in Kerala decided on Friday to restore full funding of nine minority scholarships that had been slashed by 50% last month, triggering allegations about students from marginalised communities being forced to bear a disproportionate share of cuts purportedly meant to reduce the exchequer's burden.The policy reversal order states that the original allocation of Rs 13.6 crore for these nine scholarships had been restored. The Pinarayi Vijayan govt also announced an additional allocation of Rs 11 crore for the Margadeepam scholarship , raising the total plan size to Rs 20 crore. Although this scholarship was not among the nine affected by the cuts reported by TOI on Jan 31, the increase in its allocation reflects a renewed effort to support students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, sources said.The rollback came amid criticism from opposition parties, academicians and community leaders, who flagged the cuts as being a potential trigger for higher dropouts.The Prof Joseph Mundassery Scholarship, which supports economically disadvantaged high achievers from the minority community, had taken the biggest cut. The scholarship pays Rs 10,000 each to SSLC students securing A+ in all subjects and Rs 15,000 to those excelling in higher secondary exam and vocational courses.The Mother Teresa Scholarship, which supports students from Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi communities pursuing diploma courses in nursing and paramedical institutions, was among those hit by now-revoked cuts. Funding for civil services exam coaching for minority candidates, UGC coaching reimbursement and scholarships for students studying abroad have also been fully restored.","The policy reversal order states that the original allocation of Rs 13.6 crore for these nine scholarships had been restored.

AMRAVATI: Even beggars don't accept one rupee in alms, but govt is giving crop insurance for this sum and this too is being misused, Maharashtra agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate said Friday, triggering sharp reactions from farm outfits and opposition parties.The minister, an NCP MLA from Nashik, was answering a query on the Re 1 crop insurance scheme after a meeting in Amravati.Kokate, however, clarified there was no plan to discontinue the scheme, but changes would be made to plug loopholes. ""Govt rejected 4 lakh insurance claim applications. These may have been turned down because of erroneous entries. The scheme has been beneficial, but it was turned into a scam by certain elements.""Former Congress president Nana Patole said, ""The Mahayuti govt must apologise to farmers. What was promised for Re 1 is now being hiked 100 times. And the agriculture minister is insulting farmers by comparing them with beggars."" Later, Kokate said his statement was ""misinterpreted and distorted"", and he was ""only talking about irregularities by outside companies"".Maharashtra govt introduced a crop insurance scheme for a rupee in 2023.Earlier, farmers had to shell out around Rs 750 to Rs 1,100 a hectare towards premium, which is now borne by the state. A spokesperson of Swabhimani Shetkari Paksha said Vidarbha is already dogged by farm suicides and such statements can aggravate the situation. Activist Vijay Jawandhia said, ""Charging one rupee is also a mere formality. Govt should make it free, and applications should go directly from the talati's office. Now, farmers depend on community service centres to fill up their forms. Direct applications will do away with fraud.""

NEW DELHI: Sending a strong message to IAS officers reluctant to opt for central deputation, govt in the latest empanelment of joint secretaries has included only 16 such officers of 2009 batch in the 'initial' list out of the total 119 from the batch. This is the lowest number of IAS officers from any batch who have been empanelled in the 'initial' list.Sources said fewer officers made it to the list as govt has strictly applied the norm of minimum two years service as a deputy secretary or director in the central govt for an IAS to be eligible for empanelment as a JS . Though this norm was made applicable from 2007 batch onwards, sources said there were relaxations for officers from 2007 and 2008 batches.The empanelment of JS in the past few years shows that 49 IAS officers out of 89 from the 2005 batch made it to the 'initial' list. Similarly, 55 out of 87 IAS officers of 2006 batch were empanelled as JS in the first list. In the case of 2007 batch IAS officers, 31 out of 89 were initially empanelled as JS. As per notifications of DoPT, 64 IAS officers of 2008 batch out of 111 were empanelled as JS in first list.Though govt has come out with fresh empanelment of officers as JS of these batches in the past under 'initial leftover' and 'initial deferred' categories, top officials said the first list of empanelment from 2009 batch officers is a message to all who are not keen to come to work in central govt.",This is the lowest number of IAS officers from any batch who have been empanelled in the 'initial' list.

RIL made 'unfair' enrichment, panel had said

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday ruled against Reliance Industries Ltd and its foreign partners in a dispute over the govt's $1.7 billion claim against the energy giant for making "" unjust enrichment "" by extracting gas that migrated from state-run ONGC's blocks adjacent to their KG-D6 field off the Andhra coast.The bench of Justices Rekha Palli and Saurabh Banerjee quashed an international arbitration tribunal 's ruling rejecting the govt's claim and overturned Justice Anup Jairam Bhambani's verdict upholding the arbitral award in favour of the RIL-led consortium.""We are setting aside the impugned order dated May 9, 2023, passed by the single judge, and the arbitral award passed by the arbitral tribunal in 2018, being contrary to the settled position of law along with the pending applications, if any, leaving the parties to bear their own costs,"" the bench said.Justice Bhambani had held, ""This court is not persuaded to hold that the conclusions drawn by the arbitral tribunal are such that no reasonable person would reach. Suffice it to say that the view taken by the arbitral tribunal is most certainly a 'possible view', which calls for no interference... this court finds no ground to interfere with the majority arbitral award; which is accordingly upheld.""The case dates back to 2013 when ONGC claimed its IG and KG-DWN-98/2 blocks adjacent to RIL's KG-D6 field shared a common gas pool. It moved court, saying RIL, which had already put KG-D6 into operation, was extracting gas that migrated from its blocks that were still under development.Oil ministry approached Delhi high court after the arbitration panel led by Singapore-based Lawrence Woo struck down its demand for nearly $1.6 billion in cost, including interest, and $175 million as additional cumulative 'profit petroleum' payable till March 31, 2016, towards ""disgorgement of unjust enrichment"" made by RIL.Once US consultant DeGolyer & MacNaughton, appointed under court order for an independent study, affirmed the continuity of the gas pool, the ministry appointed a one-man committee of retired Delhi HC chief justice A P Shah to suggest a course of action. The committee said RIL had made ""unfair"" enrichment and was liable to pay. The ministry then slapped costs on RIL, which challenged it through international arbitration.The arbitration panel rejected govt's charges and asked Centre to pay legal costs to RIL. Govt challenged this HC, which upheld the arbitration tribunal's rejection of the govt's allegation.The tribunal had said, ""RIL extracted whatever gas became available in the course of petroleum operations within their contract area. Reliance deducted the 'cost petroleum', calculated the 'profit petroleum' and shared the requisite portion of the profit petroleum with the ministry.""The ministry has not claimed Reliance did not pay it govt's share of profit petroleum for the entire quantity of gas extracted by Reliance, including migrated gas.On the allegation of RIL committing fraud by suppressing knowledge about the continuity of the gas pool, the tribunal had said ""non-disclosure of one solitary D&M Report-2003, though a technical breach of terms of the PSC, was not a material breach of contract"".", Delhi high court rules against Reliance Industries Ltd and its foreign partners. Justices Rekha Palli and Saurabh Banerjee quashed an international arbitration tribunal's ruling rejecting the govt's claim.

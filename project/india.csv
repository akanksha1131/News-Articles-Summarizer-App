DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami recalled various achievements of his government as it completed four years in the state on Friday. CM Dhami highlighted the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), the promise it made to the people.""UCC was the resolution of our election. We implemented the UCC within the state.

That resolution was accomplished, and we have completed that work,"" Dhami told ANI.UCC was implemented in the state just seven months ago, on January 27, making Uttarakhand the first state in the country to implement the law.Earlier on May 3, after its implementation, CM Dhami had lauded how the law had freed muslim women from ""social evils.""""UCC has freed Muslim sisters from social evils. Now all women will get justice in inheritance and property rights as well,"" CM Dhami had said during his speech.He also said that many people are creating ""confusion"" about UCC, but the law is not against any religion or sect.""UCC is not against any religion or sect. Many people are creating confusion about it. This is an effort to establish harmony in equality by eradicating the evil practices of society.This is such a necessary reform that will benefit the entire society,"" CM Dhami said.Just four months after the implementation of UCC, more than 1.5 lakh applications were received from across the state, covering nearly 98 per cent of villages, indicating widespread public support for the law, according to CM Dhami.The chief ministersaid that a robust system has been developed to implement the UCC. To make the process more accessible and user-friendly for the general public, a dedicated portal and mobile app have been developed.Additionally, the chief minister said that more than 14,000 Common Service Centres (CSCs) at the village level have been integrated with the system.The chief minister also emphasised the need to implement a revision of the state's land law, which restricts the sale of agricultural and horticultural land in 11 districts. Of the 13 districts in Uttarakhand, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts have been exempted from the stringent amendments to the land law.","Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami completed four years in office on Friday.

Landmark Land Law Reforms: CM Dhami marks 4 years of Uttarakhand government's progressive agenda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/landmark-land-law-reforms-cm-dhami-marks-4-years-of-uttarakhand-governments-progressive-agenda/articleshow/122240213.cms,"Mr. Pushkar Singh Dhami

DEHRADUN: On the occasion of the completion of four years of the Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami 's completing four years, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami spoke about the several achievements of his government, including the revision of the state's land law that restricts the sale of agricultural and horticulture in 11 districts.Of the 13 districts in Uttarakhand, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts have been exempted from the stringent amendments to the land law.Speaking to ANI, Dhami said that these stringent amendments to Uttarakhand's land law were in line with public sentiment. He added that the state government has introduced various legislation, including the anti-cheating law, which has become a model for the entire nation.""People had long-standing expectations about the land law. We have also implemented it. Be it anti-riot law, anti-conversion law to prevent religious conversion, or an encroachment removal campaign, in which we have so far cleared more than 6,500 acres of land from encroachment. The anti-cheating law has become a model for the entire country,"" Dhami said.Highlighting the efforts of the Uttarakhand government in combating corruption, CM Dhami said that his government has taken action against those who have engaged in corruption regardless of their ""position"".""Apart from this, we have taken major action against corruption. Earlier, people used to say that small fish are being caught, and big fish are being released. Today, along with small fish, big fish are also being caught. Those who are the crocodiles of corruption are also not being spared, regardless of their position,"" the CM said.In February, the state legislative assembly passed the Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Destruction and Land Reforms Act, 1950) (Amendment) Bill, 2025.At that time, Dhami had stated that the state government laid the foundation for land reforms in accordance with public sentiment. Work will be done continuously on land management and land reforms in future as well.The Uttarakhand government has remained committed to protecting the state's resources and lands from land mafias. The purpose for which people have bought land was not used but misused, Dhami said.The chief minister said that permission for purchase for agricultural and industrial purposes in the state was given at the collector level. ""It has now been abolished in 11 districts, and provision has been made to take decisions at the state government level only in Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar. The land transfer of more than 12.5 acres in the approved limit in favour of any person has been abolished in 11 districts and will be decided at the state government level only in Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts,"" CM Dhami said.He further added that an affidavit has been made mandatory for purchasing 250 square meters of land for residential projects. ""If the affidavit is found to be false, the land will be vested in the state government. Permission to purchase the thrust sector and notified Khasra number land under micro, small and medium industries, which was given at the collector level, will now be given at the state government level,"" he said.The chief minister stated that many significant changes have been introduced in the new law. He said that the government had also taken views from stakeholders in Gairsain. ""In these new provisions, the views of the people of the state have been taken, and suggestions have also been taken from everyone. Suggestions were also taken from the people in their districts at the District Magistrates and Tehsil levels of all the districts. This law has been made on the request of suggestions from everyone,"" he further said.The amendment covers land purchases outside municipal limits and excludes Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts. Another major change is that land bought for tourism, industry, and educational facilities will have a ceiling of 12.5 acres in the 11 districts. In the remaining two districts, permission can be sought to purchase more land.",Pushkar Singh Dhami has completed four years as the chief minister of Uttarakhand.

From access to agency: Uplifting India’s marginalised,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-access-to-agency-uplifting-indias-marginalised/articleshow/122239110.cms,".

.

India’s empowerment journey is at a critical inflection point. While its developmental story often showcases soaring GDP figures and rising global stature, this progress masks a more complex reality. For millions on the margins, advancement remains a distant promise. Caste, gender, disability, religion, and sexuality frequently intersect, forging layers of exclusion that persist despite legislative guarantees.It’s in these invisible trenches that the real battle for empowerment is unfolding — quiet, yet transformational. At the heart of this shift is a recalibration of what empowerment means.No longer is it just about delivering benefits. As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and feminist scholar Naila Kabeer argue, empowerment must expand people’s capabilities and life choices. That means not merely giving marginalisedcommunities access to goods and services, but enabling them to exercise voice, agency, and dignity.India has, in recent years, initiated an array of legal and policy instruments to address entrenched inequities. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016), Forest Rights Act (2006), and Transgender Persons Act (2019) are emblematic of this shift.Schemes like MGNREGA and the Ujjwala Yojana have brought work and clean fuel to rural doorsteps. Yet implementation reveals uneven outcomes, especially among Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women with disabilities.Bihar’s Viklang Sashaktikaran Yojna and Telangana’s Aasara pension scheme are examples of state-level adaptations that attempt to bridge local gaps. Civil society networks like Wada Na Todo Abhiyan monitor and pressure govts to fulfil promises, adding a layer of accountability. Meanwhile, institutions such as NITI Aayog ’s SDG coordination centres are beginning to integrate community voices in planning and monitoring processes.But real change hinges on more than schemes. It requires systems that understand complexity. A tribal woman with a disability, for instance, doesn’t just need a wheelchair ramp. She needs coordinated entitlements, accessible communication, and community support that acknowledges the multi-layered nature of her exclusion.Corporate India, too, is stepping in with purpose. CSR is evolving beyond cheque-writing. Projects like ITC’s Mission Sunehra Kal, which has mobilised over 3.5 lakh women into self-help groups, or HUL’s Project Shakti, empowering over 1.3 lakh rural women with entrepreneurship and hygiene training, are crafting new templates for inclusive growth. Vedanta’s Nand Ghar and NTPC’s Girl Empowerment Mission are weaving nutrition, education, and health into holistic empowerment.These initiatives are not without limitations. Intersectional targeting is still nascent. While SC/ST inclusion has improved, a closer look reveals gaps in addressing compounded vulnerabilities—say, for transgender persons with disabilities or religious minorities in remote areas.CSR interventions must therefore move from outcome counting to impact mapping, using tools like storytelling, community audits, and life histories to understand what change looks like from the ground. International partnerships add momentum. UNDP-supported projects like the Gender Seal for Development are institutionalising gender equity across health systems and skilling programmes like SMILE.A major structural reform is the govt’s push for third-party evaluations of centrally-sponsored schemes, undertaken by the Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO). These assessments are unearthing the gaps and successes that often escape attention.The convergence of law, policy, civil society, and corporate commitment offers an unparalleled opportunity. But the real test lies in embedding intersectionality — in seeing the individual not just through one identity marker but through all that shapes their lived reality. Welfare delivery must give way to systems of recognition, redistribution, and representation.Only then will India’s growth story be truly inclusive, not just in charts and numbers, but in lives changed, voices heard, and futures reimagined.","India’s empowerment journey is at a critical inflection point.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Trinidad and Tobago on Friday (Thursday in T&T) for a two-day official visit, marking the second leg of his five nation tour.During his visit to the Caribbean country, he referred to his counterpart, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar as “Bihar ki Beti” (daughter of Bihar), highlighting her ancestral roots in Bihar's Buxar.“Kamla ji’s ancestors lived in Buxar, Bihar. She herself has visited there. People proudly call her Bihar ki Beti,” PM Modi said while addressing the Indian community in the capital Port of Spain. “Many people here have roots in Bihar,” he added, applauding the strong cultural connection between the two nations.Upon his arrival, he was warmly welcomed at the airport by T&T PM Kamla, who was dressed in Indian attire, along with her entire Cabinet. Many Cabinet members were also seen wearing Indian attire.In Port of Spain, PM Modi was greeted with a traditional Bhojpuri Chautaal performance. Sharing the moment on X, the PM wrote: “Bhojpuri Chautaal echoes in Trinidad & Tobago!”Addressing the Indian diaspora, he praised their contributions to the country’s development and spoke about their strong ancestral ties to India. He also brought with him a replica of the Ram Mandir and holy water from the Sangam at the Maha Kumbh and the Sarayu River in Ayodhya as a gesture of respect and connection.PM Modi also highlighted the global importance of Bihar’s heritage, saying: “Bihar’s legacy is a matter of pride not just for India, but for the entire world.

Startups to giants: India rides the AI wave to sustainability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/startups-to-giants-india-rides-the-ai-wave-to-sustainability/articleshow/122238919.cms,"India is fast becoming a global vanguard in marrying artificial intelligence (AI) with sustainable development. As the world faces mounting climate challenges, the country’s businesses, ranging from IT behemoths to climate-tech start-ups, are weaving AI into the fabric of their green goals, making India one of the most AI-active nations in sustainability initiatives.A striking 64% of Indian companies are now actively deploying AI to boost the impact of their sustainability efforts — the highest proportion among surveyed countries, according to IBM’s 2024 sustainability readiness study. This isn’t just a sign of technological enthusiasm, but of a maturing mindset that places environmental responsibility at the heart of corporate strategy.India’s journey is as much about economic transformation as it is about ecological conscience. In 2022–23, the digital economy accounted for nearly 12% of the national income, underlining the country’s success in harnessing tech for green growth.Take Infosys, for instance. The IT giant achieved carbon neutrality in 2020 — well ahead of global targets — by using AI and digital tools to drive energy efficiency, adopt renewables, and run offset projects that also benefit rural communities. The company was also the first Indian firm to join the RE100 initiative, committing to 100% renewable electricity.But it’s not just industry titans making waves. India’s climate-tech ecosystem now boasts over 800 operational start-ups, which have collectively raised more than $3.6 billion between 2014 and 2024.Among them is Alt Carbon, a venture leading the charge in carbon removal technologies. The company combines geochemical innovation, environmental data platforms, and scientific validation to sequester CO 2 through enhanced rock weathering and soil improvement on farmland. With its cutting-edge platform ‘Atlas’, Alt Carbon can monitor soil chemistry, water dynamics, and ecosystem health at high resolution, and aims to remove 5 million metric tons of CO 2 by 2030. AI and other emerging technologies like IoT (internet of things), 5G, and blockchain are transforming how Indian enterprises think about sustainability. From resource-efficient smart grids to traceable, ethical supply chains and real-time emissions monitoring, digital tools are offering tangible solutions to previously intractable problems.This momentum is also evident in platforms such as EY’s ESG Compass, which supports businesses in navigating ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) goals through data automation, risk analytics, and benchmarking tools. Such solutions are helping organisations make more informed, sustainable decisions while increasing transparency for stakeholders.Yet, as PM Narendra Modi recently reminded the world at the AI Action Summit 2025, sustainable AI must not merely be powered by clean energy, but also be efficient by design—light on data, lean on compute power, and accessible to the broader developer community. “After all,” he said, “the human brain can compose poetry and design spaceships while using less power than most light bulbs.”Indeed, while AI tools are proving their worth, there are pressing concerns that must be addressed — particularly around data privacy, interoperability, and ethical design. Most current sustainability-driven AI tools focus on energy emissions during training, often ignoring emissions during the deployment and inference phases. Moreover, many are tailored for highly skilled developers, limiting access for users relying on APIs or nocode platforms.As The Times of India Social Impact Summit approaches, the conversation is expected to pivot around these very themes: how to scale tech-enabled ESG and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) efforts, ensure inclusive adoption, and drive measurable impact.With diverse stakeholders converging, the summit presented by Malabar Gold & Diamonds — Ernst & Young is knowledge partner — aims to serve as a crucible for collaboration and future-ready sustainability solutions. It is being held on July 11 and 12, 2025, in Mumbai.",India is fast becoming a global vanguard in marrying artificial intelligence with sustainable development. 64% of Indian companies are now actively deploying AI to boost the impact of their sustainability efforts.

Donald Trump Predicts Major India-US Trade Deal With Lower Tariffs Before July 9 Deadline Ends

How US Trade Deal With Vietnam Will Hit China

World’s Trading Dilemma & China’s Warning

Challenge for China & Its Worry

US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, tariff wars, and moves to seal trade deals with major trading partners in Asia and Europe has China increasingly on the guard - and rightly so! These trade deals could potentially separate Chinese companies from global supply networks, despite the recently announced trade truce between the US and China.US officials are actively negotiating with key trading allies in Asia and Europe before July 9, seeking arrangements that could limit Chinese involvement and address what the US considers unfair trade practices by China.The temporary 90-day suspension by Trump on what he termed ""reciprocal"" tariffs affecting many US trading partners concludes on July 9. These countries risk facing substantially higher tariffs if they fail to establish trade agreements with the US.Many countries are taking steps to maintain positive relations with Washington. Since Trump's tariff announcement in April, Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea have implemented regulations to prevent product rerouting through their territories to the US.Also Read | What is Donald Trump’s net worth? Billionaire US President has a big portfolio of cryptocurrencies, stocks & more - top details South Korean authorities have intensified their efforts against transshipments, noting an increase in such activities. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te addressed this concern and subsequently introduced regulations requiring all US-destined exports to include legal certification of their Taiwanese origin.President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday a new tariff structure with Vietnam, marking the first such arrangement. According to Trump's social media announcement, Vietnamese exports to the US will face a 20% tariff, while goods identified as being transshipped through the country will incur a 40% charge.This arrangement will affect products containing Chinese components that are either minimally processed in Vietnam or simply routed through the country before reaching the US. This structure reflects similar provisions found in existing US trade agreements with Mexico and Canada.The complete details of the agreement remain undisclosed by the White House, with some aspects possibly still under development. The impact on China's increasing exports to Vietnam is yet to be determined. China's Ministry of Commerce has not yet provided a response to enquiries.India, which is reportedly close to finalising a deal, is discussing ""rules of origin"" requirements. The US is seeking a minimum of 60% local value addition for products to qualify as ""Made in India"" and receive benefits under the agreement. According to Bloomberg News, India is attempting to negotiate this requirement down to approximately 35%.The trade war predicament facing Asia centres on its dual reliance: needing US consumer markets while depending on Chinese manufacturing inputs, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Natixis SA. According to the Bloomberg report, in her recent analysis, she highlighted that Vietnam, Cambodia and Taiwan face particularly high exposure to this situation.Also Read | From ‘dead’ to ‘hottest in world’: Donald Trump calls ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ the path to US making a ‘fortune’; says America growing out of ‘Biden mess’ For most Asian economies, China represents a more significant trading relationship than the United States. Beijing has issued stern warnings about protecting its interests, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi expected to emphasise this position during his upcoming European diplomatic mission to Brussels, Germany and France.""China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of Chinese interests in exchange for so-called tariff reductions,"" said the Ministry of Commerce on Saturday, reiterating previous cautions. ""If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.""According to Bloomberg Economics, Vietnam's trade agreement could trigger retaliatory measures from China.""Beijing has signalled its intention to address arrangements that undermined Chinese interests, and the acceptance of increased tariffs on products 'transshipped' through Vietnam could be considered such a case,"" Bloomberg's Rana Sajedi noted in a research analysis.The United States' potential influence on other nations to strengthen or implement export restrictions on advanced technology poses a significant challenge for Beijing, particularly regarding its acquisition of essential semiconductor manufacturing equipment.In June, Taiwan expanded its restricted entities catalogue to include both Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., requiring Taiwanese companies to obtain governmental clearance before engaging in business transactions with these firms.The situation extends beyond Asian borders. Europe faces its own complexities in this matter. China's electric vehicle exports predominantly flow to the EU, whilst Chinese investments in the EU and UK reached 10 billion euros ($12 billion) in the previous year, as documented by Rhodium Group.Also Read | US plans ‘economic bunker buster’ bill: Will Donald Trump impose 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia? How it may impact India However, commercial relations are becoming strained. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has recently criticised Beijing for its approach to rare earths and magnets, whilst highlighting concerns about Chinese industrial surplus.The European Union's potential agreement with the US has raised significant concerns in Beijing, particularly regarding provisions similar to those in the British-American deal, which encompassed supply chain security, export regulations and ownership guidelines for industries including steel, aluminium and pharmaceuticals. Although China was not explicitly mentioned, Beijing issued an unusual public critique of the agreement, viewing it as a direct challenge, according to the Financial Times.""China is clearly worried that the EU will accept the same wording as the UK did on export controls,"" said Joerg Wuttke, a partner at the Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington and former president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. ""They are pushing the EU not to do this, and the US is pushing the EU to do it.""The EU and US aim to establish an agreement before July 9, when American authorities plan to implement a 50 per cent tariff on virtually all European products. The EU considers the US relationship more vital, as European exports to America exceed twice the value of those to China, providing the US with substantial negotiating power.The primary challenge facing Beijing lies in the potential consolidation of these initiatives into a broader transformation - beyond US-led restrictions on Chinese exports to a fundamental restructuring of global commerce centred on 'trusted' supply networks, potentially marginalising China. During his Southeast Asian tour earlier this year, President Xi Jinping called for regional unity as an ""Asian family,"" cautioning against commercial fragmentation.Also Read | Not just Apple iPhones! Android smartphone makers like Samsung, Motorola step up exports from India to US; move due to Trump’s tariff policies China typically counters opposition through selective trade restrictions. Following EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles last year, Beijing initiated anti-dumping investigations into European brandy, dairy and pork products. In 2023, it suspended Japanese seafood imports after perceiving criticism from G7 meetings in Japan. A diplomatic dispute with Australia in 2020 resulted in trade limitations affecting various commodities, including lobsters, wine and barley.""If some agreements explicitly list China as a target and show that some countries are cooperating or collaborating with the US to 'contain China,' then China will definitely respond,"" said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and a former adviser to the Chinese Commerce Ministry.","US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, tariff wars, and moves to seal trade deals with major trading partners in Asia and Europe has China increasingly on the guard. These trade deals could potentially separate Chinese companies from global supply networks, despite the recently announced trade truce between the US and China. For most Asian economies, China represents a more significant trading relationship than the United States.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122222052,imgsize-62864,width-400,resizemode-4/122222052.jpg"

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About

Poll Do you believe that marital pressure can lead to extreme actions such as murder? Yes, it can lead to drastic measures. No, there are always better alternatives.





AURANGABAD: In a chilling echo of the recent Meghalaya honeymoon murder, a 45-day-old marriage in Bihar’s Aurangabad district ended in bloodshed when a young woman allegedly conspired with her maternal uncle and his two accomplices to have her husband shot dead in cold blood.The victim, 24-year-old Priyanshu Kumar Singh, was murdered on the night of June 24 while returning from Nabinagar railway station.Initial probe suggested a contract killing, but the case took a dark turn when police found that the murder had been masterminded by Priyanshu’s own wife, Gunja Singh (30).According to Aurangabad Superintendent of Police Ambarish Rahul, Gunja had been in a 15-year-long illicit relationship with her maternal uncle, Jeevan Singh (52).Despite her reluctance, she married Priyanshu in May under family pressure. But just weeks into the marriage, struggling to keep her affair secret, she allegedly decided to eliminate her husband — inspired by the Meghalaya honeymoon murdercase, where a newlywed woman was accused of murdering her husband during their honeymoon trip.Police say Gunja and Jeevan plotted meticulously. Jeevan, with the help of Jaishankar Chaubey and Mukesh Sharma from Garhwa district, Jharkhand, arranged SIM cards and logistics to execute the plan.On the night of the murder, Priyanshu, returning from Varanasi, made a routine call to update his wife on his whereabouts. Gunja passed the information to the killers, who were lying in wait. Moments later, Priyanshu was ambushed and shot dead.Gunja was arrested on Wednesday evening, and during interrogation, she confessed to the murder conspiracy. Both accomplices have also been taken into custody, while her uncle Jeevan Singh remains absconding, with a manhunt underway.Police have seized Gunja’s mobile phone, and call records are expected to play a crucial role in proving her involvement.The chilling similarity to the Meghalaya honeymoon case — where marital intimacy masked a sinister murder plot — has left both investigators and locals stunned.","Police say Gunja Singh, 30, had been in a 15-year-long illicit relationship with her maternal uncle, Jeevan Singh.

Video Was Backed-up

Follow Procedure: Court





BENGALURU: Swapnil Nagesh Mali, the 30-year-old senior associate consultant at Infosys who was arrested, and later released on bail, for secretly filming one of his female colleagues inside their office washroom, has confessed to the police that he had secretly recorded at least one more woman in the company restroom.During interrogation, Swapnil said he derived ""satisfaction"" from watching such videos and had more than 50 such downloaded clips on his phone.Swapnil, a BE from Ram Nagar in Maharashtra's Sangli district, is the son of a farmer. Police said his parents were shocked and deeply disturbed when informed about his arrest.According to the victim's complaint, around 11 am on June 30, she went to the washroom. While using the toilet, she noticed a reflection on the cubicle door and saw someone attempting to pull something from the adjacent stall.She quickly stepped out and saw another woman exiting one of the other cubicles. To verify what exactly was the matter, she returned to the same stall that she had been to, climbed onto the commode and saw a man standing on the commode in the neighbouring cubicle and recording her. His trousers were off.As soon as she confronted him, the accused began apologising repeatedly. The victim then ran out and alerted her colleagues about the intruder in the women's washroom. Swapnil, who was trying to flee, was cornered and caught by housekeeping staff.According to the police, the victim and another female employee from the company's HR department checked Swapnil's phone, and found the victim's video clip in it. They took a screenshot of the clip as evidence and deleted it from the accused's phone to make sure it wasn't shared.However, according to a senior police officer, the videos were still on the phone as those had not been deleted permanently. ""Once we confirmed that the videos were still thereon his phone, a woman police sub-inspector was told to check those,"" the officer said.""After informing her company HR, the victim returned home and informed her husband about the incident, who advised her to file a police complaint so that legal action could be initiated,"" police said.Subsequently, the victim lodged a police complaint on July 1.When Electronics City police produced the accused in court, the magistrate noted that the sections invoked are punishable with less than seven years' imprisonment and directed police to follow proper arrest procedures and grant station bail.The magistrate also reminded the cops that even minor lapses could lead to the accused being acquitted.","Swapnil Nagesh Mali, 30, a senior associate consultant at Infosys, was arrested for secretly filming one of his female colleagues inside their office washroom.

QRSAMs designed to intercept hostile fighters

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Thursday gave preliminary nod to three major acquisition projects and seven smaller ones, collectively worth over Rs 1 lakh crore, ranging from specialised spy aircraft and advanced minesweepers to quick-reaction air defence missiles and underwater autonomous vessels.The biggest project to get “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”, which is just the first step in the long-winded procurement process, was for the indigenous construction of 12 mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for around Rs 44,000 crore, which will take almost a decade, sources told TOI.These specialised warships, each with a displacement of 900-1,000 tonne, will be capable of detecting, tracking and destroying underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.They are crucial amid the expanding maritime collusiveness between China and Pakistan. At present, the Navy makes do with just “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the major capability gap.The second big project was the Rs 36,000 crore procurement of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems developed by DRDO , with three regiments for the Army and three squadrons for the IAF.Overall, the Army Air Defence (AAD) has projected a requirement of 11 such regiments.These highly-mobile QRSAMs, designed to intercept hostile fighters, helicopters and drones at ranges up to 30 km, will add to the country’s existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role under Operation Sindoor in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities.The third major project was for three ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance) planes, designed to identify and help target high-value enemy targets on the ground with greater precision and accuracy by fighter jets and missiles, for around Rs 10,000 crore.These aircraft will be equipped with a wide array of indigenous sensors and systems developed by DRDO, like synthetic aperture radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors, for gathering “actionable intelligence” in real-time on enemy infrastructure, build-ups and movements.Another interesting project granted AoN was for semi-submersible autonomous vessels for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions. They will be acquired under the ‘Make-II’ category project, where prototype development is funded by the industry.Two other naval projects included procurement, through competitive bidding, of super-rapid gun mounts (SRGMs), which are the main 76mm guns fitted on warships, and the DRDO-developed “processor-based moored mines” that detonate upon sensing an enemy warship’s acoustic, magnetic or pressure signature.AoNs were also accorded for procurement of armoured recovery vehicles, electronic warfare systems and the tri-Service integrated common inventory management system for better supply chain management, the MoD said.","The biggest project to get “acceptance of necessity (AoN)” was for the indigenous construction of 12 mine countermeasure vessels.

NEW DELHI: The man who allegedly raped a 22-year-old woman in her Pune flat left behind a chilling message threatening to leak her photos online and took a selfie using her phone before fleeing, police revealed on Thursday, as per PTI. The accused, who posed as a courier delivery executive to gain entry, remains at large nearly 24 hours after the attack. Pune Police have formed 10 special teams to trace and arrest him.The incident took place around 7:30 pm on Wednesday in the Kondhwa area, when the woman, an IT professional, was alone at home. According to Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajkumar Shinde, the man convinced her he was delivering a bank-related envelope and asked for a pen. As she turned to get it, he entered the flat, latched the door, and forced himself on her.The woman told police she passed out during the assault and regained consciousness about an hour later. “She does not remember anything after that as she gained consciousness around 8.30 pm. She then informed her relatives and the police were alerted,” said Shinde.The accused reportedly used the victim’s phone to take a selfie that showed part of his face and her back.He also left a disturbing message warning her not to report the crime, saying he had taken her photos and would circulate them on social media. “I will come again,” the message read.Police are probing whether a chemical spray was used to make her unconscious. Forensic experts have collected nasal and oral swabs for examination. Investigators are also checking CCTV footage and data from the housing society’s gate management app to identify the suspect.A case has been registered under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism), and 351(2) (criminal intimidation).

""It is rare for the same person to have more than one funeral, but in this case the families have the DNA match and certificate of handover of the mortal remains.

Rijiju to represent India at Dalai Lama b'day event

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday firmly rejected China's claim that it has a decisive say in choosing the Dalai Lama's successor and asserted that the issue could be decided only in accordance with the wishes of the Tibetan spiritual leader and established Buddhist traditions.""The Dalai Lama's position is of immense importance, not just for Tibetans but for millions of his followers across the globe. The right to decide on his successor rests solely with him, in accordance with centuries-old Buddhist customs,"" parliamentary affairs and minorities minister Kiren Rijiju told reporters. He also dismissed as ""unwarranted interference"" China's objection to the Dalai Lama's announcement that he has ""exclusive authority"" in deciding who gets to succeed him.The response came after the 90-year-old spiritual head of the Gelug branch of Tibetan Buddhists, who has lived in exile in India since 1959, asserted that the institution of Dalai Lama would continue after his death, and that his successor would be chosen by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit set up by him. The Dalai Lama had earlier said his successor would be from among his supporters based outside China: something that runs counter to Beijing's known desire to have one of its loyalists from Tibet anointed.""The Dalai Lama's reincarnation must follow the principles of domestic recognition, the 'Golden Urn' process, and approval by the central govt, in line with religious traditions and laws,"" the Chinese foreign ministry had said in response to the Dalai Lama's statement.With the Dalai Lama turning 90, the succession issue has gained urgency amid fragile India-China ties.The spat over reincarnation adds another layer to bilateral tensions that have persisted since the 2020 border clashes and China's recent diplomatic outreach to Pakistan.Kiren Rijiju, a Buddhist from Arunachal Pradesh, will visit Dharamshala along with his cabinet colleague and animal husbandry minister Lalan Singh, to represent Indian govt at the Dalai Lama's birthday celebrations.The question of succession has long been a sensitive subject for Beijing, which seeks to assert control over Tibetan Buddhism . It holds a grudge against India for its decision to offer shelter to the Dalai Lama when he fled Tibet in 1959. It has dubbed the Tibetan religious leader a ""splittist"". The Dalai Lama, with his saintly image and message of peace and a following that that includes Hollywood celebrities and members of global cultural elite, has been a thorn in China's side, fuelling its desire to reduce the institution of religious leadership of Tibetan Buddhists to an adjunct of the Communist dictatorship.In the 1990s, China controversially installed its own Panchen Lama after the mysterious disappearance of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the boy selected by the Dalai Lama for the second-most revered figure for Tibetan Buddhists. Panchen Lama has failed to gain acceptance among Tibetans, heightening fears of similar interference in the Dalai Lama's succession.","India rejects China's claim that it has a decisive say in choosing the Dalai Lama's successor.

NEW DELHI: Just days after the assault of a Mira Road sweet shop owner by MNS workers over language, another disturbing video from Maharashtra has surfaced, this time involving Rajan Vichare, former MP and senior leader from Uddhav Thackeray ’s Shiv Sena (UBT).In the now-viral clip, Vichare is seen summoning traders to his office in Thane, where his supporters allegedly slapped and humiliated them for not speaking in Marathi. The men were reportedly forced to apologise publicly and were repeatedly told to use Marathi while conducting business in the state.The video, shared widely on social media, shows Vichare sitting calmly as his party workers confront the traders. One supporter can be seen slapping a trader while demanding an apology and shouting, “Speak in Marathi!”This incident follows a tense week in Maharashtra, where language politics have flared up. After MNS activists attacked a north Indian shopkeeper in Mira Road for not using Marathi, the area’s market remained shut for a day in protest. Traders and local communities demanded protection and accountability from the state.In response to the backlash, Aditya Thackeray attempted damage control, telling the media, “I spoke to Rajan Vichare ji. He said this was not a Marathi vs non-Marathi issue. It began when a party worker was not allowed to charge his phone, and the argument escalated.”But critics aren’t buying it. The visual evidence suggests otherwise, and many have pointed out the growing pattern of linguistic vigilantism, now cutting across political factions.","Rajan Vichare, former MP and senior leader from Uddhav Thackeray ’s Shiv Sena, is seen summoning traders to his office in Thane.

Partition survivor who was saved by a Muslim dies at 102,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/partition-survivor-who-was-saved-by-a-muslim-dies-at-102/articleshow/122236338.cms,"PATIALA: One of the last survivors of the 1947 Partition died in Dhainthal village of Punjab's Patiala on Tuesday, aged 102. Ram Krishan Singh's life reflected the horrors of communal violence as well as the courage and compassion that shone through despite the bloodshed.Ram Krishan was about 24-years-old during the division of India into two nations, which led to violent upheaval in Punjab. In Aug 1947, a mob murdered his father, Jeona Singh, a carpenter and bullockcart manufacturer, in Dhainthal after he refused to abandon their ancestral home.""My father was killed during those days of hate. Before Partition, our village was largely Muslim, with a few Sikh and Hindu families. Children played in each other's homes. Then, suddenly everything changed,"" Ram Krishan Singh had recalled in an interview with a web channel, Azad Bol Punjabi, four years ago.As communal tensions escalated, Ram Krishan and other family members temporarily fled to nearby Tullewal village. Jeona Singh stayed back to guard their home, along with an elderly Nihang. When Muslim families began migrating to Pakistan, a mob entered Dhainthal and killed Jeona in his home.Ram Krishan's grandson, Hardeep Singh Gahir, a assistant public relations officer in Patiala, said his grandfather went back in search of his father, only to face a grim reality.Gahir said, ""The Nihang who survived told my grandfather that he had to cremate Jeona in a tandoor using cow-dung cakes because there was no safe way to arrange a funeral.""During the strife, Ram Krishan's life was spared by an unexpected act of humanity. When he and other family members were cornered by an armed group, a Muslim villager intervened to protect him. This stranger's bravery became a story Ram Krishan frequently recounted. Gahir shared, ""Even in his last years, he would recall with gratitude how a Muslim man risked his own life to save him.""Following Partition, the family's life in Dhainthal changed permanently. Jeona's wife, who was pregnant at the time, gave birth to a daughter, Mohinder Kaur, two months after Partition. Ram Krishan delayed his own marriage until he was 30 as the family rebuilt their lives. He continued the carpentry tradition, and his son Balwinder Singh still practises the craft, using modern techniques. ""Ram Krishan lived quietly, serving as a witness to history's cruellest chapter and exemplifying resilience. His life was a reminder that even in times of hatred, acts of kindness could echo across generations,"" said his family.","Ram Krishan Singh was about 24-years-old during the division of India into two nations.

NEW DELHI: Are the NDA allies growing wary of Chirag Paswan? Speculation is swirling after Union minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha chief Jitan Ram Manjhi warned that the Lok Janshakti Party leader would face consequences if he repeated his 2020 assembly poll strategy.Asked whether Chirag was trying to build pressure on the NDA over seat-sharing ahead of the year-end Bihar elections , Manjhi said, ""You saw what happened in 2020. He had to face the consequences of what he did. If he does the same again, the outcome will be similar. Bihar now has a double-engine government under Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar.""Praising the current NDA administration, Manjhi said progress had been made across sectors including roads, electricity, law and order, and governance.Chirag Paswan, however, chose not to escalate the matter and responded diplomatically: ""Jitan Ram Manjhi is like a father to me. Even if he says something harsh, I will accept it with respect. If the Opposition tries to project this as a rift in the alliance, they will fail.""The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) used the episode to take a swipe at the NDA. Party MP Manoj Jha said, “Sometimes they say one thing, sometimes another, and sometimes it’s all in gestures—but the intent is clear.This is their internal matter. The script of such differences is often written in the Delhi darbar.”In the 2020 assembly elections, Chirag Paswan’s LJP fielded candidates in 137 seats but won only one. However, by splitting the anti-BJP vote, particularly in JD(U) strongholds, the LJP is widely seen to have contributed to the JD(U)’s poor performance. The BJP ended up winning 74 seats, overtaking JD(U)'s 43, and emerged as the senior partner in Bihar for the first time.The assembly election is scheduled for the end of the year, where a high-stakes battle is expected. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) — consisting of the Janata Dal (United) led by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and the Bharatiya Janata Party — will face off against the Mahagathbandhan, which includes the Congress, RJD, and Left parties.","Chirag Paswan's LJP fielded candidates in 137 seats but won only one.

NEW DELHI: Advocate Ramaswamy Neelakandan prepared for life as a high court judge by returning case files to clients after the CJI-led Supreme Court collegium on Jan 17, 2023, recommended to Union govt to appoint him, along with four other advocates, including L C Victoria Gowri, as judges of Madras high court.The Union govt appointed all of them as judges, except Neelakandan. Though names of the five advocates were sent by the SC collegium on the same day, the govt appointed them in batches - three on Feb 7, 2023, and the fourth on Feb 27, 2023.Neelakandan, who belongs to the OBC community, shares his fate with 28 other advocates, whose names were recommended to the govt by the collegium between Jan 2023 and April this year. The Centre's pick and choose policy has left them in suspense - whether to resume practice or keep waiting for the Centre's nod to become an HC judge.While Neelakandan's wait has stretched beyond 29 months, advocate Subhash Upadhyay, whose name was recommended by collegium on April 12, 2023, for judgeship in Uttarakhand HC, is waiting for his warrant of appointment for the last 26 months.Along with Upadhyay, the collegium had recommended names of three advocates and a judicial officer for appointment as judges of the HC. Only Upadhyay's name was left out. Like him, advocate Arun Kumar is awaiting action on collegium's May 9, 2023, recommendation for his appointment as Allahabad HC judge.On Oct 17, 2023, the collegium recommended the names of five advocates for appointment as judges of Madhya Pradesh HC. Among them, only advocate Amit Seth is still awaiting appointment.Of the 29 advocates still awaiting appointment as HC judges, five are women advocates. Among them, the one enduring the longest wait is advocate Shamima Jahan, whose name was recommended by the collegium on Jan 4, 2024, for appointment as a judge of Gauhati HC.Other women advocates sharing Jahan's fate are Sreeja Vijayalakshmi (name recommended on April 16, 2024), Tajal Vashi (Oct 15, 2024; Gujarat HC), Shwetasree Majumder (Aug 21, 2024; Delhi HC), and Sheetal Mirdha (March 5, 2025; Rajasthan HC).Despite successive chief justices, including the incumbent CJI B R Gavai, impressing upon the Union govt not to pick and choose from the list and avoid making staggered appointments from the same batch, the govt has not abandoned the practice which creates seniority issues in constitutional courts where merit and seniority are two crucial factors for career advancement.Interestingly, the collegium's recommendations for appointment of judges to Supreme Court have been speedily processed and implemented by the govt, in some cases the appointments have come through within three days of the recommendation.The collegium recommended to the govt on May 26 to appoint Justices N V Anjaria, Vijay Bishnoi and A S Chandurkar as judges of the SC. The three took oath as Supreme Court judges on May 30.On May 26, the collegium recommended appointments of chief justices to five HCs, transfers of four HC CJs and transfer and repatriation of 22 HC judges. More than a month later, govt is yet to give effect to the appointments and transfers of HC CJs and judges.","Ramaswamy Neelakandan, who belongs to the OBC community, shares his fate with 28 other advocates.

"10 state-of-the-art Isro techs transferred to Indian firms, says IN-SPACe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-state-of-the-art-isro-techs-transferred-to-indian-firms-says-in-space/articleshow/122236034.cms,"NEW DELHI: The country’s space regulator-cum-promoter Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) on Thursday said it facilitated the transfer of 10 state-of-the-art technologies developed by Isro to six Indian companies.The tripartite technology transfer agreements, signed among NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), six companies and IN-SPACe at the regulator’s headquarters in Ahmedabad, will give private players the opportunity to access developed technologies available with Isro, enabling them to use space-related technology for commercial applications in space as well as other sectors. The technologies that foster satellite launch, ground station infrastructure and geospatial applications are expected to deepen industry participation, enable indigenisation and reduce dependency on foreign technologies.Two advanced inertial sensors — Laser Gyroscope and Ceramic Servo Accelerometer — developed by Isro’s inertial systems unit for potential use in satellite launch vehicles have been transferred to Hyderabad-based Zetatek Technologies, which has over 25 years of expertise in inertial navigation system (INS) testing, calibration and QA/QT equipment. Three technologies related to ground station operations — S/X/Ka tri-band dual circular polarised monopulse feed, tri-axis antenna control servo system and Ku/C/L and S Band Cassegrain feed — have been transferred to Avantel and Jisnu Communications, Hyderabad-based companies specialising in end-to-end communications solutions for space and defence platforms.These technologies, currently sourced from foreign vendors, will enable self-reliance in critical ground station infrastructure.Reacting to the development, IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said, “Transfer of these technologies marks yet another significant step towards empowering the private sector to harness and commercialise space technologies. Isro has a flourishing repository of R&D in space technologies, and it is time we leverage that to the optimum to strengthen India’s space industrial ecosystem, and in that, industry-led innovation will play a key role. ”Further, two geospatial models developed by Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre of Isro for pest forewarning and semi-physical crop yield estimation were transferred to Ahmedabad-based Amnex Info Technologies, to be deployed in agricultural decision-making and crop protection. A compact, multi-parameter, portable bathymetry system developed by Isro’s National Remote Sensing Centre has been transferred to Jalkruti Water Solutions, Ahmedabad, to enable UAV-based integration for water resource monitoring.Further, Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre’s ceramic-based flame-proof coating technology, which was originally developed for launch vehicle applications, has been acquired by Ramdev Chemicals, Ahmedabad, for wider industrial applications.","Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) facilitated the transfer of 10 state-of-the-art technologies developed by Isro to six Indian companies.

In talks with senator seeking to tariff Russia oil buyers: Govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-talks-with-senator-seeking-to-tariff-russia-oil-buyers-govt/articleshow/122236018.cms,"India's import of Russian oil grew dramatically from less than 1% to 40% in 3 yrs

NEW DELHI: India has conveyed its concerns to US Senator Lindsey Graham who is sponsoring a sanctions bill that will, if approved, impose 500% tariffs on India, China and others who purchase Russian oil, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.Graham was quoted as saying earlier this week that President Donald Trump had told him to bring to vote the bill that might help the US force Russia to join peace negotiations on Ukraine. Kremlin, however, has warned that it could adversely impact peace efforts.""Any development in the US Congress is of interest to us if it impacts or could impact our interests. We have been in touch with Senator Graham. The embassy and our ambassador have been in contact as well,"" Jaishankar said.While India has traditionally sourced its oil from West Asia, it ramped up purchase from Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in Feb 2022.This was mainly because of the discount offered by Russia to offset the impact of western sanctions. India's import of Russian oil grew dramatically from less than 1% of its total crude oil imports to 40% in three years.""Our concerns and our interests on energy security have been communicated to him (Graham).So, we'll then have to cross that bridge when we come to it, if we come to it,"" Jaishankar said.""Russia's stronghold over new markets has solidified in the third year of the invasion. The three biggest buyers, China (Rs 78 billion), India (Rs 49 billion) and Turkiye (Rs 34 billion) were responsible for 74% of Russia's total revenues from fossil fuels in the third year of the invasion,"" global think tank Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said in a report earlier this year.","India has conveyed its concerns to US Senator Lindsey Graham.

"After 'good' trials, roads min junks L1 bidding mode",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-good-trials-roads-min-junks-l1-bidding-mode/articleshow/122235845.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, all highway agencies under the road transport ministry, including the NHAI, will soon replace the least cost (L1) mode for bidding out works for preparing detailed project reports (DPRs) with highest technical score (T1) for companies.The agencies will fix cost for consultancy service (bid price) and companies will be selected on the basis of their technical competence and ratings based on their past performance.Officials said the experiment of only fixed cost and highest technical score for bidding out works in the NHAI has been ""good"" so far, since its introduction in Sept last year. TOI on Sept 8 had first reported this crucial change in bidding parameters. ""The new provision of rating of bidders and assigning 30% marks for technical score will further bring quality players to bid for projects,"" said a senior official.The policy change gains importance considering that there has been major deterioration in preparation of project reports after consultancy firms bagged projects quoting very low and unsustainable prices. Poor project preparation impacts quality of work and results in delay in implementation.In developed countries such as Japan and Australia, govt entities pay more attention and time to preparation for DPRs for perfect execution.Officials admitted that there have been several cases where the prices quoted for preparing DPRs was as low as Rs 70,000-Rs 80,000 per km. ""At such a low cost, no one can prepare a good DPR. Field surveys cost more than such quoted price. That was the trigger for fixing the cost, which approximately comes to Rs 4-5 lakh for one km of 4-6 lane highway. This is barely 0.5% of the overall project cost. In most other countries the payment made for DPR preparation is around 10% of project cost,"" an official said.He added that provisions have been made where companies that have key personnel from top 50 reputed technical institutes, such as IITs and NITs, will get a better score. ""So, the entire framework of technical score, including the marks for ratings, is aimed at getting serious and quality players to bid for DRP works,""an NHAI official said.","All highway agencies under the road transport ministry, including the NHAI, will soon replace the least cost (L1) mode for bidding out works for preparing detailed project reports.

Kaliganj is a Muslim-majority constituency in Nadia. BJP was the only party that saw its vote share dip (from 31% in 2021 to 28.2% now), prompting TMC to emphasise how BJP had failed to hold on to even its majority community votes. It remains to be seen whether Bhattacharya's party colleagues keep up their anti-Muslim pitch even as he takes a conciliatory approach, which would indicate the party has hit on a good cop-bad cop strategy with Bengal's approximately 2.5 crore Muslim voters.""Look at Bengal's villages. Morchhe Musalman, marchhe Musalman (Muslims are killing and Muslims are dying). Who is responsible for this situation? Those who do not like BJP may not vote for us. But they should accept that 90% of the people killed in the last three years have been Muslims,"" he said.""BJP wants visarjan and Muharram processions to walk side by side without any malice against each other.

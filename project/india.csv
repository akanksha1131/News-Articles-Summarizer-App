Vote 'chori' row: BJP steps up attack on Congress; claims Pawan Khera has 2 voter ID cards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vote-chori-row-bjp-steps-up-attack-on-congress-claims-pawan-khera-has-2-voter-id-cards/articleshow/123647552.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday accused Congress leader Pawan Khera of holding two voter ID cards as Rahul Gandhi sharpened his attack against the Centre with his ""vote chori"" claim during the recently concluded ""voter Adhikar Yatra"" in poll-bound Bihar.In a social media post, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya urged the Election Commission to investigate whether Khera voted multiple times.""It has now emerged that Pawan Khera, Congress spokesperson—who never misses a chance to flaunt his proximity to the Gandhis—holds two active EPIC numbers (in Jangpura and New Delhi Assembly constituencies, falling under East Delhi and New Delhi Lok Sabha seats respectively),"" Malviya said.""It is now for the Election Commission to investigate how Pawan Khera holds two active EPIC numbers, and whether he voted multiple times—a clear violation of electoral laws,"" he added.Malviya also accused Khera of holding a ""malicious"" press conference in Bihar to mislead voters during the INDIA bloc's recently concluded ""Voter Adhikar Yatra.""""As if the criminality of holding multiple votes isn’t enough, Pawan Khera is holding malicious press conferences in Bihar to mislead voters, create dissonance, and undermine India’s robust electoral process,"" he said.Earlier, the BJP had dug up the 1980 poll roll and said that Sonia Gandhi's name appeared on the voter list three years before she became an Indian citizen.""Sonia Gandhi’s tryst with India’s voters’ list is riddled with glaring violations of electoral law.

Have you heard of anything bigger than an atom bomb? It is a hydrogen bomb. BJP people, be ready, a hydrogen bomb is coming. People are soon going to find out the reality of vote chori,"" he said.""In the coming time, I am guaranteeing you that after the hydrogen bomb (comes), Narendra Modi ji will not be able to show his face to the country,"" he added.Earlier, Rahul said the Congress had analysed the Mahadevapura electoral rolls over six months and found that out of 1,00,250 alleged bogus voters, 40,009 had “fake and invalid addresses” and 10,452 were “bulk voters” registered at common addresses. Examples included entries with “0” in the address field, non-existent locations, and addresses that could not be verified.The opposition has also been protesting against the special intensive revision of the electoral roll, alleging that the EC's exercise is aimed at ""disenfranchising voters"" in Bihar ahead of the assembly elections due later this year.","BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya urged the Election Commission to investigate whether Khera voted multiple times.

'Shame': Trump trade adviser's fresh attack on India after RIC huddle at SCO; takes jibe at PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shame-trump-trade-advisors-fresh-attack-on-india-after-ric-huddle-at-sco-takes-jibe-at-pm-modi/articleshow/123646265.cms,"



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday said that ""it is a shame"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the stage with the ""two biggest authoritarian dictators"" in the world during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China.While talking to reporters, Navarro said that PM Modi needs to step up and be with Europe and Ukraine, and stop ""buying oil from Russia.""""The road to peace in many ways runs at least partly through New Delhi. It's time for Modi to step up. I have great respect for Modi. I love the Indian people. It was a shame to see Modi getting in bed, as the leader of the biggest democracy in the world, with the two biggest authoritarian dictators in the world, Putin and Xi Jinping,"" Navarro said.""So we hope that the Indian leader comes around to seeing that he needs to be with us in Europe and Ukraine and not with Russia on this, and he needs to stop buying the oil,"" he added.This comes a day after the White House trade counselor ignited a firestorm in the ongoing US-India trade spat, alleging, in reference to India selling refined Russian oil to the West, that ""Brahmins are profiteering at the expense of the Indian people.""""Look, Modi's a great leader. I don't understand why he's getting into bed with Putin and Xi Jinping when he's the biggest democracy in the world. So I would just simply say to the Indian people: please, understand what's going on here. You've got Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people. We need that to stop. Yeah, and we'll be watching that closely,"" he said during an interview with Fox News.Navarro has made multiple jabs at India as the latter refuses to budge on ceasing trade with Russia. These included calling the Russia-Ukraine war ""Modi's war,"" branding India ""Kremlin's laundromat,"" and accusing New Delhi of fueling the Ukraine war for profit.The Trump administration, earlier this month, ramped up attacks on India for buying Russian oil, with Navarro characterizing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as ""Modi's war,"" and cautioning New Delhi about getting close to Beijing and Moscow.""India, you're the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies. (Instead) you're getting in bed with the authoritarians,"" Navarro had said, just hours after 50% tariffs on India went into effect.Trump has imposed 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25 per cent for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India has said.Meanwhile, on Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that most of Trump's sweeping global tariffs are unlawful.Following this, the Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called on Speaker Mike Johnson to put on the floor US Representative Gregory Meeks' resolution to terminate Trump's ""national emergency"" declaration, which he used to impose the massive tariffs.Quoting Meeks in a social media post, it also called for the Speaker to ""stop covering for Trump’s lawlessness.""","US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday said that ""it is a shame"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the stage with the ""two biggest authoritarian dictators"" in the world during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday did not extend the Sept 1 deadline for filing claims and objections to Bihar Draft Voters List prepared after special intensive revision (SIR) as the Election Commission said such submissions can be made by people till the last date of nominations for the Assembly elections.""Most importantly, the filing of claims or objections or corrections is not barred after Sept 1. These can be submitted even after the deadline. The applications submitted for claims, objections or corrections after Sept 1 will be considered after the electoral roll has been finalised,"" Election Commission told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, while arguing that extension of deadline would create complications.For EC, senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Maninder Singh said, ""The process of consideration of claims and objections continues until the last date of filing of nominations, and all inclusions and exclusions are integrated in the final roll.""After the recording of EC's statement, the bench expressed surprise that despite several SC directives to political parties which protested SIR, only 128 claims and objections were filed: 10 by RJD for inclusion, and 118 by CPI(ML) Liberation (103 challenging inclusion and rest for inclusion).""What is bothering us is that despite all these directions passed by the Supreme Court, the political parties have come out with only 128 claims and objections. The booth level agents (BLAs) are grassroots-level party workers. Why are BLAs not coming out with lists of people allegedly excluded from the draft voter list? And what is more surprising is that political parties are filing more applications for deletion rather than inclusion,"" the bench said.Finding that the political parties are not assisting those among the 65-lakh people deleted from the voter list to file claims, the bench directed the state legal services authority to instruct by Tuesday noon its district units to activate para-legal volunteers and assist people in getting enrolled.EC, as per its records, said, ""Approximately 99.5% of the electors (out of 7.24 crore) featured in the draft electoral roll for the state of Bihar have already submitted their eligibility documents pertaining to the SIR exercise.""Importantly, the bench asked the district legal services authorities (DLSAs) to send a confidential report on the issues faced by people in inclusion, correction or deletion of their names from the voter list.

Public reactions: ‘Why people don’t want kids anymore’

Education a luxury?

What next? Parent pressure mounts

A prominent international school in Bengaluru has found itself at the centre of a heated debate after details of its ₹7.35 lakh annual fee for Grade 1 students surfaced online. The 2025–26 academic year fee structure, widely shared on social media, has sparked questions about affordability, regulation, and the widening gap in access to quality education.The controversy picked up steam after a tweet by an account named D.Muthukrishnan posted a screenshot of the fee structure, with the caption highlighting how “even ₹50 lakh IT couples can’t afford this school”. The post quickly went viral, garnering thousands of likes, retweets, and heated discussions in the comments section.Many users expressed shock at the numbers, while others debated whether global-standard education justifies such a cost. Screenshots from the tweet have since spread across Instagram and WhatsApp groups, amplifying the debate further.The school’s official fee details reveal a steep cost across grades:Additionally, parents must pay a non-refundable admission fee of ₹1 lakh, pushing the initial cost for new students even higher.The viral tweet triggered widespread discussion on X and Instagram. Many users expressed disbelief that even dual-income IT couples earning ₹50 lakh annually feel the pinch.However, some defended the pricing, arguing that premium international education comes at a cost. Advocates claim the fees reflect state-of-the-art infrastructure, low student-teacher ratios, and global curricula like IB and Cambridge, which many parents actively seek.The outrage comes amid a broader trend of sharp fee hikes in Bengaluru’s private schools, with annual increases often ranging from 10% to 30%. According to parent associations, these hikes have continued despite previous protests and petitions.The Bengaluru case reflects a wider national trend, where urban families are spending up to nine times more on education than their rural counterparts. Top international schools in Mumbai, Delhi, and Hyderabad also charge ₹6–10 lakh annually, excluding add-on costs.This has sparked an uncomfortable question: Is quality education becoming a luxury product in India? Critics say the growing gap risks excluding even upper-middle-class families from elite schooling options.Parent groups are now pushing for state-level committees to review and approve private school fee structures. Some suggest linking annual hikes to inflation, while others argue the free market should prevail, leaving parents to choose schools based on affordability.For now, the debate continues online, with many asking whether India’s private education system is pricing out the very demographic it seeks to serve.","A prominent international school in Bengaluru has found itself at the centre of a heated debate after details of its annual fee surfaced online.

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","US federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal.

The downpour caused significant traffic congestion, with vehicles stuck for hours on National Highway 48 (NH-48). In response to the weather conditions, the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) issued an advisory instructing schools in Gurugram to conduct online classes to ensure the safety of students and staff.The DDMA also advised corporate offices and private institutions in the district to encourage employees to work from home. An orange alert has been issued, forecasting the possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall on Tuesday, September 2, 2025, prompting the administration to take precautionary measures. The advisory urged residents to exercise caution and avoid unnecessary travel.The persistent rain led to waterlogged streets across Gurugram, especially affecting key areas such as Rajiv Chowk. Traffic moved at a very slow pace, with vehicles, trucks, bikes, and cars struggling to navigate through the flooded roads. The waterlogging has caused considerable disruption to daily life and commuting within the city.Officials, including Gurugram Police Commissioner Vikas Arora and Deputy Commissioner Ajay Kumar, carried out late-night inspections of NH-48 and Sohna Road to assess the situation and coordinate relief measures, according to the ANI. The inspections aimed to monitor the traffic conditions and ensure safety protocols were being followed.The advisory clearly stated: ""In view of the forecast, all corporate offices and private institutions in the district are advised to guide their employees to work from home; and all schools in the district are advised to conduct online classes on 02-09-2025."" This directive was issued to reduce the risk of travel during extreme weather and to keep the public safe.The Gurugram Deputy Commissioner also posted a message on X, appealing to residents to cooperate with officials and adhere to the guidelines. ""The district administration appeals to the public to exercise caution in view of the weather conditions, avoid stepping out of their homes unnecessarily, and follow the administration's guidelines,"" the DC wrote.Earlier, Congress workers staged a protest against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government, highlighting the poor management of waterlogging in Gurugram following the incessant rains. District Congress President (Rural) Vardhan Yadav referred to Gurugram as 'Sink City', pointing out the difficulties faced by residents. ""This road, which connects the main roads of Gurugram, must be passed via boats within a few minutes of rain,"" he said during the protest, as reported by the ANI.The protesters even brought out a boat to demonstrate the waterlogging situation on the streets, shouting slogans as the streets remained flooded.The heavy rain also impacted Delhi Metro services, particularly on the Blue Line between Indraprastha and Barakhamba stations. The metro experienced disruptions following the incessant rainfall, causing inconvenience to commuters, as reported by the ANI.The DDMA advisory and local administration continue to monitor the situation closely as the city braces for more rainfall. Residents have been urged to stay updated with weather warnings and follow all safety instructions.","Gurugram has experienced heavy rainfall, receiving over 100 millimetres of rain until Monday evening.

China and India are two of the most civilisational countries.”“We are the world's two most populous countries and part of the Global South... It is vital to be friends, a good neighbour, and the Dragon and the Elephant to come together,” he added.PM Modi, on the second day of his visit, shared warm moments with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping as they met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit 2025 in Tianjin.

Terrorism is not just a challenge to the security of a country but a common challenge for all of humanity.""""We have to say clearly and unanimously that no double standards are acceptable on terrorism,"" he added.""This attack was an open challenge to every country and person who believes in humanity. In such a situation, it is natural to raise the question of whether the open support of terrorism by some countries can be acceptable to us. We have to unanimously oppose terrorism in every form and colour. This is our duty towards humanity,” the Prime Minister further said.PM Modi also took a veiled jibe at China's Belt and Road Initiative as he said that connectivity loses its trust and meaning if it bypasses sovereignty.While speaking at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in China's Tianjin, PM Modi pointed to the SCO Charter and said that connectivity should always respect sovereignty and territorial integrity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday addressed the plenary session at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin and called for a united global fight against terrorism.

Connectivity that bypasses sovereignty loses trust and meaning,"" PM Modi said.""India firmly believes that strong connectivity ensures not just trade, but also trust and development. That is why we are working on Chabahar and the International North-South Economic Corridor, which will enhance connectivity to Afghanistan and Central Asia,"" he added.SCO member states ""strongly condemned"" the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, expressing their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased and the injured.""The Member States strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025.

The warmth in India-Russia ties, despite mounting American pressure on India to discontinue its oil purchase from Russia, was on full display in China, as President Vladimir Putin and PM Narendra Modi walked hand in hand at the SCO summit and later travelled together in Putin’s luxury sedan, Aurus Senat, to the venue for their bilateral meeting.In their talks, Modi strongly backed ties with Russia saying the 2 countries have always stood shoulder-to-shoulder even in difficult circumstances and close cooperation between them is important for global peace, stability and prosperity. Putin said that the bilateral tes, which are friendly and based on trust,will continue to grow.The PM spent more time with Putin in Tianjin than with any other leader. This included thecarpool ride, another 45 minutes in the car even after reaching the meeting venue and an hour-long bilateral meeting. According to official sources, Putin wanted to travel together with Modi from the SCO summit venue to the hotel where the meeting was to take place, and even waited for about 10 minutes for the PM to join him. The leaders, who were also spotted in a huddle with President Xi Jinping at the SCO venue earlier, were said to havediscussed various issues in the car, while the Russian and Indian delegations waited inside the hotel.In the bilateral meeting, Modi did not specifically call for an immediate ceasefire but told Putin in his opening remarks that the “aspiration of entire humanity” was for all parties to work constructively and end the conflict.“We hope that all parties shall proceed ahead constructively. A way must be found to end this conflict and establish lasting peace,” recalling his past conversation with Putin on the issue and welcoming all recent efforts for establishing peace.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called Modi ahead of the meeting to emphasise the need for an immediate ceasefire without which, he said, it was going to be difficult to have peace talks. He had said later Modi was ready to give “appropriate signal” to Putin.According to an Indian readout, the leaders discussed bilateral cooperation, including in the economic, financial, and energy sectors and expressed satisfaction with the sustained growth in bilateral ties in these areas.On Ukraine, it said, Modi reiterated his support for the recent initiatives that have been taken to address the conflict in Ukraine and emphasized the need to expedite a cessation of the conflict, and to find a durable peace settlement.“The two leaders reaffirmed their support for further strengthening of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between the two countries,” said the Indian government, adding that the PM was looking forward to hosting him for the 23rd annual summit later this year. The summit will take place in December.Modi told Putin 140 crore Indians were eagerly waiting to welcome him for the summit. “This is a reflection of the depth and scope of our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. India and Russia have always stood shoulder-to-shoulder even in the most difficult situations,” said Modi.In his own remarks, Putin said that the multifaceted Russia–India ties will continue to actively develop and trade and economic ties are seeing “positive momentum”.“Russia and India have maintained special relations for decades – friendly and based on trust. This is the foundation for the development of our relations in the future, and these relations are absolutely non-partisan in nature, supported by the overwhelming majority of the peoples of our two countries,” said Putin, adding the 2 countries will closely coordinate efforts on global forums like the UN, BRICS, G20 and SCO.This was the first meeting between Modi and Putin after the Trump administration an additional 25 percent tariff on India for its procurement of crude from Russia. Top US officials have repeatedly targeted India in the past few weeks, accusing the Indian government of bankrolling Russia’s war machine and even calling it Modi’s war. Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Monday India was being punished for buying Russian oil.","The PM spent more time with Putin in Tianjin than with any other leader.

NEW DELHI: Russia is studying potential investments plans to manufacture its Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jets in India, defence sources told ANI, amid growing bonhomie between New Delhi and Moscow.India had earlier expressed the need for at least two to three squadrons of fifth-generation fighter aircraft, with both Russia’s Su-57 and America’s F-35 in the race.Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which already builds the Russian-origin Su-30 MKI in Nashik, is seen as a possible hub for Su-57 production if the plan materialises.Russian agencies are currently assessing the level of investment required to manufacture the aircraft in India, defence sources told ANI.There are other facilities in India also where a number of other Russian origin equipment is manufactured and can be used in the fifth-generation fighter aircraft production, if required to be manufactured in India, which would also help cut costs, they added.The discussions come at a time when US President Donald Trump has targeted India with steep tariffs, 50% across sectors and an additional 25% citing Russian oil imports, while New Delhi continues to deepen ties with Moscow.In recent talks, India has sought advanced air defence systems like the S-400 and S-500 from Russia, while Moscow has been urging New Delhi to purchase Su-57 fighter jets.India was part of the Russian Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft programme nearly a decade ago but later withdrew over differences.However, sources told ANI that the project could be revived given the current global scenario, even as the US continues to push its F-35 offer to India.Meanwhile, India is simultaneously developing its indigenous fifth-generation fighter aircraft, expected to take its first flight by 2028 and be commissioned by 2035.","Russia is studying potential investments plans to manufacture its Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jets in India, defence sources told ANI.

BJP Raises Objection Over Alleged Abuses At Congress Rally Against PM Modi's Mother





What's next?



NEW DELHI: For 16 days, Rahul Gandhi’s 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' carved a noisy trail through Bihar ’s dusty highways and crowded colonies. More than a campaign, it was pitched as a ""moral"" crusade: a fight to ""protect the vote"" of millions allegedly struck off the rolls. The march had political theatrics, constitutional sermons, and opposition show of force - adding to both hope and controversy.Over 1,300 km, across 25 of 38 districts and 110 assembly constituencies, Rahul Gandhi walked, rode bikes, and waved his way through Bihar's politically charged landscape. From Sasaram to Patna, the yatra drew vast crowds, with slogans like 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor' echoing throughout.INDIA bloc allies joined at different stages, turning the yatra into a a portrait of opposition unity.At its core, the campaign was about a single phrase 'vote theft.' Rahul Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Election Commission of disenfranchising more than 65 lakh voters, disproportionately Dalits, OBCs, Muslims, and the poor, through the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.""This is not just about Bihar, it is about India's democracy,"" he declared at multiple stops, equating the march with a defence of the Constitution itself.While Congress has long been a marginal force in Bihar, this yatra has pushed Rahul Gandhi into the role of lead protagonist in the opposition drama, rather than a supporting character.Though Congress has long been a minor player in Bihar politics, the yatra has also revived its cadre, giving local workers visibility and provided the party a chance to reset its organisational machinery months before Bihar assembly elections By framing the battle as one of rights and democracy, rather than caste politics alone, Congress seeks to leapfrog back into Bihar's political relevance. The yatra has also sharpened opposition attacks on the EC, ensuring the issue will reverberate in coming elections.The finale in Patna on Monday tied the campaign's rhetoric to history. Marching from Gandhi Maidan to Ambedkar’s statue, Rahul Gandhi invoked both leaders’ legacies, casting the yatra as a ""revolution for electoral justice.""Visuals of him in white T-shirt and local gamcha, riding jeeps and chatting with villagers, were circulated widely on social media by the party - crafted as proof of a grounded, accessible leader. Congress leader also stepped into knee-deep waters to see how makhana (fox nuts) - world's new favourite superfood from Bihar - is grown. Sharing a video of his interaction, Rahul said the entire hard work is done by 99 per cent 'Bahujans' while the benefit goes to only 1 per cent middlemen, as he vowed to fight this ""injustice"".But the road was not without bumps. A police constable injured in Rahul Gandhi’s convoy became a flashpoint for BJP attacks. Meanwhile, alleged abusive remarks against PM Modi during a rally in Darbhanga drew sharp and coordinated criticism from the BJP.Both party workers also clashes in Patna over the remarks escalating political tensions.The yatra has undeniably energised Congress’s rank and file, repositioned Rahul Gandhi as a rights-focused challenger to PM Modi, and sent a message of opposition unity in a state where caste politics usually dominates. But the unanswered question remains: will this momentum last, or will it fade like previous Congress spurts?For now, Rahul Gandhi leaves Bihar having turned ""vote theft"" into a political battle cry and hoping his yatra is remembered less as a roadshow, and more as the beginning of a movement that translates into results in upcoming elections.","Rahul Gandhi’s 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' carved a noisy trail through Bihar ’s dusty highways and crowded colonies.

'No Perpetrators...': SCO Summit Delivers Stunning Blow To Pakistan Over Pahalgam Terror Attack

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states on Monday have 'strongly condemned' the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22 expressing their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased and the injured.""The Member States strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025.

It reaffirmed the SCO members’ firm commitment to fighting terrorism, separatism, and extremism. It also highlighted the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist, or extremist groups for mercenary purposes.It further stressed the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats.Member states strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, underscoring that double standards in the fight against terrorism are unacceptable and called on the international community to combat terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists.On 22 April, a terrorist attack in Baisaran Valley, Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir , killed 26 people, including 25 Indians and a Nepali tourist.In retaliation, India launched Operation Sindoor on the night of 6–7 May.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,” he explained.","Rekha Ram Kalbelia, 55, from Rajasthan's Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.

"SCO condemns Pahalgam, PM says certain states’ support for terrorism unacceptable",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-condemns-pahalgam-pm-says-certain-states-support-for-terrorism-unacceptable/articleshow/123643111.cms,"SCO Echoes India’s Stance On Pahalgam Terror Attack; Pak PM Watches In Silence

The SCO Tianjin Declaration strongly condemned the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice. Without naming Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi in his address warned member-states against double standards on terrorism and questioned if the open support for terrorism by certain countries can ever be acceptable to the member-states.While the strong condemnation of Pahalgam allowed India to endorse the declaration, the SCO in the same breath, and as a compromise sought by Pakistan, condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express in March and another attack in Khuzdar in May this year.Pakistan has accused India of having a role in the Jaffar Express attack. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had earlier refused to sign on to a joint statement by SCO that didn’t mention the Pahalgam attack on civilians in J&K.“We have to say clearly, and in one voice, that no double standards on terrorism will be acceptable. We have to oppose terrorism together, in every colour and form. This is our responsibility towards humanity,” said Modi in his remarks at the summit.The PM said that SCO stood for 3 pillars - Security, Connectivity and Opportunity. In his remarks, Modi mentioned the Pahalgam attack, calling it an assault not just on the conscience of India but also an open challenge to every country and every individual who believes in humanity.“For the past 4 decades, India has been bearing the grave scars of ruthless terrorism. Countless mothers have lost their children, and innumerable children have been left orphaned. Recently, we witnessed the most heinous face of terrorism in Pahalgam,” said the PM, thanking all nations that stood by India.Modi also said that Terrorism was not only a threat to the security of individual nations, but a shared challenge to all of humanity. “No country, no society, no citizen can consider themselves completely safe from it. That is why India has consistently stressed the importance of unity in the fight against terrorism,” he said, recalling India’s initiative under the SCO counterterrorism mechanism to counter Al-Qaeda and its affiliated terrorist organizations. He backed joint measures against radicalization, extremism and separatism and thanked SCO for supporting India’s position on terror-financing.The Declaration strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, stressed that double standards in the fight against terrorism are unacceptable, and called on the international community to combat terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists.On connectivity, India again was the only SCO State to not back China’s BRI because its flagship project, China Pakistan Economic Corridor, passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir. The PM said in his remarks “connectivity that bypasses sovereignty ultimately loses both trust and meaning”.Modi underlined that efforts towards connectivity must uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, saying this is also enshrined in the core principles of the SCO Charter. He also urged SCO to increase mutual cooperation for reforms of global institutions and call unanimously for UN reform.“To confine the aspirations of the Global South to outdated frameworks is to deny justice to future generations. The colourful dreams of the new generation cannot be displayed on a black-and-white screen. It is time to change the screen,” he said.The PM also underscored that India has been an active member of SCO, which many see as an important platform for India to stress its strategic autonomy, and has always contributed in a constructive and positive manner.While underlining the significance of sovereignty, Modi backed strong connectivity saying it does not merely facilitate trade but also opens the doors to trust and development. “It is with this vision that we are working on initiatives such as the Chabahar Port and the International North-South Transport Corridor. Through these, we can enhance our linkages with Afghanistan and Central Asia,” said the PM.On opportunity, Modi backed more cooperation and reform recalling that in 2023, under India’s presidency, the SCO witnessed “fresh energy and ideas” along with new areas of cooperation like start-ups and innovation, traditional medicine and digital inclusion. To strengthen people-to-people ties, he proposed creation of a Civilizational Dialogue Forum under the SCO. “Such a platform will allow us to share the richness of our ancient civilizations, art, literature, and traditions on a global stage,” said Modi.",The SCO Tianjin Declaration strongly condemned the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin were seen sharing light moments and walking hand-in-hand during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin on Monday, while Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif looked on as the leaders passed him during the group photo session.PM Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were also seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation, underscoring the camaraderie among the three leaders at the summit.“Interactions in Tianjin continue! Exchanging perspectives with President Putin and President Xi during the SCO Summit,” PM Modi posted on X, along with pictures from the event.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that Pm Modi will address the plenary session of the 25th SCO Heads of State Council Summit later in the day. “Prime Minister will be addressing the plenary session of the Summit, where he will outline India’s approach to fostering regional cooperation under the SCO umbrella,” Misri said.Following the plenary, PM Modi is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin. On Sunday, PM Modi also met Xi, where both leaders agreed that India and China are “development partners, not rivals.”They emphasised the need for peace along the border, supported a mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary issue, and agreed to resume direct flights.Modi also invited Xi to attend the 2026 Brics Summit in India.In another engagement, PM Modi met Xi’s close aide Cai Qi in Tianjin. During the meeting, PM Modi shared his vision for India-China relations, while Cai reaffirmed Beijing’s intent to deepen exchanges. Misri said a banquet was replaced by a brief interaction due to scheduling constraints.The SCO currently has 10 member states, with India becoming a full member in 2017.Meanwhile, India’s S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” missile defence systems played a crucial role during “Operation Sindoor” on the night of May 7 and 8. The Indian Air Force successfully intercepted Pakistani drones and missiles aimed at 15 Indian cities, according to ANI reports quoting domain experts.Officials confirmed that debris from Pakistani drones and missiles was recovered at multiple sites, providing evidence of the attack. India’s Integrated Counter-UAS Grid and Air Defence systems thwarted the attempt, preventing damage to key assets.The S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” — India’s name for the Russian-made Triumf system — can engage targets up to 400 km away and detect threats as far as 600 km. Equipped with phased-array radar, it can track over 100 targets simultaneously and neutralise threats ranging from drones to ballistic missiles.India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 for five S-400 units, the first of which was deployed in Punjab in 2021. The advanced system is seen as a game-changer in South Asia, bolstering India’s multi-layered air defence and giving it a strategic edge against Pakistan and China.The government described the May 7 strikes as “focused, measured, and non-escalatory,” clarifying that no Pakistani military installations were targeted. However, after Pakistan escalated on Wednesday, Indian forces struck back, neutralising Pakistani air defence systems, including one in Lahore.","PM Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation.

NEW DELHI: India joined other SCO member states in strongly condemning in the Tianjin Declaration the military strikes by Israel and the US on Iran, a member of the Eurasian group, in June this year. SCO had in June too condemned Israel's military strikes on Iran in a joint statement, but India had then refused to associate itself from it saying the Indian govt wasn't a part of the discussions that preceded the condemnation.The Tianjin Declaration said such aggressive actions against civilian targets, including nuclear energy infrastructure, which resulted in the death of civilians, are a gross violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter, and an infringement of Iran's sovereignty.""They undermine regional and international security and have serious implications for global peace and stability,"" it said. The Declaration also noted that the physical nuclear safety and security of nuclear facilities must be ensured on a permanent basis, including during periods of armed conflict, in order to protect the population and the environment from harm.Reiterating their ""deep concern"" over the continuing escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the member states also strongly condemned the actions that have led to numerous casualties among the civilian population and a catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.""They stress the need to ensure an immediate, complete and sustainable ceasefire, access to humanitarian aid, and intensified efforts to achieve peace, stability and security for all residents of the region,"" it said.India had in June also abstained from voting on a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Its decision to distance itself from the SCO condemnation of Israel then was seen as another show of solidarity with Israel. The fact that Pakistan, a traditional foe, is also a member of SCO was also seen as a likely factor in India's decision at the time.""Member states note that the only possible way to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East is through a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian question,"" said the Declaration.",India joined other SCO member states in strongly condemning the military strikes by Israel and the US on Iran.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's friendly gestures with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the SCO Summit on Monday drew more attention than the official proceedings, setting off a wave of reactions on Chinese social media.Their ""hand-in-hand"" walk, a hug, and a ride together in Putin's Aurus Senat limousine quickly went viral. On Baidu, China's biggest search engine, the top trend read: ""Modi and Putin hugged and chatted hand-in-hand."" On Weibo, the leading social media platform, the headline was: ""Modi takes Putin's car.""Reports said Putin waited about 10 minutes for Modi so they could travel together from the summit venue to their bilateral meeting. What began as a short drive turned into a 45-minute exchange, as the two kept talking even after arriving.Posting a photo from the car, Modi wrote on X: ""After the proceedings at the SCO Summit venue, President Putin and I travelled together to the venue of our bilateral meeting. Conversations with him are always insightful.""The timing of the optics is important. Russia remains under strict Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, while India is facing pressure from the US and Europe for continuing its energy and defence ties with Moscow.Analysts saw Modi's public warmth with Putin as a message that New Delhi intends to keep its ""Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership"" intact despite global concerns.Their one-hour meeting later covered cooperation in trade, fertilisers, space, defence and culture, with Modi repeating India's call for a peaceful solution to the Ukraine conflict.For China, which hosted the summit, the images highlighted changing power dynamics in the region. The surge of online interest in the Modi-Putin chemistry suggested a wider public reading of the two leaders as symbols of a counterbalance to Western influence.As one Weibo user remarked: ""Modi rides Putin's car - that's more symbolic than any speech at the summit.""","PM Narendra Modi's friendly gestures with Russian President Vladimir Putin drew more attention than the official proceedings.

"Why are minority institutions left out of RTE, asks SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-are-minority-institutions-left-out-of-rte-asks-sc/articleshow/123643958.cms,"RTE exemption may undermine vision of universal edu: SC

NEW DELHI: Expressing serious doubts about its own 2014 verdict delivered by a five-judge constitution bench, which held that provisions of Right to Education (RTE) Act were not applicable to religious and linguistic minority educational institutions, Supreme Court has said the ruling ""strikes at the heart of good quality universal elementary education, its consequences are far-reaching"", and hence it needs to be re-examined.While deciding a batch of pleas from Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra on whether passing the Teacher Eligibility Test was mandatory for appointment in minority-run schools, a two-judge bench referred the case to CJI to consider the desirability of forwarding the matter to a larger bench. It said putting minority institutions outside the Act's ambit would weaken the idea of inclusivity.Minority schools aren't bound by the law that sets rules for appointment of teachers and the provision of free education for poor students.The SC bench said its own 2014 judgment essentially created a dichotomy between RTE under Article 21A and the collective rights under Article 30(1), which is about the right of minority communities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.""We respectfully express our doubt as to whether Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust (case) (insofar as it exempts the application of the RTE Act to minority schools, whether aided or unaided, falling under clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution) has been correctly decided...Thus,ultimately, a reconsideration (of the judgment) seems unavoidable,"" Justice Dipankar Datta, who penned the verdict for the bench, also comprising Justice Manmohan, said.The bench said, ""We hasten to observe with utmost humility at our command that the decision in Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust (case) might have, unknowingly, jeopardised the very foundation of universal elementary education. Exemption of minority institutions from the RTE Act leads to fragmentation of the common schooling vision and weakening of the idea of inclusivity and universality envisioned by Article 21A. """"We are afraid, instead of uniting children across caste, class, creed, and community, it reinforces 'divides' and 'dilutes' the transformative potential of shared learning spaces. If the goal is to build an equal and cohesive society, such exemptions move us in the opposite direction,"" it said.The bench framed four issues to be adjudicated by a larger bench and it included whether the 2014 verdict, exempting minority educational institutions from the purview of the RTE Act, requires reconsideration.The bench noted that exemption of minority schools from the Act was being misused.","Supreme Court expresses serious doubts about its own 2014 verdict delivered by a five-judge constitution bench.

SC validates 85% MBBS quota for locals in Telangana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-validates-85-mbbs-quota-for-locals-in-telangana/articleshow/123643876.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said since states have given up 15% of MBBS seats to the all India quota (AIQ), they can validly reserve rest of the seats in govt medical colleges for natives, and upheld Telangana’s medical admission norm mandating a candidate to study classes 9-12 within the state.During hearing of petitions, which questioned the validity of such a rule, a bench comprsing Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran had repeatedly asked the state govt that would it be unfair to students whose parents are natives of Telangana but for better coaching facilities sent their wards to cities outside the state.The bench had even suggested that the state could have made the 2024 domicile rule applicable from 2028 to allow students to study for four consecutive years in the state prior to taking the NEET-UG examination for admissions to medical colleges. However, in its judgment the bench upheld Telangana’s domicile rule while recording the state’s concessions — children of state govt employees and all India service Telangana cadre officers who studied outside because of posting of their parents outside the state would be eligible for admissions.Writing the judgment recording the relaxations for children of state and all India services employees posted outside Telangana, Justice Chandran said, “We uphold the Rules of 2017 as it stood amended in 2024.”This means that children of natives of Telangana, working in private companies and posted outside the state, would not be eligible to admissions in the 85% of MBBS seats in govt medical colleges of the state.Faulting the HC order scaling down the ‘domicile’ eligibility conditions for admission, SC cited its 2018 judgment upholding a similar domicile eligibility criterion devised by Assam.The court had said there was no data on record to state that adequate coaching facilities for medical entrance examination was unavailable in the state. It had said that those who can afford coaching outside the state fall in the affluent class of citizens and could compete for the 15% all India quota MBBS seats reserved in every state-run medical college.","The Supreme Court said since states have given up 15% of MBBS seats to the all India quota (AIQ), they can validly reserve rest of the seats in govt medical colleges for natives.

NEW DELHI: Former vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday vacated VP Enclave, almost six weeks after his unexpected resignation from the second highest constitutional post. Dhankhar has shifted to a farmhouse at Gadaipur in south Delhi's Chhatarpur, which belongs to INLD chief Abhay Chautala , in what is supposed to be an encampment before he gets an official bungalow.Videos showed Dhankhar, the first occupant of the Enclave, leaving the sprawling complex in the evening, accompanied by a cavalcade of cars, police escort vehicles, and an ambulance.Chautala said on X that he had offered his place to the ex-VP because of their old family links. ""We have old family ties with him. He is like a family member. When I asked him where he was shifting, he said he was thinking about it. I told him it (my farmhouse) is his house. Till the new official accommodation is allotted and ready, he can stay in our house,"" the INLD chief said.A few days ago, INLD leader Abhay Chautala had told mediapersons in Haryana that he was confident of Jagdeep Dhankhar soon speaking about why he resigned from the VP post while asserting that he had spoken to the former VP.Sources said the VP Enclave will be made ready for Dhankhar's successor in the next 10 days. The VP election will be held on Sept 9 and NDA's candidate C P Radhakrishnan is the favourite. TOI has learnt that so far there has been no movement to identify any retirement home for Dhankhar, with sources saying that the housing & urban affairs ministry would begin shortlisting available type-VIII bungalows in the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone after getting a communication from MHA.

Sources said that usually such requests are routed through the proper channel.Dhankhar shared close ties with former deputy PM Devi Lal and his son, the ex-chief minister of Haryana Om Prakash Chautala.

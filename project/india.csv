SC takes suo motu cognizance of ‘digital arrest’ scam; scammers forged top court's order to extort Rs 1 cr from woman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-takes-suo-motu-cognizance-of-digital-arrest-scam-scammers-forged-top-courts-order-to-extort-rs-1-cr-from-woman/articleshow/124619525.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of spiralling incidents of seamsters suing ‘digital arrest’ to extort money from citizens, especially senior citizens, after a septuagenarian woman from Ambala made a startling complaint - orders of SC were forged by scammers to con her into parting with over Rs 1 crore of her hard-earned money.The complainant, a 73-year-old woman from Ambala in Haryana, wrote a complaint to the CJI B R Gavai alleging that the seamsters produced a forged order of the SC purportedly passed by the previous CJI Sanjiv Khanna to put her on digital arrest and extort more than Rs 1 crore to set her free.The CJI and senior judges of the SC took serious note of the audacity of the seamsters to forge court orders, that too of the highest court of the land, to resort to ‘digital arrest’, a phenomenon unknown to law, in running extortion rackets across the country.The suo motu petition titled “In re: Victims of Digital Arrest Related to Forged Documents” will be taken up by a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday to decide whether the state police is competent enough to deal with the menace of ‘digital arrest’ scam or it required to be entrusted to central probe agencies equipped to make a country-wide probe.The unusual spike in incidents of digital arrest in recent years and the victims being vulnerable senior citizens, the SC would also consider whether judicial monitoring of the probe is required to give the investigations the desired swiftness and bring the culprits to book.The National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP) had recorded 2,746 reported cases of digital arrest during Jan-Aug 2024, which nearly doubled to 4,439 cases in Jan-Aug 2025. The authorities have been issuing advertisements making citizens aware of the fraud and advising them to ignore threats of ‘digital arrest’ while reporting the incidents to police concerned.The govt agencies had blocked over 1,700 Skype IDs and 59,000 WhatsApp accounts used in these scams. Official statistics reveal that seamsters extorted nearly Rs 25 billion from citizens through ‘digital arrest’.",The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of spiralling incidents of seamsters suing ‘digital arrest’ to extort money from citizens.

NEW DELHI: Actor and Padma Shri awardee Manoj Bajpayee on Thursday lashed out at the Rashtriya Janata Dal ’s (RJD) IT cell for circulating a manipulated campaign clip that falsely featured him.The four-time National Award-winning actor took strong exception to the use of the clip, which was posted by the parody account of Tejashwi Yadav , who is a CM candidate for the oppositionAfter the clip went viral, Bajpayee issued a stern public clarification. Quoting the post, he wrote: “I would like to publicly state that I have no association or allegiance with any political party. The video being circulated is a fake, patched-up edit of an ad I did for @PrimeVideoIN. I sincerely appeal to everyone sharing it to stop spreading such distorted content and urge people not to engage with or encourage such misleading content. ”The post prompted RJD’s IT wing to delete the video, but not before it had already ignited a storm online.Hours after the actor issued a clarification, the BJP attacked the Tejashwi-led RJD for using the actor's video without his consent.""Shame on RJD ecosystem for circulating fake video of Actor Manoj Bajpayee for its campaign in Bihar!

Interestingly, Khesari Lal has also launched a devotional YouTube channel, signalling what many see as a personal shift toward spirituality even as he enters the political fray.BJP, on the other hand, has fielded folk singer Maithili Thakur from Alinagar in Darbhanga district. Maithili turned 25 recently. Her father Ramesh Thakur is also her guru and teaches music. She had recently met BJP state incharge Vinod Tawde and union minister Nityanand Rai.The high-voltage campaign is building up ahead of voting for the 18th Bihar assembly, which will take place in two phases on November 6 and 11 across 243 constituencies.

NEW DELHI: Taking a leaf out of former chief election commission er (CEC) T N Seshan’s book, the Election Commission has asked its Bihar poll machinery to set up separate enclosures for identification of ‘purdanasheen’ women voters in the polling stations, using innovative but locally available, inexpensive materials like charpoys and bedspreads.Implementing the directions issued by the Seshan-led EC in 1994, the current commission has directed the Bihar chief electoral officer (CEO), district election officers (DEOs) or returning officers (ROs), assistant ROs and presiding officers to create these enclosures to ensure that no woman stays away from voting purely due to lack of privacy and other required facilities at polling stations.The poll body will identify areas and polling stations with significant number of veil-wearing women and ensure that adequate lady staff, including at least one woman polling officer, are included in the polling parties. “Separated enclosures for identification of purdanasheen women should be provided in the polling station with locally available but absolutely inexpensive devices and using local ingenuity, such as use of charpoys or cloth such as bed spreads.The 1994 instructions also sought the deployment of at least one lady polling officer in polling stations where the number of women electors is 50% or above and where the system of burqa or purdah is observed as a social custom.In polling stations exclusively meant for women electors, the polling personnel shall have as many lady officers as available, consistent with overall security requirements.In other polling stations too, at least one lady polling officer shall be appointed for identifying and assisting women voters. The services if lady village level workers or anganwadi workers, gram sevikas and lady school teachers shall be used for identification of purdahnasheen women voters.Also, where women polling staff are not available in adequate numbers, the returning officer or presiding officer may appoint any woman as an attendant to assist women electors and also the presiding officer in respect of women electors. Care should be taken to ensure that such attendants do not have any known leanings for allegiance to any political party or candidate.Some of the reasons cited in the 1994 instructions, for the low women voter turnout was included social and religious taboos, particularly among purdahnasheen women of a particular community or women of certain other communities observing the purdah system in the presence of family and village elders, or to sentimental reasons in some tribal areas.",The Election Commission has asked its Bihar poll machinery to set up separate enclosures for identification of ‘purdanasheen’ women voters.

Census pre-test from November 10 to November 30; self-enumeration during November 1-10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-pre-test-from-november-10-to-november-30-self-enumeration-during-november-1-10/articleshow/124618465.cms,"NEW DELHI: The pre-test for houselisting phase of Census 2027 will be undertaken from Nov 10 to Nov 30, 2025 in selected sample areas spread across all states and Union territories, the Centre announced in a notification issued on Thursday.The pre-test — meant to test efficacy of the census questionnaire, proposed data collection methods including via the digital mode and other logistics – will allow an option of self-enumeration to the respondents between Nov 1 and Nov 7, 2025.The pre-test will cover only the houselisting and housing phase of the upcoming census exercise — which gets underway in April 1, 2026 — as per the notification issued by MHA in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 17A of the Census Act, 1948, read with rule 6D of the Census Rules, 1990.The home ministry had on June 16, 2025, notified its intent to conduct Census 2027 — the first ever to be done in the digital mode — with March 1, 2027, as the reference date. For the UT of Ladakh and snow-bound areas of J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the reference date would be advanced by six months, to 00.00 hours of the first day of October 2026.According to sources, Census 2027 - which is likely to put out final population data by 2027-end, setting the stage for delimitation and, based on it, implementation of women's quota in legislatures by the 2029 general election and, eventually, increase in strength of the Lok Sabha and state assemblies - is likely to replicate the schedule of past decennial exercises.It will be held in two phases - housing listing operations, likely between April 1, 2026, and Sept 2026, followed by population enumeration from Feb 9 to 28, 2027.Caste enumeration - a first since the 1931 Census - is likely to be done in the second phase of population enumeration. Unlike the 2011 exercises, no parallel updation of the Narional Population Register (NPR) is planned along with Census 2027.A four-day, intensive training of lead trainers for Census 2027 pre-test was conducted last week at the Registrar General of India and Census Commissioner’s office here on Friday. These lead trainers are now training the enumerators in the states/Union territories, following which the pre-test will be taken up in the field.A pre-test was last conducted for Census 2021 — before the exercise had to be put on hold on account of the Covid pandemic — in August-September 2019. However, since the Census methods have since been updated — with major improvements in applications to capture data and options of self-enumeration for both the houselisting and population enumeration phase — a fresh pre-test was deemed necessary. No fresh questionnaire has been notified yet for Census 2027; in all probability, there shall be no change in the data fields to be captured in the houselisting phase.Refresher training in the coming days will reorient the 34 lakh enumerators and supervisors and 1.3 lakh Census functionaries in the use of Census apps and the Census management and monitoring system.","The pre-test will cover only the houselisting and housing phase of the upcoming census exercise.

SC dismisses Telangana plea against HC stay on 42% OBC quota,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-dismisses-telangana-plea-against-hc-stay-on-42-obc-quota/articleshow/124617676.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court Thursday dismissed Telangana govt’s plea challenging a high court order staying implementation of 42% reservation for backward classes in local body polls.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked Telangana HC to decide the main matter on merits.“You may continue with your elections. The order shall not affect the HC in deciding the case on its own merits,” it said while dismissing the petition.On Oct 9, HC said increase in OBC quota appeared to violate the 50% limit set for reservations by SC and stayed the govt order. It had said the local body elections could proceed without implementing the proposed quota hike. Telangana had passed three govt orders — one on provision of 42% reservation to OBC in local bodies, and two consequential orders laying down on guidelines for fixation of such reservations in respect to elections to mandal praja parishads, zilla praja parishads and gram panchayats under Telangana Panchayat Raj Act, 2018.","Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked Telangana HC to decide the main matter on merits. “You may continue with your elections.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: In a surprising development, Supreme Court’s five-judge collegium led by CJI B R Gavai has spelled out the reason — Union govt’s objection — for changing the transfer destination of Madhya Pradesh HC’s Justice Atul Sreedharan from Chhattisgarh HC to Allahabad HC.Two months ago, the collegium had uploaded a statement on its August 25-26 meetings that resulted in recommending Centre transfer 14 judges from HCs where they were discharging their duties to other ones. Justice Sreedharan’s name figured at the top of the list, specifying that he was being transferred from MP HC to Chhattisgarh HC.On October 14, the collegium statement said it acceded to the government’s request for reconsideration of Justice Sreedharan’s transfer to Chhattisgarh, where he would have been senior enough to be part of the HC collegium, and “resolved to recommend” his transfer from MP HC to Allahabad HC, where he would not be in the collegium.This incident brings to fore the increasing influence of Centre, which in the past has stalled or long delayed giving effect to three-judge SC collegium decisions recommending appointments of several persons as HC judges, in the sphere of transfers. SC through its judgments had given primacy to the collegium in matters of appointment and transfers of HC and SC judges.Interestingly, recommendations of the same five-member collegium for appointment of SC judges have been notified with extreme expedition, sometimes in 48 hours, by the government in the past.However, several recommendations by the collegium, comprising CJI and four most senior judges, for transfers have been selectively put in cold storage by the government without assigning any reason. Surprisingly, the SC collegium through CJI has not made attempts to give effect to its recommendations pertaining to transfers.This has left those HC judges, whose transfers have been recommended by the collegium but not given effect, in a piquant situation — whether to take up cases that require detailed hearing or to wind up pending work.A similar incident took place eight years ago. Then 5-J collegium led by incumbent CJI Dipak Misra had recommended transfer of Karnataka HC’s Justice Jayant Patil, who during his stint at Gujarat HC had ordered a probe into the Ishrat Jahan case, to Bombay HC.The government immediately conveyed its disagreement to the proposal. The collegium hurriedly met at the residence of one of the judges and changed the transfer destination to Allahabad HC. Justice Patil tendered his resignation to the President.",Supreme Court's five-judge collegium led by CJI B R Gavai has spelled out the reason — Union govt’s objection — for changing the transfer destination of Justice Atul Sreedharan from Chhattisgarh HC to Allahabad HC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124617391,imgsize-8538,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-10-17-035450.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Cautioning high courts, and itself, against routinely ordering CBI probes, Supreme Court on Thursday said courts should invoke their power to direct an inquiry by the central agency as a last resort in an exceptional situation.A bench of justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi set aside Allahabad high court’s order directing a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the recruitment process for UP legislative council staff, saying the order was passed by HC on the basis of some doubt and assumptions. The bench also referred the matter back to the high court for a rehearing.“It is well settled that directions for CBI inquiry should not be ordered by the high courts or this court in a routine manner. The jurisprudence, as developed by this court through judgments qua the direction of an investigation by CBI is well settled. It imposes a significant self-restraint on the exercise of this extraordinary constitutional power under Article 32 or Article 226 of the Constitution. The exercise of inherent powers to direct CBI to investigate must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and only in exceptional situations,” Justice Maheshwari, who penned the judgment for the bench, said.“This court has consistently cautioned that a CBI investigation should not be directed as a matter of routine or merely because a party casts certain aspersions or harbours a subjective lack of confidence in the state police. It goes without saying that for invoking this power, the court concerned must be satisfied that the material placed prima facie discloses commission of offences and necessitates a CBI investigation to ensure the fundamental right to a fair and impartial investigation, or where the complexity, scale or national ramification of such allegations demands expertise of central agency,” he said.The bench said while there was no inflexible guideline to decide when such power should be exercised, courts may do it when a case had national or international ramifications. Interestingly, a bench headed by Justice Maheshwari, through an interim order on Monday, had directed CBI to probe the Karur stampede case in Tamil Nadu.Cautioning against burdening a central agency with matters that do not satisfy the threshold of an exceptional case, SC added: “An order directing an investigation to be carried out by CBI should be treated as a measure of last resort, justified only when the constitutional court is convinced that the integrity of the process has been compromised or has reasons to believe that it may get compromised to a degree that shakes the conscience of courts or public faith in the justice delivery system. ”“Such compelling circumstances may typically arise when the materials brought in notice of the court prima facie point towards systemic failure, the involvement of high-ranking state officials or politically influential persons, or when the local police’s conduct itself creates a reasonable doubt in the minds of the citizenry regarding their ability to conduct a neutral probe,” the bench said.",A bench of justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi set aside Allahabad high court’s order directing a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the recruitment process for UP legislative council staff.

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Both gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

A fifth-grade student from Gandhinagar, Gujarat, Ishit Bhatt, who appeared on Kaun Banega Crorepati 17 hosted by Amitabh Bachchan , faced intense social media criticism for his behavior on the show. Indian cricketer Varun Chakaravarthy, who recently led India to victory in the Asia Cup 2025, came to the student's defense on social media platform X, condemning the online abuse directed at the minor.The incident gained attention after clips from the show went viral, showing Ishit's interactions with host Amitabh Bachchan during the question-and-answer segment of the popular quiz show.During his appearance, Ishit displayed what many viewed as assertive behavior towards the show's format and host.""Mere ko rules pata hai isliye aap mereko abhi rules samjhane mat baithna,"" Ishit was heard saying on the show, indicating he already knew the rules and didn't need an explanation.The student continued with similar responses throughout his appearance, making demands about the game's progression.""Arre option daalo,"" he said while waiting for the options to be displayed on screen.When it came time to confirm his answer, Ishit stated, ""Sir ek kya uss mein chaar lock lagado, lekin lock karo.""The student's participation on the show ended without any prize money after he incorrectly answered a question about the Valmiki Ramayana.When asked to identify the first kanda of the Valmiki Ramayana, Ishit chose Ayodhya Kanda instead of the correct answer, Bala Kanda.Amitabh Bachchan addressed the situation during the show, saying, ""Kabhi kabhi bachhe over confidence mein galti kar dete hai.""The incident sparked widespread discussion on social media, with many criticizing the child's behavior and raising questions about parenting and the pressure faced by young participants on reality shows.Varun Chakaravarthy took to X to defend the young contestant, stating: ""Example of how social media has become a place for cowards running their mouths without any sense!

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%?

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday firmly rejected the United Kingdom's latest sanctions targeting Russia’s oil sector and Indian firms, reiterating that it does not recognise unilateral sanctions, warning against ""double standards"" in energy trade.""We have noted the latest sanctions announced by the UK... We do not subscribe to any unilateral sanctions. The Government of India considers the provision of energy security a responsibility of paramount importance to meet the basic needs of its citizens,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at his weekly media briefing.Jaiswal highlighted that Indian companies procure energy globally, considering overall market conditions. ""We would stress that there should be no double standards, especially when it comes to energy trade,"" he added.These remarks came after the UK government announced 90 new sanctions on Wednesday, targeting Russia’s oil exports and entities linked to its energy trade, including India’s Nayara Energy Limited.The move, coordinated between the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Treasury, aims to ""strike at the heart"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ""war chest"" in the conflict with Ukraine.""Today’s action demonstrates the government’s determination to cut off Putin's revenue streams – targeting Russian companies and their global enablers,"" the FCDO said in a statement.The sanctions cover four oil terminals in China, 44 oil tankers allegedly part of a ""shadow fleet"" transporting Russian crude, and Nayara Energy, which the UK claimed had imported 100 million barrels of Russian oil worth over $5 billion in 2024.London said the measures were meant to choke off energy revenues feeding Putin’s ""war chest"" amid the conflict in Ukraine.In response, Nayara Energy reaffirmed its compliance with Indian laws, stating that, ""Nayara Energy operates in full compliance with the laws and regulations of India. As an Indian company, we are deeply committed to supporting the nation’s energy security and fostering economic growth.""""We categorically state that this unilateral move by the European Union is founded on baseless assertions, representing an undue extension of authority that ignores both international law and the sovereignty of India,"" it added.The UK said its latest measures also directly target Russia's oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, which together export about 3.1 million barrels per day.The FCDO noted that Rosneft alone accounts for nearly half of Russia’s oil production and around six per cent of global supply.","The UK government announced 90 new sanctions on Wednesday, targeting Russia’s oil exports and entities linked to its energy trade.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

New Delhi: Supreme Court has expressed reluctance to accede to requests from SC Bar Association president Vikas Singh and solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against advocate Rakesh Kishore for attempting to hurl a shoe at CJI B R Gavai, and restrain social media from glorifying the incident.Though the attorney general has granted consent to initiating contempt actions, as is statutorily required, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi Thursday appeared to be wary of the possibility of contempt proceedings providing fresh fodder to those justifying his action.The mentioning was jointly made by Vikas Singh and other SCBA office bearers along with Mehta, who informed the bench that as per the requirement under Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, AG R Venkataramani has granted consent for initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore for his act, which grossly undermined institutional dignity and interfered with administration of justice.Singh said Kishore is being projected as a hero in a section of social media, which may encourage others to indulge in such reprehensible acts. The SG said SC must consider passing a John Doe order restraining all social media channels from glorifying the incident.Justice Kant said, “There will be multiple problems. SC as an institution has over the decades zealously protected the right to free speech. But we are also of the view that the right to free speech cannot be at the cost of the dignity and reputation of others.How to deal with these competing issues is the question. A John Doe order will trigger the next wave of derogatory comments.”Justices Kant and Bagchi said the CJI had magnanimously ignored the incident and appealed to everyone to follow suit. “The institution never gets affected by such incidents. It is our acts and behaviour which determine our dignity and respect. It is in that spirit that the CJI had brushed aside the incident as an irresponsible act of a citizen.”An unrepentant Kishore had claimed he had hurled the shoe to protest CJI's alleged remarks on the decapitated Vishnu idol at Khajuraho.The bench, on repeated pleas to initiate contempt proceedings, said, “Our request to you is to consider whether taking up the contempt plea would give fresh winds to intensify the contemptuous chirping in social media. Moreover, when we are already burdened with a heavy caseload, should we waste judicial time on such issues?”Mehta said the algorithm of social media is such that an incident like the present one gets amplified to monetise the content for the maker. Justice Bagchi said, “The algorithm is so programmed that the contents which appeal to the baser instincts of people go viral. Mere mentioning for initiation of contempt proceedings would go viral and monetise the makers. Let it die its natural death.”Justice Kant said, “The incident is to be treated with the contempt it deserves.”",Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi expressed reluctance to accede to requests from SC Bar Association president Vikas Singh and solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta.

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka cabinet on Thursday decided to frame new rules to regulate Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activities, including marches and events held on government-owned properties and public roads, information technology and biotechnology minister Priyank Kharge said, according to PTI.The decision follows a letter from Kharge to chief minister Siddaramaiah, seeking a ban on RSS activities and those of its affiliated organizations in public and government spaces.Speaking to reporters after the cabinet meeting, Kharge said, ""The rules we want to bring is regarding public places, government schools, colleges, government premises, government owned institutions and aided institutions. We will bring together the previous orders issued by the home department, law department, and the education department to frame a new rule. In the next two to three days, the new rule will come into force within the framework of law and the Constitution.

Whatever you have to do, it has to be done after seeking the government’s permission.""Kharge further explained that granting permission will be at the government’s discretion. ""There are parameters to grant permission... You cannot walk on the road waving sticks or take out ‘Patha Sanchalana’ (march) just by giving intimation to the authorities.

NEW DLEHI: Janhit Janata Dal (JJD) chief and Lalu Yadav ’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav , who is set to contest from Mahua constituency in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , filed his nomination on Thursday accompanied by a roadshow and carrying a photo of his grandmother Marchiya Devi.Speaking to reporters, he said the occasion was significant for him as he had moved ahead with the blessings of his grandmother and parents.""I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. On this auspicious occasion, as I am required to file my nomination, I have brought my grandmother with me. She lives on in our hearts... People of Mahua will support whoever works for them. I worked to make Mahua a district and also give employment opportunities to the youth,"" Tej Pratap said, as quoted by ANI.Tej Pratap, who currently represents Hasanpur, had earlier served as Mahua MLA from 2015 to 2020. The seat is now held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan.The JJD, which Tej Pratap floated after his expulsion from the RJD earlier this year, has announced 22 candidates in its first list for the assembly elections scheduled for November. His expulsion from the party followed a controversy involving a social media post where he claimed to be in a long-term relationship.Tej Pratap had later stated that his account was hacked.His strained ties with his family have played out publicly in recent months. On October 12, he unfollowed his younger brother and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on X. He had earlier unfollowed his sisters Misa Bharti and Hema Yadav. He now follows only five accounts, including his father Lalu Prasad Yadav, mother Rabri Devi, and sister Raj Lakshmi Yadav.Despite family tensions, Tej Pratap’s sister Rohini Acharya extended her support to him with a message on X: ""May you achieve all the success and happiness in the world, and may you always move forward like a shining light, brother. Wishing you all the very best... with love and blessings.""It makes an interesting twist in the Yadav family dynamics, as last month Rohini Acharya did something similar to his elder brother Tej Pratap when she unfollowed RJD, and Tejaswi Yadav from her social media accounts. The increasing rifts between family members playing out in public are often attributed to sudden importance given to Sanjay Yadav, a close friend to Tejaswi.On being asked about the grandmother and Acharya he said, ""I brought the photo of my grandmother Marchiya Devi in the nomination. With her blessing, I am going to win in Mahua. The Janshakti Janata Dal is going to win. Rohini Acharya called me, she extended her good wishes.""The Bihar Assembly elections will take place in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with counting scheduled for November 14.

As Bihar heads into a heated two-phase assembly election on November 6 and 11, the political scene saw a day of rapid developments on Thursday — from the Election Commission’s strong defence of its voter roll revision to the NDA completing its candidate lists, while the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) remains mired in seat-sharing talks. Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination amid family tensions, and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath took direct aim at the opposition over the burqa voter verification controversy.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) formally declared all its candidates for the 243-member Bihar Assembly, with both JD(U) and BJP announcing 101 seats each. Other allies, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) and the Hindustani Awami Morcha (HAM), have also completed their lists.JD(U)’s second list featured ministers Sheila Mandal, Vijendra Prasad Yadav, Leshi Singh, Jayant Raj and Zama Khan, along with turncoats Chetan Anand and Vibha Devi. “The JD(U) has now released all 101 candidates,” the party said.The BJP, meanwhile, unveiled its list of 40 star campaigners, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda. It also includes five chief ministers: Yogi Adityanath, Hemanta Biswa Sarma, Rekha Gupta, Mohan Yadav and Devendra Fadnavis — and a mix of senior leaders and Bhojpuri stars such as Pawan Singh, Manoj Tiwari and Ravi Kishan.The first phase of polling will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14.The Congress Party unveiled its first list of 48 candidates for the Bihar election with no finalisation of a Mahagathbanthan seat-sharing deal yet.Among the prominent names, state Congress chief Rajesh Ram is set to contest from the Kutumba seat, while the Leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), Shakeel Ahmad Khan, will represent the Kadwa constituency.The list includes a diverse group of candidates, ranging from Bagaha's Jayesh Mangal Singh to Patna Sahib's Shashant Shekhar.While the NDA went into campaign mode, the opposition Mahagathbandhan (MGB) is yet to finalise its seat-sharing formula. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav filed his nomination from Raghopur but refrained from announcing the alliance’s seat division.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said an agreement within the INDIA bloc would be announced “soon”. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Discussions are progressing in the right direction… the people believe in Tejashwi Yadav as their leader.”He accused the Nitish Kumar-led government of “failing to meet the people’s needs over the last 20 years” and cited a CAG report on Rs 73,000 crore in unutilised funds. “Bihar’s youth deserve better. Rats drinking liquor, stolen bridges and question paper leaks show the scale of corruption,” Kumar said.He confirmed he would not contest the election but would campaign across 243 constituencies, adding: “My beliefs have not changed. Only the platform has.”Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) chief Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination from Mahua with a roadshow, carrying a photo of his grandmother. “I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. People of Mahua will support whoever works for them,” he said.Tej Pratap, earlier expelled from the RJD, now leads his own party after a public rift with his brother Tejashwi. He recently unfollowed Tejashwi on X, adding to speculation of a full family break.Mahua, currently held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan, will now see a high-profile contest. Tej Pratap said he had worked to make Mahua a district and promised jobs for the youth.The Election Commission on Thursday defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Bihar’s electoral roll before the Supreme Court, calling it “accurate” and dismissing allegations of Muslim voter exclusion as “false and communal”.“This communal approach is to be deprecated,” the poll body said in its affidavit, responding to a petition by the Association of Democratic Reforms and activist Yogendra Yadav. The EC told the court that “no appeal has been filed by any voter” since the publication of the final roll and that errors had been minimal.It added that 3.66 lakh names were deleted due to duplication, migration or deaths, and that “not a single objection has been reported so far”. The final voter count now stands at 7.42 crore — down by 47 lakh from the earlier list.The bench, led by Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, posted the matter for further hearing on November 4.On the campaign trail in Danapur, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accused the RJD-Congress combine of “mischief” over the EC’s decision to verify the identity of burqa-clad women voters.“Should fake voters be allowed to vote? The Congress and RJD want this to happen,” he said, claiming the opposition opposed electronic voting “because they want to restore the old system of booth capture”.He linked Bihar’s politics to cultural heritage, saying, “After the construction of a grand temple of Lord Ram at Ayodhya, the birthplace of Goddess Sita in Sitamarhi is all set for a facelift.”Calling the RJD’s allies “partners of the mafia”, Yogi declared, “Under NDA rule, they will meet the same fate in Bihar.”",Bihar heads into heated two-phase assembly election on November 6 and 11.

Chandrababu Naidu’s Bold Vision: Bullet Train To Connect Hyderabad, Amaravati, Chennai And Bengaluru

NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways will next focus on building ‘dedicated passenger corridors’ to cater to the growing passenger demand while increasing the capacity of existing tracks and developing Vande Bharat 4.0 trains, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Wednesday.He said the dedicated passenger corridors will be designed for a speed of 350 kmph and an operational speed of 320 kmph and will be completely indigenous, providing huge opportunities to Indian players. The minister also warned suppliers and manufacturers against compromising on the quality of products and directed the Railway Board chairman to be ‘ruthless’ in blacklisting and blocking such companies from getting any work in the sector.Addressing industry players after he inaugurated the International Railway Equipment Exhibition, the minister said there are three major focus areas for railways: provide enough service for passengers and their comfort, ensure safety and make the national transporter ready for at least the next 25 years.On the target to have dedicated passenger corridors, Vaishnaw said, “We have to start constructing dedicated passenger corridors because we are 1.4 billion people; the transportation demand is humongous, and we have successful examples of economies of similar nature...Thesecorridors will be equipped with indigenously developed signalling systems and modern Operations Control Centres (OCCs).” He added that such corridors will be constructed across the country, and the target is to develop around 7,000 km of them in the next two decades.While highlighting the success of Vande Bharat trains, he urged the industry and railway engineers to reimagine the indigenous semi-high-speed train. The current Vande Bharat (3.0) is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 52 seconds. “The new version will focus on enhancing toilets, improving seats and elevating the overall workmanship of the coaches. Vande Bharat 4.0 (to be launched in the next 18 months) should be a train so advanced in quality and comfort that countries around the world aspire to adopt it,” the minister said.Vaishnaw urged manufacturers to focus on quality and safety, cautioning that “those who do not improve will lose out”. He directed the Railway Board chairman to carry out strict checks and blacklist those supplying poor quality materials.On the hydrogen-powered train, Vaishnaw said a 2,400-horsepower model has been developed entirely indigenously. “We will not import this technology. We will design it ourselves,” he said.",The Indian Railways will next focus on building ‘dedicated passenger corridors’ to cater to the growing passenger demand.

‘Modi loves Trump... he is a great leader’, says US president

WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed he was assured by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday that New Delhi was tapering its purchase of Russian oil to help stop the Russia-Ukraine war, but the external affairs ministry in Delhi denied knowledge of any such conversation.In Washington, in his customary freewheeling banter with pool reporters in the White House, Trump indicated that India’s pledge was conveyed through the new US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, who was present in the Oval Office to brief the president about his meeting with Modi and India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA) earlier this week in New Delhi.“He’s assured me, there will be no oil purchase from Russia. I don’t know. Maybe that’s a breaking story. Can I say that? Would you say there will be no oil?” Trump said, waving towards Gor, and adding, “He’s not buying his oil from Russia.”New Delhi responded with a carefully worded statement that “it has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario” and that it is broad-basing its energy sourcing. While there was no explicit denial by India of Trump’s claim, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal did say that he wasn’t aware of any conversation between Modi and Trump on Wednesday.India also didn’t confirm if there was any discussion on this issue when the leaders last spoke, on October 9.India also didn’t confirm if there was any discussion on this issue when the leaders last spoke, on October 9. The MEA statement didn’t directly refer to Trump’s remarks and the ministry said it was responding to media queries on comments on India’s energy sourcing. India’s response also underscored the fact that as far as the US is concerned, India has for years sought to expand its energy procurement. “This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current government has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” said the official.Trump also conceded that India’s oil purchases may not stop immediately. “It started... It’s a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,” he said, adding that he would also try and get China to stop buying Russian oil in an effort to stop the war. Once this oil revenue spigot for Moscow is turned off and war is over, Trump indicated India could go back to purchasing Russian oil.His hypothesis that Moscow would end the war if it does not get oil revenues from India and China is among the reasons holding up a trade deal between Washington and New Delhi. Both sides are said to be close to an agreement, with India indicating it is open to stepping up US energy purchases even as it draws down on buying Russian oil, although officials privately fumethe Trump’s performative public diplomacy tends to queer the pitch.Trump called Modi a “great man” and India “an incredible country”, and claimed that “he (Modi) loves Trump”. “Now, I don’t know if the word love… I don’t want you to take that any different... I don’t want to destroy his political career, but you have to understand… I’ve watched India for years... every single year you’d have a new leader. I mean, some would be in there for a few months, and this was year after year after year. And my friend has been there now for a long time, and he is, and he’s assured me, there will be no oil purchase from Russia,” the US president said.",US President Donald Trump claimed he was assured by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday that New Delhi was tapering its purchase of Russian oil.

Fantastic Opportunity For Both: British Chambers of Commerce Hails UK-India Trade Deal as 'Win-Win'

The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system to significantly boost its air defence architecture and strengthen its air capabilities.Thales will manufacture the missiles and launchers at Belfast, Northern Ireland, before delivering them to the Indian Army.The contract follows days after India-UK defence initiatives unveiled during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to India.In a joint statement, the Centre said the deal will further support India’s air defence capabilities and, in the spirit of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat', meet current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence while fostering long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.British defence secretary John Healey had said, ""The defence deals announced today show how our growing strategic partnership with India will boost UK business and jobs. I am hopeful this will pave the way for a deeper relationship between our two defence industries, particularly in the development of electric engines for naval ships and in air defence"" he added.The LMM is a lightweight, man-portable missile system that can be deployed in operational areas, including high-altitude regions, the Indian Army said.The missile operates on a laser beam riding guidance system, allowing precision strikes with minimal collateral damage. Equipped with a triple-effect warhead and proximity fuse, it is effective against aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, and UCAVs, including low-infrared signature targets, at ranges beyond 6 km in all-weather conditions.Weighing just 13 kg, the LMM is a supersonic weapon with speeds above Mach 1.5. Its advanced sighting system and high-explosive warhead give it a high single-shot kill probability. The system is optimised for air, land, and naval deployments, enabling rapid response against drones, light aircraft, and helicopters near borders or frontline positions, reported news agency ANI.","The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system.

Climate change becoming human rights imperative: Kovind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/climate-change-becoming-human-rights-imperative-kovind/articleshow/124613695.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Former President Ram Nath Kovind Thursday cautioned that climate change is “no longer only an environmental concern but is becoming a human rights imperative”. The consequences of the challenges posed by climate change, manifesting in the form of floods, droughts and heatwaves, are borne largely by those who are least equipped to bear them, he said at a programme to mark the 32nd foundation day of the National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ).During the event, which saw a day-long conference on human rights of prison inmates, Kovind also said the true test of a society’s values lies in how it treats those who are most vulnerable, including those who are in custody.NHRC chairperson Justice V Ramasubramanian said the commission has handled more than 23 lakh cases and about 2,900 cases of suo motu cognisance since its inception in 1993. NHRC has recommended monetary relief of more than Rs 263 crore in about more than 8,000 cases to victims of human rights violations.While noting that India has built a robust and comprehensive framework for the protection of human rights, Kovind asserted the need to recognise emerging and complex challenges. “We live in an age of unprecedented technological, environmental, and societal transformation. With the change in structure of employment in the modern economy, new forms of human rights concerns are emerging,” he said.He cited the example of workers in the informal sector, such as drivers, sanitation workers, construction labourers, and countless migrant workers and how too often, they endure unsafe working conditions, irregular incomes, and the absence of social protection. “Their human rights are frequently at risk,” he highlighted while emphasising that “economic progress must always walk hand in hand with human dignity”.","Former President Ram Nath Kovind cautioned that climate change is ‘no longer only an environmental concern but is becoming a human rights imperative’ The consequences of the challenges posed by climate change are borne largely by those who are least equipped to bear them, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124613682,imgsize-7612,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-10-17-002620.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Aggrieved by the preliminary inquiry into the June 12 AI 171 Ahmedabad crash which indirectly put the blame on the pilot, the father of the pilot in command of that flight and the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) have moved Supreme Court Their plea: The apex court order an independent investigation by a panel of aviation experts headed by a retired Supreme Court judge that takes into account all possible causes that could have led to the crash. Pushkaraj Sabharwal, 91, and FIP have contended that the preliminary investigation into the crash is ""profoundly flawed”. And they say the probe team is predominantly focusing on the pilots, who can no longer defend themselves.Pushkaraj Sabharwal had earlier written to aviation authorities also to express his anger at the preliminary report of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) had “tarnished” his son Captain Sumeet Sabharwal's reputation. First leaks in the US media and then the AAIB report released within a month of the probe had, some directly & others indirectly, blamed a pilot for switching off the engines’ fuel supply.Government, on its part, says the investigation is fair and unbiased.The plea in Supreme Court says: “The current approach of the investigation has resulted in a failure to adequately examine, or rule out, other more plausible technical and procedural factors… The petitioners emphasise that factual misdirection through selective disclosure, especially against crew who cannot defend themselves, impedes root cause discovery and threatens future flight safety-calling for a neutral judicial lens. ”Questioning the composition of the five-member probe panel, it says: “The team is dominated by officers from DGCA, the State aviation authorities whose procedures, oversight, and possible lapses are directly implicated in the investigation. Moreover, the officers are placed under the control of the DG, AAIB, thereby creating a situation where the very entities responsible for regulating and overseeing civil aviation are effectively investigating themselves. ”The pilots’ union have long questioned the AAIB preliminary report which, they sources there say, “has rushed to give a clean chit to Boeing and blaming a dead pilot who can no longer defend himself.”Pushkaraj Sabharwal’s plea says as much. The AAIB investigation team appeared to ""predominantly focus on the deceased pilots ... while failing to examine or eliminate other more plausible technical and procedural causes.” He and FIP, which has about 5,000 members, have sought the current probe be stopped and a new panel of aviation experts headed by a retired Supreme Court judge conduct the investigation.","Pushkaraj Sabharwal, 91, and FIP have contended that the preliminary investigation into the crash is ""profoundly flawed"" They say the probe team is predominantly focusing on the pilots, who can no longer defend themselves.

Who Cut the Fuel? Inside the Mystery of the Air India 171 Cockpit Audio

MUMBAI: The investigation into the fatal crash of Air India Flight AI171 by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is facing legal challenges. A second case, this time a writ petition, has been filed before the Supreme Court of India demanding an independent, judicially monitored inquiry into the loss of the Boeing 787-8 (VT-ANB) on June 12, 2025, in Ahmedabad, which claimed 260 lives.The petition was filed by Pushkaraj Sabharwal, father of the deceased pilot Capt Sumeet Sabharwal, and the Federation of Indian Pilots. It directly challenges the preliminary report issued by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which attributed the crash to ""pilot action."" The petitioners allege the AAIB report is technically flawed, incomplete, and biased.A month ago, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court by the NGO Safety Matters Foundation seeking full disclosure of flight data, cockpit voice transcripts, and technical records related to the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner accident. The PIL sought the appointment of independent professionals to monitor the investigation. It alleged that the preliminary report released by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau a month after the accident was ""selective''.The incomplete disclosure of critical information, coupled with the premature attribution of pilot error while overlooking systemic faults is a violation of the articles of the Indian Constitution and international law governing accident investigations.The writ filed by the Capt's father alleges technical flaws and system failure played a role in the accident. The petition focuses on several critical technical inconsistencies that suggest a catastrophic system failure occurred before any crew input, such as premature RAT Deployment, for instance.The Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed during take-off, an event which typically indicates a major electrical or digital power failure, predating any alleged pilot error. Another point was about a possible total systems collapse. The simultaneous failure of all power and data systems, including the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), points to a single-point electrical collapse, it said.As for the fuel control switches, the AAIB report's finding of both fuel control switches moving from RUN to CUTOFF within one second is called physically improbable under take-off conditions, it said. The petition suggests these points to an automatic or corrupted FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) command.The writ petition stated that the AAIB allegedly failed to investigate a known risk in the Boeing 787's Common Core System (CCS)—the unified software that links all avionics, flight controls, FADEC, and electrical power. This is a crucial line of inquiry for potential cascading or common-mode failures. The petition cites anomalies in forensic evidence, including thermal damage to the Enhanced Flight Recorder without soot deposits. This suggests battery-induced combustion, not an external fuel fire, as the cause of damage.Beyond the technical arguments, the petitioners assert that the AAIB's investigation violates international standards for independence. Conflict of interest was brought to focus, the petition argued the investigation breaches the legal doctrine of nemo judex in causa sua (""no one should be a judge in their own cause""). It highlights that DGCA officials and representatives of the manufacturers (Boeing and GE) are part of the probe, compromising its objectivity. This arrangement allegedly violates ICAO Annex 13 principles for an independent investigation.Addressing the media reports in certain foreign publications that appeared before the preliminary report was made public, the petition accused the AAIB of unlawfully leaking confidential cockpit voice data (CVR) in violation of the Aircraft Investigation Rules, 2017 (Rule 17(5)).The selective leaks, the petition said, had fueled a prejudiced media narrative against the deceased flight crew. The petition ultimately prays for the constitution of a Judicially Monitored Committee, to be headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge, with the inclusion of independent aviation and systems experts. This move aims to ensure a transparent, technically sound, and unbiased inquiry consistent with global safety standards.","A writ petition has been filed before the Supreme Court of India demanding an independent inquiry.

Bihar Polls: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Accuses RJD, Congress of ‘Mischief’ Over Burqa Verification Order

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday launched attacks on the opposition, alleging that they focus solely on ""family-based politics"" while the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is committed to development.Speaking at an election rally in Saharsa, Adityanath targeted the Janata Dal ( RJD ) and Congress. He said, ""PM Modi says the country is his family, but Lalu ji (RJD President) says Rabri Devi's family is his only family. RJD cannot think beyond this. However, the NDA works for the country, and Bihar's double-engine government is working towards the state's development.""He added, ""NDA is taking forward 'virasat' and 'vikas' in Bihar...Today, when development is being recognised, Congress and RJD have started a campaign that they don't want development, they want burqa, so that they can rob the rights of the poor by getting fake votes cast,” as quoted by ANI.Adityanath further criticised Congress, accusing it of allowing ""illegal infiltration and fostering unrest."" He said, ""During Congress's tenure, they used to question the existence of Lord Ram and Lord Krishna.They used to let infiltrators enter the country, which led to anarchy. RJD only worked on the development of their family, not Bihar.""Speaking about the Ram temple in Ayodhya, he said, ""Congress and RJD members always questioned us whether the Ram Temple would be built, and we always said it would definitely be built...The Ram Lalla temple has been built in Ayodhya, and a grand temple of Mother Janaki is also being built in Bihar.""Earlier in the day, CM Yogi addressed a rally in Danapur in support of BJP candidate Ram Kripal Yadav. He criticised the RJD-Congress alliance for fostering ""jungle raj and dynastic politics"" in Bihar between 1990 and 2005.He said, ""Who does not know about Bihar's jungle raj and dynastic politics from 1990 to 2005. You must have seen who those people were who turned Bihar's spiritual land of knowledge into a land of dynastic politics and crime, creating an identity crisis for our youth.""He added, ""How anarchy was spread here in the name of development is not hidden from anyone. Amid the identity crisis faced by the youth in Bihar, people who wanted to do something for the State migrated.""Polling in Bihar will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11, for all 243 Assembly seats. The counting of votes is scheduled for November 14.

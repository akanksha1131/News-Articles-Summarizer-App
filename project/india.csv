"Environment-related offences increased by 30%, tobacco-linked crimes dominate the green violation figures in 2023",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/environment-related-offences-increased-by-30-tobacco-linked-crimes-dominate-the-green-violation-figures-in-2023/articleshow/124246945.cms,"Air pollution (Pic credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: India reported 68,994 environment-related crimes in 2023 which is over 30% higher than the total number of such crimes (52,920) reported in 2022, shows the latest Crime in India report released by the home ministry's National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) this week.Nearly 86% (59,279) of environment-related crimes, however, pertain to only one offence -- the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 that prohibits advertisement and regulates trade, commerce, production, supply and distribution of such products.The report shows that the highest number of overall environment-related crime was reported in Tamil Nadu (41,304) followed by Kerala (8,786), Rajasthan (7,794), Maharashtra (4,854) and Uttar Pradesh (1,804).Offences under Noise Pollution Act, and Forest Act and Forest Conservation Act figure at second and third position with reporting 6,640 and 2,076 crimes, respectively. The other offences were reported under the Wildlife Protection Act (526), the Environmental Protection Act (389), and Air and Water Pollution control law (68) among others. Sixteen cases were reported under the National Green Tribunal Act 2010, of which all these cases were filed in Meghalaya.Though chargesheets were filed in nearly 98% of the environment-related cases which eventually reported higher rate of conviction compared to other cases filed under IPC and special and local laws (SLL), an overwhelming majority relate to only tobacco-linked offences and crimes under the Noise Pollution Act. Other than crimes under these two Acts, the conviction rate in the remaining environment-related offences was quite low.The UT of Delhi, which faces air pollution crisis every year during winter due to multiple violations of different nature, did not file a single case under the Air Pollution Control Act in 2023. Though its neighbour Haryana reported three cases under the law, Punjab that witnesses violation on stubble burning issues too did not file a single case under the Act.Offence-wise data shows that Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number (1,282) of cases under forest-related crimes followed by Rajasthan (232), Himachal Pradesh (141), Jharkhand (139) and Karnataka (98) in 2023.Under the Wildlife Protection Act, Rajasthan reported the highest number of cases (181) followed by Uttar Pradesh (116), West Bengal (41), Maharashtra (27) and Bihar (25).","India reported 68,994 environment-related crimes in 2023 which is over 30% higher than the total number of such crimes (52,920) reported in 2022.

This may seem very hard to believe, but now is probably the safest time to be alive. Murder rates in India are at their lowest since we started tracking such data, according to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).And it’s the same story for most countries globally. NCRB started releasing data for murder and culpable homicide in 1957. In that year, India’s murder rate per lakh was 2.57. By 2023, the latest year for which NCRB has released its data, this had dropped to 2.25.The murder rate rose steadily since 1957, and peaked in the 1990s, after which it has kept dropping. It fell below 4 in 2001, and dropped to under 3 in 2013.Among large states that registered more than 1,000 cases of murder and culpable homicide, the rate is the highest in Jharkhand – at 3.8 per lakh population. Jharkhand is followed by Haryana, Chattisgarh, Assam, Odisha and Telangana – each reporting a rate of 3 or higher. Globally, Japan is the safest country and South Africa the most dangerous, according to World Bank data. Japan, in 2020 – the last year for which comparable data across countries is available – saw only 0.3 murders per lakh population.","The murder rate rose steadily since 1957, and peaked in the 1990s, after which it has kept dropping.

We didn’t accept it either. But see how the situation changed in Leh. Leh celebrated at the time. Now they are saying they realised that Article 370 protected them for 70 years.”Omar Abdullah’s remarks came against the backdrop of Ladakh unrest, where security forces fired on demonstrators on Sept 24, killing four and wounding more than 80.He also pushed back against suggestions that Kashmiris could shift to BJP if governance falters.Turning to his govt formation last year, Omar revealed he resisted pressure to include BJP in office.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah ruled out taking to the streets for restoration of statehood. “We will get our rights while abiding by law and the Constitution, but I won’t allow people to be pushed into the flames and destroyed,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124245181,imgsize-842852,width-400,resizemode-4/omar-abdullah-4.jpg"

Understanding organizational restructuring, severance implications, and the economic drivers behind workforce decisions can help professionals navigate transitions more strategically. Resilience in uncertainty: Even in high-performing firms reporting revenue growth, such as Accenture, which posted a 7% year-on-year increase to $17.6 billion in the June-August quarter of fiscal 2025, job security is not guaranteed, making emotional resilience and strategic foresight critical for sustaining a long-term career.

Looking ahead

Global consulting giant Accenture has laid off thousands of employees across its offices worldwide in the past three months. The company cited slowing corporate demand and the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) as primary drivers of the workforce reduction. While the restructuring, valued at $865 million, aims to align the company with evolving client needs, it also signals a broader shift in the skills white-collar professionals will need to remain relevant.Accenture Chief Executive Officer Julie Sweet addressed analysts, explaining that the company is “exiting people on a compressed timeline where reskilling is not a viable path for the skills we need.” The statement underscores a growing reality in corporate environments: not all employees can be retrained fast enough to meet the demands of rapidly changing technology. Sweet emphasized that the company will prioritize workforce alignment with client demand for AI-driven solutions, a move that may result in further exits in the months ahead.At the end of August 2025, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. The layoffs , part of a continuing process expected to run until November 2025, reflect both operational restructuring and the financial imperative of managing severance costs.The company projects that the initiative will save over $1 billion, even as it seeks to retain core talent capable of delivering on AI-focused projects.Alongside workforce reductions, Accenture is investing in upskilling programs focused on agentic AI, a new class of tools designed to automate complex decision-making and operational tasks. Sweet noted that these programs are essential for meeting client expectations as businesses globally seek to reinvent operations with AI. For white-collar professionals, the implication is clear: developing proficiency in emerging AI technologies is no longer optional but increasingly central to career sustainability.While the Accenture layoffs are significant, they offer critical lessons for professionals navigating a transforming work environment:Accenture’s approach demonstrates a broader trend: the integration of AI into corporate strategy is reshaping not only business models but also the expectations placed on white-collar professionals. Those who embrace continuous learning, anticipate technological shifts, and develop highly relevant skills will find themselves better positioned in a rapidly evolving job market.The Accenture example highlights that career growth today depends on adaptability, specialised skills, and strategic planning.

Inside details of how PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi ran away with the Asia Cup trophy!

Poll Should politics be kept separate from sports like cricket? Yes, absolutely No, they are interconnected

Former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev called for keeping politics separate from cricket following India's refusal to accept the Asia Cup trophy and medals from Pakistan 's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi after their five-wicket victory over Pakistan in the final at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on September 28, 2025.The presentation ceremony was delayed and shortened after the Indian team declined to receive the awards from Naqvi, who heads both the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Asian Cricket Council. The Indian team instead celebrated their victory on the field without the official awards.The match itself saw Pakistan make a strong start with an 84-run opening partnership between Fakhar Zaman and Sahibzada Farhan. However, they suffered a dramatic collapse, losing nine wickets for just 33 runs to finish at 146 in 19.1 overs. India successfully chased down the target despite losing three early wickets.""I just want to say — your responsibility, and responsibility for the entire media also we should look into the sports side rather than looking into the politics side. Yes, media has the responsibility to bring everything on the table, but as a sportsman, I would like to see that we should stick to sports. It will be much better,"" Kapil Dev said in an interview with India Today.The controversy extended beyond the trophy presentation. Pakistan's Haris Rauf received a fine of 30 percent of his match fee for making a provocative 'plane crash' gesture during the Super Four match. Additionally, Sahibzada Farhan received a warning for his 'gunshot' celebration after scoring fifty runs, which he defended as a cultural expression.Kapil Dev, who led India to their first World Cup victory in 1983, also commented on the current state of Pakistani cricket talent compared to previous generations.""Yeah, I think they don't have the similar talent they used to have in the '80s, '90s or before that. Pakistan has given us, to the world, one of the best cricketers. You can talk about Imran Khan, you can talk about Javed Miandad, Zaheer Abbas, Wasim Akram , Waqar Younis. They have given us that talent. But unfortunately, we can't see similar talent today — not even one percent of what they used to have,"" Kapil Dev added.The Asia Cup final victory marked a significant achievement for India, despite the controversy surrounding the presentation ceremony. The team's performance demonstrated their ability to handle pressure situations, successfully chasing down the target with two balls remaining in their innings.The incident has highlighted the ongoing challenges in keeping sports separate from political tensions between the two nations. Despite these challenges, the focus remains on the cricket played on the field and the sporting achievements of both teams.The match will be remembered not only for India's victory but also for the broader context of cricket diplomacy and its role in India-Pakistan relations. The events surrounding the trophy presentation have added another chapter to the complex history of cricket encounters between these two cricket-playing nations.",Former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev calls for keeping politics separate from cricket.

I-T drive to target tax evasion on capital gains in joint deals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-t-drive-to-target-tax-evasion-in-joint-deals/articleshow/124244497.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: The income tax department is set to launch a drive to nudge people who entered into joint development agreements, but didn’t pay capital gains, to deposit the requisite tax. In Kolkata and Bengaluru alone, there are 25,000 to 30,000 such entities have been identified, said sources.Joint development agreements — a deal between real estate developers and landowners — are used across the country with Delhi and other cities also on the radar. The transfer under the agreements, which could cover a small piece of land where three or four floors are built or a larger tract with multiple houses or plots, require landowners to pay capital gains tax.The campaign is expected to be launched over the next few days with emails and correspondence addressed to identified taxpayers, asking them to come clean on their own. Govt sources said that the tax department believes that majority of individuals may have missed paying taxes and are likely to come forward and clear dues. Only in cases where landowners do not come forward will tax authorities contemplate the next set of measures.Taxpayers, whose transactions pertain to the last financial year, can update their latest income tax return and pay the requisite tax. For cases related to previous years, an additional 25% may be required to be paid but compliance will ensure there is no penalty.In recent years, the tax department has adopted ‘Nudge’, or Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable Taxpayers, to push taxpayers to pay their dues without penalty and the response has been quite encouraging. For instance, a campaign on foreign assets and income for FY 2023-24 which nudged 19,500 individuals saw 12,700 revised returns, with close to 900 changing their residency from residents to non-residents. More than 30,000 reported overseas assets and income during the period with disclosures of Rs 29,000 crore assets and over Rs 1,000 crore additional taxes. Similar focused campaigns have been run for virtual digital assets and HRA exemptions, getting people to comply without taking punitive action.","In Kolkata and Bengaluru alone, there are 25,000 to 30,000 such entities.

26/11 attack: Chidambaram says foreign pressure blocked retaliation; BJP hits out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-fallout-chidambaram-says-foreign-pressure-blocked-retaliation-bjp-hits-out/articleshow/124244271.cms,"BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday launched a major onslaught on Congress over former Union minister P Chidambaram ’s statement that foreign pressure restrained the Manmohan Singh govt from retaliating against Pakistan after the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, saying the country has “paid a heavy price” for sins committed by Congress.BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad said Chidambaram’s comments have raised a big question as to “how weak the govt headed by Singh was”. “P Chidamabram, home minister in the Manmohan Singh govt, has now admitted that after the 26/11 attacks, he favoured retaliatory action against Pakistan, but the external affairs department... did not agree, and Singh remained silent,” he said, seeking answers from Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as to what compulsions prevented them from acting on the home minister’s suggestions. “It took around 16–17 years for Chidambaram to acknowledge that they failed to give a decisive response to Pakistan for the 26/11 attacks. Why was this wisdom kept hidden for so long? It took years to arrive at this realisation; it’s shameful. The foreign ministry and other ministries overruled the matter, and Singh just watched as the country suffered. Hundreds were killed; the attacks were clearly linked to Pakistan-based terrorists.”Contrasting Congress’s response with the surgical strikes, air strikes and Operation Sindoor conducted by India under PM Modi, Prasad asked, “Who was running the country then? Where was Sonia Gandhi?”In a TV interview, Chidambaram said India had considered military retaliation after the 26/11 attacks but chose not to do so, apparently under pressure from other countries. “The whole world was descending upon Delhi to tell us don’t start a war... For example, Condoleezza Rice, who was then (US) secretary of state, flew in two or three days after I took over to meet me and the PM and to say, please don't react. I said this is a decision which the govt will take. ”“Without disclosing any official secret, it did cross my mind that we should do some act of retribution.” he added.

Avg GDP growth rate of 12% must to tackle unemployment in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/avg-gdp-growth-rate-of-12-must-to-tackle-unemployment-in-india/articleshow/124244547.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Average GDP growth rate of 12.2% is needed to start addressing India’s underemployment challenge and a bigger push is needed for a pro-growth, pro-jobs policy agenda to tackle the country’s high youth unemployment problem, a report by investment banking and financial services firm Morgan Stanley has said.“In our base case, India’s GDP will grow at an average of 6.5% over the coming decade, one of the fastest-growing economies globally. But this pace will not be enough to generate enough jobs,” said the report, asserting growth momentum needs to be stronger.The report said to achieve higher growth, India needs stronger growth in its industrial and exports sectors. “Studies have shown that every job created by manufacturing exports creates two other jobs in related sectors like transportation and logistics,” it said.“In this sense, India has significant scope to increase its market share in exports because it is still just at 1.8%, well below its weight in terms of working age population and GDP,” it added.The report said policymakers are already making efforts but the magnitude of the jobs problem means there is a need to accelerate pace and do more.“A comprehensive reform package will be needed, including accelerated build-out of public infrastructure, especially for last-mile connectivity, plus a systematic approach that incentivises state govts to improve the business environment and ensure the labour force is adequately skilled,” the report further said.It said over the medium term, one pressing issue is that AI will reduce job growth prospects, particularly for IT services sector — which has been a key source of employment creation — and for the domestic services sector as well.It said Asia’s youth unemployment is high and underlying situation is worsening. Slowing growth adds to the cyclical challenge; AI and automation are structural headwinds. Policymakers must either make reforms to shift growth models or redistributive efforts to manage potential social stability risks.","Average GDP growth rate of 12.2% is needed to start addressing India’s underemployment challenge.

Was in Mumbai During 26/11, Worked with ISI and Lashkar e Taiba: Tahawwur Rana's Shocking Confession

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party launched a sharp attack on former Union home minister P Chidambaram over his recent remarks on the UPA government's decision not to retaliate militarily against Pakistan following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, accusing the Congress of “mishandling” the situation under foreign pressure.Reacting to Chidambaram’s statements made during an interview, union minister Pralhad Joshi posted on X, “After 17 years, Chidambaram, former home minister, admits what the nation knew - 26/11 was mishandled due to pressure from foreign powers. Too little, too late.”In the interview, Chidambaram said that the idea of retaliation “did cross [his] mind”, but the government eventually decided against military action. He said this decision was influenced largely by the ministry of external affairs and senior diplomats.“The whole world descended upon Delhi to tell us 'don't start a war'. Condoleezza Rice, who was then US secretary of state, flew in two or three days after I took over… to say, 'please don't react',” he said.Also read: PM Modi's 'Operation Sindoor' post: Congress takes '3rd umpire' jibe, says battlefield comparison not app

Chidambaram, who took over as home minister just days after the attack, also acknowledged that he discussed possible retributive steps with the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other key figures.“The Prime Minister had discussed this even when the attack was going on... And the conclusion was, largely influenced by the ministry of external affairs and the IFS, that we should not physically react to the situation,” he recalled.The remarks have sparked a political row, with BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla questioning whether then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi had overruled Chidambaram’s personal view in favour of retaliation.Posting on X, he wrote, “Why was UPA taking orders from [Condoleezza Rice]? Why did Sonia Gandhi prevail over the Home Minister?” he asked.Poonawalla further accused the Congress of giving Pakistan a “clean chit” not only on the 26/11 attacks but also in the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombing case. He alleged that the UPA government advanced a “Hindu terror” narrative and granted Pakistan ‘most favoured nation’ (MFN) status despite repeated cross-border terror incidents.He added, “Congress gave clean chit to Pak on 26/11 and Samjhauta & induced Hindu Terror angles. Today too they doubt Surgical Strike, Balakote and Operation Sindoor.”On November 26, 2008, ten heavily armed Pakistani terrorists carried out coordinated attacks across Mumbai, killing over 166 people and injuring hundreds. One attacker, Ajmal Kasab, was captured alive and later executed in 2012.","Former Union home minister P Chidambaram said the idea of retaliation “did cross [his] mind”, but the government eventually decided against military action.

Gadget tips for monsoon: What to do and what to avoid this rainy season

NEW DELHI: The four-month summer (southwest) monsoon season ended on Tuesday with India reporting 8% more than normal rainfall. East & northeast India, however, reported a huge deficit of more than 20% and witnessed the second lowest rainfall year in the rainy season since 1901. The country as a whole, on the other hand, saw fifth highest rainfall this year since 2001 and 38th highest since 1901.“Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya saw deficient rainfall in three of the four monsoon months. The lowest rainfall in the monsoon season in the region was recorded in 2013,” IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said.He said, “Rainfall over east & northeast India has been deficient in many years in recent times. There is a trend that shows that the rainfall over this region is decreasing since 2020. Studies also show that rainfall over the region has decreased in the last 20 years.”Though the ‘above normal’ monsoon season was marked by many disasters, including cloudburst, landslides, floods and mudslides, specifically in northwest India (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir), the good rains helped farmers in increasing their acreage of Kharif (summer sown) crops not just more than last year but also more than the normal sown area of the season.The agriculture ministry's latest data, released on Monday, shows that the country reported an overall acreage of 1,120 lakh hectares this Kharif season, which is 24 lakh hectares more than normal acreage and seven lakh hectares more than the acreage in 2024. It raises a hope of record foodgrains during the 2025-26 crop year, even as few lakh hectares of farm land got submerged in floods in Punjab and other states.The monsoon season technically ended on Tuesday, but certain parts of the country will continue to report rainfall for a couple of more weeks till the complete withdrawal of the monsoon mid-Oct. The delay in complete withdrawal of the monsoon may delay the onset of northeast (winter) monsoon in Peninsular India.Mohapatra said most parts of the country are expected to receive above-normal rainfall during the post-summer monsoon season (October to December), except for some areas in northwest India, where rainfall is likely to be normal to below-normal.In October alone, the country is expected to receive 15% more than normal rainfall.The met department’s forecast suggests that the winter monsoon (October to December) rainfall over south Peninsular India, comprising five meteorological subdivisions of Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Kerala and South Interior Karnataka, is most likely to be above normal (more than 112% of the long period average).Asked about the possibility of early winter arrival due to developing La Nina conditions, Mohapatra said it would be premature to predict early winter onset at this juncture as the status of colder weather depends on multiple dynamic meteorological factors.La Nina (means Little Girl in Spanish) is a climate pattern associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. La Nina is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent. In the La Nina year, the winter in India is invariably colder than normal.The IMD chief said maximum (day) temperatures in October are likely to be above normal in most parts of east-northeast and northwest India whereas “normal to below-normal” maximum temperatures are expected in other regions of the country during the month.","The four-month summer (southwest) monsoon season ended on Tuesday with India reporting 8% more than normal rainfall.

In 2023, extremists seized 706 arms and 19,946 rounds of ammunition from police and central armed police forces. This is dramatically higher than 2022, when only 36 arms and 99 rounds were reported stolen.","Incidents of extremist, insurgent and terrorist violence have recorded a sharp fall from 446 in 2022 to 163 in 2023.

There are wide regional variations when it comes to suicides. While Kerala tops the list at 30.6 per lakh population, Bihar has the lowest suicide rate in the country at 0.7.But one factor stands out sharply: income. A vast majority of victims came from households earning less than Rs 1 lakh a year, showing how poverty and financial insecurity push people to the edge. The less educated are also more vulnerable. More than four in five victims had not studied beyond higher secondary school.Men in their 30s and early 40s were the most affected, while among women the highest toll fell on those aged 18 to 30. Strikingly, among children under 18, more girls died by suicide than boys, as opposed to the trend visible in every other age group.","Kerala tops the list at 30.6 per lakh population, Bihar has the lowest suicide rate in the country at 0.7.

States high on crime, low on murders

Going by the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Delhi is the country’s crime capital. Per lakh population, 1508.9 cases of IPC were recorded in 2023. Kerala is second on this list with 721.7 IPC cases per lakh population. Among major states and UTs, Jharkhand had the fewest reported cases at 126.6 per lakh population.That would make Delhi almost 12 times more unsafe than Jharkhand, and Kerala about six times so. But — and this is where the story takes an unexpected twist — the chances of getting murdered in Jharkhand is almost one and a half times more than in Delhi, and nearly three times higher than in Kerala.So, are we to believe that Jharkhand has a fantastic record in controlling all other crimes except the most heinous one — murder? On the contrary, this is likely a case of gross under-reporting. Delhi and Kerala have much better policing, and a much more rigorous reporting of crime.Delhi is ranked first in overall crime, but is eighth when it comes to murders. Kerala is ranked second in overall crime and 22nd in murder. Jharkhand, on the other hand, is ranked 22nd in overall crime and ranks first in murder. Similarly, Punjab and Assam are ranked 19th and 20th in overall crime and 7th and 4th in murder.Haryana, Telangana, Odisha and Tamil Nadu have the minimum gap in their overall crime rate and the rate of murder and culpable homicide, probably indicating a better capture of both data sets.","Delhi is ranked first in overall crime, but is eighth when it comes to murders.

Accidental deaths

NEW DELHI: A staggering 1,217 lives were lost daily in accidents in 2023, an increase of around 3% over the previous year, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report.While fatalities due to forces of nature, such as lightning, avalanche, flood and landslide, saw a decline of nearly 20%, the overall increase in deaths — more than 4.4 lakh in 2023 — was on account of other reasons, like road and rail accidents , electrocution, poisoning, sudden deaths, stampede, falls and deaths by animals.Traffic accidents — road and rail — had the maximum share of around 45% of all such deaths, followed by sudden deaths (14.3%) and drowning (8.5%) in 2023, data showed.While road crashes claimed around 1.74 lakh lives — a little more than the road transport ministry’s report of 1.73 lakh for the same period — deaths on railway track and crossings claimed 24,000 lives. Speeding was reason for nearly 59% of all road fatalities.The report mentioned that Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh reported maximum fatalities in accidents at railway crossings, accounting for 1,007 deaths, which is 45% of the total 2,242 fatalities in this category.In the case rail accidents — a different category under the NCRB — 15,878 (73%) of 21,803 deaths were due to “fall from trains or collision with people at track”. Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh reported the maximum number of fatalities in rail accidents — 3,445 and 3,149 respectively.In 2023, among all rail accidents, there were 56 cases due to fault of driver while another 43 mishaps took place due to mechanical defects, such as poor design, track faults, bridge or tunnel collapse.The report stated that there was a 12.3% increase in sudden deaths, which includes heart attacks, in 2023 over the previous year. In total, 63,609 people died due to sudden deaths. Data showed that heart attacks claimed 35,637 lives in 2023 compared to 32,410 in 2022. There was also a 45% spike in the number of people killed in stampedes — which claimed 32 lives — in 2023.The National Crime Records Bureau data collated from states and UTs showed that 1,742 people were killed by animals in 2023, which was 15.4% more than that of 2022.","A staggering 1,217 lives were lost daily in accidents in 2023, an increase of around 3% over the previous year.

Revision Done,Stage Set ForState Poll Dates

3.7L electors, declared ‘ineligible’, deleted from EC’s Bihar draft roll

PATNA: Bihar will have a total electorate of 7.4 crore when state assembly elections are held, according to the final electoral roll published on Tuesday by the Election Commission of India . Overall, the voter count has dropped by 6%.The final number of voters arrived at after completion of the special intensive revision (SIR) has fallen by about 47 lakh from the 7.9 crore it was on June 24, before the exercise. But it has 17.9 lakh more voters compared to the draft roll, which had 7.2 crore on Aug 1 after 65 lakh names were deleted, show details issued by EC.The release of the rolls kicked off the drill for announcement of poll dates. EC had indicated CEC Gyanesh Kumar and his two colleagues would visit Bihar before announcement of dates, around Oct 5-6.The names of another 3.7 lakh electors, declared “ineligible”, were deleted from the draft list, while 21.5 lakh new ones were added, taking the final figure to 7.4 crore. There may be a small change in the final number as supplementary lists are published during the poll process.While the number of names removed is far less than what was being anticipated, a break-up of caste- and community-wise deletions will determine the response of parties to the SIR process carried out by the EC.The exercise dominated the buildup to the polls, relegating regular issues to the periphery. On Tuesday, the responses of opponents of SIR were muted in comparison to the earlier high-wattage protests against the exercise.However, that might change. EC said those eligible and wanting their names included in theroll could still do so up to 10 days before the last date for filing nominations for the assembly polls. Those not satisfied can file a first appeal with the district magistrate under Section 24 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, and a second appeal before the chief electoral officer, it said.The opposition had objected strongly to the SIR after the names of 65 lakh voters were initially dropped from the electoral roll on various grounds. The first major protest had been Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s statewide ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Sasaram, a Dalit bastion, on Aug 17, as the entire opposition rallied behind him. He was supported by RJD neta Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, CPI-ML general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani, among others.","Bihar will have a total electorate of 7.4 crore when state assembly elections are held, according to the final electoral roll published on Tuesday.

"How can we see him getting burned? This MP village recites ‘Ravan Chalisa’ on Dussehra, youth sport Jai Lankesh tattoos",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-mp-village-bears-ravans-name-chants-his-chalisa/articleshow/124244213.cms,"VIDHISHA: Every day, in a village 80km from Bhopal, the lines ‘Jai Lankesh gyan gun sagar, Asur raj sab lok ujagar’ reverberate across homes and fields. Unlike rest of the country, people here recite ‘ Ravan Chalisa’, perform aartis of Ravan as god, not demon.On Thursday, when effigies of Ravan will be burnt to celebrate Dussehra , this village, called Rawan, will host a grand feast and puja of Ravan, whom its people consider ‘gram devta’.While elders recite ‘Ravan Chalisa’, composed by locals and displayed on a temple wall which has a 12-foot reclining statue of Ravan, the young move around on tractors and motorcycles with ‘Jai Lankesh’ stickers on the vehicles and tattoos on their arms.The village is home to 372 families, mostly Kanyakubj Brahmins.Located in Nateran tehsil of MP’s Vidisha, the statue is believed to be 500 years old. Lore has it that a demon called Budeka lived on a nearby hill and was instructed by Ravan to build his statue. The temple’s intricate carvings are seen as a reflection of Ravan’s wisdom and divinity.“In any social or religious event, Ravan Baba is worshipped first. Every day, puja is performed at the temple, attended by elders and young ones.This tradition has been followed for centuries,” said 78-year-old Laxmi Narayan Tiwari, a local and a senior advocate.Residents and village youth have formed Lankeshwar Welfare Society to carry out development and beautification work at the temple.The rituals surrounding Ravan here are unique.Temple priest Arvind Tiwari cited long-held beliefs that inviting “Ravan Baba” to any occasion brought good fortune -- this is done by placing a cotton ball dipped in oil on the idol’s navel.Villagers said they had no idea when the village was called ‘Rawan’ but made it clear that they never wanted it changed as the name signified pride.Devotion to Ravan goes far beyond rituals. A village youth, Ankit Dhakad, has tattooed a picture of Ravan and his name on his hand. “All my friends have tattoos of Lankesh on their bodies. We feel pride in this because Ravan is our god,” he said.In the pond, there is a stone sword and nearly 7ft of the blade is visible when the water recedes in summer. Villagers claim it is “Chandrahas” -- believed to be Ravan’s sword. For generations, people have tried to dig deeper to discover its full length, but no one has succeeded. The sword remains submerged, worshipped as a symbol of Ravan’s power.As the village sees Ravan as a scholar and protector, it opposes the practice of burning his effigy.“I attend Durga Utsav but do not watch the burning of Ravan’s effigy. It brings a lot of pain to me. He is our god whom we have been worshipping for generations; how can we see him getting burned?” said Manish Tiwari (51), a farmer.","Villagers in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, worship Ravan as a god, not a demon.

Prepare to deal with biothreats , says CDS



NEW DELHI: With the Army , Navy and Air Force yet to resolve their differences over the creation of integrated theatre commands, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the armed forces must break their old institutional silos and move together towards “jointness” to deal with adversaries and challenges across all domains, including cyber & information warfare.The evolving character of warfare, combined with the complex interplay of traditional and non-traditional threats, makes jointness “a core operational necessity” and a fundamental requirement for national security rather than a matter of choice, Singh said.“While each of our Services possesses the capacity to respond independently, the interconnected nature of land, sea, air, space & cyberspace makes collaborative strength the true guarantor of victory,” he said, speaking at a seminar organised by IAF.“Our govt’s objective is to further promote jointness & integration among the three Services. This is not only a matter of policy but a matter of survival in the fast-changing security environment.”India must step-up preparedness to deal with biothreats as well as radiological contamination from nuclear weapons in the future, even though the possibility of the latter is low, CDS General Anil Chauhan said on Tuesday.Noting that the world has been through a period of intense trials and tribulations during Covid-19 pandemic, the CDS said biothreats — man-made, accidental or natural — are likely to increase in future. “While possibility of use of nuclear weapons in our context is low, it is prudent to take this into our security calculus,” he said.","India must step-up preparedness to deal with biothreats as well as radiological contamination from nuclear weapons in the future, says CDS General Anil Chauhan. “Our govt’s objective is to further promote jointness & integration among the three Services,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124244172,imgsize-1158104,width-400,resizemode-4/rajnath-singh.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday searched six premises in connection with a case of money laundering against Anil Ambani and R-ADAG entities.Sources said the searches were a part of the investigation into overseas remittances by Reliance Infrastructure, allegedly in violation of certain regulations of Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema).In a statement, Reliance Infrastructure said Tuesday’s searches were related to matters dating back to 2010, when the company had awarded an EPC contract for construction of JR toll road (Jaipur-Ringas highway) to Prakash Asphaltings & Toll Highways.“This was a domestic contract with no foreign exchange involved. The work was completed, and the company has no continuing connection or relationship with the said contractor. The toll road has been with NHAI for the last four years,” it said, adding that the company and its executives are fully cooperating with ED in its probe.On Aug 5, Ambani was questioned at ED headquarters in connection with another money laundering probe against him and his entities, and his Cuffe Parade residence was searched by CBI on Aug 23 as a follow-up of an FIR registered by the anti-corruption agency for alleged “misappropriation of funds” received from SBI During his visit to ED headquarters, Ambani was asked about his foreign assets and other transactions, both in India and overseas. Some of his other close associates have also been questioned over the past two months in the same case.ED is probing alleged laundering of public money exceeding Rs 20,000 crore, some of which was allegedly siphoned outside the country through “undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets” created over the years.","ED searches six premises in connection with a case of money laundering against Anil Ambani and R-ADAG entities.

NEW DELHI: No flying training organisation (FTO) in India has been placed in the top A+ or A category in the first ever ranking done of flying schools here by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.This ranking — a brainchild of DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai — was to start from Oct 1 and the regulator made the list public on Tuesday. Based on multiple parametres like safety record and time taken to complete required flying to earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL), these two categories require a score of 70% and above.Thirteen FTOs have found a place in the B category — with scores between 50% and 70%. These include Chimes Aviation Academy, SVKM's NMIMS Academy of Aviation Shirpur, Bihar Flying Club, Orient Flights Aviation Academy, Skynex Aero, FSTC Flying School, Patiala Aviation Club, Haryana Institute of Civil Aviation, Jet Serve Aviation, Nagpur Flying Club, National Flying Training Institute, Banasthali Vidyapith Gliding & Flying Club and Rajiv Gandhi Academy for Aviation Technology.Twenty-two FTOs have been placed in the C category, which is for those with score below 50%. DGCA sends them “a notice for self-analysis towards improvement of their performance.” Govt-owned Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) which comes under the Union aviation ministry also falls in this category.This is the first time FTOs have been ranked in India. “The idea is to improve FTOs in terms of both safety record and making them student-friendly.There will be lot of churn and improvement among the schools to either improve or retain their ranking — and become attractive enough for students. We hope to see some FTOs in A category next time,” said sources.FTO ranking will be published bi-annually, “preferably on October 1and April 1 of every year.” FTOs scoring 85% and above will be ranked A++; 70-84.99% as A+; 50%-69.99% A and below 50% as B. “Category ‘B’ FTOs will receive a notice from DGCA for self-analysis towards improvement of their performance.”FTOs are being ranked on several key parameters like safety record and time taken to complete 200 hours of flying — which is among the things required to earn commercial pilot licence (CPL). This will help budding pilots help choose “good” schools. Currently even after paying several lakhs, they have to virtually “beg” to get their flying hours at a majority of the schools.Through ranking, Govt wanted FTOs to improve on all counts, with safety being key along with timely completion of flying, in order to get better rankings and therefore attract students. While being a regulated sector, a majority of FTOs in India are anything but student-friendly and that forces large number of budding pilots to go abroad every year to earn their CPLs.“This is part of DGCA’s continued commitment to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of pilot training in India, while fostering a performance-driven and transparent training ecosystem. (Ranking) holds FTOs accountable for maintaining regulatory compliance and operational standards. Aspiring pilots and their families often struggle to identify credible FTOs. A ranking system serves as a reliable guide, helping them choose institutions based on quality, safety, and training outcomes rather than mere location or fees,” the regulator says.Apart from these actors, the DGCA sees ranking system will “ensure training quality and standardisation; enhance transparency and accountability; guidance for student pilots; aid in identifying high-performing FTOs for expansion or international collaboration, and underperforming ones for closer monitoring or corrective action.”All FTOs will have to submit performance data within the stipulated timelines for the scoring to be done in time. “DGCA reserves the right to verify submitted data through audits and inspections.

NEW DELHI: After flying schools, India could soon now start ranking organisation conducting aircraft maintenance engineering (AME) courses — thereby allowing students who wish to pursue this field make an informed choice. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will for the first time rank flying training organisations (FTOs) starting Oct 1 — a brainchild of DG Faiz Ahmed Kidwai. “We plan to start ranking AME institutes shortly. The preparatory work has started,” said sources.FTOs are being ranked on several key parameters like safety record and time taken to complete 200 hours of flying — which is among the things required to earn commercial pilot licence (CPL). This will help budding pilots help choose “good” schools. Currently even after paying several lakhs, they have to virtually “beg” to get their flying hours at a majority of the schools. The proposed ranking for AME institutes could have a similar focus on both the quality of training being imparted and how friendly — or otherwise — they are for students.Sources say the ranking system for FTOs has led to pressure on schools to improve their performance and become attractive for students. This pressure, say people in the know, has led to schools also seeking faster clearances from DGCA to cut delays in training. “The cumulative impact will be a win-win for students pilots and the future of Indian aviation with our aim to be a(self reliant) in the field. Govt is looking for a similar positive impact in the field of AME trading by improving things for students,” said sources.TOI had first reported the plan of DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai to rank flying schools in India on March 24, 2025. Through this move, Kidwai wanted flying training organisations (FTOs) to improve on all counts, with safety being key along with timely completion of flying, in order to get better rankings and therefore attract students.

NEW DELHI: Nitin Nabin will take over as BJP national president on Tuesday after emerging, as widely expected, as the sole candidate in fray, with the party’s leading figures from PM Narendra Modi , his cabinet colleagues and CMs, besides hundreds of electors from across country, endorsing his choice for the top organisational job.Modi, who signed the nomination paper in Nabin’s support but was not physically present at party headquarters Monday, is expected to be there when he formally assumes office. Other senior members, including Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh and CMs Yogi Adityanath, Mohan Yadav and Nayab Saini, turned up at the venue to be part of the set-piece occasion.K Laxman, party MP and returning officer for the poll, said after nomination process that Nabin is the only contestant in fray. In BJP’s history since its foundation in 1980, its president has always been a consensus choice and never faced electoral contest. A formal announcement of his elevation is scheduled for Tuesday.“I announce that only one name, that of Nitin Nabin, has been proposed for post of national president of BJP,” he said. Nabin (45), currently BJP working president and fifth-term MLA from Bihar, will take over the mantle from JP Nadda six years after the Himachal politician had taken up the position.Nabin will be its youngest-ever president.All 36 organisational states of BJP were part of the nomination-filing process besides its parliamentary party, which included Modi and Shah among others in what was seen a display of wide support for Nabin. Laxman said all 37 sets of nomination were found valid.Ministers and state presidents were seen patiently waiting for their state’s turn — an alphabetical order was followed for different units, to file their nomination in support of Nabin’s candidature. Nabin is expected to preside over his first formal meeting with office bearers in a couple of days.BJP’s Anurag Thakur said election of a young president conveys Modi’s call to Gez Z to be part of politics. Modi and BJP have shown they practice what they preach, he added.","Nitin Nabin will take over as BJP national president on Tuesday after emerging, as widely expected, as the sole candidate in fray.

NEW DELHI: In a rare development, Delhi HC acted on communication from Supreme Court of England and Wales to record statement of a banker in connection with the Nirav Modi case. In a recent order, HC sought assistance of Centre while issuing notice to all parties, including the fugitive diamantaire.Justice C Hari Shankar said assistance from govt is also needed “as to the future course of action to be taken in this matter, as there does not appear to be any earlier precedent in which the court acted on the basis of a communication from the foreign court, without a party to the matter approaching court”.The UK court sought HC’s intervention to record the testimony of a Delhi-based Bank of India official as a witness in proceedings abroad concerning Firestar Diamond FZE and its founder Nirav Modi in a loan default dispute.The request was communicated to Delhi HC via Union ministry of law and justice under 1970 Hague Convention on “taking of evidence abroad in civil or commercial matters”, HC noted in its order. To facilitate the process, court made the parties to UK proceedings, including Nirav Modi, also a party to the present matter.HC also asked counsel for Bank of India to clarify if they intend to file a formal application in the matter.","Delhi HC acted on communication from Supreme Court of England and Wales to record statement of a banker in connection with the Nirav Modi case.

HC refuses to suspend Sengar jail term in custody death case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-refuses-to-suspend-sengar-jail-term-in-custody-death-case/articleshow/126732828.cms,"Unnao Rape Case: Delhi HC Rejects Kuldeep Sengar’s Plea To Suspend Sentence

NEW DELHI: Less than a month after his release was stayed by Supreme Court in the main rape case, Delhi high court on Monday refused to suspend a 10-year jail term handed to expelled BJP functionary Kuldeep Singh Sengar for the custodial death of the Unnao rape survivor’s father.“The offence committed is of grave magnitude and has a deep societal impact,” Justice Ravinder Dudeja observed, rejecting relief sought on the grounds of delay in trial. The HC pointed out that the delay was partly caused by the multiple applications Sengar’s legal team filed in the matter.“Purpose would be served if the appeal were heard on merit in an expeditious manner,” the HC said, listing the appeal for hearing on Feb3.HC said it was “noteworthy” that Sengar has “criminal antecedents in as much as he was convicted in a connected case for the rape of a minor and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. The existence of such serious antecedents is a significant consideration and militates strongly against suspension (of the sentence).”It highlighted the findings of the trial court that Sengar was a key participant in the conspiracy and that the assault on the rape survivor’s father, and the subsequent falsification of the FIR, were part of that design.“Those findings form the basis of the conviction of the appellant and cannot be set aside lightly at the stage of deciding application for suspension of sentence,” the HC noted.On the argument that circumstances changed since his conviction, the HC said, “No exceptional or compelling circumstance was brought to the fore that would warrant suspension of sentence at this stage. The argument that the appellant underwent approximately 7.5 years of total imprisonment of 10 years RI awarded to him also does not advance his case. The period undergone is relevant but not determinative.”It underscored that when “weighed against the gravity of the crime, the threat perception, the appellant’s antecedents, and the nature of the trial court’s findings, this factor alone cannot warrant suspension.”In 2020, Sengar was sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment by a trial court in the case. The trial court said “no leniency” could be shown for killing a family’s “sole bread earner.” It also awarded a 10-year jail term to Sengar’s brother, Atul Singh Sengar, and five others for their role in the custodial killing of the rape survivor’s father.The father was arrested at the behest of Sengar under the Arms Act and died in custody on April 9, 2018, owing to police brutalities. Sengar kidnapped the minor and raped her in 2017. The former lawmaker’s sentence was suspended by HC on Dec 23, 2025, in the main rape case but the order was stayed by the Supreme Court on Dec 29, 2025.","Delhi high court refuses to suspend 10-year jail term handed to expelled BJP functionary Kuldeep Singh Sengar for the custodial death of the Unnao rape survivor’s father. “The offence committed is of grave magnitude and has a deep societal impact,” Justice Ravinder Dudeja observed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126733020,imgsize-1009135,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

However, they cannot afford the high cost of AC tickets for frequent travels.

The facts of the present case speak volumes as to how the proceedings are arbitrary and contrary to statutory provisions, besides being against the fundamental principles of adjudicatory process,” the HC observed, allowing the petitions by the couple.It said while no amount of cost can be treated as enough for these cases, “we cannot leave these cases without imposing any. Hence, we impose a token cost of Rs 1 lakh per case upon the respondents to be paid to each of the petitioners”.The HC also flagged how a change of an officer resulted in a change of proceedings, stressing that “merely because the new incumbents in the chair feel themselves to be wiser and they hold another opinion, which their predecessor did not or could not take, an already settled assessment cannot be unsettled and the petitioner cannot be made to face the rigmarole or harassment of assessment proceedings again and again”.The income-tax notice concerned the reassessment of the petitioners’ income for the year 2009-10 on account of certain “interest-free” loans received by them from RRPR Holding Pvt Ltd, the promoter entity of NDTV.

FIR In July 2023, Suspects Not Even Identified Yet







IMPHAL: A 20-year-old from the Kuki-Zo community, who became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur, has died waiting for justice.Eighteen when she was abducted and allegedly ""handed over"" to members of an armed group, the woman carried physical and psychological injuries that never healed, culminating in her death on Jan 10, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum said.The FIR, filed two-and-a-half years ago, is still pending at Porompat police station in Imphal East. None among her alleged attackers has been even identified.Kuki-Zo organisations, including Committee on Tribal Unity, held a candlelight vigil Saturday, demanding accountability for the woman's trauma through the 30-odd months she lived since the assault. She first reported the alleged crime to Kangpokpi police on July 21, 2023, two months after it occurred.This was after she fled the Imphal Valley amid spiralling unrest there. The FIR states that she was abducted on May 15 that year from near an ATM booth in Imphal's New Checkon. Some women from a group involved in the ethnic clashes allowed four armed men belonging to a valley-based outfit to take her to a hilltop, where three of them allegedly took turns sexually brutalising her before dumping her in a creek.The woman survived when an autorickshaw driver ferrying vegetables found her. The next day, she fled Imphal and sought treatment at a Kangpokpi hospital. She was referred to a hospital at Kohima in Nagaland and later to Guwahati in Assam.Despite months of medical care, the woman continued to suffer from uterine complications and deep psychological trauma, ITLF said. The organisation termed her death ""emblematic"" of the atrocities faced by the community during the ethnic violence.The Committee on Tribal Unity urged the Union govt to ensure justice was done to the young woman, saying punishing the perpetrators would ""uphold the spirit of the PM's Beti Bachao vision"".","20-year-old from Kuki-Zo community became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur.

"When winter burns: Uttarakhand to Kashmir, Himalayan forests are catching fire out of season",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-winter-burns-uttarakhand-to-kashmir-himalayan-forests-are-catching-fire-out-of-season/articleshow/126661834.cms,"‘Mountains where we’ve lived our lives don’t feel as pleasant anymore’

The pattern extends further north

But does dryness alone explain the scale or spread?

DEHRADUN/KULLU/SRINAGAR: For decades, forest fires in the Himalayas followed a predictable calendar. They started simmering in late spring and early summer, when rising temperatures, dry winds and accumulated leaf litter turned forests combustible. Winter, by contrast, was the season of snow, moisture and relative calm. That rhythm has been breaking for the past few years.This winter, forests across Uttarakhand - and increasingly Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir - have been burning with an intensity and frequency that forest officials and scientists say is no longer an anomaly, but indicative of a shifting ecological pattern. ""Forest fires are part of a natural cycle, but climate variability is compressing and intensifying that cycle,"" said Amit Kumar Verma, senior scientist at Dehradun's Forest Research Institute, who is involved in a five-year study to understand shifting forest fire regimes across the country.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country - 1,756 - surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country — 1,756 — surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.Dec, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years. Forest officials attribute much of the spike to extreme dryness. “We have had a completely rainless December. Moisture levels in forest floors are very low,” a senior official said. Like Uttarakhand, Himachal, too, has not received any rainfall since the first week of October last year, and snowfall has been largely absent from major apple-growing belts such as Kullu, Mandi, Shimla and Chamba. This has led to fires sparking across the state’s forests -- maximum at Shimla forest circle (62), followed by Rampur (16), Mandi (8), the Great Himalayan National Park-Kullu (6), Chamba and Kullu (4 each), and Bilaspur and Wildlife (South) circle (2 each) as per data from the state forest department.Kashmir’s forests have been enduring a harsh, snow-deficient winter too. Fires have been reported across the Valley and the Pir Panjal range, including Uri, Bandipora, Nishat and Poonch. In Dec, a forest guard died while fighting a blaze in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, and on Jan 12, a forest fire in Poonch triggered a series of landmine explosions along the Line of Control after flames spread into mined areas in Balakote and Mendhar sectors. “There is nearly a 40% snowfall deficit after three consecutive dry winters,” said Mudasir Mehmood, DFO Awantipora. “With no soil moisture, it’s no surprise that grass becomes highly flammable.”Officials point to stubble burning in farms close to forest fringes, biomass and solid waste burning, and in some cases, villagers setting fire to forest floors to encourage fresh grass growth for cattle. Anti-forest activities — including poaching and attempts to flush wildlife from cover — are also cited by forest and wildlife experts as possible reasons.According to former Uttarakhand head of forest force Jairaj, forest fires are rarely driven by a single cause. “In high-altitude areas with valuable wildlife like musk deer, poachers sometimes light fires to corner animals during winter when they are already vulnerable. Climate change adds another layer — everything is dry, and even a small spark can escalate into a big blaze,” he said.What is compounding the situation is that traditional forest management practices have eroded. The gradual decline of grazing and community-led clearing has allowed dry grass and leaf litter to accumulate on the forest floor, creating a potent mix that can erupt into a blaze if a carelessly-thrown beedi or half-lit match comes its way. “Earlier, villagers regularly cleared jungle grass. With migration and alternative livelihoods, that practice is fading,” an official said.On the ground, residents are already feeling the impact. In Jyotirmath (formerly Joshimath), 61-year-old Sarvani Devi has been watching, with a wary eye, smoke spiralling from the forest near her house for the past few days. “If these fires spread, everything will turn to ash. That is our biggest fear. Somehow, these mountains, where we have lived all our lives, don’t feel as pleasant anymore.”","December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.

‘BJP Won By Betrayal’: Uddhav Thackeray’s First Reaction On Mumbai Civic Poll Results







MUMBAI: Striking a defiant note in the aftermath of the high-stakes civic elections, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Friday acknowledged the party's below-expectation performance but urged his newly elected corporators to turn municipal houses into battlegrounds against what he described as the ""rule of money power"" and policies detrimental to Marathi interests.Addressing party workers and supporters, Thackeray congratulated elected corporators of both the MNS and Shiv Sena , underlining that the elections were fought in adverse circumstances.""This election was not easy. It was a battle between the power of wealth and power, and it was directed against the Shiv Sena,"" he said, crediting grassroots workers for holding their ground despite the odds.While conceding that the MNS did not secure the kind of mandate it had hoped for, Thackeray made it clear that electoral setbacks would not blunt the party's political edge. ""We are not the kind to get discouraged. Our elected corporators will bury the rulers there,"" he said, adding, that ""if they see anything happening against the Marathi people, they will definitely bring those rulers to book.""Political observers see Thackeray's remarks as a bid to reposition the MNS as a combative force within civic governance rather than merely a player measured by seat tallies.","MNS chief Raj Thackeray urges newly elected corporators to turn municipal houses into battlegrounds.

(With inputs from agency)

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday personally received UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the airport in New Delhi, a special gesture asserting the close ties between the two countries, as the visiting leader arrived for a brief but high-level official visit.MBZ’s visit, undertaken at the invitation of Prime Minister Modi, comes amid heightened developments in West Asia.Taking to social media platform X, the Prime Minister said, ""Went to the airport to welcome my brother, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE. His visit illustrates the importance he attaches to a strong India-UAE friendship. Looking forward to our discussions.""The PM later welcomed the UAE president and his family at his official residence on Lok Kalyan Marg.As part of the traditional Indian welcome, PM Modi presented a series of cultural gifts to the visiting dignitaries. President MBZ was gifted a Royal Carved Wooden Jhula (swing) from Gujarat, intricately hand-carved with floral and traditional designs. The jhula, a central fixture in many Gujarati homes, symbolizes togetherness, conversation, and intergenerational bonding, resonating with the UAE’s declaration of 2026 as the Year of Family.In addition, PM Modi presented a handmade Kashmiri Pashmina shawl in an ornate silver box from Telangana, representing India’s rich handloom and handicraft tradition. A similar Pashmina shawl was gifted to Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi, accompanied by Kashmiri saffron in an ornate silver box, prized for its deep crimson strands and intense aroma.The ministry of external affairs in a media briefing gave the details of the meeting between the two leaders, which according to foreign secretary “extended beyond the scheduled hours” and happened in both “restricted and expanded format.”The meeting was scheduled for 2 hours, but went well past 3 hours, termed ""substantive"" in terms of the outcome and also setting the tone and direction of India-UAE ties in the near future.The entourage of MBZ included the members of Royal families of both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and senior ministers and officials of UAE government, reflecting on the importance of the visit.""Amongst the members of the delegation were Sheikh Hamad bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the managing director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority; Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the deputy prime minister and foreign minister of the UAE; Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai, also the deputy prime Minister and the minister of defence of the UAE. And also Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who is the deputy chairman of the Presidential Court. In addition, there were the secretary general of the supreme council for national security, the minister for industry and advanced technology, the minister of state for international cooperation, the minister of state for artificial intelligence, digital economy and remote work applications, and the minister of state for defence affairs. Even for this short visit, this was a really, really high-powered delegation that accompanied the President..."" said the foreign secretary Vikram Misri.Talks between PM Modi and president Nahyan focused on advancing the India-UAE partnership, as well as an exchange of views on regional and global issues of mutual interest, the MEA said.Multiple agreements have been signed and agreed upon between the two countries ranging from nuclear and energy cooperation to railways and space. The leaders also discussed taking the bilateral trade between India and UAE to $200 billion by 2032. They also identified AI as a priority sector.""On the trade front, following the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between the two countries in 2022, the bilateral trade has since crossed $100 billion. In view of this, two leaders decided to raise ambitions and look to double bilateral trade to $200 billion by 2032. It was also decided to facilitate exports of the MSME industries to the West Asian, African and Eurasian regions..."" foreign secretary said.He added, ""The two sides decided to explore partnership in advanced nuclear technologies, including development and deployment of large nuclear reactors and small modular reactors, as well as cooperation in advanced reactor systems, nuclear power plant operations, and maintenance and nuclear safety. Artificial Intelligence was identified as a priority area of cooperation. It was decided to collaborate on setting up a supercomputing cluster in India with UAE partnership. The UAE will also look at investments for expanding data centre capacity in India. The UAE will also participate at a high level in the Artificial Intelligence Summit that India is organising in February 2026. Both sides will also explore the possibility of setting up a digital or a data embassy. This is a relatively new concept, but there will be work done to see how these can be set up under mutually recognised sovereignty agreements...""The two sides also decided on establishing the “House of India” in Abu Dhabi. This will be a unique cultural space which will have a state of the art museum reflective of India’s ancient culture, and a lasting symbol of India-UAE partnership, foreign secretary said.UAE has one of the largest Indian diaspora in the world, close to 4.5 million people from India currently living and working in the Middle Eastern nation. The Prime Minister expressed his deep appreciation to the UAE president for looking after the interest of the Indian community.Both leaders also discussed the issues in the Middle East and expressed full support for all efforts to promote peace, security, stability, and prosperity in the region. They also unequivocally condemned the cross border terrorism, and for perpetrators, supporters and financiers of all acts of terrorism to be brought to justice.MBZ also expressed support for India’s chairmanship of BRICS grouping this year, and also confirmed UAE high level participation in the AI impact summit that will be held next month, MEA said.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in a post on X shared the list of outcomes.The post said, ""List of Outcomes (12 in total) : Official visit of President HH Sheikh @MohamedBinZayed of UAE to India.""This marks Sheikh Mohamed’s third official visit to India since assuming office as UAE President, and his fifth visit to the country in the past decade, reflecting the frequency of top-level engagement between New Delhi and Abu Dhabi.The visit coincided with ongoing diplomatic activity related to West Asia, with the United States preparing to move to the next phase of its Gaza Peace Plan, which includes the proposed National Committee for the administration of Gaza.Prime Minister Modi has been invited by US President Donald Trump to be part of the Gaza Peace Board, according to a White House statement.India and the UAE have seen sustained engagement across political, economic and defence domains in recent months. Earlier this month, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi visited the UAE to strengthen military cooperation, while external affairs minister S Jaishankar travelled to Abu Dhabi in December for the India-UAE joint commission Meeting and strategic dialogue.India and the UAE share strong political, economic and people-to-people ties, supported by frameworks such as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), the Local Currency Settlement system and a Bilateral Investment Treaty. The two countries also cooperate closely at multilateral forums including the UN, BRICS, I2U2 and the UAE-France-India trilateral.According to the MEA, Sheikh Mohamed’s short visit provides an opportunity for both leaders to review progress in bilateral ties and identify new areas of cooperation amid evolving regional dynamics.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally received UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the airport in New Delhi.

Boost for defence exports as Rajnath flags off 1st batch of Pinaka guided rockets for Armenia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/defence/boost-for-defence-exports-as-rajnath-flags-off-1st-batch-of-pinaka-guided-rockets-for-armenia/articleshow/126721791.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big boost for India’s arms exports, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday flagged off from a facility in Nagpur the first batch of guided Pinaka rocket system bound for Armenia.The export of the multi-barrel rocket launcher, renowned for its accuracy and extended range, signalled India's emergence as a reliable supplier of cutting-edge defence technology. The Pinaka launchers, which are highly capable weapon systems with variants that can strike targets at up to 75 km -- the latest trial version can even touch a range of 120km -- have been increasingly promoted by India as part of its growing arms exports.Rajnath said the export of Pinaka missiles developed at Solar Defence & Aerospace facility have begun, demonstrating the capabilities of the defence industry. “India is no longer just an importer but is rapidly moving towards becoming an exporter,” he said. The minister said that due to increasing participation of the private sector, India's defence exports, which were at less than Rs 1,000 crore 10 years ago, have now reached a record Rs 24,000 crore.Domestic defence production, which stood at just Rs 46,425 crore in 2014, has grown to a record Rs 1.51 lakh crore now, he added.The Indian Army has already inducted Pinaka Mk-I Enhanced variant (EPRS) after successfully completing trials in April 2022. Originally built with a 37.5-km range, Pinaka has been upgraded over time to deliver greater range and effectiveness. In a proposal worth around Rs 2,500 crore, the Army is now looking to induct 120-km strike range rockets. The new 120-km strike range rockets, whose trial was conducted in Dec 2025, would be capable of being launched from the same launcher which at present can hit targets at 40 km and 75-plus km.In Sept 2022, Armenia had signed an agreement worth Rs 2,000 crore (approx. $250 million) with India for four Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher batteries along with anti-tank rockets, ammunition and other equipment. The deal included multi-barrel launch systems as well as guided rockets designed to enhance precision strike capabilities. Deliveries of the initial Pinaka unguided systems started in July 2023 and concluded by Nov 2024. Now, the first batch of Pinaka guided rockets has been flagged off from the Nagpur facility.While Armenia is its first confirmed buyer, several other nations, including some in Southeast Asia and Europe like France, have expressed keen interest in acquiring the Pinaka system.DRDO started the development of Pinaka in the late 1980s, as an alternative to the multi-barrel rocket launching systems of Russian make, like the ‘Grad’, which are still in use. DRDO is now producing the Pinaka systems with support from Indian entities like Tata Advanced Systems, Solar Industries, Munitions India Ltd and Economic Explosives Ltd.Besides Pinaka, India is offering for exports its indigenous Akash missile shield, especially after the world saw its mettle in Op Sindoor. Here too, Armenia, which has been in border conflict with Azerbaijan, was the first buyer, receiving the first battery in Nov 2024 under a $720 million deal for 15 missile systems. Other countries like the Philippines, Brazil, Egypt, and Vietnam have also shown interest in the Akash shield.","The export of the multi-barrel rocket launcher signalled India's emergence as a reliable supplier of cutting-edge defence technology.

Jaishankar told him he was no stranger to this part of the world and was also familiar with the longstanding challenge of cross-border terrorism.""Poland should display zero-tolerance for terrorism and not help fuel the terrorist infrastructure in our neighbourhood,"" he said.The meeting also saw India's discord with Europe on the Russia-Ukraine war spill out in the open as Jaishankar stressed that selective targeting of India on the Ukraine issue is unfair and unjustified. If Sikorski, who is also deputy prime minister, thought he could duck the issue by pretending Jaishankar might have been talking about Trump tariffs, the Indian minister retorted that the selective targeting was not limited to tariffs.""I think there have been other forms of selective targeting. But we will discuss that,"" Jaishankar said after Sikorski brought up the unfairness of selective targeting through tariffs.Poland is among the European countries that have not refrained from hectoring India on its position on the Ukraine war and trade relations with Russia.India has responded by calling out the ""double standards"" of these countries saying the European Union itself has continued to trade with Russia in not just energy but also fertilisers and other commodities. ""In the recent past, both in New York last Sept and in Paris this Jan, I have candidly shared with you our views on the Ukraine conflict and its implications. While doing so, I have also repeatedly underlined that the selective targeting of India is both unfair and unjustified. I do so again today,"" Jaishankar said in his opening remarks.On Sunday, the Polish leader had in Jaipur attacked Russian President Vladimir Putin saying Russia cannot be trusted.","Poland has been looking to expand its trade, defence and energy ties with Pakistan.

DMK or TVK? Decoding Congress's alliance dilemma ahead of Tamil Nadu assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dmk-or-tvk-congresss-decision-dilemma-ahead-of-tamil-nadu-assembly-elections/articleshow/126678409.cms,"The Congress has been on the winning side in Tamil Nadu several times, but has not been a part of the DMK government. If the Congress dumps DMK and manages to join a winning combination, it may get a chance to be part of the state government.

The DMK has often been accused of being anti-Hindu and anti-north - with some of its leaders making remarks that often run into controversy. While it helps the DMK in Tamil Nadu, the Congress, being a national ally, is left facing the consequences of these remarks in other parts, where it has high electoral stakes.

For years, Congress was the only national party with a reasonable presence in Tamil Nadu. However, that is changing fast. The BJP is working aggressively to gain ground in the state. The Congress needs to take steps to prevent itself from being swept out of the state politics by the BJP as has happened in several other states.

The DMK which is fighting for a second consecutive term could face anti-incumbency. Several DMK leaders also face corruption charges. These will also impact the Congress adversely even though it is not part of the government and has no say in matters of policy or governance.

The emergence of Vijay’s TVK gives the Congress an option to explore political realignment in the state. The TVK, which is leaving no stone unturned for a debut victory, has already called the Congress a “natural ally.” Actor Vijay’s popularity and his massive rallies have already forced the existing players to take note of his political march.

The Congress alliance with the DMK is stable and time-tested. Congress has gained politically from this alliance winning seats in both assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The two parties have worked together for a long time ironing out differences. If Congress dumps the alliance, it may turn out to be a costly gamble.

The DMK has been a crucial and loyal India-bloc ally for the Congress. With the state sending 39 members to Lok Sabha, Congress has gained from the DMK’s numbers in its national politics. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the DMK won 22 seats.

The Congress lacks the kind of cadre support and organisational strength needed to pursue independent politics in Tamil Nadu. Its vote share in the state has been on the decline in assembly elections.

Vijay the actor may be very popular, but Vijay the politician remains an untested novice. Huge crowds in rallies may not translate into votes when Tamil Nadu goes to polls to elect a new assembly in some months. If Vijay fails, like Prashant Kishor did in Bihar, Congress will end up losing a stable long-term ally without any political gains. Since AIADMK is already tied up with the BJP, the Congress may be pushed to oblivion.

NEW DELHI: The Congress is finally in action mode in Tamil Nadu. After a weekend brainstorming with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi in the national capital, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee has convened a crucial Executive Committee meeting tomorrow to focus on preparations for the upcoming 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections.But the important question is: Has the Congress finalised its direction in the state? Will the grand-old party continue with its long-term ally the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ), which has refused to share power if the alliance wins the upcoming assembly elections? Or will the Congress explore the possibility of a new coalition in the state by joining hands with actor-politician Vijay ’s TVK?The Congress-DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu faces one of its toughest challenges from within. According to reports, the Congress leadership has asked the state unit leaders to maintain alliance discipline and avoid confrontational political posturing against the long-standing and “trusted” ally. The directive on the importance of unity comes amid some very strong remarks made by a section of the state Congress after DMK rejected the idea of a coalition government.Congress MP Manickam Tagore was the first to float the idea of power sharing when he said that time had come to discuss sharing of power in the state with DMK.When the DMK said “no” to this, the Congress leader took potshots at the regional ally and also accused it of intolerance towards coalition partners.“We do not say ‘bye-bye’ to allies after elections,” Manickam Tagore said in a hard-hitting social media post. The Congress leader cited the example of United Democratic Front (UDF), the Congress-led coalition in Kerala, to school the DMK on “coalition dharma.” In a series of Pongal messages, Tagore contrasted what he described as the DMK’s “centralised mindset” with the inclusive and consultative UDF model practised in Kerala. “No betrayal after elections, no breaking alliances after counting votes. That is the UDF difference,” he said, describing it as “coalition dharma in action”.Tagore said Kerala UDF offers a hopeful template for coalition politics, where the Congress leads without monopolising authority. Power, he stressed, is shared rather than concentrated.The DMK is yet to react to this raised pitch by the Congress, which has till now played second fiddle to its regional ally. Even in 2006 when the DMK had fallen short of majority winning 96 seats, the Congress with 34 elected members supported DMK’s minority government without joining it.The Congress’s electoral fortunes in Tamil Nadu have been intertwined with the DMK since the two parties came together. Whenever the DMK has done well, the Congress has also gained, and vice versa.The grand-old party has seen a steady decline in its vote share in the state from 9.3% in 2011 to 4.27% in the 2021 assembly elections. So, has the time come for the Congress to rethink its Tamil Nadu strategy? Here are the pros and cons of the grand-old party considering a political realignment in the state.PROSCONSFor the Congress leadership, any decision on DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu will be tricky. While on the one hand, it will be tempted to experiment with Vijay’s TVK for greater political gains, on the other, it would be wary of its decision turning into a costly gamble.","The Congress has been on the winning side in Tamil Nadu several times, but has not been a part of the DMK government.

"DGCA exemptions end on February 10, IndiGo may cut more flights",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-exemptions-end-on-feb-10-indigo-may-cut-more-flights/articleshow/126722651.cms,"NEW DELHI: IndiGo could temporarily reduce some more flights post Feb 10 when it has to implement the new safety-enhancing & humane flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules.The airline on Monday assured the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) it will ensure there are no disruptions next month under the new rules that increase pilot requirement and for that, it may opt for a short term network readjustment if needed.The airline’s schedule was cut 10% last month after the December fiasco and it currently operates about 2,200 daily scheduled domestic and international flights. Of these 2,200 flights, about 350 are mounted on its turboprop ATR fleet and the rest on Airbus A320/A321s.To minimise fresh cuts from February 10, when the exemption from the new FDTL for its mainstay Airbus A320 family fleet pilots ends, IndiGo will shift some medium to short routes currently served by A320s to ATR.This will slightly reduce the number of flights on A320s and enable the airline to achieve two things — minimise further cuts on the Airbus fleet and operate the slightly more truncated schedule without any hiccups. Both the aviation ministry and DGCA are closely monitoring the process as they, along with IndiGo, are absolutely certain on one thing that a repeat of the chaos witnessed last month can’t be allowed again, let alone as soon as next month.To ensure that, the DGCA has been taking constant updates from IndiGo, including the latest one on Monday.,The regulator is going to cross-check the data submitted by the airline and match it against its proposed post February 10 operations to see that there are no slippages.“If any cuts are needed, the same will be decided well in time to ensure there are no last-minute cancellations, leaving flyers stranded at airports. Affected passengers of flights that may need to be cut after February 10 will need to be informed in time and given the option of a refund or alternate flights. We will not allow any public inconvenience,” said people in the know.IndiGo clearly has to set its house in order, and mend fences with pilots as apart from several other factors, a broken relationship between the aviators and top management had aggravated last month’s crisis.Relatively minor pinpricks like withdrawing night allowance on top of major ones including an inhumane rostering (its Nov 2025 is cited as an example of what a roster should not be); tight schedules with no slack; “arrogance” of some key people & the airline’s record profits being shared only with a handful of top brass & not the regular Joes drove a wedge between pilots and those in C Suites.Pilots are closely watching the action, if any, the airline takes against the “bad apples” identified in its internal and the DGCA probe.Post IndiGo’s schedule collapse last month, the regulator had on Dec 5 given IndiGo a temporary exemption from implementing the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules for its A320 family fleet till February 10, 2026.The DGCA had fined IndiGo Rs 22.2 crore, of which Rs 30 lakh is a daily fine for the 68 days of FDTL exemption between December 5 and February 10 that works out to Rs 20.4 crore.Additionally, the airline has to submit a bank guarantee of Rs 50 crore. Of this release of Rs 15 crore is linked to “initial and sustained compliance over six months of the new FDTL through “manpower planning, rostering and fatigue-risk management.”",IndiGo could temporarily reduce some more flights post Feb 10 when it has to implement the new safety-enhancing & humane flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules.

EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi said the commission would take necessary corrective steps.The bench did not agree with Dwivedi when he said that instances where age gap between the voter and his father is 15 years or less, or more than 50 years, and also less than 40 years between grandchildren and grandparents, should be categorised under “logical discrepancy”.The bench said, “We are not in a country where there is no child marriage.”A host of senior advocates — Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan and Banerjee — appearing for Trinamool Congress politicians complained that EC was adopting absurd criteria for issuing notices citing “logical discrepancy”.Dwivedi said notices are issued to produce relevant documents so that the discrepancies are corrected.",Almost 1.4 crore West Bengal voters face ‘logical discrepancy’ notices requiring documentary proof for the special intensive revision (SIR) Supreme Court ordered the Election Commission on Monday to display the list of such people in panchayat and block offices and gave them 10 more days to furnish documents.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126723199,imgsize-743936,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: An American woman faced a shocking incident of sexual harassment on the Delhi Metro when a teenage boy groped her after she agreed to a photo. The boy's mother and sister defended his actions, claiming he was simply curious about blondes.Gaurav Sabnis, an Indian-origin professor at New Jersey's Stevens Institute of Technology, shared the woman's account on X. He had warned his former student to stay cautious during her India trip for a friend's wedding, especially in Delhi where she might draw unwanted attention as a white .""When this former student called me in November for suggestions for her India trip for a friend's wedding, I told her, be on guard for sexual harassment. Especially in Delhi. Here, you're just another blond. There, you'll be a target. Sadly, it came true,"" Sabnis wrote, posting a screenshot of her text.The woman described the ordeal: “While my colleagues and hosts were great and I had a fun memorable 8 days in India, there was one unfortunate and ugly incident. That just soured my mood so much that I was withdrawn and depressed for a couple of days.”""A teenage boy, maybe 14 or 15, at a Delhi Metro station just ruined it forever.He was with his mom and sister so thought okay why not. He puts an arm on my shoulder. Weird but okay, he's a teenager. And then, professor, he just straight up grabbed my breasts hard and spanked my butt and giggled like he had played a joke. pretty much EXPLODED in anger, grabbing him by the collar and pushing him away. He fell and his mother started getting upset at me saying I was ""overreacting"". That he had never met a blond lady up close so he got ""carried away"". What kind of parenting is that? I loved your country and I wish I could say return, but don't think ever will. In fact I'm going to give all of South Asia a pass.""Social media users condemned the family's defense as enabling and victim-blaming. Many highlighted molestation as a serious crime and suggested filing a complaint, while other Indians apologised .on behalf of the boy and his family.One wrote, ""I know exactly what you mean. Whenever my daughter travelled in India, she was left deeply bewildered—why people spoke to her while staring at her chest instead of meeting her eyes, why they asked for selfies as if she were an object rather than a person, and why so many felt entitled to touch, feel, or grab her. The experience was confusing, unsettling, and profoundly violating.""Another said, ""Most unfortunate. The over protective mother’s reaction is highly condemnable and a major factor in moulding the way men behave.""A third commented, ""Victim blaming is a common thing in North India especially"" and ""“Overreacting"" what a disgusting reaction from the lady, instead of reprimanding her kid.""","An American woman faced a shocking incident of sexual harassment on the Delhi Metro when a teenage boy groped her after she agreed to a photo.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) to display the names of all 1.25 crore electors categorised under “logical discrepancies” during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal, where assembly elections are expected in April-May.A three-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant issued the order while hearing pleas alleging procedural irregularities in the SIR exercise.“The ECI has issued notices to certain persons described as falling under the category of 'logical discrepancies'. With a view to enabling these persons, we direct that their names be displayed at Gram Panchayat Bhavans, block offices, and ward offices,” the bench said, according to ANI.The court instructed the poll body to provide clear guidance for submitting documents and objections, and asked the West Bengal government to ensure adequate manpower for the process. Individuals in the category who have not submitted their claims or objections must do so within 10 days. The bench also directed that authorised officers issue letters to facilitate document submission.The Director General of Police of West Bengal has been asked to ensure smooth conduct and prevent any law-and-order issues.Where objections are found satisfactory, applicants will be given a hearing as per the ECI’s Standard Operating Procedure.Over 1.2 crore names had been flagged under the ‘logical discrepancy’ category on the ERONET portal, sparking controversy.

Who Cut the Fuel? Inside the Mystery of the Air India 171 Cockpit Audio

NEW DELHI: Air India said on Monday it is in the process of returning personal belongings of the AI-171 crash victims, seven months after 260 people were killed in the country’s worst aviation disaster in nearly three decades.According to an Air India spokesperson, 22,000 belongings have been preserved and listed on a dedicated portal. Of these, around 8,000 items could be linked to specific individuals and are listed as “associated,” while the remaining 14,000 are listed as “un-associated.”“Air India is handling this process with utmost respect, dignity, and accuracy. Working closely with a qualified external partner, our teams have spent considerable time cataloguing and documenting recoverable and returnable items,” a spokesperson told news agency PTI.“The exercise began on January 5 and will continue till mid-February. Information has been shared with the families through email and a dedicated website, and once they confirm the details, the belongings will be handed over physically in a manner that honours their grief and privacy. Several families have already collected the items which belonged to their kin,” he added.For “associated” belongings, emails have been sent to the concerned relatives with photographs and details of each recovered item, offering three options: to decline possession, collect it in person from a facilitation centre in Ahmedabad, or have Air India send it via courier.For the remaining 14,000 items, a separate portal has been created. The kin can either collect these in person at Ahmedabad or have them sent by courier, according to their preference.The belongings on display include a toy airplane, a toy car, a wristwatch, plastic bangles, a sweater, a pair of shoes, a half-burnt page of a book containing the famous Gujarati prayer “Mangal Mandir Kholo,” handbags, and other items.On June 12 last year, Air India flight AI-171, a Boeing 787-8 en route to London Gatwick, crashed into a medical college hostel complex shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The aircraft burst into flames, killing 241 of the 242 people onboard and 19 individuals on the ground.The crash is being probed by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.","Air India is in the process of returning personal belongings of AI-171 crash victims. 22,000 belongings have been preserved and listed on a dedicated portal.

West Bengal: a fortress with shrinking margins



Delhi: the fall of a regional experiment



Odisha and Andhra Pradesh: Swift reversals



The Southern Wall



Tamil Nadu: Outlier that resists

The BJP playbook, in numbers



Splits weaken rivals without eliminating them.

Welfare delivery triumphs identity-based vote banks.

Grassroots expansion breaks local monopolies.

Seat conversion efficiency rewards consolidation.

Narrative control nationalises elections.

The larger picture



When results from Maharashtra's long-delayed civic polls came on January 16, it became clear that the Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has made it to the top once again. The BJP swept 1,425 of 2,869 seats across 29 municipal corporations, a strike rate of nearly 50%. In Mumbai's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), a Shiv Sena citadel for 25 years, slipped out of regional control.Since 2014, the BJP's rise has not dismantled regional politics outright. Instead, it has steadily shrunk the space in which regional parties operate, limiting their ability to convert votes into seats, state power into national leverage and identity politics into a sustained election issue.Let's take a look at how that containment has unfolded, state by state.Recent civic polls in Maharashtra offer a clear snapshot of regional parties containment in action.In the January 2026 civic elections, the BJP emerged as the single largest party across major urban bodies. In Mumbai’s BMC, it won 89 of 227 wards on its own. With ally Eknath Shinde’s faction of the Shiv Sena adding another 29, the ruling Mahayuti crossed the majority mark. Uddhav Thackeray ’s Shiv Sena (UBT) was reduced to 65 seats, down from more than 130 in 2017.Across the state, the picture was bleaker for regional forces. In Pune Municipal Corporation, the BJP crossed 110 seats, while the combined strength of the two Pawars - Sharad and Ajit Pawar - remained in double digits.Pimpri-Chinchwad, another Nationalist Congress Party bastion, delivered 87 seats to the BJP.These civic polls were delayed for nearly nine years due to legal and administrative hurdles.The BJP framed its campaign around the idea of a ""triple-engine sarkaar"", led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre and Devendra Fadnavis at the state level. Welfare schemes such as 'Majhi Ladki Bahin' found traction among women voters, while youth backing was decisive: nearly 47% of voters aged 18–25 reportedly favoured the BJP.But the most decisive factor was political fragmentation.The 2022 Shiv Sena split turned Shinde into a BJP ally, hollowing out the party’s organisational spine. The 2023 NCP fracture left Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar competing for the same shrinking base. Even Uddhav Thackeray’s tactical alliance with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) split Marathi identity votes in dozens of wards, indirectly benefiting the BJP.In Bihar, the regional parties have not been eliminated, but absorbed and subordinated within a BJP-led political framework.In 2025 Bihar assembly elections, the NDA won over 200 of 243 seats, its most decisive victory in the state in decades. Within that, the BJP emerged as the single largest party, overtaking chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) in numerical strength for the first time.Seat data underlined the altered balance of power.The BJP secured 89 seats, while JD(U) followed with 85 seats. Smaller allies such as the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha and Rashtriya Lok Morcha added to the NDA tally. In contrast, the opposition collapsed. The Rashtriya Janata Dal, which had won 75 seats in 2020, was reduced to roughly 25 seats, while the Congress slipped to single digits.For regional parties in Bihar, this was not merely a defeat. It was a reordering.Nitish Kumar retained the chief ministership, but the arithmetic left little ambiguity. Power within the alliance now flows from the BJP outward, not the other way around. JD(U), once the pivot of Bihar politics and a perennial kingmaker in Delhi, now operates within limits defined by its larger partner.The RJD’s trajectory is equally telling. Tejashwi Yadav's party got the highest vote share of 23% in the elections: BJP - 20.08%, JD(U) - 19.25%.Despite retaining a loyal base among Muslims and Yadavs, the vote share did not translate into seats.Welfare schemes, infrastructure expansion and caste-neutral messaging from the NDA fractured older social coalitions.Bihar results show a crucial feature of the BJP's containment strategy: regional parties are allowed to survive, but not to dominate.Containment here does not mean extinction.It means subordination — a shift from being the senior partner to alliance dependents in a political order anchored firmly by the BJP.In India’s most populous state, the BJP’s containment strategy has played out through electoral arithmetic.In 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA won 64 of 80 seats. On the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party , despite being opposition in the 2022 assembly with 111 of 403 seats, struggled to expand its footprint. The Bahujan Samaj Party, once a pivotal force, was reduced to near irrelevance, winning just one seat.Vote shares tell a revealing story. BJP got around 36% vote share in 2024, while Samajwadi part got near 29%.This gap was widened by welfare politics. Schemes such as PM Awas Yojana, free rations and direct benefit transfers helped the BJP get more votes.Construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya also helped consolidate Hindu votes across caste.The Trinamool Congress remains dominant in West Bengal, but the BJP is up for the challenge.In the 2021 assembly elections, TMC won 213 of 294 seats. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, it retained 29 of 42 seats, getting around 45% of vote share. The BJP, however, consolidated itself as the principal challenger, holding roughly 23% of the vote share.The trajectory matters. BJP’s vote share surged from 18% in 2019 to nearly 38% in the 2021 assembly polls, driven by defections, organisational expansion and polarised campaigning. While welfare schemes such as Lakshmir Bhandar helped TMC stabilise its base, urban Kolkata and tribal belts like Jangalmahal saw growing BJP penetration.Mamata Banerjee remains powerful within the state. But will she continue to enjoy this power for log? We will know in a few months as Bengal votes for its next assembly.The 2025 Delhi assembly elections marked a turning point.The BJP won 48 of 70 seats, ending a decade of rule by the Aam Aadmi Party and reclaiming the capital after nearly 27 years. AAP’s vote share remained competitive, but BJP’s organisational depth, candidate spread and campaign scale ensured superior seat conversion.For AAP, the loss was existential. Once projected as a governance-driven alternative with national ambitions, it now faces questions about relevance beyond Punjab. Delhi’s verdict showed that even a high-visibility regional model can be overwhelmed by a national party’s machinery.Odisha saw one of the sharpest collapses. In 2019, the Biju Janata Dal won 113 of 147 assembly seats. By 2024, BJP swept 20 of 21 Lok Sabha seats and won 78 assembly seats, ending Naveen Patnaik’s long rule. Leadership vacuum and BJP’s appropriation of Odia identity accelerated the fall.In Andhra Pradesh, the YSR Congress Party’s dominance evaporated in 2024, when a TDP-BJP-JSP alliance won 135 of 175 assembly seats, pushing YSRCP to the margins despite a significant residual vote share.Both states show how quickly regional dominance can collapse when organisational depth and narrative control shift.Tamil Nadu remains the clearest exception.In the 2021 assembly elections, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam won 133 of 234 seats. In 2024, the DMK-led alliance secured 22 of 39 Lok Sabha seats. BJP’s vote share remains in single digits.Strong linguistic identity, entrenched welfare politics and the legacy of Dravidian ideology have limited BJP’s expansion. Seat conversion for regional parties remains efficient, and internal splits have so far been avoided.Kerala’s alternating Left and Congress coalitions continue to resist national consolidation. BJP’s vote share hovers around 11–15%, with limited seat gains despite a strong cadre base.High political literacy, entrenched welfare systems and cohesive minority blocs have constrained BJP’s growth. Yet even here, regional dominance remains confined within state borders, offering little national leverage.Nationally, the BJP-led NDA governs 19 states and is currently at its highest-ever strength in atate assemblies. The BJP alone presently has 1654 MLAs across state assemblies.Regional parties together hold roughhly about 31% of MLAs.BJP's containment strategy is consistent:Urbanisation, aspirational voting and fatigue with dynastic feuds have amplified these effects.India's regional parties are not extinct. They still win elections and govern states. But the data since 2014 shows their power is increasingly bounded.Civic routs in Maharashtra, the fall of AAP in Delhi, and reversals in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh all point to the same conclusion: the pathway from state power to national influence has narrowed dramatically.As 2026 assembly elections approach in five states and UT, the challenge for regional parties is no longer survival alone. It is to reinvent in current political climate. Will Mamata Banerjee and MK Stalin be able to hold their grounds or will the BJP push their parties to the wall? We will know by mid-year.","Since 2014, the BJP's rise has not dismantled regional politics outright. Instead, it has steadily shrunk the space in which regional parties operate. This has limited their ability to convert votes into seats, state power into national leverage and identity politics into a sustained election issue. Recent civic polls in Maharashtra offer a snapshot of regional parties containment in action.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126682951,imgsize-1587217,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo-of-pm-modi39s-election-rally.jpg"

DHAKA: In the midst of strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka, the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh on Monday visited a Teesta project area close to the strategic Siliguri corridor or Chicken’s Neck — a 22-km narrow land strip — between India’s mainland and its Northeastern states.Chinese envoy Yao Wen’s visit was related to an technical assessment being carried out under the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project, said the interim govt headed by Muhammad Yunus whose last year controversial pitch for “extension of the Chinese economy” and India’s “landlocked” Northeast remarks echoed in the Dec anti-India protests that targeted Indian diplomatic facilities in Dhaka and other Bangladeshi cities.Water resources adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who accompanied Yao to the project area in Rangpur’s Tepamadhupur Taluk Shahbazpur, said China is keen to start implementation of Teesta Master Plan (TMP) as soon as possible. She said both Bangladesh and China are committed to implementing TMP. However, as the scrutiny process of project is not yet complete, it is not possible to start work at this time, Hasan said.While for Bangladesh, Teesta is a lifeline for agriculture and livelihoods in its northern districts, for India — West Bengal — its equally critical.Hence, a Teesta water-sharing strategy has stretched over decades and a final agreement has remained elusive due to concerns from West Bengal govt.Following a meeting between Yao and national security adviser Khalilur Rahman Sunday, chief adviser Yunus’s press wing posted on X, “Both sides exchanged views on issues of mutual interest, reaffirming longstanding friendship and development cooperation between Bangladesh and China.”“Discussions included Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project and proposed Bangladesh–China Friendship Hospital. In this context, Chinese ambassador informed that he would visit Teesta project area, and reiterated China’s commitment to completing the ongoing technical assessment expeditiously,” it said.The ambassador also reaffirmed his govt’s continued support for Bangladesh’s ongoing democratic transition and conveyed best wishes for the successful conduct of the forthcoming national elections, the press wing said.Yunus, who was appointed chief adviser in 2024, during an interview in China in 2025 had urged Beijing to establish strong economic infrastructure in Bangladesh by leveraging its strategic position as “only guardian of the ocean” in the region.",Chinese envoy Yao Wen’s visit was related to an technical assessment being carried out under the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project.

"1 man listed as dad of 389, another of 310: SIR detected WB errors, says EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-man-listed-as-dad-of-389-another-of-310-sir-detected-wb-errors-says-ec/articleshow/126723573.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the last few elections in West Bengal, there are instances of hundreds of voters who have recorded a single person as their father. In the 2025 electoral list, in assembly constituency number 283 (Barabani in Asansol district), a person has been registered as father of 389 voters, Election Commission told Supreme Court on Monday.Such incorrect information is categorised as ‘logical discrepancies’ requiring correction, EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Dipankar Datta and Joymalya Bagchi. Dwivedi said the notices issued to such voters are for the purpose of correcting the records and the onus is on the voter to produce documents to record the correct name of their parents.In assembly constituency number 169 (Bally, Howrah district), another person is recorded as father of 310 voters, the EC affidavit said. It said each of seven persons are linked to more than 100 voters as parents; 10 have been recorded as parents of 50 or more voters, another ten as father of 40 or more voters, 14 more as father of 30 or more children, 50 for more than 20 children each, 8,682 for more than 10 children each, 2,06,056 for more than six children, and 4,59,054 for more than five children each.It said as per National Family Health Survey 2019-21, the average household size of India is 4.4.“This denotes that on an average each family consists of 2-3 children. However, in some cases the number of electors linked to one parent is more than 50. This required clarification from voters,” Dwivedi said.“Therefore, cases in which six or more electors have mapped/linked themselves to one person, merits greater scrutiny as regards validity of linkages. In such cases, electoral registration officers are issuing notices to verify whether matching has been done correctly to weed out the chance of fraudulent mapping,” EC said.There are four more grounds on which notices have been issued to electors under ‘logical discrepancy’ category: name of elector in the roll as on Oct 27, 2025 not matching with that mentioned in the 2002 SIR roll; difference of elector’s age as per 2025 roll with parent’s (calculated based on 2002 SIR roll) age is less than 15 years; difference of elector’s age (as per 2025 roll) with parent’s age (calculated based on 2002 SIR roll) is more than 50 years; and difference of elector’s age with grandparent’s age is less than 40 years.","There are instances of hundreds of voters who have recorded a single person as their father.

Who has stopped them,” Abdullah told reporters in Jammu, saying Kashmir is their home and Pandits are free to return.“There are many Pandits living in Kashmir. They did not leave. When others left the valley, they stayed in their homes peacefully,” he said, adding that most displaced families have rebuilt lives elsewhere. “They may come as visitors, but I don’t think they will return to live,” he said, citing age, health and children settled in education and jobs.Abdullah also echoed music composer AR Rahman’s remarks on alleged communal bias, saying “a fire of hatred” is being used to divide Hindus and Muslims for elections, pointing to Jammu tensions and the Jan 6 National Medical Commission decision withdrawing permission for the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence to admit 50 MBBS students for 2025–26, officially citing deficiencies.

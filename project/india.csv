ED summons Anil Ambani on August 5; loan diversion charge being probed: What's the case about?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-summons-anil-ambani-on-august-5-rs-3000cr-loan-diversion-charge-being-probed-whats-the-case-about/articleshow/123033156.cms,"Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani

What's the case about?

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday summoned industrialist Anil Ambani on August 5 in loan fraud case amid probe over bribery, unsecured loans allegations.Ambani, 66, has been asked to depose at the ED headquarters in Delhi as the case has been registered here, sources told news agency PTI.The agency will record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) once he deposes, they said.Meanwhile, the agency is conducting search in Bhubaneshwar and Kolkata in connections with fake bank guarantee racket.""The agency recorded an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) based on a case registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police dated November 11, 2024 in the matter,"" officials said.This comes days after the central probing agency conducted simultaneous raids in connection of financial irregularities and collective loan ""diversion"" of more than Rs 10,000 crore by multiple group companies of Ambani.ED sources had said the investigation primarily pertains to allegations of illegal loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore, given by the Yes Bank to the group companies of Ambani between 2017-2019.Officials said that searches were done at over 35 locations in Mumbai, covering 50 companies and 25 individuals under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).A Delhi-based ED unit is spearheading the investigation.The agency is probing alleged improper diversion of approximately Rs 3,000 crore in loans, granted by Yes Bank to Ambani's group companies between 2017 and 2019. In reaction to the raids, Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure issued clarification letters to the exchanges.According to officials, multiple agencies, including the National Housing Bank, SEBI, National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), and Bank of Baroda, have shared relevant information with the ED.Officials told that “ED has found gross violations in Yes Bank loan approvals to RAAGA companies,” including backdated Credit Approval Memorandums, lack of due diligence, and breaches of the bank’s credit policies. The loans were allegedly diverted to multiple group and shell companies.Red flags identified include loans to entities with weak financials, shared addresses and directors, poor documentation, and evergreening of loans. Officials also noted, “SEBI is also learnt to have shared its findings with ED in the case of RHFL.”The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years.A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.","Ambani, 66, has been asked to depose at the ED headquarters in Delhi as the case has been registered here.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Friday as India braces for 25% tariff rate on its exports to the US. While Nifty50 went below 24,750, BSE Sensex was down over 100 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,727.45, down 41 points or 0.17%. BSE Sensex was at 81,047.39, down 138 points or 0.17%.Market analysts indicate that Nifty's underlying short-term trend remains positive despite high volatility. Analysts suggest maintaining caution and adopting a hedged strategy due to expected market fluctuations. US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order announcing tariffs on 69 countries (including EU) which will be effective August 7, 2025. India is also a part of the list. Trump's earlier deadline for reciprocal tariffs was August 1.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The August series starts on a weak note after the 3.1% dip in Nifty in July. In the near-term the market will be influenced by the tariff-related news. Since the date of implementation of the modified tariff rates is August 7th, that gives countries time to negotiate and bring the tariffs down.That may happen. Yesterday’s market action indicates that the market views the 25% tariff as a short-term issue. The rate is likely to come down after the next round of negotiations beginning this month.“An important trend in the market is the weakness in the broader market, particularly the smallcaps. This trend is likely to continue given the high valuations of the segment. Sustained selling by the FIIs continues to be a negative. The sharp surge in the dollar index to 100 will nudge the FIIs to continue selling putting pressure on largecaps too. Investors can adopt a wait and watch strategy.""US equities declined on Thursday as initial gains diminished following corporate earnings reports and economic data releases, with investors awaiting post-market results from Amazon and Apple.Asian equities dropped for six consecutive sessions, marking the longest downward trend in 2025, following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, despite strong performance from large technology companies failing to boost overall market confidence.Oil oprices remained stable on Friday, following a decline exceeding 1% in the previous trading session, as market participants evaluated the consequences of increased US tariffs potentially affecting economic activities and global fuel consumption growth.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 5,588 crore net on Thursday. Domestic institutional investors purchased Rs 6,373 crore net.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opened in red on Friday as India braces for 25% tariff rate on its exports to the US.

UPI New Rules: New NPCI rules kick in from August 1 - All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/upi-system-changes-new-npci-rules-kick-in-from-august-1-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/123025161.cms,"Representative image

Cap on balance enquiries to prevent system overload

Limit on bank account access via “list account” API





Restrictions on UPI autopay transactions during peak hours

Industry reaction welcomes move towards efficiency

Deadline set for compliance; penalties for violations

Starting August 1, 2025, UPI will see changes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.The changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.Payment Service Providers (PSPs), UPI apps, and banks must implement the changes by July 31, as per NPCI’s compliance notice dated May 21.A major change includes a cap on balance enquiry requests, now limited to 50 per app per customer in a rolling 24-hour period, as per ET.These requests must be user-initiated only, with no automatic prompts by apps or systems. UPI apps must also introduce the ability to reduce or halt such requests during peak load hours to minimise system strain.The guidelines also require issuer banks to include the available account balance in every successful UPI transaction message, streamlining user experience and reducing the need for separate balance checks.NPCI has also put in place access limits on the “list account” API, which lets users view bank accounts linked to their mobile number. This API will now be restricted to 25 requests per customer per app per day, and only after the user selects their bank in the app.Any retries must be made with explicit customer consent, ensuring transparency and avoiding unnecessary API calls.To further address system congestion, NPCI has restricted UPI Autopay executions to non-peak hours only. Peak hours are defined as 10:00 to 13:00 and 17:00 to 21:30.Each autopay mandate will be allowed one initial attempt and a maximum of three retries, clearly capped at four total executions per mandate sequence.Welcoming the new rules, Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred was quoted as saying by ET that “These measures are prudent and forward-thinking, as they prioritise system efficiency and user security. By capping balance requests and optimising API usage—especially with clear restrictions during peak hours—the guidelines will effectively reduce server overloads and potential service outages. ”He also highlighted the value of “emphasis on customer consent and timely compliance” in enhancing system accountability.The NPCI has clearly warned that failure to comply with these directives by July 31, 2025, may result in UPI API restrictions, penalties, suspension of new customer onboarding, or any other appropriate action.NPCI has advised all member banks and UPI ecosystem participants to communicate these changes across their systems and partners ahead of the compliance deadline.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.

• August 13 – 17 (Wednesday – Sunday) – Jhulan Purnima

• August 15 (Friday) – Independence Day

• August 16 (Saturday) – Janmashtami

• August 26 – 28 (Tuesday – Thursday) – Onam

• August 27 (Wednesday) – Ganesh Chaturthi

Will there be a long weekend?

Note:

August is often a busy month for students across India, filled with academic schedules, Independence Day activities, and mid-term assessments. But it also offers a series of public holidays and regional observances that can bring a much-needed pause.August stands out because it includes national celebrations like Independence Day, along with various state-specific observances and religious festivals. While some holidays are limited to specific regions or communities, others bring long weekends that are useful for both rest and preparation. Whether you're planning a study break, or simply catching up on assignments, here’s a list of school holidays in August 2025 to help you plan better.Here are the major holidays that apply across most schools in India:Raksha Bandhan is widely celebrated in northern and central India to honour the bond between siblings. Schools in many states, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana, usually declare a holiday on this day.Observed mainly in West Bengal, Odisha, and parts of eastern India, Jhulan Purnima celebrates the divine swing festival of Radha and Krishna.Some regional schools may remain closed during this period.Independence Day is a national holiday across all Indian states. Most schools observe the occasion with flag hoisting and cultural programs, followed by a day off.Janmashtami, marking the birth of Lord Krishna, is a public holiday in many states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Depending on regional tradition, schools may declare a holiday either on August 16 or the preceding/following day.Onam is Kerala’s biggest harvest festival, celebrated with cultural events, pookalam (flower rangoli), and traditional feasts. Schools across Kerala typically remain closed for multiple days, especially around Thiruvonam, the festival’s main day.Ganesh Chaturthi is an official holiday in states like Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Telangana. Schools in these regions remain closed to allow students to participate in rituals, home celebrations, and public processions.In addition to national holidays, several region-specific observances may apply based on your state’s academic calendar or school board guidelines.Yes, students may get a long weekend from August 15 to 17 if schools remain closed on Saturday, August 16. Additionally, if your school observes Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami holidays in succession, you could see shorter study weeks during mid to late August.While holidays are ideal for rest, many students also use this time to revise, complete pending assignments, or prepare for upcoming exams. If you're in senior secondary classes, this could also be a good time to begin short-term courses, practice mock tests, or explore college options if you’re in Class 12.Younger students can use the break for hobby classes, reading, or short family trips, depending on how your school has scheduled internal assessments.Check with your school’s official holiday calendar or circular, as some private and state board schools may differ in observance dates based on local declarations or weekend policies.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Another indigenous warship joins Navy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-indigenous-warship-joins-navy/articleshow/123029921.cms,"NEW DELHI: Another indigenous multi-role stealth frigate, Himgiri, was delivered to the Navy Thursday that will boost country's blue-water combat capabilities. This is the second such stealth warship to be handed over to the force this month.The 6,670-tonne Himgiri has been built by the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), while her predecessor Udaygiri was handed over by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) on July 1. Both the warships are slated to be commissioned together towards end-August.The 149-metre long Himgiri is the third of the seven frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the remaining four are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.All these multi-mission frigates are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km, and ""designed to address current and future challenges in the maritime domain"", an officer said.For air defence, the frigates are equipped with Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles, among other weapons.""These frigates reflect a quantum leap in naval design, stealth, firepower, automation and survivability, and are an admirable symbol of aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in warship building,"" the officer said.Overall, the 140-warship Navy has 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage. This naval expansion is crucial to tackle the maritime collusiveness between Pakistan and China, which is making major strategic inroads into the Indian Ocean Region with the world's largest naval force of 370 warships.","The 6,670-tonne Himgiri has been built by the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) Her predecessor Udaygiri was handed over by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) on July 1.

Phased fan replacements

NEW DELHI: Faced with a troubling spike in student suicides, IIT Kharagpur is taking an unusual but decisive step, downsizing ceiling fans in hostel rooms to make them unusable for self-harm. The initiative is part of a larger mental health push aimed at protecting students from moments of impulsive distress.“This is not a solution to mental health, but in a moment of crisis, the absence of a tool can mean the presence of life,” said institute director Suman Chakraborty, speaking to PTI.The elite institute has witnessed four student suicides in 2024 alone, the latest being 21-year-old Ritam Mondal, a fourth-year mechanical engineering student, found dead in his hostel room on July 18, just days after returning from vacation.In response, IIT Kharagpur has formed a 10-member fact-finding committee and launched a slew of initiatives:The plan to replace ceiling fans in all 21 hostels, home to nearly 16,000 students, will roll out in phases. “We can’t give a timeline just yet, but the decision has been made,” Chakraborty said.By reducing access to means of suicide while strengthening emotional scaffolding, IIT Kharagpur is trying to change the script on campus tragedies, from silence and stigma to support and survival.","IIT Kharagpur is downsizing ceiling fans in hostel rooms to make them unusable for self-harm.

After the discussion on the Pahalgam terror attack, it is set to demand one on SIR, a move that puts the functioning of Parliament in the coming weeks under a cloud given the government's reluctance on the sensitive issue targeted at BJP and Election Commission.At a discussion of the INDIA bloc leaders Thursday, the opposition agreed to keep their single-minded focus on the EC's electoral rolls review which has roiled election-bound Bihar, and would be implemented in the rest of the country. Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have led the discussion by alleging that the issues in Parliament are important, but the BJP is winning the elections by ""manipulating"" the voters' lists.The opposition's thinking was evident from the fact that the meeting also discussed the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, with some dubbing them as a rebuff to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP. Congress Lok Sabha whip Manickam Tagore even moved an adjournment motion on the government's ""economic and diplomatic failure"" over tariffs.But the protest in the House which paralysed its functioning was solely on SIR.It was also mentioned in passing that Rahul make a presentation to the anti-BJP camp on how the ""tampering"" is being done, based on what Congress claims to have unearthed in the Bangalore Rural Lok Sabha seat.The meeting, which comprised Gaurav Gogoi, Supriya Sule, T R Baalu, Ramgopal Yadav, N K Premachandran, Derek O'Brien, John Brittas, KC Venugopal, felt other issues though important should be kept aside as distraction.Interestingly, the opposition decided to adopt the Trinamool Congress's appellation of SIR, calling it ""vote chori"". It was felt SIR is too esoteric for the common man to grasp its political significance.Rahul is learnt to have argued that issues in Parliament are effective, but BJP is winning elections on the ground through a different strategy focused on electoral rolls. An MP quoted Rahul as saying that after defeats in states that appeared tilted towards Congress, the party believed it was because of weak organisation. But after studying Bangalore Rural, it is convinced there are other reasons. ""We have found a pattern,"" he reportedly said.Sources said the opposition is unanimous on the issue, and the ball is in the government's court on accepting the demand for a discussion on Special Intensive Review.","The opposition decided to adopt the Trinamool Congress's appellation of SIR, calling it ""vote chori"" It was felt SIR is too esoteric for the common man to grasp its political significance.

Based on the evidence, the judge said a bomb could have been placed later on the bike. Refuting the prosecution's case, the judge also noted that it could not be proved that the bike on which the bomb was allegedly fitted belonged to Thakur, that RDX was procured by Lt Col Prasad Purohit from Kashmir, or that he assembled the bomb.The judge also found sanction orders granted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act to be defective and invalid, issued without ""application of judicial mind"".The NIA judge said the conspiracy in Malegaon blast case remained unproven due to absence of evidence and witnesses who would testify that a series of meetings were held by the organisation named Abhinav Bharat to plan the attack.ATS probes focused on the alleged conspiracy by a group intent on avenging perceived atrocities against Hindus. The crux of prosecution's case was that the plot revealed an effort to strike terror by orchestrating a bomb blast in Malegaon, a Muslim-dominated area.However, the judge said to show that the main elements of the conspiracy were finalised at Faridabad and Bhopal, the prosecution was not supported by ""material witnesses"" and the testimony of those who did was not ""reliable and acceptable...other meetings which were held at Kolkata, Indore, Ujjain, Nashik and Pune, no acceptable evidence is present on these on record... witnesses have retracted from their earlier statements given to ATS. Therefore, neither conspiracy is proved nor meetings are proved,"" the judge said. While it was alleged that that accused Ajay Rahirkar, acting as treasurer of Abhinav Bharat, collected donations and distributed funds to Lt Col Prasad Purohit, who was a trustee, as well as to Sudhakar Dhar Diwedi and Major Ramesh Upadhyay (Retd), Purohit used these funds for personal expenses, including house construction and paying for LIC policies. ""But there was no evidence that the said amount was used for terrorist activities,"" the judge said.The retraction by 39 of 323 prosecution witnesses of statements given to ATS considerably weakened the case. ""Testimony of prosecution witnesses is riddled with material inconsistencies and contradictions,"" the judge said.Referring to procedural shortcomings, the judge was critical of the handling of the crime scene. It was revealed that no rough sketch map was drawn, and the spot was not immediately barricaded, leading to contamination. The judge pointed out that a mob gathered at the spot after the blast, pelted stones, vandalised cars, caused damage to a police chowki, and snatched the firearms of police officers. He said a counterattack by police involved lathicharge, firing, and use of grenades.Despite the presence of a fingerprint expert, no prints, DNA samples, or other critical data were collected at the spot. The judge said since the spot was contaminated, analysis of articles found could not be considered 100% accurate anyway. Even material seized such as mobiles and laptops were not sealed as per due process.The judgment also raised concerns about procedures adopted for collecting voice samples and intercepting mobile communication. The judge observed that interceptions were not authorised in the specific period, and permissions were obtained belatedly. This rendered the intercepted data unusable as evidence. It was also noted that ""narco analysis was carried out of the accused by ATS but not supported by documents and it was not filed on record"".The judgment even raised concerns about planting of evidence and tampering of material. It has called for an inquiry into the actions of ATS officer Shekhar Bagade, whose presence at an accused's house was seen to be under suspicious circumstances. ""House search of accused Sudhakar Chaturvedi tilt towards planting (of RDX) in the light of evidence of record. There was no conscious possession over the house, and articles, found at the relevant time,"" the judge said. Chaturvedi was accused of assembling the bomb at his home, a claim he denied.The judge pointed out that despite allegations that Purohit had brought RDX from Kashmir, no evidence was presented to show its storage at his house or its use in assembling the bomb. Interestingly, NIA's supplementary chargesheet in May 2016 had accused ATS of planting RDX traces to frame Purohit and, notably, gave a clean chit to Pragya Thakur and others, citing insufficient evidence. Despite NIA's stance, the special court, on Dec 27, 2017, ruled that seven accused, including Thakur and Purohit, would face trial under UAPA, though charges under MCOCA were dropped.In his concluding remarks Thursday, the judge expressed awareness of ""agony, frustration and trauma caused to society at large, more particularly to the family of victims, by the fact that a crime of this nature has gone unpunished"".""However law does not permit the court to convict the accused solely on the basis of moral conviction or suspicion,"" the judge said.As per the judgment, a compensation of Rs 2 lakh is to be paid to families of those who died in the blast, while the 95 injured will receive Rs 50,000 each. The case, meanwhile, will continue against two absconding accused, Ramji Kalsangra & Sandeep Dange. Five different judges have so far presided over proceedings. The tenure of the current judge, A K Lahoti, was recently extended by Bombay high court till Aug 31, 2025 to ensure he could deliver the verdict.",The NIA judge said the conspiracy in Malegaon blast case remained unproven due to absence of evidence.

He said there is a lot of speculation about suspicious voters, and alleged that the results can be manipulated on electronic voting machines (EVMs). He asked the minister if the votes were being cast correctly. Election Commission has informed that there is no category of suspicious voters as per the RP Act,"" the minister said, and added that EC further informed that ""the election results cannot be manipulated on EVMs"".Meghwal said there is no doubt in the fairness and integrity of EVMs which, he said, have stood the test of several elections, public and legal scrutiny over the years. ""EC has further informed that in at least 42 petitions against use of EVMs which have been filed before various high courts and Supreme Court, and after going through various aspects of the technological soundness and the administrative safeguards involved in the use of EVMs, the courts have repeatedly held that EVMs are tamper proof, credible and reliable,"" the minister added.He said EC has mentioned that to dispel any apprehension of any kind, EVM-related documents, such as manual on EVM and VVPAT, presentation on EVM, status paper on EVM, legal history of EVMs and VVPATs and FAQs are available in public domain on EC website that anyone can check.","Law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal says there is no category of voters called ""suspicious voters"" under the RP Act.

HC junks Turkiye aviation company's plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-junks-turkiye-aviation-companys-plea/articleshow/123030237.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court bench of Justice Tejas Karia on Thursday dismissed a plea by the Turkish-owned company Celebi Ground Handling India Pvt Ltd against government's decision to revoke its security clearance. A copy of the detailed order is awaited.Earlier this month, a different bench had dismissed petitions by Turkish firms Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India Pvt Ltd challenging the revocation of their security clearance by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Safety (BCAS), saying there were ""compelling national security considerations"" involved.In May, BCAS had revoked the security clearance after Turkiye backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country. The court on July 7 underlined the necessity to eliminate the possibility of espionage or dual use of logistics capabilities, which would be highly detrimental to the security of the country, especially in the event of an external conflict.In its detailed ruling on the earlier petitions, the high court had upheld the govt's reasoning and decision.","Delhi high court dismisses plea by Turkish-owned company Celebi Ground Handling India Pvt Ltd against government's decision to revoke its security clearance.

Parliament must review powers of speaker under anti-defection law: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-must-review-powers-of-speaker-under-anti-defection-law-sc/articleshow/123030197.cms,"Telangana speaker breached Parliament trust: SC

NEW DELHI: In a significant judgment, the Supreme Court on Thursday said to protect foundations of democracy, Parliament must take a call on the effectiveness of the anti-defection law mechanism, which has been virtually blunted due to the widely-perceived partisanship of speakers, leading to delays in deciding disqualification petitions against political turncoats.Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih gave this ruling while directing the Telangana assembly speaker to decide within three months the disqualification petitions filed against 10 BRS MLAs who defected to Congress after it formed govt in the state following the Nov 2023 elections.The verdict marks a departure from the restraint that courts have shown in setting deadlines for speakers and could well be a precedent in settling defection-related cases in the future.The CJI-led bench also directed the speaker not to allow the 10 MLAs, facing disqualification proceedings, to protract proceedings.""In the event any of such MLAs attempt to protract the proceedings, the speaker would draw an adverse inference against him,"" the bench said.Constitutional courts have generally refrained from fastening speakers with a timeline to decide pending disqualification petitions. However, SC said since the Telangana speaker has delayed adjudication of disqualification petitions by more than a year, it warranted issuance of directions to him.The bench was critical of the way the speaker issued notice on the disqualification petitions seven months after they were filed, and said such a delay breached the trust Parliament reposed in presiding officers to adjudicate defection cases fearlessly and expeditiously. In the 2023 elections to the 119-member assembly, Congress had won 64 seats, BRS 39, BJP eight, AIMM seven and CPI one. However, Congress's numbers rose after the defection of the 10 BRS MLAs.Writing the 74-page judgment recording numerous instances of speakers' deliberate inaction in speedy adjudication of disqualification petitions against MLAs, CJI Gavai said, ""It is for Parliament to consider whether the mechanism of entrusting speakers the important task of deciding the issue of disqualification on the ground of defection is serving the purpose of effectively combating political defections or not?"" ""If the very foundation of our democracy and the principles that sustain it are to be safeguarded, it will have to be examined whether the present mechanism is sufficient or not. ..it is for Parliament to take a call on that,"" the CJI said.SC reiterated the settled law that speakers/chairman of assemblies, Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha function as tribunals while deciding disqualification petitions under the anti-defection law, and that their decisions can be scrutinised by the HCs and the apex court. CJI Gavai examined the purpose behind enactment of the anti-defection law in 1985 through a constitutional amendment and said the only purpose of entrusting the work of adjudicating the disqualification petitions to the speaker/chairman was to avoid dilly-dallying and resultant delay in the courts of law or the Election Commission's office.He said, ""Parliament decided to entrust the important question of adjudication of disqualification petitions, on account of defection, to the speaker/chairman expecting him to decide them fearlessly and expeditiously."" CJI Gavai and Justice Masih said, ""With the experience of over 30 years of working of the 10th Schedule to the Constitution, the question that we will have to ask ourselves is as to whether the trust which Parliament entrusted in high office of the speaker or the chairman of avoiding delays in deciding the issue with regard to disqualification has been adhered to by the incumbents in the high office of speaker and the chairman or not?""Referring to a chain of cases under the anti-defection law marred by inordinate delay in adjudication by speakers across states, already frowned upon by SC in as many cases, the bench said, ""We need not answer this question, since the facts of the various cases themselves provide answer.""",Supreme Court says Parliament must take a call on effectiveness of the anti- defection law mechanism. Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih gave this ruling while directing the Telangana assembly speaker to decide within three months the disqualification petitions filed against 10 BRS MLAs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123030205,imgsize-157042,width-400,resizemode-4/123030205.jpg"
SC recalls own order directing liquidation of Bhushan Steel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-recalls-own-order-directing-liquidation-of-bhushan-steel/articleshow/123029988.cms,"SC's role in IBC proceedings limited, says CJI

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic yet decisive reversal, Supreme Court Thursday annulled its May 2 judgment ordering liquidation of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, which had been revived in 2021 by the Sajjan Jindal-led JSW through a Rs 20,000 crore plan concurrently upheld by NCLT and NCLAT under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code process.Unabashedly admitting that its earlier decision militated against the settled law on inviolability of the decision of Committee of Creditors, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice Satish Chandra Sharma recalled the verdict and posted the matter for fresh hearing next Thursday.The bench also frowned upon the use of Article 142 by the earlier bench led by Justice Bela M Trivedi, who has since retired, to order liquidation of the revived company despite it being in the pink of health.""Powers of Article 142 are meant to do complete justice and not cause injustice to 25,000 employees,"" the apex court said Thursday.In an open court hearing on the review petitions filed by Punjab National Bank, the lead creditor for bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, and JSW, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul told a bench of CJI BR Gavai and Justice Satish Chandra Sharma that IBC proceedings aim to revive sick companies and liquidation is only the last resort.The CJI said he has, as an SC judge, authored many judgments crystallising disparate rulings on IBC proceedings to lay down the cardinal principle that concurrent approval by NCLT and NCLAT of a revival plan accepted by the CoC cannot be interfered with by SC unless the petitioner challlenging it establishes a perversity. The verdict in the Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd case appears to be in the teeth of SC rulings.Mehta said IBC proceedings were followed to the T and it was the decision of the CoC to approve the revival plan of successful resolution professional, which was concurrently upheld by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the appellate tribunal (NCLAT) leaving little scope for SC interference.""Liquidating a viable and profit-making entity will be in the interest of none and would create many difficulties for the creditors as well as the successful resolution applicant,"" he argued.Kaul said JSW has infused an additional Rs 8,000 crore apart from the Rs 20,000 crore, and the company is now in robust health nearly tripling its productions. It now employs 25,000 people in the revived plant.On May 26, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Sharma had stayed the liquidation process and ordered status quo after learning that petitions seeking review of the May 2 judgment are pending consideration.","Supreme Court annulls its May 2 judgment ordering liquidation of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd.

"Malegaon blast case: UAPA sanctions invalid, terror charge can't stick, rules court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malegaon-blast-case-uapa-sanctions-invalid-terror-charge-cant-stick-rules-court/articleshow/123029929.cms,"MUMBAI: Special trial judge A K Lahoti, in a key finding that led to the collapse of the Malegaon blast case , held that the prior sanction under the anti-terror law UAPA against the accused was ""invalid."" It was issued without judicious application of mind, and the mandatory twin test safeguard required by law was not scrupulously followed, the court said.The judge analysed Section 45 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), which outlines procedural safeguards. Section 45(1) requires valid sanction from the Centre or state govt to prosecute any terror offence under the Act. Section 45(2) mandates an independent review of the evidence by an authority appointed by the govt.Lt Col Prasad Purohit, through his counsel Shrikant Shivade (who passed away in 2022) and later advocate Viral Babar, had consistently argued that the UAPA sanction was flawed. Other accused also challenged the validity of the Jan 2009 sanction and another issued in 2011 by the additional chief secretary (home). The trial court held both sanctions to be ""defective.""While the prosecution claimed it had followed the twin test, the court said there was no evidence it was done as mandated under Section 45(2).""The sanction is not a curable defect. So, all the provisions of UAPA will not be invoked,"" the judge ruled.Advocates Ranjeet Sangle (for Sudhakar Dwivedi) and J P Mishra (for Sadhvi Pragya Singh) also argued that the first sanction bypassed the statutory safeguard under Section 45(2), and that the absence of such review invalidated the trial court's cognisance of UAPA charges.Special public prosecutor Avinash Rasal had contended that the sanction's validity could only be decided during the trial, a view echoed by the Supreme Court in 2018.However, the special judge reviewed the sanctioning procedure and found that UAPA charges could not be sustained due to the faulty sanction. Shivade had also pointed out that the authority did not comply with the mandatory safeguard of an additional review committee required under law since Dec 31, 2008.The prosecution argued that since the crime occurred in Sept 2008, the earlier 2004 provision-without the second review-was applicable. But the Supreme Court clarified in 2023 that the UAPA's procedural safeguards during sanction are mandatory.","Special trial judge A K Lahoti held that the prior sanction under the anti- terror law UAPA against the accused was ""invalid"" It was issued without judicious application of mind, and the mandatory twin test safeguard required by law was not scrupulously followed, the court said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123029934,imgsize-744366,width-400,resizemode-4/123029934.jpg"

BAREILLY: An IAS officer, who once survived seven bullets after exposing a Rs 100-crore scam, was transferred within 36 hours of taking charge as sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Shahjahanpur's Powayan. The move came on Monday, hours after Rinku Singh Rahi hit the headlines once again - this time for performing sit-ups before a group of lawyers and cancelling two unpublicised land auctions.A video of the ""uthak-baithak"" was shared on social media. Rahi believes it may have cost him the post. Shahjahanpur DM Dharmendra Pratap Singh, however, told TOI, ""Rahi's transfer was initiated by the state govt and I have no idea about the precise reason behind it.""The auctions involved rights to village fish ponds and cattle shed land in Simra Viran. They were scheduled without public announcements, he said, a technical omission that could prevent fair bidding. ""More people deserve the chance to participate in such auctions. My decision may have upset some people,"" Rahi, a 2022 batch IAS officer, said.On the same day, he directed revenue officers to identify encroachments on govt land and issue notices.""If no notice is issued within 15 days, an FIR will be filed against the lekhpal concerned,"" he warned. He also planned to digitise tehsil-level records, including court proceedings and document submissions. ""People shouldn't have to file RTIs to get basic information,"" he said.After landing in the town for his latest posting, he proposed creating two WhatsApp groups in every village - one to allow residents to report absentee officials, and another to post complaints and their responses openly. ""I had already done this in Mathura as a provincial civil services officer. This is not innovation. This is basic administration.""But it was the sit-ups on Monday that drew public attention. After asking a clerk to do sit-ups for urinating in the open, Rahi himself performed sit-ups in front of lawyers at the tehsil premises after they pointed out filthy public toilets. ""I took responsibility because I was the senior-most officer. If seniors lead by example, systems improve,"" he said. Asked whether the video led to his transfer, he said, ""Could be. ""He added: ""I will serve wherever I'm posted. I'll not tolerate wrongdoing.""In 2008, as a provincial civil service officer in Muzaffarnagar, he exposed irregular transfers of social welfare funds. ""When I refused bribes and kept digging, I was warned,"" he said. On March 26, 2009, while playing badminton, he was shot in the face. The attack left him blind in one eye, with a bullet fragment lodged in his skull. ""I lost everything except the will to fight,"" he said.Four years later, in 2012, after being denied promotion, he staged a dharna outside the social welfare directorate in Lucknow. Police forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric facility. A decade later, he cleared the UPSC exam under the physically challenged category at age 40, secured all-India rank 683, and joined the 2022-batch IAS under the Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) quota, UP cadre.His tenure in Shahjahanpur lasted less than two days. His plans, he said, were simple: open the system to scrutiny, restore accountability, and make governance participatory.","Rinku Singh Rahi once survived seven bullets after exposing a Rs 100-crore scam.

Trump's rant against India undercuts claim of having used trade to broker Operation Sindoor truce with Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trumps-rant-against-india-undercuts-claim-of-having-used-trade-to-broker-operation-sindoor-truce-with-pakistan/articleshow/123005683.cms,"NEW DELHI: When he lashed out at India for not lowering tariffs for American businesses, US President Donald Trump undercut the claim he has incessantly made: that on May 10, the Modi govt caved in to his threat of not doing trade with India if it did not pause Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. He had also suggested that India would get a good deal for its compliance.Trump's outburst on Truth Social on Wednesday conflicted with his claim of having frog marched India to cease Operation Sindoor by dangling the threat of stopping trade.Interestingly, the 'all things not good' admission from the US president, who has earned the reputation of being the global scold because of his petulance and pugnacity, came on a day when the two Houses of Parliament concluded a debate on Operation Sindoor that was dominated by Trump's claim of having mediated the suspension of hostilities.Also read: India-US trade deal: Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on India - top developments On Tuesday, PM Modi had refuted Trump's claim, saying no global leader had asked him to cease the offensive, and that it was the sheer ferocity of the IAF strikes on Pakistan's airbases that led Islamabad to sue for peace on May 10. That was getting as close as an Indian PM could get to accuse the US president of inexactitude.External affairs minister S Jaishankar went a step further on both Tuesday and Wednesday, stating that Trump and Modi did not talk between April 22 and June 16 when in a telephonic conversation, Modi had rebutted the suggestion that the operation against Pakistan was ceased because of anyone's mediation.In a significant decision, the Modi govt got foreign secretary Vikram Misri to let out details of the conversation. India has also consistently rebutted Trump's claim that trade was a factor in India's decision to stop attacking Pakistan after May 10.","Trump's outburst on Truth Social on Wednesday conflicted with his claim of having frog marched India to cease Operation Sindoor by dangling the threat of stopping trade.

Carter Hart may not be getting a chance with the Edmonton Oilers. NHL insider Frank Seravalli said on July 28, 2025, that the team is not interested in signing the goalie. Hart and four other players were part of the Hockey Canada Five case. Although they were found not guilty in court, the NHL has said the five players cannot play for now. Seravalli called Hart a “non‑starter” for the Oilers and said the league will review the case before making a final decision.Justice Maria Sarroccia ruled last week in Ontario’s King’s Court that Carter Hart and four teammates were not guilty in the Hockey Canada Five case. The players had faced sexual assault charges from a 2018 incident in London, Ontario. The judge said the complainant, known as E.M., gave consent and that parts of her story were not credible.Despite the verdict, the NHL told teams the players remain ineligible to sign until the commissioner’s office finishes its review. Frank Seravalli discussed this on TSN in Toronto on July 28. On the same day, Bob Stauffer, who hosts the Oilers Now show in Edmonton, asked fans and guests if the Oilers should sign any of the cleared players.Stauffer has raised this question several times since the ruling.On July 29, Stauffer invited former NHL agent and GM Brian Lawton to the show. Lawton said, “Canada feels divided over this. Half think the players did something horrible, half think they were cleared and should move on with their lives.” He added that the players may find it easier to sign with a U.S. team where hockey is less in the public eye.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers Face Uncertainty As Connor McDavid Eyes Short-Term NHL Contract Extension At Potential Record Salary The Oilers have a history of second chances.

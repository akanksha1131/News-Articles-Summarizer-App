NEW DELHI: Congress leader Pawan Khera on Wednesday launched a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , invoking US President Donald Trump ’s repeated claims -- including the latest one -- that he mediated a peaceful agreement between India and Pakistan after India's retaliatory strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.Targeting PM Modi over Trump's latest remarks about brokering a ceasefire, Khera said, ""Trump is coiled around Modi like a snake. And yesterday, Rahul Gandhi handed him the perfect chance to wriggle out of the mess. Just say Trump was lying about the ceasefire. Simple, right? But no. Modi is allergic to taking Rahul ji’s advice. And voilà, today the snake is back, coiled tighter than ever, hissing bitter truths into Modi’s ear.""Trump, in his most recent comments on India, also mentioned the anticipated trade deal between the US and India. While answering questions on high tariffs imposed by India, Trump said, ""Yeah, I think so. India is my friend. They ended the war with Pakistan at my request...The deal with India is not finalised. India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country...""Just a day earlier, during the Operation Sindoor debate in Lok Sabha, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had accused the PM Modi- led government of using the military operation to protect the Prime Minister's image.He further challenged PM Modi to call Trump a ""liar"" in Parliament, over the latter's repeated claims of using trade leverage to end the India-Pakistan conflict. ""If Narendra Modi has even 50 per cent of the courage of Indira Gandhi, he should declare in the House that Trump is lying about the ceasefire,"" Rahul Gandhi said.In Parliament, PM Modi responded firmly, saying that no foreign leader had asked India to halt Operation Sindoor, thereby directly countering Trump’s repeated remarks. ""No world leader asked for suspension of Operation Sindoor,"" the PM said.

The Indian American author, who became the prize's youngest-ever winner in 2006 with her second novel 'The Inheritance of Loss', is now among 13 writers vying for the literary trophy.Her mother Anita Desai - with whom she shares an inheritance, not of loss but of fine storytelling - has been shortlisted for the Booker thrice but never won. After her win, Kiran acknowledged the debt: ""I wrote this book so much in my mother's company that it feels almost like her book.' While the two craft very different literary landscapes, they do have many things in common, including the habit of escaping to Mexican villages to write. The 88-year-old Anita's last novella 'Rosarita', which released last year, was also set in Mexico.Kiran's longlisted 'The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny' which will be out in Sept, has taken almost two decades to take shape. By her own admission, she writes slowly, piecing her novels together like a jigsaw puzzle. Going by the promos, the storyline seems almost filmi: a love story about two young people who first see each other on a train.But, as always, she remains conscious of her role in the wider world, exploring themes like migration, modernity, and the complicated bonds that link one generation to the next.""Intimate in its details, epic in its reach,"" is how Manasi Subramaniam, editor-in-chief at Penguin Random House India, describes it.

NEW DELHI: A five-judge constitution bench of the SC led by CJI B R Gavai on Tuesday fixed a nine-day schedule to deliberate on a Presidential Reference that has questioned the SC’s power to fix timelines for the President and Governors on granting, refusing and withholding assent to Bills passed by Assemblies.The bench of CJI Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said the hearing would commence from Aug 19, when it will first hear senior advocates K K Venugopal and A M Singhvi on behalf of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, respectively, on the states’ preliminary objections to maintainability of the Reference.It said those opposing the reference, represented by Kapil Sibal, Rakesh Dwivedi, Gopal Subramaniam, would be given four days – Aug 19, 20, 21 and 26 - to complete their arguments. Those supporting the Reference – attorney general R Venkataramani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta – would place their response to maintainability plea as well as the constitutional issues warranting the Reference on Aug 28, Sep 2, 3 and 9.It reserved Sep 10 for rejoinders by parties and clarified that under no circumstance would the schedule be breached and told lawyers to arrange time-schedule for their arguments through prior consultation.It appointed advocate Aman Mehta as the nodal counsel for those supporting Reference and Misha Rohatgi as one for opposers.“The nodal counsel in consultation with lawyers shall arrange the timetable for the arguing counsel so that the hearing could be completed on Sep 10. The timetable will be followed scrupulously,” the CJI-led bench forewarned.TOI was first to report on May 15 about the President sending a Reference to the SC for its opinion on the contentious issue of judiciary stepping into the domain of the executive, especially when the Constitution gave no power to the SC to grant deemed assent on behalf of the Governor to Bills.Critical of the SC’s Apr 8 judgment and use of its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 Bills pending with the TN governor to be deemed to have been assented to, the President had said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the Governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the Governor”.The Reference had said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to Governors and the President respectively, “does not stipulate any time frame or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a Bill passed by an Assembly. The Reference has sought the SC’s opinion on 14 questions.Without any express provision in the Constitution, A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on Apr 8 had set a three-month deadline for the Governor to either grant or return the Bill to the House. If the Bill is re-passed by the House and resent to him, then the governor must grant assent within a month, the SC had ruled. It had also fixed a three-month deadline for the President to decide whether to grant or refuse assent to a Bill.","A five-judge constitution bench of the SC led by CJI B R Gavai on Tuesday fixed a nine-day schedule to deliberate on a Presidential Reference.

""How can one find closure when she lies scattered like that?"" asked Mohammed Koya, kin to the Panakkadan family.One year has passed since a rain-triggered landslide on July 30 turned Chooralmala and Mundakkai into ghost villages in Kerala's Wayanad.

He owned 11 rental shop units and plantation land, including a 2-acre cardamom plot. All of it now lies buried or abandoned. With dialysis thrice a week and Rs 14 lakh in unpaid loans, Aboobacker said: ""Now I depend on others to survive.""The fight is not against rubble - it's against time, fatigue and fading attention.

Microsoft has responded to the criticism that it fired American employees to hire foreign cheap labor saying that H-1B applications are no way related to the recent job eliminations and many employees on H-1Bs also lost their jobs. The statement comes amid an intense debate over Microsoft's announcement of 9,000 layoffs while the company reportedly made 4712 applications for H-1Bs.“Our H-1B applications are in no way related to the recent job eliminations in part because employees on H-1B’s also lost their roles. In the past 12 months, 78% of the petitions we filed were extensions for existing employees and not new employees coming to the U.S.,” the company said in a statement emailed to CFO Dive by a spokesperson.Vice President JD Vance recently slammed Microsoft and he said it makes no sense to him that companies fire Americans and then claim that they can't find workers in America and bring in foreign workers. ""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me,"" he said.""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bulls**t story,"" he said.The H-1B visa program that allows companies to hire foreign workers has emerged as a contentious issue while the Donald Trump administration is planning a major overhaul of the program.

No India-US Trade Deal Before August 1?

India-US trade deal stalemate: Ahead of his self-imposed tariff deadline, US President Donald Trump has said that a trade agreement with India has not yet been finalized. “India trade deal not been finalized,” said Trump. Asked whether India would face 20-25% tariff rates, he said, ""Yeah, I think so. India is my friend. They ended the war with Pakistan at my request...The deal with India is not finalised. India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country..."". However, he cautioned that the tariff rate has not yet been decided as negotiations continue.Trump’s remarks come just days ahead of the August 1, 2025 reciprocal tariff deadline. In the last few weeks Trump had said that the US is ‘nearing’ a deal with India. The likelihood of an interim trade deal announcement before the deadline appears slim for now.Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that India is preparing for a temporary reciprocal tariff rate ranging between 20-25%. India anticipates facing elevated US tariffs on certain export items as an interim arrangement, two officials from the Indian government told the news agency.""Talks are progressing well, and a delegation is expected in Delhi by mid-August,"" one of the Indian government officials said, adding that President Donald Trump could issue a tariff letter imposing duties of 20 or 25% in a ""worst-case scenario"".""However, we assume it would be a temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place.

Earth is about to witness a close celestial visitor as asteroid 2025 OL1 approaches our planet. Roughly the size of a small aircraft, measuring about 110 feet in diameter, this space rock will make its closest pass on July 30, 2025. Travelling at an impressive speed of 16,904 miles per hour, it will safely skim past Earth at a distance of approximately 1.29 million kilometres. Astronomers emphasise that tracking such asteroids helps improve planetary defense, enabling early detection and response to potential future cosmic collision threats. Though this event may sound alarming, NASA assures that the asteroid poses no threat. This flyby underscores the critical need for continuous monitoring of near-Earth objects and the evolving strategies by agencies like NASA and ISRO to defend our planet.At roughly 110 feet in diameter, asteroid 2025 OL1 is about the length of a small passenger plane. Moving at a rapid speed of nearly 17,000 miles per hour, it covers the vast distance between Earth and its orbit quickly but safely. Although over a million kilometres away at closest approach, this flyby is significant because it offers scientists a chance to study an asteroid up close, better understand its trajectory, and refine detection techniques for future near-Earth objects.NASA’s latest observations confirm that asteroid 2025 OL1 will not come close enough to endanger Earth. To be classified as potentially hazardous, an asteroid must pass within 7.4 million kilometres of our planet and be at least 85 metres wide. While 2025 OL1 meets the size criterion, its closest approach of 1.29 million kilometres keeps it well outside the danger zone. Despite its harmless status, scientists remain vigilant, closely tracking the asteroid’s path for any changes caused by gravitational forces or other influences. This careful observation helps maintain our preparedness against any unexpected shifts.India’s space agency, ISRO, remains deeply involved in planetary defense initiatives. Chairman S. Somanath has emphasized the importance of preparing for asteroid threats, particularly focusing on larger objects like the asteroid Apophis, which is expected to pass Earth in 2029. ISRO aims to collaborate with other space agencies such as NASA, ESA, and JAXA to improve detection capabilities and develop technologies capable of deflecting potentially hazardous asteroids. These partnerships and upcoming missions underscore the growing global commitment to protecting Earth from cosmic dangers.Although asteroid impacts are rare, their potential consequences can be devastating. Events like the flyby of 2025 OL1 serve as reminders of the importance of continued vigilance. Space is filled with countless near-Earth objects (NEOs) that silently traverse the solar system. Most pass by unnoticed, but tracking those that come close enables scientists to predict their paths and prepare contingency plans. The data gathered from each observation enhances our ability to forecast future encounters and develop asteroid mitigation strategies, safeguarding our planet’s future.While the asteroid 2025 OL1’s passage on July 30 will be peaceful and pose no danger, it highlights the need for ongoing surveillance. Global space agencies maintain round-the-clock monitoring systems, using powerful telescopes and satellites to watch the skies. Each asteroid flyby improves our understanding of these celestial neighbors and informs defense tactics. As technology advances, missions designed to test asteroid deflection methods may one day protect Earth from potential threats. Until then, experts keep watch, reminding us to look up with curiosity—and caution.","Asteroid 2025 OL1 will make its closest pass on July 30, 2025.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in India's remarkable draw at Old Trafford? Washington Sundar's performance Ravindra Jadeja's contribution Team's ability to absorb pressure England's missed opportunities

“Grateful for the people, and forever grateful to you, God,” wrote Washington Sundar on X after scoring his maiden Test hundred — a composed, unbeaten 101* that helped India pull off a dramatic draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford.The 25-year-old all-rounder’s quiet gratitude came after a loud statement on the field, where he and Ravindra Jadeja (107) batted through the final phase of Day 5 to rescue India from what once looked like certain defeat. Reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings, India needed a miracle. They found it in the form of a rock-solid batting effort, with Shubman Gill (103) and KL Rahul (90) also playing key roles.The final session was filled with tension — England’s frustration began to show, especially after Jadeja launched a six off Harry Brook to reach his hundred. In a curious moment, Brook stepped forward with a handshake offer, seemingly looking to wrap up the game.But Sundar , just short of his own milestone, ignored the gesture and carried on. The image of Brook’s puzzled smile and Sundar’s calm focus summed up the psychological edge India held at the end.This was just the second draw for England in 40 Tests under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, which was a rare occurrence in their aggressive ‘Bazball’ era. But it was a deserved result for India, whose batters absorbed immense pressure to ensure the series stays alive at 2-1.With the possibility of leveling the series still on the line, the stage is set for a cracking finale at The Oval. But for now, Sundar’s words and his resolve linger as the high point of a chaotic final day.",Washington Sundar scored 101* to help India draw 4th Test at Old Trafford. Ravindra Jadeja (107) and Shubman Gill (103) also made centuries. England were reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings.

He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders.

SC questions age restriction for surrogacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-questions-age-restriction-for-surrogacy/articleshow/122985706.cms,"If couple in their 50s, 60s can adopt, why can't they have surrogate child, asks SC

NEW DELHI: Questioning the restrictions under surrogacy laws, including age limit on intended parents and surrogate mothers, Supreme Court Tuesday said laws shouldn't frustrate the wish of childless couples, widows and divorcees to become parents through surrogacy. Instead, the laws should frustrate commercial surrogacy.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan said present laws seem ""harsh"" to those wanting to take the surrogacy route to parenthood. The bench is examining provisions of Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 and the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021.The laws set age limits for intended parents and surrogate mothers. An intended mother must be aged between 23 and 50, and the intended father between 26 and 55 years. Further, a surrogate mother must be married and between 25 and 35 years of age, have a biological child, and only act as a surrogate once in her lifetime.Laws allow single women (widowed or divorced) between ages 35 and 45 to pursue surrogacy. Appearing for the govt, additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati defended the provisions, saying the age bar was needed to ensure a child's welfare and to prevent commercial surrogacy.She said the limits were also set keeping in mind the genetic quality of gametes and urged the court to refrain from passing an interim order.The bench, however, said rationality was lacking in the provision and asked why a single woman could not go for surrogacy. ""If she is a widow or a divorcee then she needs it more. Look at the void in her life... Rationality and object are absent. Look how harsh it is,"" the bench observed. It said if a couple in their 50s and 60s can adopt, then why can't they have a surrogate child.SC reserved its order on a plea of three petitioners, seeking its approval to go for surrogacy as they are age barred. They submitted that the laws came into force in 2022 but they started the process much earlier as they froze their embryo in 2012 and 2016, and that they should be allowed to pursue. Bhati argued that there were multiple reasons for freezing embryos, and it might not just be for surrogacy.""Crystallisation of rights happens on implantation of the embryo in the uterus and not just on freezing of embryos,"" the ASG submitted. She said there are a large number of embryos that might have been frozen earlier but they cannot claim exemption from the law. The court, thereafter, reserved its order on the plea but hinted that it would protect only those who initiated the process before the laws came into force.In one of the cases, the wife is 58 years old and the husband is 64.In the second case, the wife is 53 and the husband 56. Multiple petitions have been filed challenging various provisions of the Acts. One of the petitioners submitted that the laws were discriminatory as it barred a single woman from surrogacy.""The restrictions are wholly discriminatory and without any rational or reason behind it inasmuch as the said restriction is not only infringing fundamental rights of the petitioner, but also violative of the basic human rights of an individual to found a family as recognised by the UN and reproductive rights, which have been recognised as an aspect of personal liberty under Article 21,"" the plea said.","Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan said present laws seem ""harsh"" to those wanting to take the surrogacy route to parenthood.

Mystery over ghost litigant in SC deepens as 3rd lawyer distances himself from case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-over-ghost-litigant-in-sc-deepens-as-3rd-lawyer-distances-himself-from-case/articleshow/122984613.cms,"NEW DELHI: The mystery around a 'ghost litigant' in Supreme Court deepened further as the third lawyer whose name appeared in the order sheet for the litigant told the court Tuesday that he was not involved in any way in the case and did not know how his name cropped up. Suspecting the role of some outsider and not lawyers, the bar associations sought a police inquiry and forensic examination of documents to catch the culprit which the apex court agreed to consider.In this murky case, a litigant managed to get a favourable order from SC after he propped up a 'ghost' opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for the top court to quash orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant. Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before SC.The names of four lawyers were mentioned in the order out of which three are known names in the field of litigation but no one had heard of the fourth advocate. It came to light that the lawyer who allegedly represented the fake party did not practice law any more and he and his daughter, whose name was also there, were not even aware of the case.The court, thereafter, directed the third lawyer to appear before it.Appearing before a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar, advocate Ratan Lal told the court that he did not do anything and he had nothing to do with the case. As all three lawyers refused their involvement in the case and the fourth lawyer remains untraced, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and Supreme Court Advocates On-Record Association (SCAORA) told the bench that lawyers were not involved in the wrongdoing.SCAORA president Vipin Nair said an inquiry was needed in the case and who would conduct it was very important. ""The blame or charge of any wrongdoing can't be straightaway ascribed to AOR or lawyers since the pleadings indicate that the possibility of the petitioner engaging in fabrication can't be ruled out. A thorough enquiry is therefore necessary,"" Nair told the bench.It was also argued police should be asked to hold an inquiry. The court, after a brief hearing, said it would consider all aspects and pass an order. SC had in Dec passed the order after the 'compromise agreement' was placed before it and the order sheet of that day mentioned the names of the four advocates.",A litigant managed to get a favourable order from SC after he propped up a 'ghost' opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner.

The ministry seeks to understand the root causes behind this development.The matter is significant as TCS, India's premier IT services company, plans to reduce its workforce by 12,261 employees, representing two per cent of its global staff this year, with middle and senior management positions bearing the majority of the impact.As of 30 June 2025, TCS employed 6,13,069 people, having added 5,000 new staff during the April-June quarter.The company announced on Sunday that this restructuring aligns with their strategy to become a ""future-ready organisation"", emphasising technological investments, AI implementation, market growth, and workforce reorganisation.""TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation. This includes strategic initiatives on multiple fronts, including investing in new-tech areas, entering new markets, deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves, deepening our partnerships, creating next-gen infrastructure, and realigning our workforce model,"" it said as quoted by PTI.""Towards this, a number of reskilling and redeployment initiatives have been underway. As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2 per cent of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year,"" the statement further read.The company stated it would provide appropriate benefits, outplacement services, counselling, and support to affected employees.Meanwhile, the Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) has approached Union Minister for Labour and Employment Mansukh Mandaviya, urging the government to issue a notice to TCS seeking an explanation for the company's recent decision to terminate 12,000 jobs this year.Read more: TCS layoffs prompt NITES to write to Labour Minister; IT employee union wants stay on 12,000 job losses The IT employees' union has described TCS' latest move as unethical, inhumane, and outright illegal. ""The law clearly states that no employee who has served for over a year can be retrenched unless the company provides one month's notice or wages in lieu, pays statutory retrenchment compensation, and notifies the govt. TCS has not complied with any of these legal requirements,"" NITES alleged, terming the action a blatant and wilful violation of the law.NITES also highlighted the devastating impact of the layoffs, stating that thousands of working professionals with families, EMIs, and financial commitments would suddenly lose their livelihood. ""The psychological, emotional, and financial trauma of this move is unimaginable,"" Harpreet Singh Saluja, President of NITES, wrote in the letter.The union further contended that TCS' actions cannot be justified as restructuring.

NEW DELHI: India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution, amid renewed international efforts to end the Gaza war. According to a list of delegates, 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday that will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, both key strategic partners for India.India had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","Despite US warnings against participation, India hopes the conference will pave the way for concrete steps towards a two-state solution. 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday.

Trade Outlook: A Deal Waiting to Happen?

With the 2025-26 NBA season approaching and theretooling for a serious title push, one key veteran could find himself on the trade block. According to a report by Devon Platana, forwardmay be the most likely Laker to be moved before opening night, as the franchise evaluates its options under the constraints of the salary cap.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ offseason moves have reshaped the team’s identity. Key acquisitions — including Deandre Ayton, Marcus Smart, and Jake LaRavia — have significantly improved head coach JJ Redick’s depth chart. But as the team eyes additional roster upgrades, especially on the wings, financial flexibility becomes a necessity.Given the Lakers’ current cap situation, further additions will likely require a trade, and Vanderbilt’s name continues to surface as a logical piece to be moved.Jarred Vanderbilt, acquired by the Lakers during the 2022-23 season, has had a turbulent tenure in Los Angeles. Known for his defensive versatility and hustle, his potential has been overshadowed by an ongoing struggle with injuries.Vanderbilt has only played in 65 regular-season contests and five playoff games since the beginning of the 2023-24 season, raising concerns about his reliability. Despite his effort on the court, availability remains a major issue. Jarred Vanderbilt is currently under contract for approximately $24 million over the next two seasons, and holds a $13.2 million player option for 2027-28. For a player who hasn’t been consistently available, this is a significant cap hit — especially for a team looking to compete at the highest level.Offloading Vanderbilt’s deal could open doors for the Lakers to pursue a more durable and productive veteran wing — a position that remains an area of need.Whether used in a straight salary dump or as part of a multi-player deal for a proven contributor, Vanderbilt’s expiring deal and defensive skill set could still be appealing to certain teams. However, his durability issues may limit the Lakers’ leverage in negotiations.As Devon Platana puts it: “He just isn’t the player L.A. needs him to be.” That statement encapsulates the shift in perception around Vanderbilt — from valuable rotation piece to trade candidate.The NBA offseason has already featured surprise trades, and Jarred Vanderbilt could be the next domino to fall. With the Lakers aggressively looking to maximize LeBron James’ and Anthony Davis’ remaining prime years, every roster spot matters. If Vanderbilt is unable to prove his durability before the season begins, his time in Los Angeles may indeed be coming to an end.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Potentially Eyeing Reunion With $2,291,897 Toronto Raptors Center to support LeBron James and Luka Donic As the summer progresses, expect the Lakers to explore all options — and that includes potentially saying goodbye to a familiar face in Jarred Vanderbilt.","Los Angeles Lakers forward Jarred Vanderbilt is under contract for $24 million over the next two seasons.

Dallas Mavericks’ Motivation: Now or Never?

Los Angeles Lakers’ Perspective: Holding the Cards

My Verdict on the Trade

Thehave emerged as a dark horse in thesweepstakes, with new reports suggesting that the team is seriously evaluating the possibility of acquiring the four-time NBA champion. Though LeBron has opted into the final year of his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, The Athletic’s John Hollinger revealed that James showed serious interest in joining Dallas before making that decision.According to Bleacher Report’s Dan Favale, “Are we just supposed to believe he’s no longer intrigued by the prospect of reuniting with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving?”—a question that points to the ongoing intrigue surrounding the potential formation of a new super team in Texas.The idea of LeBron James playing alongside Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving is more than just fantasy. It’s grounded in both basketball chemistry and off-court relationships. James has previously expressed admiration for both stars, and his history with Irving is well documented—from their championship run in Cleveland to an up-and-down but ultimately successful on-court partnership.For Dallas, the potential acquisition of LeBron would be less about age and more about capitalizing on a small window.Even at 40, James averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, and 7.3 rebounds in the 2023-24 season. His impact goes beyond numbers—his leadership, playoff experience, and basketball IQ are unmatched.Despite the appeal, Dallas faces serious logistical challenges. LeBron’s $52.7 million salary for the 2024-25 season is the first hurdle. While offseason rules allow teams to exceed the non-taxpayer mid-level exception to acquire buyout players, that doesn’t apply in this case since James is under contract.To make a deal work, the Dallas Mavericks would need to offload a significant portion of their roster. That could mean surrendering four to five players, as well as including draft capital.And even this framework may not be enough unless a third or fourth team is looped in to absorb salary or provide additional assets. The Lakers , meanwhile, are unlikely to take back long-term salary, as they are believed to be pursuing future cap space aggressively.What makes this pursuit different is Dallas’ sense of urgency. Coming off a Finals loss and looking to maximize Anthony Davis’ remaining years, the Mavericks are clearly open to high-stakes, high-reward moves. Pairing Anthony with LeBron and Kyrie could create one of the most formidable offensive trios in NBA history, if not the most experienced.Still, LeBron entering his age-41 season raises concerns. There’s no guarantee that the 20-time All-Star will maintain his elite level of play deep into the next campaign. But for a franchise that hasn’t won a title since 2011, the gamble might be worth the upside.From the Lakers’ standpoint, letting go of LeBron James isn’t as simple as it looks. Though he’s near the end of his career, James remains their most valuable asset—on the court and in marketing. Trading him for a package of role players and picks might not align with the franchise’s long-term plans unless it frees them to land a major star or opens up cap flexibility.The Mavericks’ rumored interest in LeBron James is more than just smoke—it’s a calculated, if risky, pursuit of championship relevance. As Dan Favale notes, “Bringing in LeBron is one thing if he’s coming off a buyout… It is another venture entirely when you have to account for his $52.7 million salary.”Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Potentially Eyeing Reunion With $2,291,897 Toronto Raptors Center to support LeBron James and Luka Donic Whether Dallas can pull off this blockbuster remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the Mavericks are not content to stand still. And in the unpredictable landscape of the NBA offseason, that might just be enough to make something happen.","The Dallas Mavericks have emerged as a dark horse in the LeBron James sweepstakes.

'Pakistan trying same tactic as Hamas': Former Pentagon official on Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-trying-same-tactic-as-hamas-former-pentagon-official-on-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120570167.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former US Pentagon official Michael Rubin on Thursday said that the recent attack in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pahalgam was akin to the October 7 attacks in Israel by militant outfit Hamas .Rubin claimed that Pakistanis were trying the same tactic as Hamas to attack a specific religion and specifically ""the most liberal"" amongst them.""That is exactly what went on when the October 7th, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. It was directed specifically against Jews, and not only against Jews, but among the most liberal Jews who were most prone to wanting peace and normalcy with the Gaza Strip,"" Rubin said.""Targeting a vacation resort, middle-class Hindus, it is evident that the Pakistanis are trying the same tactic now. It should be no more successful for Pakistan than it was for Hamas,"" he added.Rubin also called upon India to plan an Israel-style retaliation against Pakistan and wipe out the leadership of the ISI.""And frankly, it's now the duty of India to do to Pakistan and to Pakistan's ISI what Israel did to Hamas. It's time to wipe out the leadership of the ISI, to treat them as a designated terror group, and demand that every country that is an ally of India, every country that is an ally of the world's largest democracy, do the same,"" the former Pentagon official said.Earlier, former Jammu and Kashmir Police chief Shesh Paul Vaid also claimed that the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam was a ""Pulwama 2.0 moment"" and said that India must respond back with something like how Israel reacts to Hamas' salvos.While talking to news agency ANI, Vaid said that the terrorist attack at the picnic spot in Pahalgam was similar to the October 7 attack carried out by Palestine's terror outfit Hamas in Israel.""This was a Hamas-style attack on 7 October on Israel. It's not a coincidence that Asim Munir (Pakistan Army chief) uttered illogical words two days back, and then such an attack takes place where the religion of the tourists was asked,"" the former DGP said.""Our response should be appropriate, something like how Israel responded,"" he added.Intelligence sources have also pointed to multiple visits by senior Hamas functionaries to Pakistan over the past year.A Hamas team recently visited Jaish-e-Muhammed’s headquarters in Bahawalpur besides a Pakistani Army facility, which houses their combat simulation centre, inaugurated by Army chief Asim Munir last month. The area hosts the Bahawalpur Corps, a Pakistani military formation tasked with border defence and rapid deployment due to its strategic proximity to Rajasthan.At least 28 people were killed after terrorists opened fire on a group of tourists in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. The gruesome terror attack in Pahalgam is one of the biggest terror attacks after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army fatigues identified their victims by faith, asking them to tell their names and recite Islamic verses before spraying bullets on them from close range.Gunmen struck around 1:30 pm in Baisaran meadow — about 7 km from Pahalgam and reachable either by foot or by horses — as scores of tourists were enjoying a regular afternoon, surrounded by snow-capped peaks and pine forests. Pahalgam's meadow is a top sightseeing spot that draws hundreds of visitors daily. Heavy security presence, including checkpoints and armed patrols, provided a sense of security.","Former US Pentagon official Michael Rubin on Thursday said that the recent attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam was akin to the October 7 attacks in Israel by militant outfit Hamas.

Pahalgam terror attack: What is Indus Water Treaty and how will its suspension impact Pakistan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-terror-attack-what-is-indus-water-treaty-and-how-will-its-suspension-impact-pakistan/articleshow/120557713.cms,"What is Indus Waters Treaty?



How does the Indus Waters Treaty works?



Why was the treaty needed?



How will Indus Water Treaty suspension impact Pakistan?



The Indus River network, comprising the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, serves as Pakistan's principal water resource, supporting a population of tens of millions.

The treaty will impact Pakistan as it receives about 80% of the total water flow, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan, especially in the provincesof Punjab and Sindh.

Pakistan relies substantially on this water supply for irrigation, farming and potable water.

The agricultural sector contributes 23% to Pakistan's national income and supports 68% of its rural inhabitants.

The Indus basin supplies 154.3 million acre-feet of water yearly, which is vital for irrigating extensive agricultural areas and ensuring food security.

Any interruption to water flow would significantly impact Pakistan's agricultural sector, a crucial component of its economy and rural livelihoods.

Reduced water availability will likely lead to lower crop yields, food shortages, and economic instability in rural areas dependent on farming.

Pakistan already faces critical water management issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity.

issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity. The country’s water storage capacity is low, with major dams like Mangla and Tarbela having a combined live storage of only about 14.4 MAF, which is just 10% of Pakistan’s annual water share under the treaty.

The suspension exacerbates these vulnerabilities by cutting off a guaranteed water supply, leaving Pakistan with fewer options to manage its water needs.

NEW DELHI: India suspended the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan on Wednesday in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack . This move was one of five major decisions made during a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Indus Water Treaty (IWT), signed on September 19, 1960, between India and Pakistan, is seen as a key example of cross-border water-sharing.It was brokered by the World Bank after nine years of talks and signed by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan’s President Ayub Khan to manage shared rivers.According to the agreement, India has control over the eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—while Pakistan gets the waters from the western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.The treaty benefits Pakistan as it receives about 80% of the total water flow from these rivers, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan , especially in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh.According to the World Bank, the treaty set up a framework for fair and cooperative management of the Indus River system , which is essential for agriculture, drinking water, and industry in both India and Pakistan.It outlined clear guidelines for the equitable sharing of the river and its tributaries to ensure both nations could meet their water needs.The treaty gave India control over the eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—while Pakistan was given the western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.However, both countries are allowed limited use of the rivers assigned to the other for specific purposes like irrigation and power generation.When British India was divided in 1947, the Indus River system—which starts in Tibet and flows through both India and Pakistan, also touching parts of Afghanistan and China—became a source of tension.In 1948, India temporarily stopped the flow of water to Pakistan, leading Pakistan to raise the issue with the United Nations.

Five key decisions taken at CSS meet

The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism .

. The integrated checkpost Attari will be closed with immediate effect. Those who have crossed over with valid endorsements may return through that route before 1st May 2025.

Pakistani nationals will not be permitted to travel to India under the SAARC visa Exemption scheme. Any SPES visas issued in the past to Pakistani nationals are deemed cancelled. Any Pakistani national currently in India under SPES visa has 48 hours to leave India.

The Defence, Military, Naval, and Air Advisors in the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi are declared persona non grata. They have a week to leave India.

India will be withdrawing its own Defence, Navy and Air advisors from the Indian high commission in Islamabad. These posts in the respective High Commissions are deemed annulled.

How will Indus Water Treaty suspension impact Pakistan?

The Indus River network, comprising the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, serves as Pakistan's principal water resource, supporting a population of tens of millions.

Pakistan relies substantially on this water supply for irrigation, farming and potable water. The agricultural sector contributes 23% to Pakistan's national income and supports 68% of its rural inhabitants.

The Indus basin supplies 154.3 million acre-feet of water yearly, which is vital for irrigating extensive agricultural areas and ensuring food security.

Any interruption to water flow would significantly impact Pakistan's agricultural sector, a crucial component of its economy and rural livelihoods.

Reduced water availability will likely lead to lower crop yields, food shortages, and economic instability in rural areas dependent on farming.

Pakistan already faces critical water management issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity.

The country’s water storage capacity is low, with major dams like Mangla and Tarbela having a combined live storage of only about 14.4 MAF, which is just 10% of Pakistan’s annual water share under the treaty.

The suspension exacerbates these vulnerabilities by cutting off a guaranteed water supply, leaving Pakistan with fewer options to manage its water needs.

How closing Attari border will impact trade?

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack , the central government on Wednesday suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan — one of five key decisions taken at the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""The CCS reviewed the overall security situation and directed all forces to maintain high vigil. It resolved that perpetrators of this attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account. As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror or conspired to make them possible,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misry.Attari, located just 28 kilometres from Amritsar, is India’s first Land Port and the only permitted land route for trade with Pakistan. Spread across 120 acres and directly connected to national highway-I, the check post has played a crucial role in cross-border trade, particularly in imports from Afghanistan.The Attari-Wagah corridor has witnessed fluctuating figures in trade and passenger movement over the years. In 2023-24, the land port recorded trade worth Rs 3,886.53 crore with 6,871 cargo movements and 71,563 passenger crossings.The Attari Land Port has long served as a critical trade conduit between India and Pakistan, handling a variety of goods. Key Indian exports through the route include soybean, chicken feed, vegetables, red chilies, plastic dana, and plastic yarn. On the other side, imports from Pakistan and beyond have largely comprised dry fruits, dry dates, gypsum, cement, glass, rock salt, and various herbs.The closure of the port is expected to significantly impact the movement of these goods, particularly affecting small traders and manufacturers who rely on this cross-border exchange. However, volumes have generally declined since 2018-19, reflecting ongoing tensions and disruptions.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh had assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.",The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.

The role of two Rawalkot-based Lashkar commanders, one of whom is Abu Musa, is also under scrutiny, sources said.On April 18, Musa organised an event in Rawalkot where he said, ""Jihad will continue, guns will rage and beheading will continue in Kashmir.

Many of the victims in Pahalgam were asked to recite the 'kalma' (Islamic phrase of declaration of faith), and those who could not were shot dead.TOI had reported last week that the Indian intelligence establishment viewed the anti-Hindu rhetoric as a calculated move - coinciding with protests against changes to the Waqf Act - to motivate Pakistan-based terrorists to regroup.The preliminary assessment of the intelligence agencies is that around sixterrorists, supported by local auxiliaries, carried out the attack. ""It seems the attackers arrived a few days prior to the attack, conducted reconnaissance, and then struck when they saw an opportunity. In early April (1-7), there were inputs that terrorists had conducted reconnaissance of some hotels.

The money raised through the sale of drugs, imported using valid channels and stored at warehouses in Neb Sarai and Alipur in Delhi, was then routed to LeT, they said, while alleging that petitioner Kabir Talwar, who is seeking bail, was part of the drug syndicate that facilitated the nefarious operation.In its affidavit, NIA said, “The narco-trafficker located in Afghanistan, through the help of Pakistan-based intelligence agency ISI and Iranian middlemen imported a large consignment of 2,988.2 kgs of narcotic drugs i.e. heroin, valued at Rs 21,000 crore through the same modus operandi, which consignment was sent from Afghanistan via Iran and which was imported in India concealed as talc powder. The proceeds of this sale was to be used for funding .”“This case is a case of largest intercepted consignment of narco- substance being brought to India through illicit means, which was to be used, not only, to wreak a havoc among public (which was the targeted user of the said narco-product) but also, to use the sale proceeds to fund terrorism,” NIA said.","National Investigation Agency (NIA) told Supreme Court that this was part of LeT’s narco-trafficking strategy.

Four murder convicts moved Supreme Court on Wednesday alleging that Jharkhand HC has not delivered verdicts in their appeals even though decisions were reserved three years ago.Appearing for the four appellants incarcerated for 16 to 11 years, advocate Fauzia Shakil informed a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh that they had filed appeals, one in 2012, two in 2014 and one in 2018, and Jharkhand HC had reserved verdicts in their cases in the months of Jan, April, May and June of 2022. Despite lapse of three years, verdicts are yet to be pronounced, she said.The bench took serious view of the lapse and issued notice to Jharkhand HC registrar general, asking him to furnish in 10 days details about the pending appeals, the judges who had heard the appeals and the years for which judgments have been reserved.SC can rectify or take remedial measures when HCs reserve verdicts for an unusually long period of time but could it do anything when a judgment gets reserved for months together by an SC bench?

NEW DELHI: Asserting that India will be unrelenting in its pursuit of those who commit terrorist attacks against the country, the govt announced a series of measures to impose costs on Islamabad for its support to cross-border terrorism , including the suspension of World Bank-backed Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) until Pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.The govt also shut down the Attari border with Pakistan in Amritsar, expelled the Pakistani air, navy and army advisors declaring them persona non grata and cut down the strength of the high commissions from the already downgraded 55 to 30. The posts of defence advisors were annulled by India and five support staff of the service advisors withdrawn from both high commissions. India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.After a CCS meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi, foreign secretary Vikram Misri also announced that Pakistani nationals will not be permitted to travel to India under the Saarc Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) visas. ""Any SVES visas issued in the past to Pakistani nationals are deemed cancelled. Any Pakistani national currently in India under SVES visa has 48 hours to leave India,'' he said. In the CCS meeting, Misri said, the cross-border linkages of the Pahalgam terrorist attack were brought out and was noted that this attack came in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.Speaking about India's response to the attack, which came in the middle of important Indian engagements with the US and Saudi Arabia, govt sources suggested the actions announced were only indicative and not exhaustive, as all options, including ""kinetic action"", remained on the table.In the absence of any substantive bilateral engagement with Pakistan for almost a decade, exchanges between the two countries had been limited to talks under the IWT framework for irrigation and hydropower development and cooperation at the SCO forum.India had not discontinued engagements under the IWT mainly because of the involvement of the World Bank, a co-signatory to the treaty, but it had twice issued notice to Pakistan in the recent past for a review and modification of the treaty. Last year, it cited the effect of persistent cross-border terror attacks as one of the reasons for seeking a review of the treaty.President Donald Trump in a conversation with Modi condemned the attack and offered full support for efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. The support for India from the international community so far has been overwhelming, with all countries, including China, condemning the attack Pakistan denied any link with the worst attack on civilians in India in years, choosing to describe it as ""home-grown"".Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif said the top civilian and military leadership will meet on Thursday to formulate an appropriate response to India's move to suspend the IWT and downgrade diplomatic ties. ""A session of the National Security Committee will be held under the chair of PM Shehbaz Sharif,"" he said. Misri said strong expressions of support and solidarity were received from many govts around the world, which unequivocally condemned the terror attack, and the CCS recorded its appreciation for such sentiments, which reflect zero tolerance for terrorism.""The CCS condemned the attack in the strongest terms and expressed its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and hoped for the early recovery of the injured,'' Misri said, adding that the CCS also reviewed the overall security situation and directed all forces to maintain high vigil. ""It resolved that the perpetrators of the attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account. As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror, or conspired to make them possible,"" Misri said.","India suspends World Bank-backed Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) until Pakistan abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.

NEW DELHI: In the winter of 2023, four soldiers were killed in action in J&K's Poonch and an unknown outfit named People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) claimed responsibility for the attack. Months later, it claimed responsibility for another attack in Gulmarg that had resulted in four deaths, including two soldiers from Rashtriya Rifles.In the summer of 2020, a fierce gunbattle broke out in Keran, leading to multiple casualties on both sides, and the terrorists claimed to be from The Resistance Front (TRF).Both outfits had not been heard of before, but their emergence failed to fool too many. It did not take long for Indian agencies to figure out they were offshoots of notorious outfits Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which had sought to camouflage their jihadi orientation by slipping into new sloughs.The tactical sleight of hand and rebranding of the outfits - LeT became TRF and JeM became PAFF - was prompted by the changed political landscape in J&K following abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.Rebadging has been an old practice with terrorist outfits but the switch this time to non-Islamist nomenclatures was prompted to curry favour with influential human rights groups in the West, which have been enamoured with claims of ""freedom struggle"", ""self-determination"" and ""resistance"" - in short ruses that terrorist groups employ to woo public opinion in foreign capitals.""With these seemingly innocuous monikers, groups like LeT and JeM cloaked their jihadist ideology and intensified terrorist activities in Kashmir, exploiting the rhetoric of resistance and rights to further their agenda and fuel violence, while also helping their chief backer Pakistan peddle their alibi about terrorism in J&K being a homegrown affair,"" said an officer from the security establishment.In this case, the additional motivation came from the blows that Indian security forces had inflicted on LeT and JeM while also squeezing their overground supporters, and as the two needed to rally their cadre.""By adopting monikers, both groups aimed at creating confusion among the people so that their support on the ground remained intact. This tactic, they assumed, would allow their new Mujahideens to maintain a low profile and help Pakistan avoid sanctions, and continue their nefarious activities without arousing suspicion,"" a senior intelligence officer said. Moreover, rebranding enabled them to reinvent their image, potentially appealing to new recruits and sympathisers who were deterred by their previous notoriety.The rebranding was also an attempt to evade global sanctions and dodge the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which had designated LeT as a terrorist organisation. International pressure also prompted Pakistan to pretend to take action against terrorist groups, and it had resorted to putting terrorist leaders under house arrest or imprisoning them.","In the winter of 2023, four soldiers were killed in action in J&K's Poonch.

There are a variety of military options, short of a full-blown war, on the table. It's for the political leadership to take the final call. If there is a go-ahead, then the retaliatory strikes will be at a time and place of our choosing,"" a senior military officer told TOI after a flurry of top-level meetings on Wednesday.The hard-nosed intent for cross-border retaliation , in keeping with the Modi govt's self-avowed muscular image on national security issues, was also evident when defence minister Rajnath Singh addressed an IAF event in the afternoon. There would be swift and strong action against not only the terrorists involved in the Pahalgam massacre, but also the orchestrators behind the scenes who conspired to carry out the heinous act on Indian soil, he said.There is realisation among the military brass here that Pakistan will not be caught off-guard like it was during the Balakot air strikes in Feb 2019 or the earlier ground-based ' surgical strikes ' to take out four ' terror launch pads ' across the Line of Control (LoC) in Sept 2016. With the well-equipped Pakistan military being no pushover, the pros and cons of every option, along with the escalation matrix, will have to be factored into the decision-making.Military officers, on their part, contend that ""carefully-calibrated precision air strikes"" against non-state targets by fighters like Rafales, Mirage-2000s and Sukhoi-30MKIs - armed with long-range weapons like the French 'Scalp' air-to-ground cruise missiles, Israeli Crystal Maze missiles and Spice-2000 precision guided penetration bombs - remain ""the best and most effective option"".""One can always achieve the element of surprise on Day-1 with airborne strikes. The day after the Balakot strikes, Pakistan managed to surprise the IAF with its 'Operation Swift Retort' because we let our guard down. Lessons have been learnt,"" another senior officer said.Govt will have to be fully prepared for escalation if it decides to go for air strikes. A less-escalatory tactical option will be to break the ongoing ceasefire with Pakistan along the 778-km LoC, which has largely held since it was renewed in Feb 2021. This will involve targeted firings by artillery guns and heavy mortars as well as concerted sniping and other such operations to disrupt their patrols in forward areas. ""All this can be very effective in raising the costs for the other side,"" an officer said.Then, there are shallow raids that can be conducted to destroy the makeshift terror launch pads that are generally located close to Pak army posts to ensure terrorists can cross the LoC in a single night. As per latest estimates, there are 110-120 terrorists present in 42 launch pads along the LoC, with 32 of them being south of the Pir Panjal range and 10 in the north. ""Terror launch pads close to LoC can be good targets,"" the officer said.If it comes to escalation, then the artillery barrages can be supplemented by longer-range standoff weapons like the 90-km range Smerch and 45-km Pinaka rocket systems and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose strike range has been extended to 450 km.",The hard-nosed intent for cross-border retaliation was also evident when defence minister Rajnath Singh addressed an IAF event in the afternoon. There is realisation among the military brass here that Pakistan will not be caught off- guard like it was during the Balakot air strikes in Feb 2019.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120563474,imgsize-1058543,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan's Taliban government on Thursday condemned the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 28 civilians were killed, stating that such incidents undermine regional security and stability.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Abdul Qahar Balkhi , the spokesman for the Taliban-run Afghan ministry of foreign affairs, expressed condolences to the families of the victims.“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan categorically condemns the recent attack on tourists in the Pahalgam region, and expresses condolences to the bereaved families,” Balkhi said.This comes at a time of strained relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have worsened since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. However, Kabul has continued to maintain that India is an ""important"" regional power.In January of this year, a meeting took place between Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister, Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, and Indian foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, in Dubai. During this meeting, the Afghan delegation assured India that Afghanistan posed no threat to any nation.","Afghanistan's Taliban government condemned the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 28 civilians were killed.

Had it been done, at least a temporary picket would have been set up in tourist spots like Pahalgam, particularly Baisaran that has been attracting a high number of tourists. Police presence would have been a deterrent and ensured quicker response even if the attack was attempted,"" said a senior officer of the security establishment.J&K police sources, however, pointed out that though the SOP is followed every time a foreign dignitary visits, there is no clarity if this should kick in only when heads of state visit or also, in the case of visits by their deputies.","J&K Police may have erred by not undertaking vulnerability mapping of terror- prone areas ahead of US Vice-President J D Vance's visit.

NEW DELHI: With parallels being drawn between the terrorist attack at the picnic spot in Pahalgam and the Oct 7 attack carried out by the terror outfit Hamas in Israel, intelligence sources have pointed to multiple visits by senior Hamas functionaries to Pakistan over the past year.A Hamas team recently visited Jaish-e-Muhammed’s headquarters in Bahawalpur besides a Pakistani Army facility, which houses their combat simulation centre, inaugurated by Army chief Asim Munir last month. The area hosts the Bahawalpur Corps, a Pakistani military formation tasked with border defence and rapid deployment due to its strategic proximity to Rajasthan.In Feb, top Lashkar-e-Taiba and JeM cadres gathered in Rawalakote, PoK, on ‘ Kashmir Solidarity Day ’ for a speech by senior Hamas functionaries, sources said. The gathering, organized under the banner of Al Aqsa Floods — a reference to the mosque in Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Jews and Muslims and has long been an inflammable point of discord — was addressed by Hamas spokesperson Khalid Qaddoumi. Agencies here viewed the event as an attempt to link their jihadi campaign in J&K with the Palestinian fight against Israel, framing both as a “resistance against occupation”.There have been clear indications of Hamas’s increased presence in Pakistan in the last one year, especially after its Oct 7 terror attack on Israel in 2023.Last year in Jan, Qaddoumi was invited to address Pakistan Parliament. Significantly, welcoming Qaddoumi, a Pakistani lawmaker had claimed that India and Israel had planned an economic corridor — the Indian Middle East Eurpean Corridor — aimed at countering the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). “That plan is now buried under the rubble of Gaza,” he gloated.Hamas leaders’ visit to Pakistan came soon after Ismail Haniyeh, the then chief of Hamas, had sought help from Pakistan in their fight against Israel. When Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, prompting Pakistan to declare a national day of mourning.“Hamas leaders also held an ‘al-Aqsa million march’ in Karachi last year. Qaddoumi referred to Pakistan as an ‘elder brother’ in gratitude to Islamabad for agreeing to host 15 Palestinian prisoners freed under a ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas,” a source recalled.","There have been clear indications of Hamas’s increased presence in Pakistan in the last one year, especially after its Oct 7 terror attack on Israel in 2023.

Perpetrators as well as the conspirators behind the scenes will face strong response: Defence minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/perpetrators-as-well-as-the-conspirators-behind-the-scenes-will-face-strong-response-defence-minister/articleshow/120562899.cms,"NEW DELHI: The actual perpetrators of the ""cowardly terrorist attack"" in Pahalgam as well as the conspirators behind the scenes will soon get a ""strong response"" for their nefarious act on Indian soil, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Wednesday, in a clear indication that the govt is examining military options in addition to the fresh diplomatic ones announced against Pakistan.""Yesterday in Pahalgam, terrorists cowardly targeted innocent civilians on the basis of faith. I would like to reiterate India's firm resolve on the zero-tolerance policy against terrorism... I assure our countrymen that in view of the incident, the govt will take every step that is necessary and appropriate,"" Singh said, delivering the annual Arjan Singh Memorial lecture here.""We will not only trace those who perpetrated this incident, we will also reach those who, sitting behind the scenes, have conspired to carry out such a nefarious act on the soil of India,"" he said.Earlier in the day, Singh chaired an almost three-hour meeting with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan, the three Service chiefs Admiral Dinesh Tripathi, Gen Upendra Dwivedi and Air Chief Marshal A P Singh, and defence secretary R K Singh. ""They reviewed the situation and the different options available at length before Singh went for the PM-led cabinet committee on security meeting,"" a source said.Another indicator that the next few days will be crucial came when Singh cancelled his visit to Ladakh to inaugurate border infrastructure projects on April 25-26. While the threat from China has not fully receded after the troop disengagement at Demchok and Depsang in Ladakh last Oct, there has been a marked upswing in bilateral ties.At the lecture, Singh said, ""Yesterday, in Pahalgam, our country lost many innocent citizens in a cowardly attack by terrorists targeting religion. This extremely inhuman act has plunged all of us into deep grief and pain.""""India is such an old civilisation and such a big country that it cannot be intimidated by such terror activities. The people responsible for such acts will get a strong response in the near future,"" he asserted.The minister, in the context of cross-border terrorist incidents, said history was witness to the withering away of nations not due to the actions of an adversary but due to the result of their own misdeeds. ""I hope people across the border look at lessons of history more closely,"" he said.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh says perpetrators of Pahalgam attack will get a ""strong response"" Singh cancels his visit to Ladakh to inaugurate border infrastructure projects on April 25-26.

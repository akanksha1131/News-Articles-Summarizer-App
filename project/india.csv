NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday said that India is not among the countries who are ""nervous"" as Donald Trump is set to return to White House after defeating Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections.""I know today a lot of countries are nervous about the US. Let's be honest about it. We are not one of them,"" Jaishankar said while speaking at the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of the Aditya Birla Group Scholarships Programme in Mumbai.In response to a question on the reset in the global power dynamic that was playing out amid the shift in the balance of power from the West to the East, Jaishankar remarked, ""Yes, there is a shift. We are ourselves an example of the shift. If you look at our economic weight, you look at our economic ranking, you look at even Indian corporates, their reach, their presence, Indian professionals, which I spoke about. So no question there is a rebalancing.""He explained that this change was expected, saying, ""And to my mind, it was inevitable because once these countries after the colonial period got their independence, they started making their own policy choices, then they were bound to grow.""Nevertheless, Jaishankar pointed out that western industrialised nations maintain significant influence globally. ""But do remember one thing, the older, the western economies, the older industrialised economies, they have not gone away. They still count, they are still prime investment targets. They are big markets, strong technology centres, hubs for innovation. So let's recognise the shift, but let's not get carried away and kind of overstate it and distort our own understanding of the world,"" the minister said.When asked about the impact of the recent US presidential election on Indo-US relations, Jaishankar highlighted PM Modi's consistent ability to establish strong connections with US Presidents, from Barack Obama through Donald Trump to Joe Biden. ""The Prime Minister was among the first three calls I think that President Trump took. Prime Minister Modi has actually built rapport across multiple presidents. When he first visited DC, Obama was the president, then it was Trump, then it was Biden. So, you know, for him (PM Modi), there's something natural in terms of how he forges those relationships. So, that's helped hugely,"" Jaishankar said in his response.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's victory on November 5 against vice president Kamala Harris secured his return to the White House. PM Modi's subsequent telephone conversation with ""friend Donald Trump"" on November 6 included congratulations for both his presidential win and the Republican Party's Congressional success.The Prime Minister acknowledged the strong trust Americans placed in Trump's leadership and vision. He recalled significant events like the Howdy Modi event in Houston in September 2019 and the Namaste Trump event in Ahmedabad in February 2020.""Heartiest congratulations my friend Donald Trump on your historic election victory. As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership. Together, let's work for the betterment of our people and promote global peace, stability and prosperity,"" PM Modi shared on X."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar said that India is not among the countries who are ""nervous"" as Donald Trump is set to return to White House.

Excerpts from the interview:



How would you describe your eight-and-a-half years in SC as a judge, especially the last two years as CJI?

Is Indian democracy in danger? There have been attempts to create a phobia about democracy being in danger in India. Your take on the role of the judiciary on this issue.

Is hate speech a cause for concern? What should India do to curb it?

Reservations for SCs and STs were to last for 10 years. But backwardness appears to be an incurable defect in Indian society with political parties vying with each other for an increase in quota beyond the 50% limit set by the SC in 1992 in the Indra Sawhney case. Should reservations be eternal?

Over the past decade, a degree of transparency has been infused into selection of persons by the SC collegium for appointment as constitutional court judges. Would it have been better if the SC had allowed the NJAC model to operate for a few years, maybe with appropriate tweaking?

Should India follow the US mechanism for selection of judges to the SC? Should the retirement age of HC and SC judges be raised?

After implementation of the Second National Judicial Pay Commission, the salaries of trial court judges have increased substantially. Should the salaries of HC and SC judges, who are paid a pittance compared to their income as advocates, be increased to give them a fair compensation for their tedious work and to attract more talent?

As CJI, the bench you headed gave many landmark judgments involving sensitive social, economic and governance issues. Were you ever approached by the executive seeking a favourable order?

Have PILs, an instrument created on the lines of class action suits to address problems faced by vulnerable sections of society, the marginalised and poor, been hijacked by a few? Has it become an industry in itself?

NEW DELHI: Marking out hate speech as a cause for concern, Justice D Y Chandrachud said its impact was multi-fold with the rise of social media.“Hurtful comments have far-reaching consequences on the psyche and emotional well-being of people,” he said while warning that curbs on hate speech must not have the effect of “chilling free speech”.Looking back at his eight-and-a-half years in the Supreme Court as a judge, the last two years as CJI, Justice Chandrachud told TOI in an exclusive interview he believed he had “left the system better than I found it”, pointing to his verdicts on disability rights, right to information, and economic federalism, besides the equal opportunity doctrine in the context of sex and caste discrimination.Asked if reservations should continue for perpetuity, the outgoing CJI said it could not be denied that quota as a means of affirmative action had promoted substantive equality. “That is a model of equality that is tried and tested, and has worked in India,” he added.Justice Chandrachud said he did not agree with the perception that a judge’s work involved an element of ‘service’. “A judge, while discharging her functions, is not doing any service. Judges are doing a job just like everybody else. They are two different issues and must not be mixed,” he said, adding that a judge must be paid commensurate with the work output.Many lawyers refer to Justice Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud as the ‘Rockstar’ of judiciary. After a stellar 25-year judicial career, eight of which were in the Supreme Court, the curtains came down on Sunday. He spoke on a range of subjects — from democracy, hate speech, reservation, executive-judiciary relations to judges’ salaries.I don’t think I can speak of my experience as a judge of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India without a reference to 13 years as a judge of Bombay High Court and three years as Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court. Much of what I have learnt and, particularly, my judicial philosophy is shaped by my experiences from then. In Bombay HC, I learnt the ropes of judging from many, especially judicial craftsmanship by observing Justices Sujata V Manohar and P D Desai. As CJ of Allahabad HC, I learnt about judicial administration.Allahabad HC has the highest sanctioned strength of 160 judges and heading the court was a challenge. It taught me many lessons on leadership and judicial administration. As the Chief Justice, you are not a ‘leader’ in the traditional sense. You are the first among equals. Your brother and sister judges could be older and more experienced in the profession.Thus, a very delicate balance has to be drawn. I learnt much about human emotions and relationships as the HC CJ. These experiences guided my functions, both administrative and judicial, at the Supreme Court. The switch from being the HC CJ to a puisne judge at the Supreme Court is in a lot of ways humbling. You are back to focusing solely on the judicial side of things. Looking back, I have had a very fulfilling journey.I had the opportunity to lay down the jurisprudence on disability rights, expanded the equal opportunity doctrine in the context of sex and caste discrimination, limited the scope of sealed cover jurisprudence to exceptional situations, gave teeth to the right to information, and crafted a nuanced understandings of economic federalism while deciding Centre-State disputes in the mineral and liquor cases. I am retiring with a sense of satisfaction.I have critically engaged in areas of law and developed jurisprudential frameworks to limit the ad-hoc model of judicial decision making. As the Chief Justice of India, I believe that I have left the system better than I found it.There are no uniform components of democracy that every country must tick to ensure that it is functioning ‘democratically’. The premise of democratic functioning in India, where we are faced with our own unique problems, is different from the premise of democracy in other countries.In India, we don’t subscribe to a merely ‘political’ understanding of democracy. Issues relating to elections or representation such as the right to vote or gerrymandering are a part of democratic governance.We also believe in social democracy, that is, the existence of certain minimum social factors such as absence of discrimination and ensuring substantive equality of opportunity. What is the role of institutions in democracy? Institutions are created and conferred with power to ensure that (i) the premises of democracy are not abrogated and (ii) the values that democratic foundations rest upon are fostered. I would term courts as ‘specially abled’ democratic institutions whose function itself is to ensure that the other democratic institutions are not captured and are able to freely exercise their duties.Viewed in that manner, the courts are conferred with powers to prevent democratic decay. This could include the role of courts to challenges which alter the rules of elections and the process of appointing persons to democratic institutions and their independence. But it would equally include the role of courts in a challenge against a reservation policy or even a challenge to the recruitment process to the post of a teacher or the challenge to arrest or an application requesting bail.Each of these issues is connected to the constitutional idea of democracy. So, it cannot be denied that courts have a very important role to play in the sustenance of Indian democracy. But it must be equally recognised that the length and breadth of Indian democracy and its meaning cannot be limited to certain ‘big’ matters.I am an ardent believer and proponent of the freedom of speech and expression. Constitutional freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions. I also believe that the restrictions must not render the right a mere paper right. Hate speech is a cause for concern. Its impact is multi-fold now with the rise of social media.There are an increasing number of keyboard warriors who say things in exercise of their freedom of speech to just gain traction and to stay relevant in public. Hurtful comments have far-reaching consequences on the psyche and emotional well-being of people. What should India do to curb it? The method opted by the state must be covered within the fold of the restrictions. It must not have the effect of chilling free speech.A balance must be drawn to ensure that the means adopted are proportionate to the infringement of the right.The statement that reservations for SCs and STs were to last for 10 years is factually inaccurate. Article 334 of the Constitution states that reservations for SCs and STs in the House of the People and the legislative assemblies of states must cease to exist in 10 years. This provision was amended multiple times that it now reads that it shall cease to exist in 80 years.Thus, the time limit was prescribed only for reservations in the legislature and not for reservations in educational institutions and services. From a constitutional perspective, the amendments to the time limit are unconstitutional only if the original and unamended provision has attained the character of a basic feature.The concept of equality of opportunity is eternal. That is one of the basic features of the Constitution. Reservation is a means to ensure equality of opportunity. You cannot deny that reservation as a means of affirmative action promoted substantive equality. That is a model of equality that is tried and tested, and has worked in India.The question is based on a surmise. I am not in a position to answer whether the NJAC model of appointment would have been ‘better’ than the collegium system. The Supreme Court decided the ‘constitutional validity’ of the NJAC model.The court does not sit in judgment on whether a model of appointment is better than the other but only on whether it is constitutionally sound. A constitution bench of the Supreme Court held that the NJAC model of appointment was not constitutionally sound.Within the system of appointment that is in place, I have infused a degree of transparency. There are parameters based on which we recommend a judge. We consider the factors of (i) merit, performance and integrity; (ii) diversity and inclusion; and (iii) representation.I don’t have an appropriate answer for whether the retirement age for judges must be raised. There are two perspectives from which this question can be viewed. If you ask me whether our brain becomes ‘slower’ at the ages of 62 and 65, and whether we can no longer discharge the functions of a judge, I would say no. We have legal luminaries in the bar who are at their prime even at the ages of 70 and 75.There is another perspective to this. The prescription of a retirement age is to prevent the concentration of power and to ensure that the opportunity is available to many from the younger population. The aim must be to balance experience with adaptability.I am a firm believer in payment of salaries commensurate with work. I also believe that any service must provide competitive salaries to attract talent. For example, when I took over as the Chief Justice of India, the salary of judicial law clerks was Rs 65,000. It is now Rs 80,000 for the first year of clerkship and Rs 90,000 from the second year.Clerkship in India is now a highly competitive and sought after job, which attracts talent. Competitive salaries also ensure that the job presents an opportunity to law graduates across the board, irrespective of the social and economic status. The same principle applies to judgeship as well. I know more than one candidate who has denied taking up judgeship because of the lack of financial prospects.It is a particularly difficult choice to make when you are offered judgeship in the high court. In many cases, candidates have to give up their lucrative practice which pays them 10x to 100x the salary they would be offered as a judge. There is often a perception that floats around. That as a judge, there is an element of ‘service’ involved and that economic benefits should be immaterial. I do not subscribe to this school of thought.A judge, while discharging her functions, is not doing any service. The minute that is the perception, then any decision of the judge will be viewed not as a discharge of her constitutional function but as an outcome of ‘graciousness’. A judge must be paid commensurate with the work output. While they are working, they are doing a job just like everybody else. The manner in which they discharge their job must conform to the principles prescribed by the Constitution. They are two different issues and must not be mixed.No, I have never been approached by the executive seeking a favourable order.I think it would amount to diminishing the impact and the benefits of PILs to say that it has been hijacked by a few. The core principle of public interest litigation is that it dilutes the traditional rule of locus standi on who can raise an issue before the court.A person who is not directly affected by an action (or inaction) may initiate a public interest litigation if it affects the public. It cannot be denied that courts have been more ‘activist’ in the PIL pleas. It can also not be denied that these petitions have contributed to social progress in India.The judgment of the Supreme Court in Vishaka is a prime example, where it developed the right against sexual harassment and framed guidelines to fill the legislative vacuum. Another very recent example is the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sukanya Shantha , where the court dealt with caste discrimination in prisons. The petitioner in the case was a journalist.There are numerous frivolous petitions which are instituted because of the dilution of locus standi. There is no denying that it burdens the already heavy docket. I remember that there was a PIL filed claiming that Charles Darwin was wrong in his evolution theory and Albert Einstein erred in deducing E=mc2.There was another petition with the grievance that the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court did not say ‘I’ while taking oath. So, there are good and bad cases. A few lawyers have made their name and have become popular through PILs but that is really a natural consequence of diluting the principle of locus standi. It is up to the court (and individual benches) to take a firm stand against it.",Justice D Y Chandrachud said its impact was multi-fold with the rise of social media. The outgoing CJI said it could not be denied that quota as a means of affirmative action had promoted substantive equality.

2020-21 killings of Dera followers put Dalla on intel radar

NEW DELHI: A shooting in Ontario and the subsequent detention of two men by Canadian Police have sparked speculation that one of those detained is designated terrorist Arshdeep Singh , alias Arsh Dalla, close aide and successor of slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar . However, there has been no official confirmation regarding Dalla’s detention from either Canadian or Indian officials, with the latter still trying to verify the authenticity of the reports.Dalla, a rival of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, had taken over reins of Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) after Nijjar’s killing by unidentified men. He has been on the ‘most wanted’ list of India since he orchestrated the murder of a Hindu man in Delhi in December 2022.The buzz suggests that Dalla was reportedly involved in a shootout on Oct 27-28 and was remanded in custody by Halton Regional Police Service (HRPS). He had also sustained a minor gunshot injury, it was claimed.HRPS had on Oct 29 said it had arrested two men on charges of “discharging firearm with intent” following an investigation after the duo had come to a hospital and one of them was treated for a non-life-threatening gunshot and later discharged.Indian intelligence agencies, who have been closely monitoring his activities, confirmed that Dalla has been residing in Canada with his wife. However, it is unclear if he was still in detention. Sources said he has been released.The report of detention came around the time Punjab Police on Sunday apprehended two of Dalla’s operatives in Mohali and Delhi, linked to a recent murder case. Dalla’s shooters were also found involved in a killing in Gwalior.Indian officials stated that Dalla has been wanted for multiple criminal offenses in India. He is believed to have continued Nijjar’s activities, maintaining ties with extremist networks overseas.Dalla, who fled to Canada in July 2020, has been linked to multiple heinous crimes such as murder, extortion and targeted killings in which more than 13 FIRs have been registered against him. He has been allegedly transferring money from Canada to India to his associates to commit various crimes, cops said.He first came on radar of Indian agencies after his role came to fore in the murder of two Dera Sacha Sauda followers in 2020 and 2021. Wanted by NIA besides police in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab, Dalla has been operating from Canada for four years and is suspected to be behind many targeted killings in Punjab.In Jan last year, Dalla was declared a designated terrorist by Union home ministry (MHA) due to his alleged involvement in a series of murders, extortion, terror funding and targeted killings besides terrorist activities.","A shooting in Ontario and the subsequent detention of two men by Canadian Police have sparked speculation that one of those detained is designated terrorist Arshdeep Singh.

People from SC, ST, OBC communities need not worry: Shah

Mahayuti will meet & decide after polls: Shah on CM face

MUMBAI: A very stringent anti-conversion law that will ensure zero religious conversions in Maharashtra will be enacted once the Mahayuti comes to power, promised Union home minister Amit Shah. On Sunday, he released the BJP’s “Sankalp Patra” (election manifesto) in Mumbai, listing 25 promises that the Mahayuti will fulfil if elected to power.Meanwhile, elsewhere in Maharashtra, Shah in his speech made it clear there will be no religion-based reservation for education and employment.The party has been wooing the Hindu community in this election, and the announcement is seen as a concrete attempt to take the party’s election slogans “Batenge toh Katenge (divided we shall be cut), Ek hain toh safe hai (We are safe if we are one)” a step forward. Speaking on the anti-conversion law, Shah said the BJP will form an internal committee to draft the anti-conversion law. “...after the Mahayuti forms the government, it will constitute a committee to hold discussions with all stakeholders. It will come up with very stringent laws so religious conversions do not take place,” said Shah.In Mumbai, Shah said PM Modi brought a bill to improve the Waqf Board, but in Karnataka, attempts were made to evict villages and even temples constructed on Waqf land. “When the opposition says it wants to improve the Waqf Board bill , it means this can happen even in Maharashtra,” he said. Shah addressed a press meet after the event.On who would be the next CM, Shah said after elections, the three parties will sit together and take a decision. On increasing number of family members of party members being given tickets , Shah said the party made attempts to reduce number of such candidates. “There are more family dynasts in MVA,” he said. On a common minimum programme, Shah said the first ten points of Sankalp Patra were of Mahayuti. “Every party will announce its own Sankalp Patra. Once Mahayuti forms govt, a committee of ministers from all three parties will be formed to pritise commitments made and ensure 100% implementation,” he said.Attacking Uddhav Thackeray, he said MVA promises are merely to “grab power”. Urging people to vote for Mahayuti, he said the 2019 people’s mandate was betrayed. “Thackeray should decide where he wants to sit. He is sitting with people who opposed abrogation of Article 370, amendment to CAA, NCR, Ram Mandir construction... I want to ask himif he can appeal to Rahul Gandhi to speak a few good words on Veer Savarkar, can he ask Congress members to say a few good words on Bal Thackeray.”","The party has been wooing the Hindu community in this election.

Ranthambore’s missing tigers: A tale of turf wars and human threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ranthambores-missing-tigers-a-tale-of-turf-wars-and-human-threat/articleshow/115153520.cms,"File photo

JAIPUR: Tigers may be disappearing from Ranthambore national park due to a complex mix of territorial disputes, human-related threats, and natural aging, as per according to wildlife experts.Recently, chief wildlife warden Pavan Kumar Upadhyay issued an order regarding 25 tigers missing from the park. A search committee could trace 10 of them within three days. Dharmendra Khandal, a conservation biologist with Tiger Watch, noted that among remaining 15 missing tigers, territorial conflicts and human threats appear to be significant factors.Forest department’s report reads, “These younger males were frequently observed roaming in search of unclaimed territories. Territorial disputes with dominant males could be the cause of their disappearance. However, human-related factors must also be considered.These young males may have been exposed to threats from locals, such as poisoning or other manmade risks.”Five older tigers are believed to have died of natural causes due to their advanced age, ranging from 18 to 19 years.The report adds, “Tigers typically live up to around 15 years, making survival beyond that age increasingly difficult. While it is remarkable that these tigers survived in Ranthambore for so long, once they passed the age of 15, they faced immense challenges.Their breeding ceased, and they struggled to maintain their health and territories in the face of mounting competition from younger, dominant tigers.”","Tigers may be disappearing from Ranthambore national park due to a complex mix of territorial disputes, human-related threats, and natural aging.

Amit Shah also said the decision to name the chief minister's face will be taken by the alliance partners only after the completion of the polls.""At present, Eknath Shinde is the chief minister. After the elections, all the three alliance partners will decide on the chief minister,"" Shah said.The home minister said the Shiv Sena and NCP split because Uddhav Thackeray prioritised his son over Eknath Shinde while Sharad Pawar preferred his daughter over Ajit Pawar.""These parties gave priority to their family members and the parties split. They blame the BJP for no reason,"" he said.The ruling alliance, Mahayuti includes the BJP, chief minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena faction, and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP faction.Shah, who unveiled the BJP's manifesto today, said that all the three alliance partners have released their manifestos and a committee of ministers will be established after elections to ensure that the poll promises are fulfilled.Amit Shah said the BJP was against ""family-based politics"" and dismissed Congress' allegations that the BJP seeks to undermine reservations. ""It is the Modi government which gave reservations to OBCs.

School Holiday November 24th: Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji's Martyrdom Day

November 2024 marks the peak of India’s festive season, with schools and colleges nationwide continuing their celebrations. After the lively Diwali celebrations on October 31, students get to enjoy several important religious holidays in the beginning of November.In many states, schools remain closed for Govardhan Puja and Bhai Dooj, extending the Diwali break into the first week of November. Schools in several states will reopen on November 4, but the festivities continue as holidays are observed for Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, and Karthik Purnima later in the month.While these holidays bring joy and cultural connection, they also indicate the end of the academic season. The pre-exam period for students begins in November, with the announcement of upcoming term-end tests and the first batch of dates for key entrance exams such as the JEE.The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students gradually transition from the festive season to exam season. Here’s a rundown of November’s key school holidays:Govardhan Puja, celebrated the day after Diwali, marks Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. Devotees prepare traditional food offerings and worship the Govardhan Hill to express gratitude for nature’s abundance. This festival is celebrated in several regions, and schools in some states remain closed for students to participate in the rituals and celebrations.Bhai Dooj, celebrated just two days after Diwali, is a festival symbolizing the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being, and brothers offer gifts in return. This occasion fosters family unity, with schools closed for students to spend time with their families and partake in this cherished ritual.Chhat Puja, a deeply revered festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to worshipping the Sun God. The festival involves fasting and prayers for the well-being and prosperity of family members. Schools close in regions observing Chhat Puja, allowing students to participate in the early morning and evening rituals along the riverbanks.Guru Nanak Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is one of the most significant days in the Sikh calendar. Celebrated with grand processions and community services, it emphasizes values of equality, compassion, and humility. Schools in many states declare a holiday, enabling students to partake in the celebrations and observe the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Karthik Purnima, observed on the full moon day of the Karthik month, holds importance for both Hindu and Sikh communities. Celebrations often include holy baths and offerings at rivers, temples, and gurudwaras. The holiday allows students and families to engage in these spiritual practices.Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji’s Martyrdom Day honours the ninth Sikh Guru's sacrifice for the freedom of religion. His martyrdom is commemorated with solemn services, kirtans, and processions, emphasising the Guru’s courage and dedication to human rights. Schools observe a holiday in some states to let students remember and honour this legacy.","November 2024 marks the peak of India’s festive season, with schools and colleges nationwide continuing their celebrations.

NEW DELHI: India is set to receive the first of its two guided-missile warships being built in Russia by the end of this month, following a long delay due to ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. However, the delivery of 2 remaining squadrons of S-400 Triumf air defense missile systems is likely to be delayed until 2026, and lease of a nuclear-powered attack submarine until 2028.The multi-role frigate, with a displacement of almost 4,000-tonne, will be handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors stationed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad for the last few months, defence sources told TOI.The warship will then be commissioned as INS Tushil by defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is slated to visit the country early-Dec for India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meet.“The second frigate, Tamal, will be handed over early next year. Both the stealth frigates will be packed with weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, and sensors to undertake a variety of missions,” a source said. India in Oct 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement for procurement of four Grigorovich-class frigates , with the first two to be imported from Russia for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard (GSL) with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore, with the first being “launched” as Triput in July this year. These four warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted in the Navy from 2003-04 onwards.Delivery of fourth and fifth squadrons of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, in turn, will take place only by 2026. “India has asked Russia for faster delivery. But it looks difficult because Russia’s entire defence-industrial production is geared towards Ukraine war,” another source said.IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan, as reported by TOI earlier.On underwater front, India in the past has operated two nuclear-powered attack submarines armed with conventional weapons (called SSNs), INS Chakra-1 and INS Chakra-2, after leasing them from Russia. Then, in March 2019, India inked an over $3 billion (Rs 21,000 crore) deal with Russia to lease a more advanced SSN for 10 years, but its delivery has also been delayed beyond 2027. “Russia has been asked to deliver the SSN earlier, but it is doubtful before 2028,” the source said.The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Oct 9, incidentally, cleared the indigenous project to build two SSNs at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore, but it will take at least a decade for them to roll out.India had of course commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBNs) as INS Arighaat in August and plans to induct the third as INS Aridhaman early next year, in a major boost for strategic deterrence.","The multi-role frigate, with a displacement of almost 4,000-tonne, will be handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors stationed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad.

The arrests took place in the Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh.Those arrested were Shiv Kumar Gautam, alias Shiva - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (main shooter), Anurag Kashyap - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (brother of shooter Dharmraj Kashyap, aide), Gyan Prakash Tripathi - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (aide/helper) and Akash Srivastava - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (aide/helper) and Akhileshendra Pratap Singh - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (aide/helper).STF said that on the night of October 12, 2024, three unknown shooters killed Ziauddin Abdul Rahim Siddiqui, popularly known as Baba Siddiqui, near the office of his son, Zishan Siddiqui, in Khairnagar, Thane, Mumbai. Baba Siddiqui, a former Maharashtra minister and close associate of actor Salman Khan, was killed in a well-orchestrated attack.The murder was registered at Nirmal Nagar police station, Thane, Mumbai. During the investigation, two shooters, Dharmraj Kashyap and Gurmel Singh, were arrested, but one of the shooters, Shiv Kumar, managed to escape.The arrested shooters revealed that the murder was carried out on the orders of notorious gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently serving a prison sentence. Bishnoi's associates, Shubham Lonkar from Maharashtra and Mohammad Yaseen Akhtar from Jalandhar, were identified as the handlers who provided logistics and information regarding the victim's location.On October 23, 2024, the Mumbai Police requested assistance from the Uttar Pradesh STF to arrest Shiv Kumar and other fugitives involved in the murder.It was during this operation that information surfaced that Shiv Kumar was hiding in Bahraich, planning to escape to Nepal.On November 10, 2024, the STF team, in collaboration with the Mumbai Crime Branch, gathered crucial intelligence from a tip-off and proceeded to the Nainapara area of Bahraich.According to the information, Shiv Kumar and his accomplices were preparing to flee to Nepal and were hiding near Harabhasri Nahar Pulliya. At this location, the STF and Mumbai crime branch teams arrested Shiv Kumar and four others.Deputy SP of STF Pramesh Shukla, said that during questioning, Shiv Kumar revealed that he and Dharmraj Kashyap hailed from the same village and had previously worked together in Pune in the scrap business.“Shiv Kumar also disclosed that he had been in contact with Shubham Lonkar, who worked for Lawrence Bishnoi. Through Snapchat, he communicated with Anmol Bishnoi, the brother of Lawrence, who instructed him to carry out the murder in exchange for a promised payment of Rs 10 lakh and ongoing financial support,” said ShuklaShiv Kumar further explained that he and his fellow shooters, including Dharmraj, were involved in surveillance of Baba Siddiqui for several days before executing the murder on the night of October 12, 2024. He also mentioned that the attack took place during a festival, which helped them blend into the crowd, resulting in the arrest of two of the shooters while Shiv Kumar managed to escape.After fleeing Mumbai, Shiv Kumar travelled through Pune, Jhansi, and Lucknow before reaching Bahraich. He had been in constant contact with his handlers and accomplices throughout the journey. According to Shiv Kumar, his associates, Anurag Kashyap, Gyan Prakash Tripathi, Akash Srivastava, and Akhileshendra Pratap Singh, had made arrangements for his escape to Nepal.","Baba Siddiqui, a former Maharashtra minister and close associate of actor Salman Khan, was killed in a well-orchestrated attack.

Los Alamos Daily Post

MUMBAI: Unknown possibly to many, just 48 hours after Donald Trump was formally declared presidential election winner, the US conducted on Nov 8 a flight test related to its nuclear weapons programme.Los Alamos National Laboratory -- one of the main centres of US nuclear weapons development -- launched a payload code named Cyclone-1 to evaluate how new components and technologies behave when released by a missile and in a space environment.The weapon-related payload was flown by Denver-based UP Aerospace’s SpaceLoft-20 rocket , and the lift-off was from Spaceport America in New Mexico.“The primary mission of the laboratory is ensuring safety, security and reliability of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile,” Stephen Judd, Los Alamos’s mission manager has been quoted as saying to. “To do this successfully requires flight testing to determine how things perform in environments similar to those experienced during a missile launch,” Judd added.Significantly, the crucial test comes at a time when the US is upgrading its nuclear warheads and designing new ones.According to Judd, flight testing allows for data gathering about how systems behave in various environments, such as different accelerations, pressures, velocities, and temperatures. Upon the rocket reaching its apogee -- the point furthest from earth -- the research payload was released and monitored by laboratory scientists through its descent back to Earth.During this flight, an onboard telemetry system transmitted in-flight information regarding the payload’s performance and its functionality. The Los Alamos lab is preparing for another four launches between this year-end and mid-Sept 2025.",The US conducted a flight test related to its nuclear weapons programme.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A tense situation prevailed outside the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi on Sunday as hundreds of members of the Hindu Sikh Global Forum staged a protest in Chanakyapuri against the recent attacks and vandalism of Hindu temples in Canada.Heavy security was deployed outside the High Commission and the protesters were stopped at Teen Murti Marg by the police. Several activists were seen attempting to climb over the police barricades and toppling them.""An entire generation had been destroyed during militancy. They were either killed or they migrated to other countries. Then they introduced drugs to ruin the life of our young generation. When they saw Punjab was thriving, they started with religious conversions. And now this new thing of attacking temples has started. This is wrong and unfortunate ... We are here to tell you that we are all together. A true Sikh can never be a Khalistani. If they want a separate nation, they should keep it limited to themselves. We want our Tricolour and our country to be respected at all times. India's Sikhs stand with India and do not support Khalistan,"" said Tarvinder Singh Marwah, president of the Hindu Sikh Global Forum.The protest was a direct response to a series of violent incidents targeting Hindu temples in Canada, particularly an attack on November 3 at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton. The incident allegedly involved pro-Khalistani extremists who clashed with Hindu-Canadian devotees, resulting in physical violence and injuries.The situation has drawn condemnation from both Indian officials and Canadian politicians, highlighting concerns over rising anti-Hindu sentiment in Canada.Following the attack, massive protests erupted outside the Brampton temple, with demonstrations also taking place in Mississauga.

GUMLA/BOKARO/RANCHI: Congress’s “divide-and-rule” policy of several decades forms the crux of the JMM-led coalition’s strategy to stay in govt and snatch the rights of tribals, Dalits and OBCs in Jharkhand, PM Narendra Modi said Sunday at twin campaign rallies in Gumla and Bokaro.“Congress governed the country Independence onwards by keeping OBCs divided. Since 1990, it has been fighting for survival. So, it wants to divide the country along caste lines and break the SC, ST and OBC fraternity again by pitting one against the other. Ek rahenge toh safe rahenge (if we are united, we will be safe),” he said in tribal-dominant Gumla.Branding both Congress and its ally JMM “anti-tribal”, Modi accused the coalition – including RJD and CPI-ML – of looting the state’s natural resources to fill their coffers and taking bribes even for issuance of birth and death certificates.“Congress can’t tolerate tribals in high positions; it even opposed Droupadi Murmu when we made her President, while former CM Champai Soren was removed from the post by this very govt.”The PM, who also held a 3km roadshow from the OTC ground to Ratu Road in Ranchi, alleged that the Hemant Soren govt “supported” recruitment exam paper-leaks to the detriment of deserving candidates for jobs among the state’s youth.He assured that if a BJP-led govt assumed office, it would ensure all wrongdoers were identified and punished. “We will bust the paper-leak mafia created by Congress and JMM here. It is my guarantee. There will be a fair and transparent recruitment process, and nobody will have to bribe or pay a commission to get jobs or get their work done.”Modi also flagged illegal immigration from Bangladesh as a threat to tribal identity. On the Hemant govt’s charge of non-cooperation by the Centre, he said the BJP-led govt allocated more funds to Jharkhand in the past 10 years than UPA ever did, but fiscal mismanagement and corruption in the state stalled its growth.","JMM-led coalition's strategy is to stay in govt and snatch rights of tribals, Dalits and OBCs, PM Narendra Modi said.

OTTAWA: Canadian police have arrested a 35-year-old Brampton resident on charges of assault with a weapon during a violent demonstration at a Hindu temple in the city, authorities said.On Nov 3, a protest occurred at Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton and unverified videos circulating on social media appeared to show demonstrators holding banners in support of Khalistan.The videos showed fist fights and people striking each other with poles on what appears to be the grounds surrounding the temple.Peel police responded to the altercation during the demonstration at the temple. As tensions between opposing sides increased, the demonstrations became physical and assaultive, a statement said on Saturday.Police began investigating several offences that occurred during the demonstration, many of which were captured on video; including individuals using flags and sticks to assault people, it said.

"For the first time, 190 people to vote in own remote Maha village",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-the-first-time-190-people-to-vote-in-own-remote-maha-village/articleshow/115152721.cms,"A senior citizen after casting vote from her Thane home on Sunday

NADED: Waghdari, a village of 300 residents in Kinwat taluka of Maharashtra’s Nanded district, has just secured its own polling station despite having no presence on the country’s land revenue map even after 77 years of independence.Until the last election, the villagers would trek for over two hours, braving the elements and animal attacks, to cast their votes in Jaldhara, the nearest village. But in the Nov 20 assembly polls, they will vote for the first time in their village under Kinwat constituency . This has brought renewed hopes for recognition and long-pending land rights from govt.“Tell us where we belong” is the villagers’ refrain. They live deep in the teak forests of the Satmala range along the Telangana border. They claim Telangana abandoned them and Maharashtra never accepted them.Local SDO and revenue officer Kavali Meghana said the EC approved the polling station in Waghdari considering the challenging hilly terrain and dense forests. “Waghdari has 190 eligible voters,” Meghana said.Villager Datta Bhawale is still angry. “For four generations, we have called this place our home, but we have nothing to show for it from govt. Our gram panchayat is 35km away and we walk 10km to vote in any election. The nearest metalled road is a three-hour walk.”Others complained that they don’t have land ownership papers and no drinking water pipeline. “When we sought our land documents, they told us that we are not on the (revenue) map. We told them to tell us if we were from Telangana or Maharashtra. Finally, a govt official said we belonged to Maharashtra. It means nothing if we don’t have basic rights,” another villager said.Senior citizen Saraswati Varvate fretted that the hamlet’s only water source was a stream around 1km away. “No one comes here to campaign. We vote hoping for change. But whoever wins, we know we’re on our own,” he said.Without these papers, they can’t get road, crop insurance, borewells or subsidies, Shankar Gaikwad, another villager, said. “Wild animals destroy our crops. On the rare occasion when we get a good yield, transporting it over rough terrain with no road, drains any small profit we make. We grow just enough to survive most of the time,” Gaikwad said.DC Abhijit Raut has sent the land records proposal to revenue authorities in Pune. SDO Meghana cited historical reasons behind the problem. “Earlier, the area was attached to Adilabad district in Telangana during the Nizamshahi period. Last year, we conducted measurements in the village and sent the proposal to Pune. We are hopeful that within the next 4-5 months, the residents will receive what they’re entitled to from govt,” Meghana said.Till the promise rings true, Waghdari’s battle continues. Teacher Sidheshwar Vishwanath is the villagers’ only established link to govt. He lives in Islampur 16km away and he rides his two-wheeler to Jaldhara and then walks for 2 to 3 hours either way to reach seven students in a single-room, asbestos-sheet roofed school in Waghdari.After Std IV, children travel long distances to reach a bigger school, and many, especially girls, drop out because of the challenging commute that involves threats of possible attacks from leopards, bears and even tigers. “I just came across a bear this (Sunday) morning. I waited for it to leave before I could continue,” Vishwanath said.Life is tougher for women. For Maya Kale, who dropped out after Std XI, the journey to school was fraught with danger. “My parents worried about me and got me married,” Maya said. Most births are at home, and in emergencies, people are carried on makeshift stretchers to Jaldhara —a two-and-a-half-hour journey to reach the nearest road.","Waghdari, a village of 300 residents in Kinwat taluka of Maharashtra’s Nanded district, has just secured its own polling station.

Pakistan on social media overdrive to revive terrorism in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-on-social-media-overdrive-to-revive-terrorism-in-kashmir/articleshow/115124996.cms,"New Delhi: An exponential rise in social media activity over the past month by Pakistan and PoK-based terrorist handles, aimed at glamourising terrorism and secessionism in J&K, as well as threatening anti-India posts, is being viewed by Indian security agencies as ""a fresh bid by Pakistan-backed terror outfits to revive local terror recruitment in J&K"", according to intelligence sources.An analysis by the agencies here of anti-India activities across ""identified"" Pakistan and PoK-based terror-linked accounts on platforms like Facebook, X, Telegram, Dark Web etc, revealed over 2,000 'posts of concern' in the past one month alone (Oct-Nov), as against 89 during the corresponding period of 2023. This translates to a more than 22-fold rise.Of the nearly 2,016 objectionable posts, more that 130 each were terrorism-specific and anti-India rants, 33 backed separatism and secessionism, and 310 were in the nature of threats to infrastructure and public places like schools etc, TOI has learnt.A senior officer in the central security establishment told TOI that the social media route to influence and exploit impressional minds of J&K youths and radicalise them for anti-national activities - something that had seen young Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani turn into a terror icon before he was killed in 2016 - follows a sharp decline in the number of local Kashmiris joining terrorist outfits. Just four locals in J&K - two from Shopian and one each from Srinagar and Tral - were recruited for terrorist activities till Nov this year, down from 22 in 2023 and 113 in 2022. In fact, there are only 30 local terrorists operating in J&K as of now, as against 75-80 foreign terrorists.""Attempts at raising local recruitment may not point to plans for a troubled winter but to preparations for heightened terror activity in the summer of 2025,"" said an officer.The decline in local recruitment in the past few years was attributed by a senior J&K govt functionary to the central and the UT administration's zero-tolerance approach to terror over the past few years, which focused not only on tackling terrorists but also on dismantling the terror eco-system by choking funding and cracking down on overground supporters by denying them govt jobs and clearances for passports, driving licence, etc.Interestingly, the rise in terrorist outfits' social media outreach to J&K youths coincides with the installation of an elected govt in the UT.Agencies are probing whether the changed power equations in J&K, even though control of police remains with the LG, have emboldened the Pakistan-based terrorist masterminds to whip up trouble there. A recent intelligence input warned of the plan of Pakistan's ISI to target over a dozen Jamaat-e-Islami leaders in Kashmir through their terror associates ""in the near future"". This could be to create public unrest or possibly linked to JeI's decision to enter the political space by contesting the recent J&K assembly elections, a source told TOI.Drone activity, meanwhile, continues to be a concern in J&K, with 40 sightings reported until Oct this year as compared to 31 in the corresponding period of 2023.","Over 2,000 'posts of concern' in the past one month alone (Oct-Nov), as against 89 during the corresponding period of 2023.

HYDERABAD: Around 15 to 20 tigers have been missing for years from Telangana’s northern tiger corridors, covering Kagaznagar, Asifabad, and Mancherial regions, claim wildlife activists.Prominent names such as Chaitra, Vaishaka, and Phalguna have not been seen since 2013, they claim. In Jan 2024, an adult tiger and a sub-adult were found poisoned to death in Kagaznagar. Two more of the same family are still missing. Wildlife activists claim only four to five tigers remain in Kagaznagar, that once had at least 15.The forest department’s response to these claims is mixed. “There’s no problem in Amrabad Tiger Reserve,” said a forest official on condition of anonymity, “but in areas outside reserves, we see tigers disappearing”.Telangana’s principal chief conservator of forests, R M Dobriyal, said, “The tigers are there. Some have migrated to Maharashtra and some have returned around Kawal. Recently, we recorded a cattle kill in Kagaznagar so we know there are at least five tigers there.”The forest department says their absence was potentially due to gaps in camera trap coverage.However, state’s chief wildlife warden Elusing Meru said, “It is a fact that there are no resident tigers at present but we are hoping that the inviolate areas created by relocation of two villages recently will make it an ideal habitat.”“In Adilabad, Tiryani, and Chennur, we saw about five tigers. But the tigers in Kawal Tiger Reserve have vanished over the years,” said an official from Aranya Bhavan.","Prominent names such as Chaitra, Vaishaka, and Phalguna have not been seen since 2013.

PM Modi has actually built rapport across multiple presidents. When he first came to DC, Obama was the president, then it was Trump, then it was Biden.

"Slums now cover 7.3% of Mumbai, down from 8%: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/slums-now-cover-7-3-of-mum-down-from-8-study/articleshow/115153178.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Land covered by slums in Mumbai region declined 8.6%, or 4.1 sq km, between 2005 and 2022, a new study has revealed. That’s an area approximately 4.5 times the size of Mahalaxmi racecourse.The study found the area covered by slums in estuarial Mumbai — Greater Mumbai and Thane city — fell from 47.7 sq km in 2005 to 43.6 sq km in 2022. This overall decline masks a more complex dynamic, though: some bastis grew larger, others became smaller, and a few vanished over the two decades. Slums shrank in some places by a total of 10.2 sq km and grew in others by 6.1 sq km, it found.Many slums also became more closely packed, or dense, after 2010. “While slums grew in area in the first decade, they densified in the second,” says John Friesen, lead author of the study.The findings show that slums should not be seen “as areas of uncontrolled urban expansion but as integral components of the city, constantly undergoing deconstruction and reconstruction”, researchers say.For the study, Friesen and others used high-resolution satellite imagery and other data to map changes in land occupied by slum structures across the Mumbai region between 2005 and 2022.With total land area covering almost 600 sq km (including the national park), the reduction brought down the proportion of land occupied by slums in Mumbai region from 8% in 2005 to 7.3% in 2022.Meanwhile, on the mainland, including Navi Mumbai and parts of Mumbra, slum area grew by almost 35%, increasing from 12 sq km to 16.1 sq km between 2005-2022.Researchers also looked at the spatial density of slums , which they based on the distance between structures. Slum areas that had less than 10 metres distance between structures were categorised as high density, while those with gaps of up to 30 metres were considered low density.Across the region, researchers found the number of low-density slums doubled from 294 to 502 between 2005 and 2010, before dropping back to 266 by 2022.Conversely, the number of tightly packed, or high-density, slums declined slightly before 2010, from 988 to 964, before increasing to 1,359 by 2022.These findings seem to support local observations that slums in the city have grown vertically rather than horizontally in the past decade, and that any sprawl in informal settlements has shifted to outer areas of the metropolitan region.Interestingly, the study also found that slums close to waterbodies and railways reduced over the 17-year period. Slum area within 100 metres of waterbodies declined by 7%, or 1.8 sq km, between 2005 and 2022, and by 11.5% or 3.7 sq km within 100 metres of railway lines.This decline needs to be studied further, Friesen said, noting that the results might be different if they expanded the 100-metre buffer zone to 200 metres. The slum area beyond 100 metres near waterbodies and railways increased, the study found.","Land covered by slums in Mumbai region declined 8.6%, or 4.1 sq km, between 2005 and 2022, a new study has revealed.

OTTAWA: Canada has denied it ever banned Australia Today, the Indian diaspora-focused media outlet operating from down under. Global Affairs Canada said in a statement that the news site and video of media comments by both India’s foreign minister S Jaishankar and his Australian counterpart Penny Wong, can be easily and freely viewed in Canada.Indian govt had earlier accused Canada of “hypocrisy” on the issue of freedom of speech in banning Australia Today. “In Canada, Meta, which owns and operates Facebook and Instagram, blocked sharing of news content on their sites, irrespective of the outlet,” said the Canadian statement.“This is due to a decision by Meta to block news on its social media platforms in Canada since 2023. This is in line with a broader business strategy on Meta’s part to de-emphasise news on its platforms globally,” it added.","Canada denies it ever banned Australia Today, the Indian diaspora-focused media outlet operating from down under.

India to seek early adoption of climate finance definition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-seek-early-adoption-of-climate-finance-definition/articleshow/115152797.cms,"BAKU: India will call for early adoption of the definition of climate finance to bring transparency in the process of its mobilisation and continue to engage constructively in all negotiations at the 29th session of UN climate conference (CO), beginning on Monday, said the country’s environment secretary Leena Nandan .“Transparency and predictability within climate finance mechanisms are paramount,” Nandan told TOI ahead of the 12-day mega climate talks, where over 190 countries are expected to adopt a new post-2025 finance goal to mobilise adequate finance for helping developing countries implement their updated climate actions — both mitigation and adaptation.The road to a new goal appears to be quite tough at this stage, specifically after Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election as he had always been opposed to the Paris Agreement and any of the decisions taken by the Joe Biden administration under the pact.“It is important for us the discussion at CO adheres to certain principles during finalisation of the NCQG,” said Nandan while stressing on its alignment with principles of UN Convention (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement.Sharing the country’s broad strategy at CO, she said, “India will continue to engage positively and constructively in all negotiations while safeguarding its key interests, keeping in view common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) of developed and developing countries; flexibilities for developing countries; and consideration of foundational principles of the convention and its Paris Agreement.”Her remarks assume significance as it means India will be strongly opposed to any move of developed nations to dilute UN Convention’s basic principles that put bigger responsibilities on rich nations to not only substantially reduce their carbon emissions but also contribute to climate fund.","The road to a new goal appears to be quite tough at this stage, specifically after Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election as he had always been opposed to the Paris Agreement.

Judges' vacancies lowest in southern high courts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-vacancies-lowest-in-southern-high-courts/articleshow/115152755.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Why is it that high courts in the southern states have managed to bring down judges’ vacancies to as low as 4% of their sanctioned strength, while the largest ones in other parts of the country have as high as 49%?A TOI analysis shows the constitutional courts in southern states have reversed the trend of perpetual large vacancies of judges as against their counterparts in other states.Kerala HC, for instance, has managed to bring vacancies down to 4%, as on Nov 1, lowest among all big HCs. Others in the region like Madras HC has brought it down to 11% and Karnataka HC to 19%.In contrast, Allahabad HC, the country’s largest HC with a sanctioned strength of 160 judges, has 49% of its judges’ posts vacant, the highest among all 25 HCs. The situation is somewhat similar elsewhere with Orissa HC having 42% vacancies, followed by Calcutta at 40%, and 38% each in Punjab & Haryana, Delhi and Gujarat; and 27% in Bombay.The vacancy issue is a perennial problem troubling higher judiciary, and govt equally. One of the reasons often cited for not finding suitable candidates is the unwillingness of acclaimed lawyers to join the bench as they find the quantum of work too disproportionate to the remuneration offered.The other factor, which probably explains why HCs in the southern states have managed to bring down vacancies significantly, is timely recommendations by the collegium on appointment of judges.As per norms, the chief justice of HC concerned has to initiate a proposal for elevation of an advocate, or from among district judges, for judgeship of HC at least six months prior to the occurrence of the vacancy. However, this timeline is seldom followed, the law minister had said in a written response to a Parliament question during the last monsoon session.The law minister further said that as on July 19, govt had received only 219 recommendations, which were at different stages of processing, as against vacancies of 357 judges. For the 138 remaining vacancies, there were no recommendations made by the collegiums of HCs concerned. Though recommendations are made by a collegium of three senior-most judges of the HC concerned, the final appointment is made with the approval of SC collegium, after an independent vetting by IB. As on Nov 1, 25 HCs in the country had 352 judges’ posts vacant, which is 32% of their sanctioned strength of 1,114.","Kerala HC, for instance, has managed to bring vacancies down to 4%, lowest among all big HCs.

The opposition party has called it a “blatant violation” of the Model Code of Conduct and election-related laws.Congress urged the EC to issue directions for “immediate takedown of the all videos” and sought that urgent action be taken against BJP and its official Facebook handle for Jharkhand.Congress’s Jairam Ramesh alleged that in an advertisement published on Nov 9 the BJP had first tried to use actors who resemble the netas of JMM, INC and RJD and then allegedly raise “several blatantly false allegations” against them.“One of the allegations is that these leaders are ‘anti-Adivasi’ who are banding together under the garb of being pro-Adivasi to ultimately serve their own personal agendas,” Congress complained.“Given that state assembly polls are presently underway in Jharkhand, it is submitted that BJP is required to have its advertisement approved by the EC in accordance with electoral norms of conduct,” Congress said, adding “there is no plausible scenario in which such an ex facie and total violation of electoral norms is allowed to be published by the EC.”",Congress has filed a complaint with the Election Commission against BJP’s official Facebook page handle for Jharkhand.

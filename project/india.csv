"All 7 NCP MLAs in Nagaland merge with NDPP, give CM Rio absolute majority in assembly",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-7-ncp-mlas-in-nagaland-merge-with-ndpp-give-cm-rio-absolute-majority-in-assembly/articleshow/121545081.cms,".

All seven Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs in Nagaland joined the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), giving the Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio-led party an absolute majority in the 60-member assembly.With this merger, the NDPP's tally increased from 25 to 32. NCP emerged as the third-largest party in the 2023 assembly elections, after the NDPP and its ally BJP, which won 12 seats.Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Nagaland Government Spokesperson KG Kenye said that the NCP, the third-largest group in the state assembly with 7 members, has formally merged with the NDPP.""We have been joined by a few more friends in the NDPP party force this evening; there are 9 groups in the state assembly this time and out of that, the NCP party is the third largest group in the state assembly with 7 members,"" said Kenye, who is also a minister in the state.The Speaker of the House has accepted the merger application. As a result, the NDPP's strength in the state assembly has increased from 25 to 32 members.Kenye emphasised that this development will strengthen Chief Minister Dr Rio's leadership and enhance the government's ability to serve the people.He clarified that coalition seat-sharing arrangements are not permanent and may be reconsidered in future elections.On the ministerial reshuffling, he stated that it falls under the Chief Minister's prerogative.Addressing the reason behind the merger move, he explained that national parties like the NCP face constraints in addressing state-specific issues. The move was motivated by the desire for a more state-focused political approach.He pointed out that the merger was influenced by both political necessity and the leadership appeal of the current government and NDPP leaders.Apart from 32 NDPP and 12 BJP MLAs, the state assembly has five NPP legislators, two members each of the LJP (Ram Vilas), Naga People's Front and RPI (Athawale, a JD (U) MLA and four independents.","All seven Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs in Nagaland joined the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) NCP emerged as the third-largest party in the 2023 assembly elections, after the NDPP and its ally BJP, which won 12 seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121545129,imgsize-28278,width-400,resizemode-4/121545129.jpg"

You and any order given by you are greater than God. If you are there then I have everything. I just need your trust and love and nothing else,” Tej Pratap posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Papa, if you were not there then this party would not have been there and neither would greedy people like Jaichand who do politics with me. Just mummy papa, may you both always be healthy and happy. ”The post came days after the RJD patriarch expelled his eldest son from the party for six years, accusing him of disregarding moral values and harming the family’s principles. The decision followed a controversial Facebook post by Tej Pratap in which he revealed a 12-year-long relationship with a woman named Anushka, a post he later said was the result of his account being “hacked.”“Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice,” Lalu had written in his own X post on May 26.“The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family.”Lalu added that while his son is “capable of judging what is right or wrong in his personal life,” those choosing to associate with him should do so at their own discretion.Reacting to the development, Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap’s younger brother and RJD’s key face in Bihar, stated that the party maintains a clear boundary between personal and political conduct. “We cannot tolerate such things. If it's about my big brother, political life and personal life are different. He has the right to make his personal decisions,” he told the media.The family dispute reignited public attention on Tej Pratap’s past, including his failed marriage with Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai.

KOLKATA: In what otherwise seemed like a perfect kidnapping of a trader for ransom, the panic-stricken wife's unwitting transfer of part of the money via UPI to one of the kidnappers proved to be their Achilles' heel, landing them behind bars in Kolkata on Saturday.Five kidnappers had abducted Timir Kanti Majumder, a trader from South 24 Parganas district's Kulpi, Wednesday from near Netaji Bhavan Metro station in Kolkata, where he had gone for some bank work. They kept him captive in an 11th-floor flat of a condominium on SC Mullick Road, near Jadavpur's Sulekha area.The accused used Majumder's phone to contact his wife via WhatsApp call, demanding a ransom of Rs 10 lakh, which was later negotiated down to Rs 5 lakh. Panicked upon receiving the ransom calls, the victim's wife told the kidnappers she needed time to arrange the money. As a token amount, she sent Rs 10,000 via UPI to one of the accused, Suman Bose, police said.The UPI transaction gave police a breakthrough, leading to the arrest of all five accused within four hours of the rescue operation. ""We located Bose near Sukanta Setu. He was nabbed and questioned extensively before he led us to the flat inside the Jadavpur condo.He also helped us locate the victim,"" said an investigating officer.""The main hurdle in the investigation was locating any suspect, as neither the complainant, Majumder's wife Tapasi, nor her family could provide any leads. The suspects weren't using their own mobile phones,"" said DC Priyabrata Roy. The accused had kept their phones switched off and used the victim's device to place ransom calls over a WiFi network.Police have booked accused Sajal Bose (43), Sudip Mazumder (39), Suman Bose (51), Samir Kumar Deb (51), and Sandipan alias Chima Das (39), for kidnapping for ransom, said Joint CP (Crime) Rupesh Kumar.""It seems a dispute over financial transactions led to the trader's kidnapping. The accused claimed the victim owed them lakhs of rupees. However, the complainant denies this, saying Majumder was tricked in a business venture. What is clear is that the accused and the victim knew each other,"" said another officer.","Timir Kanti Majumder, a trader from South 24 Parganas district's Kulpi, was abducted Wednesday.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26.

Pakistan's Strategic Bitcoin reserve plans

Pakistan’s scramble to please US President Donald Trump by establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve seems to have landed it in a soup! According to a report in the Dawn, senior officials in Islamabad have said that cryptocurrency remains banned in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan and the Ministry of Finance both clarified that cryptocurrency transactions remain prohibited in Pakistan, with all such dealings considered unlawful under existing regulations.At a session of the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal explained that despite the recent establishment of a Crypto Council by the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through executive order to explore digital asset policies, the prohibition on cryptocurrency remains enforced under SBP and SECP guidelines.According to the Dawn report, Bosal said, ""There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan."" He emphasised that formal legislation would be necessary to alter the current status.Also Read | Donald Trump’s trade policy thrown into turmoil!

Poll hould there be a comprehensive review of India's defense preparedness? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday targeted the Modi government following the remarks made by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Operation Sindoor in an interview in Singapore. Kharge claimed that the nation had been misled and demanded a special session of Parliament to address the issue.“In the wake of the remarks made by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in Singapore in an interview, there are some very important questions which need to be asked. These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened. The Modi Govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,” Kharge said in a post on X.Kharge referenced CDS Chauhan who had earlier today, firmly dismissed Pakistan's claims that it had downed six Indian warplanes during Operation Sindoor, describing the statement as ""absolutely incorrect"". Speaking toduring the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, he said, ""What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being downed."" He explained that the Indian Armed Forces identified tactical errors, corrected them, and resumed operations within two days.Also read: What CDS Anil Chauhan said on Pakistan's claim of downing India jets during Operation Sindoor Kharge lauded the bravery of IAF pilots, saying: “Our IAF pilots were risking their lives fighting the enemy. We have suffered some losses, but our pilots were safe. We salute their resolute courage and bravery.” However, he stressed that a “comprehensive strategic review is the need of the hour.”“The Congress party demands a Comprehensive Review of our Defence Preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil Review Committee,” he added.Kharge also raised concerns over US President Donald Trump’s repeated claim that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. “This is a direct affront to the Shimla Agreement,” he said, questioning why the Modi government had not provided clarity on Trump’s assertions or the affidavit filed by the US Secretary of Commerce in a United States court.“Instead of clarifying Mr. Trump's repeated assertions, and the affidavit filed by US Secretary of Commerce in the United States Court of International Trade, PM Modi is on an election blitz, taking PERSONAL CREDIT for the valour of our Armed Forces, hiding behind their bravery and dodging the contours of the agreed CEASEFIRE, which the Foreign Secretary announced on 10th, after Mr. Trump's tweet,” Kharge said. “Is India and Pakistan now again hyphenated? What are the conditions of the CEASEFIRE agreement? Rs 140 Cr Patriotic Indians deserve to know this. ”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh echoed Kharge’s concerns, criticising the lack of transparency from the government. “It is an extraordinary and telling commentary on Undeclared Emergency that the PM will not chair all-party meetings and will not take Parliament into confidence but the nation gets to know of the first phase of Operation Sindoor through the CDS’s interview in Singapore,” Ramesh posted on X. “Couldn't opposition leaders have been taken into confidence by the PM earlier?”General Chauhan, while speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, rejected the idea that India and Pakistan had approached nuclear confrontation, calling such claims “far-fetched.” He also dismissed Pakistan’s claims about the success of Chinese-supplied weapons, saying they “didn’t work,” and asserted that India had conducted precision strikes 300 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory.",Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge targeted the Modi government following the remarks made by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: India's active Covid-19 cases have crossed the 3,000 threshold, with Kerala reporting the highest number of infections, according to data released by the Union health ministry on Saturday. The number of active cases has risen sharply from 257 on May 22 to 3,395 as of May 31. In the last 24 hours alone, 685 new cases were recorded, and four deaths were reported, one each in Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.Health officials maintain there is no reason for alarm. “The severity of infections is low, with most patients under home care,” an official source told news agency PTI.Dr Rajiv Behl, Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said on Monday that genome sequencing from affected regions in the west and south of India confirmed that the variants driving the latest increase are all Omicron subvariants — LF.7, XFG, JN.1, and NB.1.8.1. “We should monitor and be vigilant, but there is no cause to worry,” he said.The rise in active cases is most pronounced in Kerala (1,336), followed by Maharashtra (467), Delhi (375), Gujarat (265), Karnataka (234), West Bengal (205), Tamil Nadu (185) and Uttar Pradesh (117).Delhi reported the death of a 60-year-old woman who had acute intestinal obstruction, while Karnataka reported a 63-year-old cancer patient who had co-morbidities including tuberculosis.Odisha health secretary Aswathy S urged residents not to panic, assuring that all seven patients in the state are stable and the situation remains under control. “The latest ICMR report says that the present variant does not exhibit severe symptoms, and most cases are mild,” she said.Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta has reiterated that the city’s hospitals are well-prepared. “Nineteen patients are hospitalised in Delhi, but there is no need to worry.

A portion of these cases will undergo RT-PCR testing, and symptomatic individuals among vulnerable groups — including children, the elderly, and pregnant women, must be tested.The advisory also mandates the tracking of positivity rates and CT values, genome sequencing of severe cases, and sewage surveillance where applicable.With schools set to reopen in June, a separate circular instructed schools to send symptomatic children home and ensure that teachers and staff do not work while ill. “Avoid crowded or poorly ventilated areas, especially for immunocompromised individuals,” the circular said.","India's active Covid-19 cases have crossed the 3,000 threshold.

Kolkata Police: ‘Legal procedures followed’

Suvendu Adhikari slams arrest as 'appeasement politics'

NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old Instagram influencer, Sharmishtha Panoli, on Saturday was remanded to 14-day judicial custody after she was arrested by Kolkata Police for allegedly making communal remarks in a social media video. The law student, originally from Kolkata’s Anandapur area and currently enrolled at a Pune-based university, was apprehended in Gurugram on Friday night after reportedly evading multiple police summons.The video in question featured Panoli criticising Bollywood actors for their silence on Operation Sindoor , as per police sources cited by news agency. The post went viral and triggered a wave of backlash, prompting her to delete the video and issue an apology. However, by then, a formal complaint had been filed in Kolkata and legal proceedings had commenced.Panoli was produced in a Kolkata court on Saturday, where her bail plea was rejected and she was remanded to judicial custody until June 13,reported. She has been charged under several sections related to promoting enmity between groups and causing religious disharmony.In response to online speculation about the legality of the arrest, Kolkata Police issued a statement clarifying that all due process was followed.“In reference to Garden Reach Police Station Case No. 136 dated 15.05.2025, certain social media narratives suggesting an unlawful arrest of a law student are factually incorrect and misleading,” the statement read. “All legal procedures were duly adhered to. Multiple attempts were made to serve notice, but she was absconding each time. A competent court then issued an arrest warrant, and she was apprehended lawfully from Gurugram. ”The statement added that she was produced before a magistrate and granted transit remand as per legal norms.Reacting to the arrest, BJP leader and West Bengal Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari accused the state government of selective action.“FIRs were filed against Mahua Moitra for derogatory remarks about Goddess Kali. Was any action taken? Saayoni Ghosh made comments about Mahadev. Nothing happened,” Adhikari said. “This is appeasement politics. Action is only taken against Sanatanis while others have a licence to abuse Sanatana Dharma.”Adhikari claimed that several FIRs against TMC leaders had been ignored and accused the ruling party of using religion as a political tool to secure its vote bank.","Sharmishtha Panoli, 22, was arrested for allegedly making communal remarks in a social media video.

Poll Do you support the nullification of Article 370? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The all-party delegations visiting various countries to expose Pakistan post the Pahalgam attack seem to be becoming a headache for the Congress with senior party leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid's recent remarks backing nullification of Article 370 in 2019 by the Modi government likely to discomfit the Congress. This comes after another delegation member, Shashi Tharoor, faced strong criticism from within the party for his statement that India crossed the line of control (LoC) to conduct surgical strikes ""for the first time"" under the Modi government.While addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia on Friday, Khurshid said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to Jammu & Kashmir following the abrogation. Khurshid is part of one of the seven- all party delegations currently touring various countries. The Congress had initially opposed the move to scrap Article 370. The party later nuanced its position and has since been ambivalent on the issue of restoration of the Article which granted J&K special status.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country.But Article 370 was abrogated, it was finally put to an end, because so much time had passed.,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir, it is very unfortunate. It will give a setback to anybody,"" Khurshid further said.While the senior leadership made no comment on Khurshid's remarks, unease within the party has been brewing ever since the government announced the names for the 51 members of the all-party delegations. The Congress had accused the Modi government of ""complete insincerity"" and for playing ""cheap political games"" while highlighting that ""regrettably"" only one of the four names suggested by the Congress leadership has been included. However, the opposition party relented, allowing ""eminent"" party members selected by the government to go with the delegations and make their contribution.The Congress had submitted the names of Anand Sharma, Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain, and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. However, the delegation finalised by the government includes Shashi Tharoor who is leading a delegation.

NEW DELHI: At least 18 people have died and dozens have been displaced across five Northeastern states as relentless rainfall triggered widespread landslides and flash floods over the past 48 hours. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued fresh warnings of heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in the region till May 31.In Mizoram, four people were killed in separate incidents triggered by landslides caused by heavy rainfall over the past two days. Among the dead were three members of a family in Champhai district and one person in Serchhip. One person remains trapped under the debris.Landslides and floods have been reported from at least 10 districts including Aizawl, Lunglei, Kolasib, Mamit, Champhai, and Serchhip. According to the Mizoram State Disaster Management and Rehabilitation Department, over 15 houses were destroyed and many roads have become inaccessible.Mizoram disaster management minister prof. Lalnilawma visited the State Emergency Operations Centre to assess the situation and announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia for the families of the deceased.“I assure the people that the government is doing everything it can. Relief operations are ongoing despite the difficult terrain,” he said.Governor Lt Gen VK Singh (retd) expressed condolences and urged residents in disaster-prone areas to remain alert and cooperative.In Arunachal Pradesh, nine people were killed in two separate incidents caused by heavy rains.A major tragedy occurred in East Kameng district on Friday night when a landslide on National Highway 13 pushed a vehicle carrying seven people into a deep gorge. All passengers — including a pregnant woman, three children, and three others — were from Kitchang village and were returning from Seppa town.“Due to darkness and another slide nearby, we had to halt operations. All seven bodies were recovered this morning,” said East Kameng Superintendent of Police Kamdam Sikom on Saturday.In a separate incident, two labourers were buried alive in a cabbage field in Lower Subansiri district on Saturday after a landslide hit the area where they were working.Meanwhile, in Upper Subansiri district’s Daporijo town, flash floods triggered by the overflowing Sigin river damaged over 117 houses. Authorities have issued prohibitory orders in several vulnerable areas to prevent further casualties.In Manipur, heavy rainfall has led to city-wide flooding in Imphal, affecting hundreds of homes and disrupting road traffic. Chief Secretary Prashant Kumar Singh said that emergency services and municipal departments were on high alert.The Indian Army deployed eight rescue columns to assist the civil administration. Among those rescued were members of a private radio broadcast team stranded in a low-lying area of Imphal.“The water level is dangerously high in several areas. People are advised to move to safer locations,” said an official from the Manipur Disaster Management Authority.In Assam, five people have died due to landslides across Guwahati’s Kamrup Metro district in the past 24 hours. The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) confirmed that the incidents were reported from multiple locations including Noonmati, Kahilipara, and Hengerabari.Tree falls, road blockages, and power outages were reported across the city, leading to panic and severe traffic congestion.“We are keeping a close watch and have mobilized our emergency response teams,” said an ASDMA spokesperson.Sikkim has been placed under red alert as continuous rainfall over the past week has sharply raised the water level in the Teesta river. The state’s Emergency Operations Centre said landslides were reported from Mangan, Gyalshing, and Soreng districts.Although no casualties have been reported so far, district officials have asked people in low-lying and landslide-prone areas to remain cautious and prepare for possible evacuations.According to the IMD, the ongoing heavy rainfall in the Northeast is due to a combination of a depression over Bangladesh and a western disturbance approaching northwest India. The IMD warned of “extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places” accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning.Disaster management authorities in all affected states have ramped up relief efforts, cleared road blockades, and opened relief camps. People are being urged to avoid venturing near rivers, landslide-prone hillsides, and waterlogged streets.“The situation remains critical.

A shell exploded near an under-construction building beside his room, sending metal splinters flying. Four students were wounded. Qari Iqbal, a 46-year-old Quran teacher, was declared dead on arrival at the district hospital.As bombs rained on Poonch for three days, 14 civilians lost their lives, including students, religious teachers, shopkeepers, homemakers, and former soldiers. Over 65 were wounded — many with life-altering scars.Panic spread faster than the blasts. Families fled, streets emptied, The district fell silent under fear.“Not even in 1965 did we witness this kind of bombardment,” said Zulfikhar Ali, a shopkeeper in Poonch town’s main market. “Everyone who could afford to leave, left.”From May 6 night to May 10, five shells landed outside BJP functionary Pradeep Sharma’s home. “It began at 1.45 am and didn’t stop for days,” Sharma said. “Doctors worked tirelessly, but if we had ventilators, we might have saved six to eight more. We need a trauma hospital here, a govt medical college.”Sharma said 80% of Poonch fled by May 10. He demanded bunkers for every household and government jobs, not just for families of the dead but also for those wounded in the shelling. “Thirty-five of them have lifelong wounds,” he said. “They’re living with trauma too.”Amid loss and grief, another wound cut deep — one of defamation. Hours after Qari Iqbal’s death, Delhi-based news channels flashed his photo on screen, calling him a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist killed in Operation Sindoor.At Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom on May 30, his brother Farooq Ahmad sat quietly, his face sunken. “We were already mourning, and then we got WhatsApp forwards. Friends asked, ‘Why are news channels calling your brother a terrorist?’ He had a beard and a Muslim name. That was enough for them to brand him something he wasn’t. Even in death, he was humiliated.”Authorities moved quickly. Poonch police and district officials called the reports “baseless and misleading”. Legal action was threatened against any outlet or person spreading false claims. Both CM Omar Abdullah and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi visited the Jamia and were briefed about the slander.Nazira Kousar, a mother from Poonch, rushed through falling shells to the hospital on May 7. Her 14-year-old son had been wounded at the seminary. “Nothing could stop me,” she said. “He survived, but now hides under a blanket, afraid to go outside. My husband has liver disease. We can’t afford treatment.” She came back on May 30, hoping someone would listen.On May 31, Union home minister Amit Shah handed job appointment letters to the next of kin. Dalbir Singh, who lost his brother Ranjit Singh, a grocery shop owner, received one. “He never married. He was calm and lovable,” Dalbir said. “I feel the sky has fallen on us. I just want this to end.”At least five members of the local Sikh community died, including former Army officer Amarjeet Singh, homemaker Ruby Kaur, and neighbour Amreek Singh. A gurdwara wall was damaged in the shelling. As Poonch recovers from three days of unrelenting fire, scars remain — carved in stone and memory.","14 civilians lost their lives, including students, religious teachers, shopkeepers, homemakers, and former soldiers.

(With inputs from agencies)

India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines, broadening its defense ties beyond the US as it faces mounting security challenges and looks to shore up its indigenous aerospace capabilities, a Bloomberg report said. Senior officials told Bloomberg that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will evaluate these proposals, with the aim to start the project swiftly.The countries in talks-UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s Safran, and an undisclosed Japanese partner-are all offering technology transfers and potential co-production arrangements, according to people familiar with the matter. Rolls-Royce offered to jointly produce and transfer technology to India during a visit by senior defense ministry officials to the UK in April, while Safran is reportedly open to sharing intellectual property rights, the Bloomberg report said.India’s push to diversify its fighter jet engine partnerships signals a strategic rebalancing in its defense policy. For decades, India’s defense ties leaned heavily on Russian suppliers, with growing partnerships with the US in the past decade. However, India’s decision to explore new partners highlights a shift: an urgent focus on reliability, supply chain security, and technological self-sufficiency amid global uncertainties.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh warned at an industry event on Thursday that delays in acquiring critical weapons “pose a serious challenge to national defense readiness,” adding bluntly, “Not for a single project that I can think of that has been completed on time.” His remarks underscore why India is moving beyond a single-source approach, especially after penalties were imposed on General Electric for delivery delays on engines that power India’s locally-made Tejas light combat jets.India’s military modernization push has been a long time coming, with delays plaguing every step of the way. Singh’s remarks-“once a timeline is given… not a single project that I can think of has been completed on time”-reflect growing impatience within India’s defense establishment.State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) has faced flak for delays in delivering Tejas Mark-1A jets, forcing the government to pivot to private sector involvement to speed things up. The new execution model for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) is a radical shift, designed to harness private innovation and global expertise while ending HAL’s monopoly on fighter production.India’s ambition is to power its twin-engine fifth-generation fighter jets-currently under the AMCA project-with engines co-developed or built domestically in collaboration with global partners. The AMCA program is part of India’s larger vision to modernize its aging, largely Russian-made air force fleet and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.Defense minister Rajnath Singh has approved a new “execution model” for the AMCA, which for the first time allows private sector firms to bid for the project alongside the HAL. Officials say the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), which is leading the project, will soon issue an expression of interest to domestic and international players.The project’s significance is clear: China’s rapidly advancing J-20 and rumored sixth-generation jets have raised alarm bells in Delhi. Meanwhile, Pakistan is set to acquire at least 40 Chinese J-35A fifth-generation fighters. With only 30 active fighter squadrons against an authorized strength of 42, India needs to catch up-and quickly.Michael Rubin, a South Asia analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, described India’s drive as part of a “broader effort to secure the supply chain for critical defense equipment.” He noted that the “military lesson from Ukraine’s war has been clear: self-sufficiency and reliable partnerships are paramount.”Meanwhile, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh emphasized in his CII Business Summit remarks, “We need to quickly get our act together… while design in India continues to produce results in the near future or maybe later, what is required today is required today.”India’s defense collaborations are moving from traditional vendor relationships to true joint development. Rolls-Royce, for example, offered to share cutting-edge engine technology, while Safran has expressed willingness to co-create intellectual property within India-key for India’s ambitions to be more than just an assembly hub.Japan, too, has signaled openness to deeper defense industrial ties, aligning with India’s vision of a broader Indo-Pacific security network. Defence minister Rajnath Singh held talks in May with his Japanese counterpart, exploring potential collaborations in tank and aero engine development.These moves do not indicate a cooling of India-US ties-joint manufacturing of GE’s F414 engines is still a cornerstone of Indo-US defense cooperation. But delays in that deal have prompted India to cast a wider net, underscoring that while Washington remains a top partner, India wants alternatives to hedge against risks.Indeed, India’s engagement with the UK, France, and Japan is about more than just hardware-it’s about building strategic resilience in the defense sector. A senior official involved in the negotiations said the goal is not to sideline US defense ties but “to ensure we have multiple options, as this is about national security.”India aims to finalise the AMCA’s prototype phase by developing five aircraft before moving to series production.For the first two AMCA squadrons, India will rely on the US-made GE F414 engines. But for the remaining five squadrons-over 100 jets-it wants more powerful 110-kilonewton engines built with technology partners outside the US, according to the officials.India’s broader defense transformation, its AMCA program, and its engagement with multiple global players highlight a fundamental truth: for New Delhi, defense self-reliance and resilient supply chains are no longer optional-they are non-negotiable in a rapidly changing world.","India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines.

NASHIK: The Bhadrakali police arrested a 40-year-old principal of a private nursing college in Dwarka locality of Nashik in Maharashtra over the charge of molesting a minor student.Police filed additional charges under Prevention of Atrocities Act, as the victim belongs to a Scheduled Tribe community, along with sections under BNS and the stringent Pocso Act.P olice said the accused resides at Police Line Road in Pathardi and, that, the principal pulled the victim's ""dupatta"", touched her inappropriately, and solicited sexual favours, repeatedly, between Aug 5, 2024, and April 29, 2025.Following the initial complaint, three additional students from the same institution came forward with similar charges. The accused appeared before a city court on Saturday and was remanded in police custody for two days until Monday.Police said separate arrests would be made for each of the four registered cases adding that the complainants know each other, suggesting that the first complaint may have encouraged the other three students to report their experiences with the principal.","The 40-year-old principal of a private nursing college in Dwarka locality of Nashik in Maharashtra was arrested over the charge of molesting a minor student.

"New apprenticeship policy to link degrees, raise stipends",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-apprenticeship-policy-to-link-degrees-raise-stipends/articleshow/121544411.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Centre has proposed comprehensive reforms to revitalise the apprenticeship ecosystem. Key measures include an inflation-linked hike in stipend rates, from the current Rs 5,000-9,000 to Rs 6,800-12,300, to reduce dropout rates and attract diverse talent.The reforms also formalise Apprenticeship Embedded Degree Programmes (AEDP), enabling apprentices to earn recognised degrees alongside practical training. Additionally, the policy aims to enable global deployment of apprentices at overseas client sites and expand training delivery through digital and virtual platforms.These proposals come amid persistent structural challenges within the apprenticeship framework. An official from ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE) said, ""The proposed stipend increase is essential to curb dropouts and make apprenticeships viable, especially in sectors like technology, manufacturing, and services where living and commuting costs can be prohibitive.""A 2022 parliamentary standing committee report recommended convergence through a unified operational and digital infrastructure.Industry participation, particularly among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), remains limited due to administrative complexity, compliance burdens, and lack of awareness. Regional disparities persist, with only 1.2% of apprentices from the North-East despite targeted benefits. Female participation, while improving, continues to lag behind overall workforce levels.Fragmentation between ministry of education and MSDE - which run National Apprenticeship Training Scheme (NATS) and Pradhan Mantri National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (PM-NAPS), respectively - has caused duplication and inefficiencies. ""We are developing a unified apprenticeship portal to integrate certification, data sharing, and employer outreach. This will simplify processes, reduce compliance friction, and improve access for both apprentices and employers,"" the official added.The 38th meeting of Central Apprenticeship Council, chaired by Jayant Chaudhary, minister of state (independent charge), MSDE, recently discussed these proposals and charted a forward-looking policy roadmap. The reforms include targeted inclusion measures for women, persons with disabilities (PwDs), and youth from the northeastern region (NER). The official noted: ""Expanding participation from under-represented groups, particularly from the North-East and PwDs, is a key priority. The pilot project launched in Mizoram, providing an additional Rs 1,500 monthly stipend to over 26,000 apprentices, highlights our commitment.""Formal regulation of AEDPs will allow apprentices to earn recognised degrees alongside hands-on training, strengthening the link between education and industry needs. ""Only 0.27% of India's workforce are apprentices, compared to 3% in the UK and Germany. Attrition rates remain high. Inflation-linked stipends and degree-linked apprenticeships will help reduce attrition and sustain a steady talent supply,"" said Nipun Sharma, CEO, degree apprenticeship, Team Lease. He also pointed out the low female participation, despite sectors like electronics manufacturing and smartphone assembly preferring female workers.On global deployment plan, the official said, ""Allowing apprentices to gain experience at overseas client sites will expose them to international standards and prepare them for a competitive global workforce.""","Centre has proposed comprehensive reforms to revitalise the apprenticeship ecosystem.

Spent 15% of time nixing fake news during Op Sindoor: CDS Anil Chauhan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spent-15-of-time-nixing-fake-news-during-op-sindoor-cds/articleshow/121544057.cms,"File photo: CDS Anil Chauhan

NEW DELHI: Almost 15% of the operational time during Operation Sindoor was spent countering fake narratives and disinformation, CDS Gen Anil Chauhan said Saturday, describing the four-day hostilities with Pakistan as a ""non-contact and multi-domain"" conflict involving both kinetic and non-kinetic elements that ""exemplifies the future of war"".""During the crisis, India retained full operational clarity and autonomy, regardless of broader geopolitical currents,"" the CDS said during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore as well as in interviews on its sidelines.India did not detect ""any unusual activity"" on the ""operational or tactical depth"" along the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China during this time, although Islamabad is closely allied with Beijing, he added.Moreover, while Pakistan may have leveraged Chinese commercial satellite imagery, the CDS said there is ""no proof of real-time targeting support"" provided by Beijing during Operation Sindoor.This came in the backdrop of there being no signs of de-escalation and de-induction of troops between the Indian and Chinese armies along the LAC as yet after disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct.Noting that almost 80% of the equipment procured by Pakistan over the last few years has been from China, the CDS said some kind of support and maintenance from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) would certainly have been provided during the conflict.""India, by contrast, relied on indigenous systems like Akash, achieving success through effective system networking, integrating both domestic and foreign radars into a cohesive defence structure,"" Gen Chauhan said.Politically, the CDS said, India has drawn a new redline against terrorism and proxy war emanating from Pakistan, and ""hopefully our adversary will learn lessons"" from Operation Sindoor.While cross-border hostilities have ceased with effect from 5 pm on May 10, the Indian government had made it clear it would respond ""precisely and decisively"" should there be any further terror attacks with a Pakistani imprint. ""So that has its own dynamics as far as the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7,"" he said.On the massive disinformation campaign, the CDS underlined the need for a dedicated information warfare vertical. India's strategy laid stress on fact-based communication, even at the cost of slower responses. Initially, two women officers served as spokespersons, while the senior military leadership was engaged in operations. Only after May 10, Army, IAF and Navy DGMOs briefed the media, he said.Gen Chauhan also said that cyber operations played a limited role during the conflict. While there were some denial-of-service attacks, India's air-gapped military systems remained secure. While public platforms faced minor disruptions, operational systems were unaffected, he said.","India did not detect ""any unusual activity"" on the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China during this time.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan violated the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) through ""unrelenting cross-border terrorism"", India said at an international forum in Tajikistan and justified its action of putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam terrorist attack.The remarks, articulated by junior environment and external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh at the Glaciers' Preservation conference in Dushanbe, came on Friday after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, at the UN-led global forum, accused India of weaponising water.Strongly condemning Pakistan's attempt to misuse the forum by raising IWT issues, Singh said the treaty's preamble stated that it was concluded in the spirit of goodwill and friendship, and that honouring the treaty in good faith was essential, but the cross-border terrorism from Pakistan interfered with its implementation.""We are appalled at the attempt by Pakistan to misuse the forum and to bring in unwarranted references to issues which do not fall within the purview of the forum. We strongly condemned such an attempt,"" said Singh, addressing the plenary session of the conference.The minister said it was an undeniable fact that there had been fundamental changes in circumstances - technological advancements, demographic changes, climate change and the ongoing threat of cross-border terrorism - since the treaty was signed, which now required a reassessment of its obligations.His remark is in sync with a clear understanding within government quarters about the need to revise the terms of the treaty, which has long been considered loaded against the interests of India.""Pakistan, which itself is in violation of the treaty, should desist from putting the blame of the breach of the treaty on India,"" said Singh.Sharif on Friday said his country would not allow India to cross the red line by holding IWT in abeyance, accusing it of endangering millions.Referring to the theme of the conference, Singh also gave details of what signified the change in circumstances as far as the impact of climate change was concerned and emphasised that the retreat of glaciers represented not only a warning but an immediate reality with far-reaching implications for water security, biodiversity and the livelihoods of billions of people. The minister underscored that the phenomenon was accelerating, with disproportionate impacts on mountain regions such as the Himalayas.","Pakistan violated Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) through ""unrelenting cross-border terrorism,"" India says.

Valmik Thapar was tiger's most tireless advocate

JAIPUR: Valmik Thapar was 24 - fresh out of St Stephen's with a gold medal in sociology and an old boy from The Doon School. He stood at a crossroads. Life had questions, but no answers. Then the jungle found him. In Ranthambhore, 1976, he met Fateh Singh Rathore - the national park's legendary field director.""Once you've looked into the eyes of a wild tiger,"" Thapar would later write, ""you're never the same."" That encounter didn't just chart a career spanning 50 years, it ignited a cause that would redefine tiger conservation in India.On Saturday morning, a pall of silence fell across Ranthambhore's forests. Thapar, 73, died at his Delhi home after a prolonged battle with cancer. More than just a conservationist, Thapar was a man who walked with tigers - and also an author, documentarian, policy adviser and activist.But to many, Valmik Thapar was the tiger's most tireless advocate. His relationship with Rathore, bloomed into a decades-long partnership that not only saved Ranthambhore's tigers from vanishing but also seeded a national movement for big cat protection.""I met Valmik as a 10-year-old in 1976,"" said Goverdhan Singh Rathore, son of Fateh Singh. ""He was going through a difficult time and came to Ranthambhore seeking peace.""""That meeting with my father led to a friendship that lasted a lifetime. Both led a long-running crusade to save Ranthambhore and its tigers,"" he added.In 1987, Thapar founded Ranthambhore Foundation - one of the first efforts in India to integrate conservation with community uplift. Villages ringing the park became part of the mission.Healthcare, education, women's employment and traditional crafts were woven into a model that linked forest protection to human well-being. NGOs like Dastkar joined the effort, showing conservation didn't need to be a choice between people and animals.Dharmendra Khandal, a close associate and conservation biologist, recalled time in the field with reverence. ""With Valmik sir, it was not just a safari; it was a masterclass in the wild. His energy at 70 was unmatched. Even between safaris, he wouldn't rest - he would invite me home for long, intense conversations about Ranthambhore's future.""Thapar authored nearly 50 books, narrated documentaries including Land of the Tiger for BBC, and served on over 150 committees, including National Board for Wildlife.He was unafraid to call out missteps in govt policy, yet managed to win trust across political and bureaucratic divides. ""He was fearless. Today, he has laid down his armour and gone to eternal rest,"" said Balendu Singh, former honorary warden of Ranthambhore.To those who worked with him, Thapar was a visionary mentor - sharp, driven, and unyielding. ""His booming voice will echo through the valleys of Ranthambhore forever,"" said Goverdhan Singh.Even in his final days, Thapar was deep into writing a two-volume chronicle marking 50 years of Ranthambhore.Wildlife filmmaker Subbiah Nallamuthu, who chronicled India's tigers for global audiences, perhaps captured Thapar's impact best. ""He was the voice through which India's tigers first spoke to the world. Long before streaming platforms and social media, he gave the tiger a language that was poetic, political and proudly Indian. The tiger may have lost a voice, but for those who read his words, watched his films, and walked the trails he once did, that voice still echoes. ""Thapar leaves behind his wife Sanjana Kapoor, daughter of actor Shashi Kapoor, and a life spent tracking pawprints through history.","Valmik Thapar, 73, died at his Delhi home after a prolonged battle with cancer.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an Army officer who refused to participate in regimental weekly religious parades on the grounds that he belonged to the Christian faith.Samuel Kamalesan had challenged his dismissal without pension and gratuity, and sought reinstatement in service. In a May 30 order, a division bench of Justice Navin Chawla and Justice Shalinder Kaur said: ""Our armed forces comprise personnel of all religions, castes, creeds, regions and faiths, whose sole motto is to safeguard the country from external aggressions... They are united by their uniform rather than divided by their religion, caste or region. ""Kamalesan was commissioned in Army in March 2017 as a lieutenant in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, which comprises three squadrons of Sikh, Jat and Rajput personnel. He was made the troop leader of Squadron B, which comprises Sikh personnel.In his plea, Kamalesan stated that his regiment maintained only a mandir and a gurdwara for its religious needs and parades, and not a sarv dharm sthal, which would serve persons of all faiths.He noted that there was no church on the premises.The bench observed that while regiments in the armed forces may historically bear names associated with religion or region, it does not undermine the secular ethos of the institution or of personnel posted in these regiments.""There are also war cries which, to an outsider, may sound religious in nature; however, they serve a purely motivational function, intended to foster solidarity and unity among the troops. At the same time, the armed forces also give due respect to the religious beliefs of their personnel,"" the bench noted.HC observed that Kamalesan kept his religion above a lawful command from his superior, which was clearly an act of indiscipline. ""While, to a civilian, it may appear harsh and even sound far-fetched, the standard of discipline required for the armed forces is different,"" it said.The bench stated the termination order specifically noted that Kamalesan's undisciplined behaviour was against all secular norms of Indian Army and adversely affected the traditional camaraderie between officers and troops of the regiment.Noting that Army organised several counselling sessions for Kamalesan, the court concluded that the decision of termination was taken after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the case and potential consequences of different courses of action.","Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an Army officer who refused to participate in regimental religious parades.

Poll Do you believe that family gatherings can lead to political reconciliations? Yes, they often do No, politics is too complex

MADURAI: Years after their political face-off and estrangement, Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin visited his elder brother and former Union minister M K Alagiri at his house in TVS Nagar in Madurai on Saturday night, soon after concluding his road show in the city.Sources said Alagiri had recently invited Stalin to his house. Accepting the invite, the DMK supremo visited Alagiri's house around 10 pm on Saturday, after several years, and had dinner with his brother and his family.The meeting was a family affair as no ministers accompanied Stalin to Alagiri's house. However, a large number of supporters of Alagiri had gathered in front of his house. They gave a warm reception to the chief minister and presented him with shawls & a 'sengol' (sceptre).This is the second time Stalin has met his brother Alagiri in a long time. He had earlier met his brother in 2024 while visiting his nephew Durai Dayanidhi, who was undergoing treatment at Christian Medical College in Vellore.In 2014, late DMK chief M Karunanidhi had expelled elder son Alagiri from the primary membership for criticising the party and its members. In December 2024, nine Alagiri supporters expelled from DMK in 2014 along with the former Union minister had written a letter to Stalin, seeking his pardon and requesting him to take them back into the party.","Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin visited his elder brother and former Union minister M K Alagiri at his house in TVS Nagar in Madurai on Saturday night.

Poll Do you believe the couple deserved a refund for their unused train tickets? Yes, they should be refunded No, it was their choice

BENGALURU: A senior citizen couple from Hoodi in Whitefield took on the railways and won after being denied refund for a train journey they never made, as their reserved coach was overcrowded and inaccessible, forcing them to return home. Bengaluru Urban II additional district consumer commission has pulled up South Western Railway (SWR) for deficiency in service and ordered a full refund along with litigation costs.The case, earlier dismissed by the forum on July 1, 2023, was challenged again by the couple at the state commission. The appeal was allowed, with the state commission setting aside the earlier order and directing the forum to readmit the complaint.The story began when Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13, paying Rs 892.5 for the trip. On the day of the journey, after reaching the station by auto (spending Rs 165), the couple was shocked to find their S2 coach - and the entire train - packed with passengers, making it impossible for them to board.With no railway staff around to assist, they were forced to abandon the journey and return home.Despite several representations and email follow-ups, the railways neither refunded the ticket fare nor offered any explanation or compensation. Left with no option, the elderly couple filed a consumer complaint citing service lapses.In their complaint, they said they informed the railways post-departure and expected a ticket deposit receipt (TDR) to be raised. But no TDR was filed and no refund or compensation issued.However, the railways, in its defence, denied any service deficiency, claiming that the train was not overcrowded when it arrived at the station. In their written response, railway officials acknowledged their tickets, further stating the train was fully reserved and unreserved travel was restored across the division after Covid. Therefore, they argued, the couple's claims of overcrowding by unauthorised passengers were ""false and baseless"".The railways said 134 passengers boarded from KJM on April 13 with no overcrowding complaints - except the elderly couple. Officials noted the duo didn't report any issue to the station master or RPF on duty, and no crowding was flagged by staff on board.Calling the duo's decision not to board a personal choice, the railways denied any service lapse. It also cited refund rules, saying confirmed tickets are non-refundable unless cancelled or a TDR is filed four hours before departure.However, the railways' own letter dated May 6, 2022, had admitted a spike in ticketless travel and called for issuing unreserved tickets to curb revenue loss - a point the consumer forum said backed the couple's claim.Holding the railways responsible for the couple being unable to board the crowded train during its two-minute halt at 11.53 pm at KJM, the panel said internal records can't override on-ground realities. It ruled the couple faced financial loss and mental agony due to a clear deficiency in service, especially when the full fare was collected.In March this year, the consumer commission ordered the railways to refund Rs 892.5 and pay the complainants Rs 5,000 for deficiency of service, mental agony, and Rs 3000 as litigation costs.","Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13.

CHANDIGARH: The concept of ""deemed confirmation"" cannot override an employer's power to analyse work, conduct and behaviour of a probationer to ensure suitability in service, the Punjab and Haryana high court said, dismissing a petition filed by a former judicial officer of Haryana Civil Services (judicial branch).Upholding the dismissal of the petitioner, Ankur Lal, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Sumeet Goel said ""deemed confirmation"" was ""a perilous concept in service jurisprudence which has long been discarded"", since it erodes into the power of the employer to assess work, conduct and behaviour of the probationer. Besides, it would mean even a person of questionable integrity could enter judicial services, the judges added.""If deemed confirmation is brought into play, notwithstanding the adverse remarks, including that of 'integrity doubtful' based on lacklustre performance, conduct and behaviour of the petitioner, then an anomalous situation would arise where the probationer, despite being unfit for confirmation, is deemed to be confirmed. This would bring into the service a judge of doubtful integrity, whose service record is tainted with adverse remarks.This would be deleterious to the very concept of probity on which the entire judicial system stands,"" the bench said.The petitioner had sought directions to quash the recommendation dated July 23, 2012, for termination of his probationary service as civil judge (junior division). Appointed on Feb 13, 2008, Lal was placed on probation for two years, a period later extended by the high court administration.Following a complaint received from the Ferozepur Jhirka Bar Association, the then acting Chief Justice referred the matter to the administrative committee. On July 18, 2012, the committee recommended Lal's termination in view of his conduct and overall service record during his posting in Bhiwani.Lal, in his petition, argued that under Rule 7.3 of the Rules of 1951, after completing two years of probation plus an extension of one year, and in the backdrop of available vacancies in the cadre, he should have been deemed confirmed.","The Punjab and Haryana high court dismisses a petition filed by a former judicial officer.

CHENNAI: Madras HC has stayed the May 25 decision of Rajiv Gandhi National Institute of Youth Development (RGNIYD) in Sriperumbudur to suspend a second-year PG student for defacing hostel property by painting 'Jai Bhim' and 'Free Palestine' graffiti in his hostel room.Justice T V Thamilselvi directed the institute to allow the student and petitioner, S Aslam, to appear in exams and take part in the internship programme. ""If he is not permitted to attend the examination and internship programme, it will cause undue hardship to the petitioner,"" the court said in its interim order on Thursday.RGNIYD's assistant registrar, Avinav Thakur, the warden, and the assistant warden visited the hostel premises and found Aslam defacing the property with graffiti. An inquiry committee, including Avinav, subsequently suspended Aslam from the institute and expelled him from the hostel.However, Aslam alleged that he was being victimised after he and some other students exposed a pending sexual assault case against Avinav in Jharkhand. He claimed that Avinav influenced the committee and coerced some students to testify against him. The court then adjourned the matter for hearing on June 25.","Madras HC stays Rajiv Gandhi National Institute of Youth Development's decision to suspend PG student for defacing hostel property.

Poll Should police procedures regarding arrests be more strictly regulated? Yes, to protect individual rights. No, current regulations are sufficient.

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court vacation bench on Friday declared the arrest of Anchor Group director Hemang Shah , 50, by Mumbai Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) as illegal, citing failure by police to produce him before a magistrate in 24 hours. The court ordered his immediate release from Arthur Road Jail.The vacation bench, comprising Justices Gauri Godse and Somasekhar Sundaresan, noted that chat messages between the wives of the two brothers supported Hemang Shah's claim that his arrest and continued custody were intended to recover the settlement amount in mediation between family members. The arrest was based on allegations of defrauding his elder brother, Mehul Shah, of Rs 67 crore.Hemang Shah petitioned the HC, arguing that his arrest was illegal since he was not produced before a magistrate within 24 hours as required by law. He was detained at Delhi airport at 5.30 pm on May 17 and produced in court only at 10.45 pm on May 18. The HC agreed, stating that his arrest ""without producing him before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours is completely illegal"" and infringes on fundamental rights under Article 22(2), which mandates such production.The FIR by the elder brother was lodged with Malabar Hill police station in South Mumbai at 2.14 am, and a Look Out Circular (LOC) was issued at the police station's request. The dispute, being resolved before a mediator, is between Hemang on one side and his brother and their father on the other. The FIR was filed during mediation, and Hemang, scheduled to fly to Muscat from Delhi on May 17, was apprehended at the airport due to the LOC.Police stated they arrested him on May 18 after the immigration department handed him over at 4.30 am, and then he was brought to Mumbai. Senior counsel for the elder brother-the complainant-argued that the immigration officers cannot be considered police officers, and hence his custody after being ""accosted"" at the airport was not an ""arrest"" by cops.The EOW's arrest memo states he was arrested on May 18 at 7.30 pm. The HC bench said, ""In our view, the act of the Immigration Officers to accost the petitioner or detain him on 17th May 2025 at 1730 hours is the act of arrest, and therefore the period of 24 hours as contemplated under Section 58 of BNS and Article 22(2) of the Constitution of India shall begin on 17th May 2025 at 1730 hours."""," Bombay high court declares arrest of Anchor Group director Hemang Shah as illegal.

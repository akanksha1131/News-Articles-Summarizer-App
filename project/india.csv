'Justice Is Crying...': Mamata Banerjee Takes EC Head On In Supreme Court Over SIR Row In Bengal

Observing that a govt must behave as a ‘model employer’ and lack of funds cannot be a ground to deny its employees their dues, Supreme Court Thursday directed West Bengal govt to pay dearness allowance (DA) to its employees for the 2008-19 period.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra ordered that the first instalment should be paid by March 31 and appointed a committee, comprising its former judge Indu Malhotra, former chief justice of Jharkhand HC Tarlok Singh Chauhan, former HC judge Goutam Bhaduri and Comptroller and Auditor General of India, to monitor implementation of its order.SC rejected Bengal govt’s defence it lacked funds and said it is not open for the State to shirk its responsibility of paying DA on account of financial difficulty, given that it is an obligation arising out of a statute of its own creation.“It has often been recognised that the State must set an example for other employers in the country by behaving as a ‘model employer’. Such a position should not be difficult to attain given all the advantages that it has. Its power lies in the volume of employment, its sovereign/constitutional authority to tax, ability to borrow and manage public finances... Leading by example, fulfilling its financial duties in times of fiscal strain, gives it the moral authority to wield the sword of law against private entities, should they not do so.SC said the least that is expected of a State in a democracy is that it honours its obligations and commitments arising from a legislation or judicial decisions, for such obligations are not discretionary.“This clear position protects such statutory obligations, for if such a ground of limited financial ability was readily available to govt, which may undoubtedly in certain situations face tough times, it would render these obligations illusory. When it comes to employees’ dues, this proposition would be extremely dangerous and stifling since the amounts received thereby are not handouts or acts of charity but are earned compensation/consideration for services given,” it said.",West Bengal govt ordered to pay dearness allowance (DA) to its employees for the 2008-19 period. Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra ordered that the first instalment should be paid by March 31.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127962101,imgsize-118330,width-400,resizemode-4/sc-notice-to-govt-on-pil-seeking-ayush-doctors-be-declared-as-registered-medical-practitioners.jpg"

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

PUNE: After Sharad Pawar took charge of steering the ship for his family following the death of his nephew Ajit Pawar, its members on Thursday backed deputy chief minister Sunetra Pawar’s name as NCP’s national president. While some other senior NCP functionaries showed reluctance for a merger with NCP (SP), the Pawar family said Sunetra would speak about it on behalf of her party.Interacting with reporters in Baramati, NCP (SP) state general secretary and Ajit Pawar’s nephew Rohit Pawar said: “As the Pawar family, we also wish that after taking charge as deputy CM, Sunetra Kaki (aunt) should be the next NCP chief.” On the issue of merger, he said there had been no discussion so far in the family. “We will take it up after the mourning period as it is important to know the members’ opinions. Since Sunetra Kaki (aunt) has taken charge as deputy CM and all NCP MLAs support her, she will speak on the merger after Feb 9. We can then discuss it thereafter.”Possibility of a re-unification grew stronger after Pawar Senior took the lead to minimise tension within the family when he went to meet Sunetra and her sons at their Baramati residence for the second consecutive day on Thursday. Some senior NCP members, including Patel and state chief Sunil Tatkare, have refuted Sharad Pawar’s claim that his nephew had initiated steps for NCP’s merger.",Sharad Pawar took charge of steering the ship for his family following the death of his nephew Ajit Pawar.

While India and Malaysia will look to ramp up trade and defence ties during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Kuala Lumpur over the weekend, the issue of fugitive Zakir Naik’s extradition is also likely to be raised by the Indian side. The visit is likely to see signing of several MoUs, including one for cooperation with Malaysia’s thriving semiconductor industry.“We have had opportunities to discuss the issue in past visits also at various levels. And, we will probably continue to take up the issue until all technical procedures are completed, and we hope to get the outcome that we desire,” said MEA secretary (east) P Kumaran, responding to a question about Naik.India and Malaysia have an extradition treaty, but the case, as Malaysia maintains, will be resolved based on judicial consideration. The official said that Modi and his counterpart Anwar Ibrahim will review progress under the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, especially in priority areas of cooperation such as trade, investments, defence, security, semiconductors, digital technologies, renewable energy, education, healthcare, and people-to-people exchanges.Kumaran also underlined the potential for defence cooperation between the two countries, saying that India is looking at sale of Dornier aircraft to Malaysia. “Malaysia also has Scorpene submarines. We are looking at opportunities to try and collaborate, especially in terms of mid-life upgrades, retrofitting etc,” said the official.","India and Malaysia have an extradition treaty, but the case, as Malaysia maintains, will be resolved based on judicial consideration.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has held as invalid prohibition on transfer or migration of a medical student from one college to another, and has directed National Medical Commission to formulate a “proper policy” to permit migration.A division bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia zeroed in on Regulation 18 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulation, 2023, and termed it “unreasonable and arbitrary”, and violating the Constitution.The bench was dealing with a petition by a medical student with 40% visual impairment who sought migration from Govt Medical College, Barmer to a college in Delhi. The court directed NMC to take a decision within three weeks on the petitioner’s transfer request.“What we find is that in the name of maintaining uniformity, standard and integrity in the matter of medical education across the institutions, total prohibition on transfer or migration of a student, need of which may occur in various situations, including the one which arose in this case, cannot be said to be reasonable; rather, in our opinion, such prohibition is manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary,” the high couty said in its order on Feb 4.The bench observed NMC’s stand that migration was prone to misuse could not be sustained, as the possibility of abuse could not be used to deny legitimate rights to a citizen.The court noted that the medical condition and capabilities of the petitioner were worsening on account of the harsh climate in Barmer, and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act mandated public bodies to ensure that persons with disabilities (PWDs) were provided “reasonable accommodation” and an “appropriate environment”. Provisions enacted by Parliament, the court said, cannot remain only a decorative and admirable piece of literature kept on a bookshelf.The judges further observed that NMC’s stand that the petitioner was aware of the weather conditions in Barmer before joining a college there was “nothing short of rubbing salt into the wounds”.","The Delhi high court has held as invalid prohibition on transfer or migration of a medical student from one college to another.

"In 10 years, trial courts awarded death to 1,310, high courts upheld 106",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-10-years-trial-courts-awarded-death-to-1310-high-courts-upheld-106/articleshow/127961651.cms,"Represenatative image

Trial courts across the country continued to impose death penalty in significant numbers in 2025 even as appellate courts set aside or modified most of these sentences, raising “serious concerns about the reliability of convictions in capital cases”, finds an annual study by The Square Circle Clinic — a criminal justice initiative of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.From 2016 to 2025, trial courts imposed 1,310 death sentences but high courts confirmed only 106, according to ‘Death Penalty in India: Annual Statistics Report 2025’ released on Feb 4. Of the death sentences confirmed by HCs, Supreme Court decided a little over a half of them and upheld none, shows the report.The data points to a persistent gap between trial court sentencing and appellate outcomes. As of Dec 31 last year, 574 prisoners were on death row which the report described as “the largest number of persons on death row at the end of a calendar year since 2016”.In this backdrop, sessions courts sentenced 128 people to death across 94 cases in 2025, finds the study.In 2025 alone, HCs acquitted, commuted, remanded or recorded abatement in most of the death sentence cases they decided, and SC’s record reflects a similar pattern, shows the report. The study finds that the apex court has not confirmed a single death sentence in 2023-2025, even where HCs had initially upheld them.In 2025 alone, high courts acquitted 35 individuals across 22 cases. SC acquitted accused in more than half the cases it decided, recording the highest number of death row acquittals — 10 persons — in the past decade.“The frequency with which death sentences are overturned at the appellate stage raises serious concerns about the reliability of convictions in capital cases,” the report states.Those acquitted by HCs spent an average of 5.17 years on death row, with several remaining under death sentence for close to two decades before being exonerated.“High rates of acquittals from death row expose a deep fracture in the criminal legal system,” said Shreya Rastogi, director, litigation and forensics at The Square Circle Clinic. “When more than a third of HC confirmation cases result in acquittals, it indicates failures in investigation and prosecution that harm victims and accused alike. These errors cost people decades of their lives and freedom.”The failures identified by the report are spread across the criminal justice process, said Maitreyi Misra, director, research and mitigation, The Square Circle Clinic. “Supreme Court itself has repeatedly pointed out failures at multiple levels — investigation agencies, prosecution and lower courts — while acquitting people on death row,” she said.","From 2016 to 2025, trial courts imposed 1,310 death sentences but high courts confirmed only 106.

NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old businessman was assaulted by a group of men after he intervened to stop youths from harassing three women in south Delhi's Mehrauli on Monday. Police have arrested all the four men allegedly involved in the assault. Mukesh Kumar (26) lives with his family in Sangam Vihar and runs a transport business.The family said the attack took place after they attended a wedding at Mukesh’s maternal uncle’s house on Monday.While the rest of the family returned home that night, Mukesh decided to return later the same night. While on his way home, he decided to stop at a stall on IGNOU Road for a cup of tea. Four young men and three women were already at the stall.A police source said, ""The men began making lewd remarks and harassing the women. Mukesh intervened, asking them to stop, which appeared to anger the men. What began as a verbal confrontation quickly escalated into a fight.

In the footage, some of the assailants can be seen restraining Mukesh while others beat him up, tearing his clothes and thrashing him. In another clip, the victim is seen lying on the ground with bloodstains on his clothes.Police got a PCR call about the attack on Feb 3 near Anupam Apartments on IGNOU Road.

Married woman can’t claim rape on false marriage promise: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/married-woman-cant-claim-rape-on-false-marriage-promise-supreme-court/articleshow/127955508.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over misuse of the criminal justice system by filing of rape cases when a consenting relationship turns sour, Supreme Court on Thursday held that a married woman who gets into a physical relationship with another man cannot file a rape case against him on the ground that she got into the sexual relationship on the promise of marriage.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said in such cases, a woman was not eligible to get married due to the subsistence of her marriage and she could not invoke the ground of false promise of marriage. It passed the order while quashing criminal proceedings against a lawyer on a complaint filed by a woman advocate alleging that he had raped her on the false promise of marriage.The court said the complainant was already married when they were in a relationship and it was “a classic case of a consensual relationship turning acrimonious”.“Therefore, even for the sake of argument, if the contention is accepted that there indeed was a false promise of marriage based on which the accused indulged in sexual activities, such a promise would not be legally enforceable or even capable of being acted upon as the victim herself was not eligible for marriage, neither on the date of the first alleged act of offence nor on any subsequent dates wherein the parties indulged in sexual activities, till the point of the date of registration of FIR.The said embargo arises from sub-clause (i) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which categorically prohibits marriage between two individuals if either of them have a living spouse,” the bench observed.The bench said courts have to be extremely careful in identifying genuine rape cases by looking for the essential ingredients to constitute the said offence in view of the law being misused today.",A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said a woman was not eligible to get married due to the subsistence of her marriage.

IAF’s Rafale-Led Flypast Caps Republic Day With A Global Showcase Of India’s Military Strength

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","HAL has received five engines from GE as on date.

Arrest mere statutory discretion to facilitate investigation, says the top court

NEW DELHI: Noting that an arrest can’t be made simply because it is lawful for the police officer to do so, SC on Thursday held that an investigating agency should not take an accused into custody for asking questions and the same should be done only when it is necessary for the probe.Enumerating various sections of the newly enacted Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N K Singh said a notice under Section 35(3) of the law to an accused or any individual concerned, qua offences punishable with imprisonment of up to 7 years, is the rule.“The power of arrest under Section 35(6) read with Section 35(1)(b) of the BNSS, 2023 must be interpreted as a strict objective necessity, and not a subjective convenience for the police officer. It does not mean the police officer can arrest to simply ask questions,” the bench said.Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the court the requirement to issue a notice under Section 35(3) is absolute and cannot be bypassed solely by recording reasons for arrest.“Suffice it is to state that an investigation can go on even without an arrest.While undertaking the exercise of collecting the evidence for the purpose of forming his opinion over the commission of a cognizable offence, a police officer shall pose a question, to himself, on the necessity of an arrest. This safeguard is provided as, in any case, the power to arrest an accused person is always available with a police officer even after he records his reasons, in writing, for not doing so at an earlier stage,” the bench said.“On the basis of the interpretation given by us, we conclude as follows: An arrest by a police officer is a mere statutory discretion which facilitates him to conduct proper investigation, in the form of collection of evidence and, therefore, shall not be termed as mandatory.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday took a sharp dig at the Congress and the Gandhi family during nearly 100-minute speech in the Rajya Sabha, accusing them of being ""habitual thieves"" and alleging that they have even ""stolen"" Mahatma Gandhi 's surname.""For some people, stealing is a family profession.

PM slams Cong for eroding global trust

NEW DELHI: PM Modi Thursday celebrated the signing of the trade deals with the EU and the US, saying the pacts augur well for world’s “stability and pace of progress” and were evidence of the international community regarding India as trusted trading partner.“When the trade deal with the EU took place, the world became more confident of stability. After the deal with the US, the world has more confidence in not just stability but also pace of progress... It is a good sign for the world... The biggest beneficiaries (from the deals) will be the youth of the country,” he said.Modi’s remarks in Rajya Sabha, during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address, came even as the treaty with the US is yet to be formally signed. It’s being seen as an indication that the two sides may have resolved their differences. The formal announcement of the deal is likely next week.Modi slammed the party for its failure to secure similar trade pacts during its tenure and said it’ll have to one day respond to what it had done to India that other countries weren’t willing to do trade deals.The 97-minute fiery speech that started amid sloganeering from a protesting opposition, saw PM hitting out at Congress for the erosion of trust of foreign partners in India’s capacity to deliver and saying that a lot of his energy was spent on rectifying the mistakes of past Congress-led govts to instill confidence globally.Modi also highlighted investments in emerging sectors such as AI, quantum computing, critical minerals, space technology and deep-sea exploration, describing them as pillars of India’s growth strategy. He called for a push towards quality manufacturing, innovation and research.He said Congress was more focused on “vote bank politics” and did not prioritise economic issues. “Neither did they have a vision or will. That is the reason that the country had to suffer so much,” the PM said.“I can see very clearly that the second quarter of the 21st century is going to be critical for India’s progress at a rapid pace towards achieving the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’. Therefore, we have to only keep moving forward and not look back,” said Modi.The opposition protest at the beginning of Modi’s speech came as Congress and others alleged that Leader of the Opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge wanted to speak but was denied permission by chairman C P Radhakrishnan. While Modi kept speaking undeterred initially amid the protest, he paused and took a dig at Kharge, suggesting that he can keep raising slogans while sitting. The opposition later walked out of the House.Continuing with his speech, the PM said, “India is signing future-ready trade deals with several nations. In the last few days, we have signed trade deals with nine big nations, including the ‘mother of all deals’ with the 27-nation EU bloc.”Reflecting on the changing global population profile — where the world’s most developed countries are witnessing a fast-aging population — Modi said India is uniquely placed due to its youth population. “Having a large youth population is in itself a big attest. We have a very precious ‘youth talent pool’ that has dreams, resolve and capability to achieve their dreams,” Modi said.",PM Modi celebrated the signing of the trade deals with the EU and the US.

NEW DELHI: Even as new roads, hospitals and schools are promised for the Northeast, more than Rs 3,200 crore meant for infrastructure projects in the region is still lying unspent — a reality check that surfaced in the Parliament on Thursday.Replying to a question in Rajya Sabha, minister of state for development of north eastern region Sukanta Majumdar said ongoing projects under the North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS) carry an outstanding central liability of Rs 3,206.18 crore as of Dec 31, 2025. There are over 160 projects still under implementation.State-wise figures show Assam topping the list with Rs 1,012.87 crore pending across 35 projects, followed by Manipur (Rs 441.38 crore), Nagaland (Rs 406.09 crore) and Arunachal Pradesh (Rs 395.37 crore). Other states with large unpaid amounts include Tripura (Rs 308.71 crore), Mizoram (Rs 275.81 crore), Meghalaya (Rs 258.05 crore) and Sikkim (Rs 107.90 crore).Sector-wise, roads and bridges account for the biggest backlog of Rs 1,402.11 crore across 53 projects. Education projects have pending dues of Rs 774.55 crore, while Rs 317.87 crore is yet to be spent on health infrastructure. Power, water supply, sports, tourism, digital connectivity and civil aviation together make up the rest of the outstanding amount.The govt also told the House that 30 projects — three under NESIDS (Roads) and 27 under NESIDS (Other Than Roads Infrastructure) — were sanctioned more than two years ago but still have over 50% of their approved cost unspent. Officials attributed the delays to tough terrain, land issues, statutory clearances and financial closures, saying timelines often depend on local conditions.NESIDS was launched in 2017–18 and later split into two components — roads and other infrastructure — to support projects ranging from highways and bridges to schools, hospitals, water supply and solid waste management. States select projects based on local priorities, while fund allocation is guided by factors such as population, area, road density, hospital beds and access to drinking water.","More than Rs 3,200 crore meant for infrastructure projects in the region is still lying unspent.

IndiGo’s 5% Flight Cut Explained: Causes, Impact on Routes, and the Ripple Effects on Passengers

CHENNAI: When IndiGo’s flight operations went topsy-turvy in December last year, there were videos and photos of hapless and tired passengers confronting ground staff. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has now put a number to their faces.The directorate’s monthly traffic data for Dec 2025 says 16.2 lakh domestic flyers were stranded at airports across the country due to the non-availability of either IndiGo aircraft or their crew members. The number of people affected due to total cancellation of flights was 9.8 lakh, while those stranded at the airports due to delays beyond two hours were 6.4 lakh.Simultaneously, 43,278 flyers who had booked flights on Air India and Air India Express were affected due to cancellation of flights. The number of passengers affected due to delays beyond two hours was almost 1.2 lakh.DGCA prepared the traffic report based on information received from the respective domestic airlines. IndiGo spent about Rs 22.7 crore on refunds, alternate flights and other facilitation in the same month, it said. The airline, however, said it cannot share details about the number of passengers eligible for compensation and the number compensated so farAt a Jan 29 meeting to review IndiGo’s operations, the airline assured that it would be good to fly without any disruption, even with the removal of exemptions to Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations from Feb 10 onwards, as they now have sufficient pilots on the roster.Civil aviation expert Captain M Ranganathan said the problem is yet far from over. “For each domestic flight, an airline should have six pairs of pilots and co-pilots, and for long-haul flights there should be 11 pairs. The pilot availability they submitted is based on DGCA’s civil aviation requirements (CAR) regulations 2022. For their present fleet, there will still be a deficiency of pilots under new regulations. There is another storm brewing if the problem is not addressed,” he said.Several pilots told TOI the biggest problem was poor pay. “Pilots’ salary is very low in India compared to other countries, and pilots are among the highest taxpayers,” said a pilot.","16.2 lakh domestic flyers were stranded at airports across the country. 43,278 flyers who had booked flights on Air India and Air India Express were affected.

Forging alliance

What political pundits say

Why caste matters in Tamil Nadu

Dalits

Thevars

Vanniyars

Nadars

Gounders

NEW DELHI: As Tamil Nadu gears up for assembly elections in a couple months, the BJP is looking to consolidate opposition forces. With an anti-DMK alliance, the BJP, it seems is also trying to ""do a Bihar"" in a state it has struggled to make a mark in till now.As the party takes winning lessons from recent Bihar assembly victory, it is forming a social alliance that represents every major caste segment in the state.Earlier in Bihar assembly election, BJP had a fool-proof plan. The party, along with its NDA partners, built a social coalition that represented the major castes, isolating the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan with its Muslim-Yadav voter base.The five NDA partners represented almost all segments of society. LJP and HAM had Dalit faces like Union minister Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi. EBC and non-Yadav OBC castes were represented by JD(U) and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha. Meanwhile, the BJP had its vote banks among the upper castes and the Baniya community.This fine-tuned caste coalition brought an overwhelming majority for the NDA. The alliance won 202 seats in the 243-member Bihar Assembly.Dominated by Dravidian politics, alliances also play a huge role in Tamil Nadu. Apart from a peak DMK or AIADMK , no single party can dominate the Assembly without a broad coalition.To prevent vote-splitting, which could favour the DMK, the BJP is trying to inculcate as many parties as it can to rebuild a broader NDA. Former alliance partners and breakaway factions are being approached, including leaders who had earlier left.Two years after the split, the BJP and AIADMK came together in 2025 and announced that the NDA will contest the upcoming assembly polls under the leadership of former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS).The BJP’s alliance with the AIADMK has been more than tactical and is seen in Delhi as the primary vehicle for relevance in the southern state. However, the current BJP strategy, curated mainly by Amit Shah, reflects this urgency.Additionally, the AIADMK also has a voter base among Dalit communities. This voter base constitutes almost 20 per cent of the state’s population.Meanwhile, AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam (OPS) also declared that he was “ready” for reunification with Edappadi K Palaniswami’s (EPS) AIADMK faction ahead of Tamil Nadu’s 2026 assembly polls.At a press meet in Madurai, OPS threw a pointed challenge at both EPS and AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran, asking whether they were prepared to take the leap. “I am ready for that. Are they ready?” he said, invoking the possibility of rival factions closing ranks under the NDA umbrella.The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) also entered the NDA, giving it a symbolic boost. However, this did not come without complications. Anbumani Ramadoss’s decision to align with the AIADMK-BJP front was meant to strengthen the NDA’s presence in northern Tamil Nadu, where the PMK traditionally draws support from the Vanniyar community. Though this adds social breadth to the coalition at a time when consolidation is critical, the PMK is far from united.Meanwhile, the BJP has also reportedly approached TVK’s Vijay to join the NDA after he positioned his party as an alternative political force in Tamil Nadu.Vijay hails from a Christian community that constitutes about 6 per cent of the population in the state. Additionally, Vijay commands huge popularity among youngsters. Unlike the parties of other film stars, Vijay’s supporters are organised and politically active.According to poll analysts, caste equations have always played a role in Tamil Nadu. However, they believe the BJP’s efforts to bring different castes on one stage have not gained much traction.Speaking to The Times of India, political analyst Kannan R said that the saffron party does have a number of leaders from the backward classes but so far, the party seems to rally Hindus as a monolithic unit.“Caste and cash remain two important factors in TN’s electoral politics and will continue to play a crucial role. I don’t think the BJP is trying to bring different castes on the stage, or if it is, it hasn’t gained traction so far,” Kannan said.“It does have a number of leaders from the backward classes, but so far the party seems to rally Hindus as a monolithic unit, which has so far been a no-go in this state,” he added.Another analyst, Shyam Shanmugaa, said that elections cannot be won purely on caste equations in Tamil Nadu.“Caste equations are always at play in rural Tamil Nadu. But in urban areas, it does not matter. Tamil Nadu is a heavily urbanised state. Hence, elections cannot be won purely on caste equations. If one caste is mobilised in a particular rural constituency, counter-mobilisation takes place,” Shanmugaa told TOI.“Therefore, winning chances are there for candidates who are caste-neutral and appeal to all castes. The BJP is mostly seen as a Brahmin upper-caste party. It is unable to mobilise one particular OBC caste. Even when TN BJP leaders from particular dominant communities were made state presidents, the BJP could not win,” he added.Dalits constitute around 19% to 21% of the state’s population. They are spread across the state, with their population higher in districts such as Cuddalore, Villupuram, Tiruvallur and Madurai.The larger Dravidian political movement, which has evolved over the past two centuries and given rise to parties such as the Dravida Kazhagam, the DMK and the AIADMK, has historically reached out to Dalits.Concentrated mainly in southern Tamil Nadu districts such as Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram, the Thevars are a politically influential community and fall under the MBC category. Several prominent Thevar leaders are part of the AIADMK.Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide V K Sasikala and rebel leader O Panneerselvam both belong to the community.The Thevar population is estimated at around 10% to 12%.Vanniyars, largely based in northern Tamil Nadu, are among the biggest and most politically active Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in the state. Tamil Nadu categorises OBCs into BC and MBC groups. The Vanniyars are primarily an agrarian community and have largely retained land ownership despite industrialisation. Members of the community are frequently named in connection with anti-Dalit violence in the state.Politically, Vanniyars are represented by the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which is currently part of the BJP-led NDA. Founded and led by S Ramadoss, the party has wielded influence due to the community’s numerical strength, organisational structure and sustained political mobilisation. Ramadoss began organising Vanniyars in the 1980s and is credited with improving educational outcomes within the community from the 1990s onwards.Vanniyars are estimated to make up about 12% to 15% of Tamil Nadu’s population, with a strong presence in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Thiruvannamalai and parts of Vellore, and smaller concentrations in Salem and Dindigul.Nadars are a trading community with a strong footprint in commerce and politics. Their leaders cut across party lines and have successfully translated economic strength into political influence.The most prominent Nadar leader in Tamil Nadu’s political history is K Kamaraj, a senior Congress leader and former chief minister. Alongside Hindu Nadars, Christian Nadars also hold a significant presence in institutions and power structures.The community’s population is estimated at around 4% to 6%, with a concentration in southern Tamil Nadu districts such as Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar.Gounders fall under the Backward Classes category and account for roughly 5% to 7% of Tamil Nadu’s population. They are largely concentrated in western Tamil Nadu, or the Kongu Nadu region, which includes districts such as Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Namakkal, Karur and Salem.Primarily dependent on agriculture and allied sectors, the community is also known for its entrepreneurial presence and influence in regional industries. Prominent figures include industrialist and philanthropist N Mahalingam, who was involved in several educational initiatives.After J Jayalalithaa’s death, Edappadi K Palaniswami, a Gounder, assumed control of the AIADMK, sidelining the Sasikala family and O Panneerselvam, and assigning key Cabinet portfolios to leaders from the community.The Election Commission is expected to announce the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu in April–May this year. In the 2021 assembly elections, the DMK won 133 seats, while the Congress won 18 seats. Meanwhile, the AIADMK secured 66 seats with 33.5% of the vote; the PMK secured five seats with a 3.8% vote share, while the VCK won four seats with a 1% vote share.","The BJP is forming a social alliance that represents every major caste segment in the state.

KOLKATA: A new welfare scheme called ‘Banglar Yuba-Sathi’ for Bengal’s unemployed youth and a 50% hike in the payout to ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’ beneficiaries headlined the Mamata Banerjee govt’s last budget — a vote-on-account — before the state goes to polls later this year.Finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya on Thursday had some cheer for state govt employees too, budgeting for a 4% hike in DA.

Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition allegations over the India-US trade deal, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday said that the agreement fully safeguards India’s agricultural interests, particularly those of the farm and dairy sectors.Underlining that India’s staple grains, fruits, major crops, millets and dairy products remain completely secure and face no threat whatsoever, Chouhan emphasised that the interests of small and large farmers alike have been fully protected and that the agreement will create fresh opportunities rather than risks for Indian agriculture.Highlighting the export potential unlocked by the agreement, Chouhan, while addressing the media on the issue, noted that India already exports rice to many countries, including the US, and has recently recorded exports worth around Rs 63,000 crore.He said that reduced tariffs will directly benefit India’s rice, spices and textile exports, and that growth in textile exports will help millions of cotton-growing farmers.On certain concerns over an adverse impact of the deal on small farmers, the minister stressed that no sudden or disruptive entry of foreign products into the Indian market will take place.On the confusion triggered by a recent social media post by the US treasury secretary about increased access for American farm products, Chouhan said commerce minister Piyush Goyal has already clarified the facts in Parliament. He reiterated that India has not opened its markets in any way that puts pressure on domestic farmers & that the protections for key agricultural commodities remain intact.“Farmers are our ‘Annadata’, the providers of life. Their welfare is nation’s welfare, and their interests are absolutely secure,” he added.","Shivraj Singh Chouhan: India's staple grains, fruits, major crops, millets and dairy products remain completely secure and face no threat whatsoever.

to Rs 75,368 crore

NEW DELHI: Railways has estimated its earnings from passenger movement at Rs 87,300 crore in 2026-27, little over 9% more than the revised estimate (RE) of current financial year as it continues to introduce more new-age Vande Bharat chair car and sleeper trains, and Amrit Bharat trains, in addition to to adding of other conventional trains.However, it has lowered the revenue from passenger transport for this year than the Budget Estimate (BE) of Rs 92,800 crore, due to nearly 10.6% fall in kms that people travelled or will travel by March 2026.Similarly, in the freight segment, the ministry has estimated earning of around Rs 1.88 lakh crore in FY 27, same that osf BE of FY26 and 6% higher than the RE of current fiscal year. Data also show that railways is likely to end up generating around Rs 1.78 lakh crore by March, around 5.5% less than the target it had set for the current year.Significantly, the revenue from goods transport is set to fall short of target despite railways not lowering the freight loading target of 1,700 million for this year. Data indicates that the revenue fall is due to a reduction of around 1% fall in the distance of goods transported by railways, meaning there may be a shorter distance than what railways had initially estimated.Responding to a question on the earnings of the national transporter, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Monday it has continued to increase revenue both from passenger and freight movement. He added that the revenue from passenger movement has increased from Rs 70,693 crore in FY 24in 2024-25 and the RE for FY 26 is Rs 80,000 crore. Similarly, in the freight segment, revenue has increased from Rs 1.68 lakh crore in FY 24 to Rs 1.71 lakh crore in 2024-25 and it has been pegged at Rs 1.78 lakh crore in the RE of this fiscal year.On why the railways is unlikely to meet the BE target, Vaishnaw said govt always sets an “aspirational” target so that everyone works hard to perform better than earlier. He added that railways has continued registering net revenue for the past three years, which shows how well the national transporter is running its day-to-day operations.As per the Budget document, with higher income, railways estimates to improve its operating ratio (OR) from 98.82% in the current fiscal year to 98.4% in FY 27. OR indicates the money spent for earning every Rs 100. The railways aims to close the next fiscal with Rs 3,000 crore net revenue, around 35% higher than Rs 1,957 crore estimates for FY 26.","Railways has estimated its earnings from passenger movement at Rs 87,300 crore in 2026-27. It has lowered the revenue from passenger transport for this year than the Budget Estimate (BE) of Rs 92,800 crore. Data also show that railways is likely to end up generating around Rs 1.78 lakh crore by March.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127960737,imgsize-104534,width-400,resizemode-4/ashwini-vaishnaw-speaks-on-budget-2026-27.jpg"

MUMBAI: For years, teacher and artist Rouble Nagi has used walls in slums for creation of murals to teach children who seldom make it to classrooms. On Thursday, that work was recognised on a global stage when she won the $1 million Global Teacher Prize 2026 — world’s largest award for educators.It was presented at World Governments Summit in Dubai, an annual gathering of leaders and policymakers. Now in its tenth year, the prize — an initiative of Varkey Foundation along with Unesco — honours teachers whose work reshaped learning outcomes and communities.Nagi, who has developed pedagogy around art, began her work in the slums of Mumbai about a decade ago. Accepting the award, she said recognition of work rooted in “education, compassion, consistency and service” had strengthened her resolve to continue working with children on the margins.Through the Rouble Nagi Art Foundation, she has established over 800 learning centres in India, reaching children who have never attended school as well as those enrolled but struggling to keep pace. The focus is foundational literacy, numeracy and basic conceptual understanding in communities where formal schooling often fails to hold.Nagi is perhaps best known for her murals, which use colour, symbols and stories to impart lessons.Neglected spaces in settlements turn into open-air classrooms which teach language, science, mathematics and history. Art is central to her as a tool to instil confidence, heal and allow self expression.Starting out with a small, hands-on effort among families living in fragile conditions, Nagi Art Foundation has expanded to villages and various urban centres. The underlying belief, she said, is that inequality is not destiny, and that education delivered with dignity can bridge the gap between exclusion and opportunity. An educator who is inspired by the legacy of Savitribai Phule, Nagi said she has remained committed to education without discrimination.Under her Misaal India initiative, Nagi has also set up skill centres for women, helping them achieve financial independence and emerge as entrepreneurs.Sunny Varkey, founder of Global Teacher Prize and GEMS Education, said Nagi represented “the very best of what teaching can be — courage, creativity and compassion”. Francis Joseph, CEO of GEMS Education, said Nagi’s influence extended beyond conventional classrooms. Stefania Giannini, Unesco’s assistant director-general for education, said the award reaffirmed a “simple truth: teachers matter”.","Nagi is perhaps best known for her murals, which use colour, symbols and stories to impart lessons.

'Women MPs Near PM's Chair': Speaker Om Birla Reveals Why PM Modi Skipped Lok Sabha Speech

Absolute lie, says Priyanka; PM hid behind Birla, claims Rahul

NEW DELHI: Speaker Om Birla disclosed in Lok Sabha on Thursday that it was at his request that PM Narendra Modi had decided not to come to Lok Sabha to reply to the President’s address, as he had concrete information that protesting opposition members standing near Modi’s designated seat could pull off some “unexpected act”.“Had such an unpleasant act happened, then its sight would have torn the country’s democratic traditions to shreds,” he said amid protests from opposition MPs.Modi’s scheduled reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address was called off at last minute on Wednesday due to intense protest from opposition MPs, with some women members hovering near the PM’s seat ahead of his expected arrival.Many other members from Congress and regional parties were raising slogans in protest, including over BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s reference to several books carrying uncharitable references to members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.Birla said, “The whole country watched the incident yesterday as to how some women members reached there. It was not in accordance with the House’s dignity.”Birla also made it clear to the Opposition the House will not function “either today or tomorrow” if they continue bringing posters and pamphlets inside and asked them to express their views in line with parliamentary traditions.With the discussion on the motion thwarted since Monday over LoP Rahul Gandhi ’s insistence on referring to an unpublished book written by former army chief M M Naravane and Birla disallowing it, Lok Sabha passed the motion with a voice vote without Modi’s reply, a first since the NDA regime began in 2014, though not without precedence.Birla also voiced disapproval of opposition members’ vocal protest at his office — an apparent reference to their show of displeasure over Dubey’s speech — and slammed it as a “black spot” in parliamentary conventions. It has never happened that MPs bring their political differences to the office of speaker in such a manner.“It is in no way appropriate that the leader of the House (PM) could not speak.” He thanked Modi for accepting his request aimed at maintaining the House’s dignity.Congress on Thursday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of seeking cover behind the Speaker as it rubbished the Chair’s statement that the PM had skipped his scheduled reply to the Motion of Thanks in Lok Sabha on Wednesday over fears that women MPs of Congress could trigger an unprecedented incident against the BJP mascot. It further said that Om Birla’s statement had been dictated by the Modi govt.Rahul Gandhi said, “Modi was so scared of the truth that he sought refuge in lies. Khair, jo uchit samjha, woh kiya (anyway, he did what he felt appropriate)” — the remark in Hindi being a sarcastic reference to what General MM Naravane has said was the PM’s stand during the Chinese aggression.Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “They are making the Speaker say all this because yesterday he (PM) did not have the guts to come to the house. Because three women were standing in front of his bench?”Priyanka asked what was so strange if women MPs were standing in front of the treasury benches. “There is no question of anyone raising any hand on the PM or trying to hurt him or any such thing. There is no question. It is an absolute lie.”With the ruling BJP castigating the Opposition for stalling PM Modi’s speech on the President’s address, Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh recalled that on June 10, 2004, then PM Manmohan Singh was prevented by BJP from speaking on the Motion of Thanks. Ramesh posted on X Singh’s reply to the Motion of Thanks on March 10, 2005, where Singh starts his speech by saying that he had “waited out an entire year to perform this happy task” and thanked the President for the address of both 2004 and 2005.Ramesh said, “...we needed to put it on record that UPA PM Manmohan Singh was not allowed by the BJP to reply to the motion of thanks in 2004 even though the house had concluded the discussion on the motion, and only Singh’s reply remained.”","'Women MPs Near PM's Chair': Speaker Om Birla Reveals Why PM Modi Skipped Lok Sabha Speech.

NEW DELHI: A tripartite agreement was signed on Thursday among the Centre, Nagaland govt and Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO) — which champions the cause of eight recognised tribes of eastern Nagaland — in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah, paving the way for creation of a Frontier Nagaland Territorial Authority (FNTA) for six districts of Nagaland.As part of the arrangement, there will be devolution of powers relating to 46 subjects to FNTA, which will cover the districts of Tuensang, Mon, Kiphire, Longleng, Noklak and Shamator. The autonomy and greater say will address the long-standing grievances of ENPO over lack of equitable development in eastern Nagaland districts.Shah, describing the agreement as a step that furthers realisation of PM Narendra Modi’s vision for a violence-free and developed northeast, recalled how he met ENPO leaders in 2021-22 and convinced them against boycotting elections by underlining that Centre was committed to resolving every dispute. He said Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio had then assured him his govt would hear and resolve grievances of ENPO.MHA in a statement said the agreement provides for sharing of development outlay for the eastern Nagaland region in proportion to population and area.","A tripartite agreement was signed on Thursday among the Centre, Nagaland govt and Eastern Nagal and People’s Organisation (ENPO) The agreement will pave the way for creation of a Frontier Nagalands Territorial Authority (FNTA) for six districts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127960119,imgsize-51264,width-400,resizemode-4/shah-at-the-signing-on-thursday.jpg"
NCLT recalls order awarding Alchemist to ‘sister concern’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nclt-recalls-order-awarding-alchemist-to-sister-concern/articleshow/127960106.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a rare decision, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Feb 3 withdrew its corporate resolution order awarding a bankrupt company — Alchemist Ltd, promoted by former Trinamool Congress MP KD Singh — to a company that turned out to be a related group entity. The bench observed the “insolvency proceedings were vitiated by fraud, collusion and malicious intent”.The withdrawal of the corporate resolution order by NCLT, a rare occurrence, happened after Enforcement Directorate approached the Delhi bench with evidence of money laundering by the group and how the promoters had allegedly created a front entity with “proceeds of crime”, making it a financial creditor with 97% voting rights to grab the firm under insolvency proceedings.Singh and his Alchemist group entities are accused of laundering an amount of Rs 1,840 crore collected from small investors, promising them high returns or allotment of plots and villas. Neither were plots or villas allotted, nor were the investors refunded their money. Interestingly, ED’s money laundering probe is based on an FIR filed by investors in Kolkata, West Bengal, the state Singh represented in the Rajya Sabha.Two of Singh’s hospitals in Panchkula — Alchemist Hospital and Ojas Hospital — are among assets worth Rs 490 crore attached by ED over the past few years.After withdrawal of the NCLT order, ED said its investigation had revealed how Alchemist Ltd was dragged to insolvency by Technology Parks Ltd which dominated the committee of creditors (CoC) with 97% voting rights and later turned out to be an entity of Singh’s group.Insolvency was just a facade and was used merely as a “device to reclaim attached assets and invoke immunity under Section 32A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)”, ED said. The agency further said an ex-employee of Alchemist group, Gaurav Misra, was appointed resolution professional, raising serious concerns regarding the independence and fairness of the entire process.“The dominant CoC members were group entities accused of money laundering and beneficiaries of proceeds of crime, including Technology Parks Ltd (with 97% voting share), Alchemist Township India Ltd (voting share 1.7%) and Alchemist Realty Ltd (voting share 0.6%)”. It was also highlighted that the aforementioned companies have been arraigned as accused in the prosecution complaint (chargesheet) filed by ED in the case.Accepting the submissions of ED, NCLT said, “An insolvency resolution dominated by accused group entities fundamentally erodes the independence and commercial wisdom of the CoC. Permitting such an insolvency would result in legitimisation of proceeds of crime, dilution of PMLA attachments and abuse of insolvency immunity.”","NCLT on Feb 3 withdrew its corporate resolution order awarding a bankrupt company to a company that turned out to be a related group entity.

'Arrogant, Liar': Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Attacks CEC Gyanesh After SIR Meet In Delhi

KOLKATA: Bucking the trend set by governors of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose avoided a confrontation with the elected govt over his inaugural address of the budget session of assembly. Although he delivered a truncated four-and-half-minute speech, he scaled down the pitch that had previously put the state govt and Raj Bhavan at loggerheads over multiple issues.Bose read out portions of the address highlighting law and order, including references to Kolkata being among the safest cities in the country. In a rare display of cordiality, he was even seen briefly holding hands and speaking with CM Mamata Banerjee after his address, prompting BJP legislators to sarcastically comment “well done”, as he exited the House.During a heated discussion that followed the governor’s address, there were fiery exchanges between the CM and leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari. Hitting out at BJP, Banerjee said: “We will win in court and we will win the vote as well. Don’t even imagine winning Bengal. You are already in trouble in Delhi. Everyone can see the condition of the so-called double-engine govt. You were zero, you are zero and you will remain zero.Stay well, stay healthy, but remember you will lose many seats.”Her remarks came amid repeated interruptions and counter-allegations from Adhikari, who said Bose deliberately curtailed his address to avoid reading out sections critical of the Union govt. The leader of opposition claimed the governor read the speech for barely 4.5 minutes and stopped before reaching references such as ‘Ghatal Master Plan’.Responding to the charge, Banerjee said it was part of the legislative convention for the governor to read the opening portions of the address and formally lay the document in the House. Looking directly at Adhikari, she added: “People will point at you and say — you don’t know anything at all. Just keep watching; many will lose their seats this time.”The governors of the three opposition-governed southern states had earlier stoked a controversy by refusing to stick to the speech documents provided by respective state govts and even walking out of the House before completing their address.Meanwhile, the assembly saw sharp political sparring over a proposed discussion on SIR of electoral rolls after speaker Biman Banerjee ruled out a debate on the issue, noting that the matter was pending before SC. TMC had sought a discussion on SIR, arguing it had caused widespread harassment of voters ahead of the 2026 assembly polls.","West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose avoided a confrontation with the elected govt over his inaugural address of the budget session of assembly.

Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath Ignites Debate, Says ‘Political Islam’ Undermined Sanatan Faith

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday told officials any death in the state caused by banned Chinese kite strings (manjha) should be treated as murder.The CM’s directive comes after a sharp rise in Chinese manjha-related deaths in the state. At least eight people lost their lives in the state in past one year due to Chinese manjha.Asked how the directive will be implemented, additional chief secretary (home) Sanjay Prasad said, “We are working on a legal and procedural framework to ensure any death caused due to the use of banned Chinese manjha is treated as a case of murder. Clear instructions will be issued to the police so that strict action can be taken against all those involved in its sale, supply or use.”The CM said Chinese manhja poses a deadly threat to citizens, especially children, as well as birds and animals. Chairing a high-level review, he asked how Chinese manjha is still being sold despite a ban. “This will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he said, directing police chiefs to conduct district-wise raids, dismantle the illegal supply network, and ensure immediate seizure of the hazardous string.Yogi made it clear that if a person loses his or her life due to Chinese manjha, an FIR for murder will be registered and those responsible, including sellers, suppliers, and others involved, will face strict legal action and jail.","Yogi Adityanath told officials any death in the state caused by banned Chinese kite strings (manjha) should be treated as murder.

PM address in RS ‘poll rally speech’: Congress

NEW DELHI: A day after West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee appeared in SC to argue against the special intensive revision of electoral rolls in her state, PM Modi on Thursday accused TMC of protecting “ghuspaithiyas (infiltrators)”.“Our colleagues from TMC spoke a lot. But they should introspect. Their merciless govt is creating new records of decline, and they are giving sermons here. Such a merciless govt is pushing the future of people into darkness... They only care about power. Even the most prosperous countries are pushing out illegal infiltrators. In our country, courts are being pressured to save infiltrators,” he said.Accusing Congress of nursing deep-seated hatred against him since he became Gujarat CM, Modi said Thursday that the party’s chant “Modi teri kabra khudegi (we will bury you)” was reflective of the hatred it harboured against him since he occupied the top job.Modi said the party’s frustration has been growing as he not only became PM, but has continued to be in office since 2014, while Congress considers the PM’s position its feudal fief.“So they think they have been left with only one option — to dig Modi’s grave,” he said. While Congress was engaged in politics of hatred, he was trying to lay the ground for a developed India, Modi said.The PM cited a host of measures his govt has taken — from repeal of Article 370 to peace and development initiatives in the Northeast and military action against terrorists sitting in Pakistan — to assert that Congress has increasingly become bitter towards him due to these developments.Congress on Thursday dismissed PM Modi’s address in RS as an “election rally speech” and said his self-obsession, fixation on “dialogue-baazi” and “demagoguery” were on full display.Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at the PM, saying “Modi ji was so afraid of the truth, he took refuge in lies. However, he did what he felt was right.” Party president Mallikarjun Kharge accused Modi govt of being determined to suppress the voice of opposition.Referring to the PM’s speech as “another election rally speech lasting 97 minutes”, Congress’ Jairam Ramesh said on X, “As always, it was overflowing with abuses and assaults, distortions and dramatics, innuendos and insults — and, of course, his usual quota of blatant and brazen lies. His self-obsession... and his fixation on dialogue-baazi and demagoguery was on full display”.Talking to reporters after opposition MPs staged a walkout during Modi’s reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address in RS, Kharge said the governing party was deliberately preventing opposition leaders from speaking in both Houses of Parliament.Kharge said abusive remarks were made against Nehru and Indira who sacrificed their lives for the nation.",PM Modi accuses West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee of protecting “ghuspaithiyas (infiltrators)” Accuses Congress of nursing deep-seated hatred against him since he became Gujarat CM.

'Sit And Protest': PM Modi Unfazed By Slogans, Takes Dig At Kharge As Opposition Walks Out Of RS

JAMMU: A bitter dispute over identity and regional recognition rocked J&K assembly for a second straight day after opposition leader Sunil Sharma of BJP dismissed the existence of the “Pir Panjal region” — triggering protests, walkouts and demands for an apology from lawmakers.CM Omar Abdullah said Thursday that Sharma’s remarks had “angered an entire region” and said it did not suit any politician to deride a region by questioning its name. Sharma had yet to apologise, he said.The row comes weeks after PDP president Mehbooba Mufti pitched for a separate administrative division comprising Rajouri and Poonch in Pir Panjal along with Chenab valley districts, citing remoteness, hilly terrain and lack of infrastructure — a demand BJP opposed.The region refers to the mountainous belt along the Pir Panjal range south of Kashmir valley and close to the LoC. Chenab valley includes Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban — rugged districts carved by the Chenab river. Both often complain they are sidelined between Jammu division and Kashmir valley in development, representation and administrative focus.The controversy began Tuesday when Sharma, who represents Padder-Nagseni in Kishtwar district, responded to a question on whether a proposed National Law University could be set up in Pir Panjal.He said there was no such region and that he had never heard the name “in any dictionary”. He later alleged the term was part of a political conspiracy by regional parties, echoing what he called the idea of a “Greater Kashmir”, which BJP would not allow.Sharma’s comments provoked protests from legislators from Rajouri and Poonch, including deputy CM Surinder Choudhary and forest minister Javed Rana, both from the area. They demanded an apology. Sharma refused.Independent legislator Muzaffar Iqbal Khan of Thanamandi in Rajouri district said Sharma’s statement has hurt public sentiment. “This is not just an insult to Pir Panjal but also to Chenab valley — Kishtwar and Doda,” he said. “We are border-area people. We have made sacrifices even during Operation Sindoor. In Poonch city alone, 16 people were killed. Those sacrifices have been insulted.”The protests resumed Thursday as lawmakers accused Sharma of reflecting “hatred” towards Pir Panjal and Chenab valley. Omar said criticism of a region by questioning its identity was unacceptable in a diverse Union territory.",Sunil Sharma of BJP dismissed the existence of the ‘Pir Panjal region’ The region refers to the mountainous belt south of Kashmir valley and close to the LoC.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

JAMMU: A high-powered Union home ministry panel has questioned Ladakh’s top political groupings on whether inclusion under the Constitution’s Sixth Schedule would offer sufficient safeguards, signalling that New Delhi is weighing constitutional limits, fiscal costs and governance models as demands for statehood gather force in the region.During talks Wednesday in New Delhi, the committee asked representatives of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Party (KDA) whether Sixth Schedule — framed for tribal areas in the Northeast — could serve as a constitutional shield for Ladakh, given that it falls under Article 368 and can be amended, sources said Thursday.Govt also sought clarity on the financial burden of granting Ladakh full statehood with a legislature, including salaries, provident fund liabilities and other expenditures for about 19,000 employees. Running a state or a Union territory with a legislature involves managing deficits and long-term fiscal responsibility, prompting the panel to press Ladakhi activists for detailed projections, the sources said.Sixth Schedule grants special protections over land, culture, and resources through autonomous councils. Since the 2019 bifurcation of J&K into two Union territories, Ladakhis have demanded similar safeguards and statehood.Senior BJP functionary Tashi Gyalson, who attended the meeting as former executive chairman of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, called the talks a step forward. “Talks were held for two-and-a-half hours and every member spoke,” he told reporters, saying discussions covered statehood, Sixth Schedule and the possibility of Article 370-type safeguards.“In broader terms govt indicated that Ladakh will get constitutional safeguards, that the region will be politically empowered, and that Ladakh will be developed as a sustainable model,” Gyalson said.LAB and KDA — umbrella groupings of political and religious organisations from Leh and Kargil — described the discussions as inconclusive. LAB co-chairman Chering Dorjay Lakrook and his KDA counterpart Asgar Ali Karbali said statehood for Ladakh and inclusion under Sixth Schedule — the two core demands — remained unresolved. Both expected another round of talks soon.Earlier, LAB and KDA met the home ministry panel in New Delhi on Oct 22, 2025. That engagement followed Centre’s decision to order an inquiry into the Sept 24 police firing on protesters in Leh demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status. Four protesters were killed.On Nov 14, the two groups submitted a joint 29-page draft proposal to the home ministry. The document also sought a general amnesty for LAB member and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and others arrested after the Sept 24 protests.","Union home ministry panel questions Ladakh's top political groupings on whether inclusion under the Constitution’s Sixth Schedule would offer sufficient safeguards.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

New Delhi: Congress MP and lawyer Vivek Tankha on Thursday wrote a letter to home minister Amit Shah seeking the release of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk who is detained under the stringent National Security Act, arguing that “a misunderstanding should not be stretched to a point where it causes deep hurt to the “soul of an entire region”.Tankha, whose roots are in J&K, told Shah, “He (Wangchuk) breathes India, thinks India, and lives for India.”Wangchuk was detained in Sept 2025 following protests in Ladakh demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the UT.“Nobody in India believes that Wangchuk deserves incarceration under NSA.

‘Insensitive government in West Bengal’

‘Congress, Congress, Congress … and Assam’

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday unleashed a scathing attack on the opposition, with a special focus on rivals in poll-bound states of West Bengal and Assam At the receiving end were the Congress , which is the BJP’s principal challenger in Assam and a key contender for power in Kerala, and the Trinamool Congress , which is the saffron party’s arch political rival in West Bengal. The DMK, which rules poll-bound Tamil Nadu, also found a mention in the Prime Minister’s speech but there were no direct charges against the MK Stalin government.While the sharpest salvos were reserved for the Congress and the Gandhis, Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress came under attack for allegedly supporting the infiltrators.The Congress was quick to dub the Prime Minister’s address as “another election rally speech” and accused him of speaking lies.""Another election rally speech lasting 97 minutes in the Rajya Sabha today by the Prime Minister. As always, it was overflowing with abuses and assaults, distortions and dramatics, innuendos and insults -- and of course his usual quota of blatant and brazen lies,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on X.""His self-obsession and his fixation on dialogue-baazi and demagoguery was on full display,"" the Congress leader added.The Prime Minister called the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal “insensitive” and alleged that the ruling party was helping infiltrators. He took a jibe at Mamata Banerjee who herself appeared in the Supreme Court to argue in an ongoing case against the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in her state.West Bengal will vote to elect a new assembly in a month or two and the BJP is going all out to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress.""Our colleagues from the TMC spoke a lot... They should introspect... A merciless government that is creating new records of decline, and they are giving sermons here. Such merciless government is pushing the future of people into darkness,"" Modi said referring to the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government.""They only care about power... Even the most prosperous countries are pushing out illegal infiltrators. In our country, courts are being pressured to save infiltrators,"" he alleged.""How would the youth of the country forgive such people who are putting in efforts to fight the case of infiltrators? They are snatching the rights of our youth, their livelihood... tribal land. It endangers the lives of our sons and daughters... But they only care about power, and they are advising us,"" he lamented. Modi said they are ""blind"" to these problems being faced by the youth.The bulk of Prime Minister Modi’s speech was focussed on the Congress and the Gandhis including Jawahar Lal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.The Congress was accused of insulting the President and hence the entire tribals and the women community, insulting a Sikh BJP leader Ravneet Singh Bittu and hence the entire Sikh community and finally insulting an Assamese acting Lok Sabha Speaker on chair and hence the entire Assamese people.Talking about disruptions in the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister said, ""Congress insulted the President. It's shameful...Yesterday in the Lok Sabha, a discussion could not be held on the President's address. It is an insult to the office of the President. Such people do not have the right to speak about the Constitution"".""You have insulted tribals, women, and the top post of India,"" he pointed out.""The incident that took place in the Lok Sabha is very painful. We can understand your frustration, but it was done in the temple of democracy. At that time, there was an MP from Assam in the chair, and papers were thrown at him. Is it not an insult to the northeast? Not an insult to the people of Assam?""He was referring to Dilip Saikia, a BJP MP from Darrang-Udalguri in Assam, and Krishna Prasad Tenneti, a TDP MP from Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh. Both are members of the Panel of Chairpersons in the Lok Sabha.Assam, like Bengal, will vote to elect a new assembly in some months and the Congress is going all out to defeat the BJP which has ruled the state for the last 10 years.With the entire opposition staging a walkout from Rajya Sabha after initially raising slogans against the Centre, the Prime Minister made the speech without any disruptions. The opposition claimed that the leaders of opposition (LoP) in both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha were not being allowed to speak, prompting them to stage a walkout.""Vipaksha ki awaaz nahi dabegi. Tanashahi nahi chalegi. LoP (Leader of Opposition) ko bolne do. (The opposition's voice can't be suppressed. Dictatorship cannot work. Let the LoP speak),"" the opposition leaders raised slogans as soon as the Prime Minister started to speak. However, once they walked out there were no further disruptions unlike in Lok Sabha where the Prime Minister did not come to speak yesterday.(With inputs from agencies)","Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed a scathing attack on the opposition, with a special focus on rivals in poll-bound states of West Bengal and Assam. The Congress was quick to dub the Prime Minister’s address as “another election rally speech” and accused him of speaking lies.

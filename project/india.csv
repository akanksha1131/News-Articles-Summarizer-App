BJP Hits Out at Tejashwi Yadav, Calls Rahul Gandhi PM Dreams Unrealist

(They forget that Lalu Ji’s blood runs in my veins. If he never bowed, do they think his son will be afraid? We are fighters.

Brothers, unite or they will finish your existence.)

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday said, “Ye log bhool gaye Lalu Ji ka khoon hai mere andar,” as he accused the BJP-led central government of undermining the Constitution and urged people to unite to safeguard their rights.He was speaking at the Samvidhaan Suraksha Samelan in Motihari as part of the ongoing Voter Adhikar Yatra.In a post on X in Hindi, Yadav referred to his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav . Tejashwi wrote, “Ye log bhool gaye Lalu Ji ka khoon hai mere andar, Lalu ji nahi jhuke to Lalu ji ka ladka dar jaega...? We are fighters... Bhaiya log, unite. Otherwise, they will end your existence.”The former deputy chief minister warned that the government’s actions could gradually strip citizens of their rights. “First, they will snatch your vote, then your ration, then your pension, and finally your assets. Democracy will be replaced by dictatorship,” he said.Yadav also reiterated his party’s promise to increase reservation benefits, saying he would raise the quota to 85 per cent.Taking a swipe at Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, he remarked, “Chacha has been stuck... He is not the same as he was earlier... He will not be the CM anymore.”Calling the Constitution the foundation of people’s rights, Tejashwi urged citizens to remove those in power if they wished to protect democracy.",RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav accused the BJP-led central government of undermining the Constitution.

'Never said someone should retire': RSS chief on 75-year age limit; dismisses speculations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/never-said-someone-should-retire-rss-chief-on-75-year-age-limit-dismisses-speculations/articleshow/123566935.cms,"RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Big Statement: Hindu-Muslim Already One, Muslims Deserve Equal Job Rights

NEW DELHI: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh put a final full stop to the speculation over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's retirement as he is going to hit the age of 75 after his birthday this September. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat , while speaking at the event “100 Years Journey of Sangh – New Horizon” on Thursday, clarified ongoing speculation around retirement norms. He dismissed reports suggesting that he or anyone in the Sangh must step down upon reaching the age of 75.""No bar on a family person becoming RSS chief, but the person needs to devote all his time to the organisation. I never said I will retire or someone else should retire at 75 years,"" RSS chief Bhagwat said.Over the past few years, the opposition has consistently criticised the BJP for its apparent policy of not fielding candidates older than 75.This stance was allegedly based on comments made by Shah prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, where he stated that it was his party's decision not to give Lok Sabha poll tickets to those above 75 years of age, leading to veteran leaders like L K Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi missing out.Shah said, ""Only the media is pushing this issue. No one above 75 has been given tickets. This is the party's decision."" He made these remarks in an interview to 'The Week'.However, Shah later clarified that this was an electoral decision, emphasising, ""There is no provision regarding age, anywhere in the Constitution of the BJP.""Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal also voiced his concerns, stating, ""He ( PM Modi) will retire next year. He is seeking votes to making Amit Shah the Prime Minister,"" during his election campaign. Additionally, Shah asserted that the BJP does not mandate leaders over the age of 75 to retire.",Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh put a final full stop to the speculation over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's retirement.

RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Big Statement: Hindu-Muslim Already One, Muslims Deserve Equal Job Rights

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said there is no rift between the Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said the Sangh can give advice on any issue, but the final decision will be taken by the BJP.The RSS chief said there could be ""difference of opinion"" while working towards the goals of the country, but there was no “manbhed (heart-to-heart differences)”.""There are opinions, but we discuss and form a consensus to decide whether it is against one's opinion or in favour of it. I will follow the collective decision. When that nature is there, quarrel doesn't exist. There can be matbhed (difference of opinion) here, but no manbhed (heart-to-heart disagreement). We need to move forward in one direction, and not different ones,"" Bhagwat said during a three-day lecture series to mark the centenary year of the RSS.Bhagwat said the Sangh has good coordination with the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre, as it did with earlier governments.""We have good coordination with every government, be it state or central. Not only this one. But there are systems that have some internal contradictions.The system (of governance) in general is the same, which was invented by the British so that they could rule. We need some innovation... even if the man in the chair is 100 per cent behind us, he has to do it, and he knows what the hurdles are. He may be able to do it, he may not. But we have to give him independence. There is no quarrel anywhere,"" he said.On the selection of the BJP president, Bhagwat said the RSS has no role. ""It’s completely wrong,"" he said, responding to a question on whether the Sangh decides everything for the BJP including its chief.""We don't decide. If we were deciding, would it have taken so long. We don’t do (decide). We don’t have to. Take your time. We don’t have to say anything,"" he said, drawing applause from the audience.He added that it is not possible for the RSS to take decisions for the BJP.The BJP, he said, has its own expertise in running political affairs, just as the RSS has in managing its shakhas.""I am running shakhas for last 50 years. If anyone advices me on running a shakha, then I am its expert. They are running state (government) for many years. So they are expert in state affairs.

Workforce demand fuels migration

Expansion of consular services in Yekaterinburg

Growing presence in high-skilled sectors

Russian visa categories and application process

Indian embassy issues visa fraud advisory

Indian community continues to grow

As traditional destinations like the UK, US, and Canada adopt more restrictive immigration policies and tighten work visa norms, Russia is emerging as a new opportunity hub for Indian workers. Russian companies across key sectors such as construction, electronics, manufacturing, and heavy machinery are actively recruiting skilled Indian professionals to address a growing domestic workforce shortage and support ongoing industrial and infrastructure development.According to India’s Ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, the demand for Indian workers is rising, prompting an increase in consular workload. He noted that consular services are expanding to meet the needs of the growing Indian community in Russia, as reported by the TASS.The Russian labour market is facing a critical shortage. According to Russia’s Ministry of Labour, the country is projected to experience a workforce deficit of 3.1 million by 2030. In response, the government plans to increase the quota for qualified foreign workers by 1.5 times in 2025, allowing for 230,000 individuals.Companies are currently hiring Indian nationals under existing Russian regulations, quotas, and laws. As quoted by the TASS, Kumar said, “At a broader level, there is a manpower requirement in Russia, and India has skilled manpower. So at present, within the framework of Russian regulations, laws and quotas, the companies are hiring Indians.”The initial wave of Indian workers began arriving in Russian regions in 2024, starting at the Za Rodinu fish processing complex in Kaliningrad, which was facing a labour shortage.Andrey Besedin, head of the Ural Chamber of Commerce and Industry, stated that by the end of the year, around 1 million Indian specialists are expected to come to Russia, including the Sverdlovsk region, as reported by the TASS. He also announced the opening of a new Consulate General in Yekaterinburg to handle increasing consular requirements.Sverdlovsk, with Yekaterinburg as its capital, is home to major heavy industries and military-industrial facilities such as Uralmash and Ural Wagon Zavod, the latter known for producing the T-90 tank. Besedin noted that many positions in these factories are vacant due to deployment of workers in military operations in Ukraine and a decline in local youth participation in industrial jobs.While early Indian arrivals were mainly in the construction and textile industries, the demand is now rising in electronics and machinery sectors. Vinay Kumar told the TASS that “most of the people who have come are in the construction and textile sectors,” but highlighted a growing need in high-end sectors like machinery and electronics.Russia offers various types of employment visas, including single-entry visas for short-term assignments, multiple-entry visas for long-term jobs, and Highly Qualified Specialist (HQS) visas for professionals. There is also a work patent option for self-employed individuals. Visa processing durations range from 5 to 30 business days depending on the type and consulate. Applicants are required to submit a completed form, valid passport, passport-sized photographs, a work invitation, a medical certificate, proof of qualifications, and sometimes an employment agreement. Expedited services are available at an additional fee.The Indian Embassy has issued a warning about fraudulent job offers. It cautioned Indian nationals against agents who offer tourist or business visas with job promises in Russia, stating that such visas do not permit employment and cannot be converted to work permits. The advisory was issued due to multiple incidents reported to the embassy.Currently, approximately 14,000 Indians reside in Russia, along with 1,500 Afghan nationals of Indian origin. The community includes skilled workers, professionals, and students. About 4,500 Indian students are pursuing medical and technical courses, with nearly 90 per cent enrolled in medical universities. Other fields include engineering, computer science, aeronautical design, transport technology, agriculture, and business management.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

CBSE announces major reforms for LOC submission ahead of Class 10 and 12 board exams 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/cbse-announces-major-reforms-for-loc-submission-ahead-of-class-10-and-12-board-exams-2026/articleshow/123547542.cms,"CBSE LOC details 2025

Two-board examination policy for Class 10



Integration of APAAR IDs in LOC submissions

Stringent data requirements for schools

Dedicated portal for children with Special Needs (CWSN)



Implications and outlook

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has unveiled sweeping reforms in the submission of the List of Candidates (LOC) for the Class 10 and 12 board examinations of 2026, signalling a marked shift in the board’s examination management framework. The LOC, a cornerstone in the preparation of board exams, now carries additional layers of accountability and technological integration aimed at ensuring accuracy, transparency, and inclusivity. These changes include stricter validation of student data, enhanced digital verification processes, and a more streamlined interface for school administrators, all designed to minimise errors and improve efficiency across affiliated institutions.For the first time, CBSE is implementing a two-board examination policy for Class 10. Under this new paradigm, the Main Examinations, scheduled for mid-February, remain mandatory for all students. Schools are instructed to submit LOC data for all candidates appearing in this primary examination. In addition, a Second Board Examination will be conducted subsequently, with LOC submissions to be completed post the conclusion of the first exam.This dual-examination framework reflects the board’s emphasis on providing students multiple opportunities for academic validation, while simultaneously imposing stricter procedural compliance on affiliated schools.Explained: What Tele-MANAS offers students and why CBSE wants schools to act now In a significant technological upgrade, CBSE has mandated the linking of Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) IDs with LOC data for both Class 10 and 12 students. Schools within India are now required to submit LOC data only for candidates possessing an APAAR ID, which the board will validate at the time of submission. Affiliated schools abroad, however, are exempt from this requirement due to administrative and legal constraints. This integration is expected to streamline student records, reduce errors, and enhance the robustness of academic data management.CBSE has underscored the importance of meticulous data preparation. Schools must collate comprehensive details for each candidate, including personal identifiers, parent/guardian information, date of birth, APAAR ID (for Indian schools), correct subject codes, subject combinations as per the scheme of studies, and the category under which the candidate is applying—be it First Sitting (FS), Improvement, or Compartment. The board has issued a strict advisory, emphasizing that only error-free data will be accepted, and reiterated that students not listed via the online LOC submission will be ineligible to sit for the 2026 board examinations.In a progressive move towards inclusivity, CBSE has launched a dedicated portal for Children with Special Needs (CWSN). The portal is designed for schools to submit records and information pertaining to CWSN students, thereby ensuring the implementation of appropriate relaxations and accommodations during examinations. This initiative reinforces CBSE’s commitment to equitable assessment practices and systematic support for differently-abled learners.These reforms mark a transformative phase in the CBSE’s examination ecosystem. By combining procedural rigour with technological sophistication, the board aims to reduce administrative lapses, enhance data accuracy, and broaden the accessibility of its examination system. For schools, the emphasis on precise LOC submission and APAAR linkage imposes a heightened responsibility, while for students, these measures promise a more transparent and structured examination process.With the 2026 board examinations poised to implement these reforms, CBSE’s latest notification underscores a deliberate shift toward operational efficiency, digital integration, and inclusivity, redefining the contours of India’s largest school-level examination body.Candidates can click on the link provided here to download the official notice regarding CBSE's LOC guidelines.","The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has unveiled sweeping reforms in the submission of the List of Candidates (LOC) for the Class 10 and 12 board examinations of 2026.

A fresh wave of bomb threat emails has hit the national capital, with around 20 colleges, including Jesus and Mary College in Chanakyapuri, receiving threatening messages, according to the Delhi Fire Services (DFS).Authorities confirmed that the threatening email was received on Wednesday and, after thorough verification, was declared a hoax. Preliminary findings suggest the sender may have used a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to mask their identity.This incident follows a recent series of similar threats. Just last week, over 100 schools across Delhi received bomb threats over five days, all of which were later found to be false alarms.On August 21, multiple schools in Delhi received bomb threats, leading to large-scale evacuations and emergency searches. Six schools in areas including Dwarka Sector 5 and Prasad Nagar were targeted early that morning.Teams from the Delhi Police, Fire Services, bomb disposal squads, and dog squads were deployed immediately. While no suspicious objects were found, searches continued throughout the day. Authorities are actively working to trace the IP addresses linked to the emails.Earlier, on August 18, Delhi Public School (DPS) in Dwarka received a bomb threat, prompting an emergency response. That threat, too, was ultimately found to be baseless.The recurring nature of these hoax threats has triggered fears and disrupted regular academic activities. Last month, over 50 schools across Delhi received similar emails, prompting several institutions to temporarily shift to online classes. Emergency teams, including bomb disposal units and fire brigades, were dispatched across the city.In previous incidents, schools like Abhinav Public School in Rohini and Richmond Global School in Paschim Vihar were among those affected. St Stephen's College and St Thomas School in Dwarka also received similar threats in July, just days after other schools had been targeted.On July 17, at least seven schools were affected due to these email threats.These repeated incidents have raised serious concerns among students, parents, and educational institutions.While all threats so far have been declared hoaxes, the frequency of such incidents has alarmed the public. In May, over 200 schools, along with hospitals, colleges, and even the Indira Gandhi International Airport, received similar threats — many of which remain under investigation, especially those traced to foreign VPNs.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday granted journalist and YouTuber Abhisar Sharma four weeks’ protection from arrest in connection with an FIR filed by Assam Police.The case relates to a video Sharma uploaded on 8 August, criticising the Assam government’s alleged communal politics and questioning the allotment of 3,000 bighas of land in the tribal Dima Hasao district to a private firm for a cement factory.While the Court refused to entertain Sharma’s plea to quash the FIR and challenge the validity of Section 152 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deals with acts endangering India's sovereignty, it issued notice on the constitutional validity of the section. The bench asked Sharma to approach the Gauhati high court for further relief.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Sharma, urged the Court to maintain consistency, noting similar relief had been granted to other journalists. “Civil society looks up to the Supreme Court. Please don’t do this,” he said.","The case relates to a video Sharma uploaded on 8 August, criticising the Assam government’s alleged communal politics.

IAF Workhorse MiG-21 Makes Last Sorties At Nal Ahead Of Sept 26 Chandigarh Farewell

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air Chief Marshal A P Singh says India must adopt its own model instead of copying others.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

Poll What is your opinion on the switch from TCS to Eduquity as the exam conducting agency? A positive change A negative change

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” He said no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.

NEW DELHI: Author Arundhati Roy on Thursday said that ""almost all the people who we call ‘antinationals’ are the ones who care"" while those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.""Almost all the people who we call 'antinationals' are the ones who care. And then the people who call themselves great nationalists, I can bet you that 99 per cent of them are dodging taxes, have sent their kids to America, or are doing everything to make sure that what goes on in this country doesn't affect their personal wealth or their whatever bullshit,"" Roy was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.She was speaking at the launch of her memoir. The book is centred on her relationship with her mother, Mary Roy, a women’s rights activist who fought the landmark inheritance case for Syrian Christian women in Kerala.Roy said she wrote the memoir after Mary’s death in 2022, describing it as ""born out of the onrush of memories and feelings provoked"" by her mother’s passing. ""I wrote this book because I feel that my mother is someone who deserves to be shared with the world,"" she said, as quoted by PTI.The 63-year-old, who won the Booker Prize in 1997 for, said her writing has always come from ""a place of love and caring about something"".""I write when it becomes harder to keep quiet than to write,"" Roy told PTI in an interview. She added, ""People don't understand why one gets so upset? Why do I write? Because it comes from a place of love. It comes from caring about something. Otherwise, why should I bother? Like, why shouldn't I enjoy my Booker Prize or whatever it was.""She said she does not see herself as both a writer and activist. ""It’s a label I find absurd, something like the clunky term sofa-bed,"" she remarked.Roy described writing itself as a risky pursuit. ""The most dangerous place in the history of time has been writing. I've never been under any illusion that it was a safe place. So I'm okay here. Because it's the safety that suffocates me,"" she said.The memoir details her difficult relationship with her mother, who, she recalls, insisted her children address her as “Mrs Roy” like other students at her school in Kerala. “It was almost as though for her (Mary) to shine her light on her students and give them all she had, we — he (the brother) and I (Roy) — had to absorb the darkness,” Roy writes.She added, “She was rough, and that roughness was what put some steel into my spine... So when all those people were around me — protesting and calling me names — I’d just be going like, 'Do you know whose daughter I am?' Like, my needle isn't moving at all.”Over the years, Arundhati Roy has faced cases, protests, and even a day in jail for supporting the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Her bookwas banned in Jammu and Kashmir this August along with 24 other titles for allegedly promoting ""false narrative and secessionism"".","Arundhati Roy says those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.

Poll Do you believe Gorakhpur will continue to attract significant investments in the coming years? Yes, definitely No, I don't think so

LUCKNOW: Once overlooked by investors, Gorakhpur has transformed into a significant industrial hub under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Incentive-driven policies, ease of doing business, and improved connectivity have encouraged reputable national and multinational companies to invest in the city, according to a press release from the state government.In the current financial year alone, the Gorakhpur Industrial Development Authority (GIDA) has allocated a record 182 acres of land for 54 new units, paving the way for Rs 5,800 crore in capital investment and creating 8,500 jobs. Over the last five years, GIDA has received proposals worth Rs 9,445 crore, generating nearly 23,000 employment opportunities.Global and national brands, including PepsiCo, Keyan Distillery, Gyan Dairy, Technoplast, Central Warehousing Corporation, Kapila Agro Industry, and APL Apollo Tubes, have already made their presence felt. Recently, Adani Group's Ambuja Cement and Coca-Cola bottler Amrit Bottlers acquired land for new units.Meanwhile, Reliance Consumer Products Limited and Shree Cements have expressed interest, with their representatives visiting GIDA sites to explore investment options.To meet growing demand, GIDA has not only strengthened its land bank but also initiated the development of Dhuriapar Industrial Township in southern Gorakhpur as a new industrial hub, where two major projects have already been allotted land.""Under the Chief Minister's guidance, Gorakhpur has built a strong ecosystem for investment. Land is being provided as per investor preference, and industrial interest is rising steadily,"" said Anuj Malik, CEO of GIDA.With world-class road, rail, and air connectivity now in place, Gorakhpur--once hesitant to attract even local investors--is rapidly establishing itself on India's industrial map.The financial year 2025-26 is expected to see significant investments in land allocated across various sectors.Shreyash Distilleries leads the list with a proposed investment of Rs 2,667 crore, followed by Ambuja Cement, part of the Adani Group, planning an investment of Rs 1,400 crore.

‘EC Is Now BJP Commission’: INDIA Bloc Slams CEC, Drops Hint On 'Impeachment' Amid Bihar SIR Row

NEW DELHI: Election Commission sources said Wednesday the poll body had no legal authority to investigate the source or quantum of contributions received by a political party, be it a recognised national/state party or a registered unrecognised political party (RUPP).As per Section 29C of Representation of the People Act 1951, a political party must, on an annual basis, file a contribution report with EC, declaring all donations received in excess of Rs 20,000. Once the party files the contribution report, an acknowledgement is issued through the chief electoral officer concerned. This acknowledgment is used by the party to claim tax relief while filing its income-tax return for the said financial year.“It is the Central Board for Direct Taxes (CBDT) that has the legal mandate to probe the source and extent of contributions received and declared by the political parties,” an official told TOI.Stating that the EC can at most delist a RUPP if it has not contested elections for six continuous years, is not found at its registered address or has not filed its contribution reports and annual audit reports, etc. Delisting makes a RUPP ineligible for tax exemption.EC is already reviewing the fulfilment of these conditions by the RUPPs. Earlier, 537 RUPPs were delisted. Under CEC Gyanesh Kumar, 334 parties were delisted on Aug 9; another 476 were put on notice two days later.There are currently 2520 RUPPs across the country.Interestingly, in the case of the five Gujarat parties that figure among the 10 top RUPPs in terms of donations received, their contributions almost match the expenditure. Also, two of these five Gujarat RUPPs had fought 2024 general election, one the Delhi assembly election in 2025 and the remaining two, the 2022 Gujarat assembly polls.","EC sources say the poll body has no legal authority to investigate the source or quantum of contributions received by a political party.

NEW DELHI: The sentiment for a boycott of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the bill on dismissal of jailed ministers is growing, with Communist Party of India (CPI) on Tuesday saying that the parliamentary panels are a sham and serve no purpose under BJP govt. The CPI stance after boycott decision by four opposition parties will increase the pressure on Congress to follow suit.CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said the JPC on Waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash. “There was a time when members on the JPC could summon documents, scrutinise details and then make contributions. Now, the opposition’s suggestions are rejected out of hand. The JPC on Waqf bill is an example. It is of no value,” he told TOI .While the Left parties don’t have the strength to be in the parliamentary panels and depend on the govt’s goodwill to find a place in them, the CPI opinion carries weight since it could be seen as representative of other smaller Left constituents.The sentiment of an integral part of the opposition INDIA bloc follows announcements by TMC, Samajwadi Party, Sena UBT and AAP that they will not participate in the JPC that is being formed to scrutinise the controversial bills, including the constitutional amendment.The offensive from the bigger INDIA bloc parties has forced Congress to take a relook at its inclination to join the proposed JPC in the interest of opposition unity. There is regret in Congress that compulsion of unity may nudge the party into following the cue of TMC-SP-Shiv Sena, arguing it will result in complications for the future, as well as when the three controversial bills come up in the parliament for discussion.Many key INDIA bloc parties like DMK, NCP (SP) and CPM have not spoken out yet, since they seem to be waiting for Congress to take a final decision.

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.

A wake-up call: Protecting players from silent head injuries

As the NFL remembers Tyler Sash nearly a decade after his untimely passing, Brett Favre has shared a deeply personal tribute that goes beyond nostalgia. Sash, a Super Bowl XLVI champion with the New York Giants, tragically died at 27, and posthumous tests revealed Stage 2 CTE. Favre’s message is a call to acknowledge the hidden toll of head injuries in football, blending remembrance with urgent advocacy for player safety.Tyler Sash’s football journey was marked by brilliance and determination, but his life after the field tells a sobering story. Post-retirement, Sash struggled with memory lapses, mood swings, and cognitive confusion, challenges now linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Favre underscores that these struggles are not mere statistics—they are the human cost of repeated collisions. “We can’t let his story fade into silence,” Favre said, framing Sash’s life as a cautionary tale for fans and athletes alike.Favre’s message carries weight because it comes from someone who intimately understands football’s physical and emotional demands.

These firsthand accounts illustrate CTE’s insidious progression, revealing a struggle hidden from stadium lights and highlight reels.Concussed: The American Dream captures Sash’s story with a blend of interviews, archival footage, and reflections from Favre, offering a vivid portrait of CTE’s impact. Favre hopes the documentary ignites dialogue around concussion safety and inspires tangible change in athlete care. “If even one family learns from Tyler’s story, his life continues to make a difference,” he emphasized, highlighting the potential for awareness to save lives while honoring Sash’s legacy.Sash’s story is both a memorial and a lesson, reminding fans and players of the hidden dangers behind every helmet.

Antonio Brown’s five-word post ignites the internet

Tyreek Hill, Keeta Vaccaro, and the real financial stakes

The personal and financial fallout of Tyreek Hill’s short-lived marriage is making headlines, but it was Antonio Brown’s online commentary that sent the story viral. The Miami Dolphins wide receiver is reportedly facing steep divorce obligations to estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, and Brown wasted no time in weighing in with his trademark bluntness. What could have been just another celebrity divorce update quickly morphed into a cultural flashpoint about money, respect, and the realities of high-profile relationships.Sports insider Dov Kleiman reported that Hill could be forced to pay Vaccaro between $20,000 and $50,000 per month in “spending money,” along with a one-off “$500,000” check. Brown quote-posted the report with the line, “Them Miami Hoes Will Get You Everytime…”His phrasing immediately overshadowed the financial figures. Critics argued his comment was misogynistic, while others defended it as hard-edged honesty about the risks athletes face when wealth and love collide. Brown, already known for stirring controversy, once again positioned himself at the center of an NFL-adjacent debate.Beyond the viral soundbite, Hill’s legal situation is no joke. After only 15 months of marriage, the potential settlement figures reflect not just his multimillion-dollar earnings but also the lifestyle considerations courts often factor into support cases. One fan’s reply captured the financial angle perfectly: “When will guys learn the magical word… prenup…”It’s a reminder that behind every high-profile romance lies the practical question of asset protection. For Hill, who remains one of the league’s brightest stars, the financial toll could be significant both on and off the field.Also Read: “Taylor Swift fans in doggy”: Antonio Brown mocks Swifties with crude meme sparking online outrage The Brown-fueled uproar proves one thing: in today’s NFL, divorce drama doesn’t just play out in courtrooms — it’s fought on timelines, reshaped in memes, and debated by millions in real time.","Antonio Brown’s five-word post ignites the internet about Tyreek Hill.

Darryl ‘Buster’ Skrine accused of running $300K fraud across States

Buster Skrine’s NFL legacy tarnished by fraud allegations

Former NFL cornerback Darryl “Buster” Skrine has once again found himself in legal trouble after being arrested in Georgia on Wednesday. Authorities confirmed the 36-year-old faces 18 charges, including identity fraud, deposit account fraud, theft by taking, and financial transaction card fraud. Police allege that Skrine targeted women through online dating platforms, convincing them to send money under false pretenses.Investigators claim Skrine told women he was in financial distress and promised to repay them through his NFL annuity. Instead, the former defensive back allegedly funneled the money into luxury expenses such as Airbnbs, travel, and gift cards. So far, victims from Wisconsin, North Carolina, and New York have been identified, with combined losses estimated at $300,000. Officials believe more victims could emerge as the probe expands nationwide.The arrest in Georgia adds to Skrine’s ongoing legal battles. Canadian authorities have pursued him since May 2024, when he skipped a court appearance in a separate fraud case and removed his GPS tracker. Skrine was previously detained in August 2023 at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport on fraud-related charges, accused of depositing counterfeit checks and withdrawing $100,000 before disappearing.Roswell police confirmed they are working with Canadian officials to ensure Skrine is held accountable in both countries. The case has now taken on international significance, further damaging the image of a player who once built his reputation on the NFL field.Skrine’s fall from grace has been swift and dramatic. Drafted in the fifth round in 2011 by the Cleveland Browns, he went on to play for the New York Jets, Chicago Bears, San Francisco 49ers, and Tennessee Titans. Over 11 seasons, he earned nearly $40 million and finished his career with 491 solo tackles, 10 interceptions, six forced fumbles, and 3.5 sacks across 157 games. He retired in 2022, remembered as a hard-hitting cornerback with consistent performances.Also Read: Travis Kelce goes from NFL star to fashion icon with American Eagle collaboration after engagement to Taylor Swift Today, however, Skrine’s career is overshadowed by fraud charges that span two countries. What was once the story of a steady NFL professional has now turned into a cautionary tale of financial crime and deception. With investigations widening, authorities believe more victims could still come forward, leaving Skrine facing a long and uncertain legal road ahead.","Darryl ‘Buster’ Skrine accused of running $300K fraud across States.

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Also Read:

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan’s actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick’s, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan’s name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan’s legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan’s lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,“No one, whether or not they’re a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.”Jordan added, “I hope this case sends a clear message…that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.”He further added:""The case was not about the money, as I plan to donate the proceeds to charity. It was about honesty and integrity.... I also hope the size of the monetary reward will deter others from using someone else's identity and believing they will only pay a small penalty.""In 2015, Michael Jordan not only won an $8.9 million verdict but also settled a parallel case with Jewel-Osco, contributing proceeds from both to Chicago-area charities, funding 23 organizations and reinforcing his steadfast commitment to community support and identity rights.Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children’s health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, “Chicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city’s future.”At 62, Michael Jordan stands as more than a basketball legend—he is a cultural icon. The Dominick’s case highlights how he fiercely defends his rights and turns his victories into ways to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan’s commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtWith a $10 million contribution to Novant, Michael Jordan helped open his fourth ""Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic"" in Wilmington, his hometown, in February 2025. The facility, which is 7,300-sq-ft and open to patients from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., offers primary care services in twelve patient rooms for underinsured and uninsured patients across five operating days each weekday. Building on earlier Charlotte and Wilmington clinics, Jordan's sincere comments stressed the importance of providing premium healthcare access to the neighborhood that molded him.Michael Jordan’s $8.9 million lawsuit victory and $10 million clinic donation prove his legacy goes beyond basketball. By defending his name and funding healthcare, Jordan shows integrity, community care, and lasting impact on future generations.In addition to his legal victories and charitable work, Michael Jordan has consistently expanded his philanthropic efforts, surpassing $30 million in healthcare donations since 2017, ensuring underserved communities in North Carolina gain lasting access to quality medical care and support.","Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015.

Dwyane Wade praises Michael Beasley after Miami 305 wins Big3 championship

Mario F*cking Chalmers!

Minnesota Timberwolves breakout season proves Michael Beasley can carry a team

The three-time NBA champion and a Hall of Famer, Miami Heat icon Dwyane Wade has undergone all the pleasures of being in locker rooms with such legends as LeBron James , Chris Bosh, and Shaquille O’Neal and has developed his own legacy of being fast, a leader and at the right moment. Most recently, Wade stirred the waters with a bold commentary concerning a one-time co-worker who took a different path in his career: Michael Beasley . Wade declared Beasley as being one of the most talented players that would not be in the NBA today which sparked debate of untapped talent and the ugly reality of the league.Dwyane Wade shared his thoughts on ""The Timeout,"" a show on his YouTube channel where he dives into basketball topics with a blend of nostalgia and insight. This episode came out recently, right after Michael Beasley's impressive performance in the Big3 league—a 3-on-3 basketball competition started by rapper Ice Cube back in 2017.Dwyane Wade was giving a ""shoutout"" to Beasley, who played a key role in leading his team, Miami 305, to a championship win against the Chicago Triplets with a score of 52-48. In that match, Beasley scored 25 points, grabbed 12 rebounds, and dished out three assists, wrapping up a season where he snagged the Big3 MVP award for the second consecutive year.Wade's full quote was passionate and direct: ""Shoutout to Michael Beasley. You hear a lot of guys say this. Michael Beasley is probably the most talented basketball player who’s not in the NBA. When you think about how talented he is, you don’t understand why he’s not in the NBA.You understand maybe he might not be a star, but you don’t understand why he’s not in the league because of the talent that young man has in his body. ""He conveyed this message to his viewers on the show, stressing Beasley's innate skills while admitting the frustrations linked to his lack of presence in the NBA.In a similar vein, on his podcast ""The Why with Dwyane Wade"", Dwyane Wade elaborated further, noting that Beasley has endured significant challenges ""mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally."" He shared that Beasley once felt like he was ""walking on eggshells"" to blend in and seize chances, but these days he looks a lot more relaxed with who he is in other leagues.Dwyane Wade's timing with the praise was spot on. Just last week, Beasley took home the Big3 championship, delivering a vital assist for the winning basket in the final. This victory marked his fourth season in the league and reinforced his position as one of the top players.The Big3, featuring former NBA players in a fast-paced, half-court game, has provided Beasley with a chance to highlight his abilities without the grind of an 82-game NBA schedule. His back-to-back MVP titles in 2024 and 2025 show that he still has plenty of energy left at the age of 36.Beasley's road to this moment has been quite the ride. Coming out of Kansas State University in 2008, he was a college superstar, averaging 26.2 points and 12.4 rebounds per game in his freshman year.The Miami Heat chose him second overall in the NBA Draft, right after Derrick Rose. The hype was immense; scouts considered him a scoring dynamo with All-Star potential. During his rookie season (2008-09), he averaged 13.9 points off the bench for the Heat, displaying flashes of brilliance next to Dwyane Wade.Michael Beasley lived a life full of injury, poor performance, and off-the-court issues, including alleged mental health and drug problems. He was eventually traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2010, to allow the Heat to have the so-called era of the Big Three with LeBaron and Bosh.In 2010-11, his breakout season, he averaged 19.2 points per game, but was unable to sustain that. He then got spells with the Phoenix Suns, back to the Heat in 2013 and 2015 and played with the Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks, New York Knicks and finally the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018-19. In 609 NBA games Beasley had an average of 12.4 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.3 assists, playing 25 games in the playoffs, and never having received a championship ring.Also Read: The Los Angeles Lakers are quietly plotting the most aggressive roster change of the modern NBA era Michael Beasley's tale is packed with what-ifs, yet it's far from concluded. His strong performance in the Big3 indicates he's still a significant player, and Dwyane Wade's endorsement could pave the way for new chances—possibly even an invite to a training camp. Right now, Beasley looks happy, enjoying basketball on his own terms.","Dwyane Wade praises Michael Beasley after Miami 305 wins Big3 championship.

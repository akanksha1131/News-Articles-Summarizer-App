MUMBAI: In a 27-year-old Pune case of robbery and multiple murders, a key accused tried separately on his re-arrest 13 years after allegedly fleeing from custody— who was convicted and sentenced to death in 2021 — stood acquitted on Monday by Bombay high court . The HC directed that he be released “forthwith”.The accused, Bhagwat Kale , was then a watchman at a construction site and did other odd jobs. The victims were four members of a family, including two children. The alleged motive was robbery of cash and silver ornaments worth roughly Rs 49 lakh.The state sought confirmation of the noose from HC as required by law for capital punishment. HC set him at liberty, holding no case was established to either nail him or hang him. A division bench of Justices Bharati Dangre and Manjusha Deshpande, pronouncing the judgment, said, “Since we find no case made out in confirming the death sentence... we dismiss the confirmation case.” Kale appealed against his conviction. HC, in a reasoned judgment to be made available later, set aside his conviction.On the intervening night of May 15-16, 1997, Ramesh Patil (55), Vijaya Patil (47), Pooja Patil (13), and Manjunath Patil (10) were murdered at their rented Kalyaninagar residence. Bhagwat Kale’s wife, Geetabai, worked as a domestic help at the Patils’ house.A Pune sessions court convicted Geetabai and the third accused, Sahebrao alias Navnath Kale, for the murders in Jan 2004.While Geetabai was sentenced to a life term, Navnath was sentenced to death by hanging. The state cited a Nov 2004 judgment of the HC division bench of then Justices V G Palshikar and Anoop Mohta, which, while commuting Navnath’s death sentence but upholding their convictions, said, “Bhagwat could not be tried as he was absconding.”","Bhagwat Kale tried separately on his re-arrest 13 years after allegedly fleeing from custody.

AAP drops 16 sitting MLAs in 2nd list of 20,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-drops-16-sitting-mlas-in-2nd-list-of-20/articleshow/116154217.cms,"AAP

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party released its second list of 20 candidates on Monday for the upcoming Delhi assembly polls, dropping 16 sitting MLAs and moving two others - former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and deputy speaker Rakhi Bidlan - to new seats.Sisodia, who ranked second in the party hierarchy and held the seat thrice, was shifted from his Patparganj constituency to Jangpura. Civil services coaching teacher, popular on social media as a motivational speaker, Avadh Ojha, who joined AAP last week, will now contest from Patparganj.Bidlan has been shifted to Madipur instead of her current Mangolpuri seat, which went to Rakesh Jatav Dharamrakshak. From two seats, Krishna Nagar and Chandni Chowk, the baton has passed to sons, with incumbent MLA S K Bagga's son Vikas from the former and Prahlad Sawhney's son Punardeep being given tickets. Since 2013, AAP has governed Delhi and is now seeking a fourth term in February. The party's previous landslide victories, securing 67 seats in 2015 and 62 seats in 2020, stand in contrast to the current situation. Party insiders indicate that anti-incumbency sentiment has emerged, resulting in several sitting legislators being denied tickets for re-election.After the names were finalised by the party's national convenor, Arvind Kejriwal, in a political affairs committee meeting, AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said, ""We are confident that AAP's election campaign will now progress with more strength, and we will form govt under Arvind Kejriwal with people's support.""The list also includes the names of former MLAs Jitender Singh Shunty (fielded from Shahdara) and Surendra Pal Singh Bittu (Timarpur), who recently quit BJP to join AAP. Shunty replaced Vidhan Sabha Speaker Ram Niwas Goel from Shahdara, who last week retired from active politics. AAP awarded a ticket to Bittu, replacing incumbent MLA Dilip Pandey. Pandey, a veteran AAP member since the days of Anna Hazare's movement.A senior party functionary said that the reason the party came up with two lists early is because it wants to give time to candidates to prepare for their constituencies. ""Most candidates are new to their constituencies, so giving them time will help them form a strategy in a better way,"" said a party functionary.From Deoli assembly constituency, the party dropped sitting MLA Prakash Jarwal, who was convicted of abetting the suicide of a 52-yearold doctor in 2020. The party chose councillor Prem Singh Chauhan.The names of the 20 candidates announced are Avadh Ojha (Patparganj), Dinesh Bharadwaj (Narela), Surendra Pal Singh Bittu (Timarpur), Mukesh Goel (Adarsh Nagar), Jasbir Kalra (Mund ka), Rakesh Jatav (Mangolpuri), Pradeep Mittal (Rohini), Punardeep Singh Sawhney (Chandni Chowk), Parvesh Ratan (Patel Nagar), Pravin Kumar (Janakpuri), Surender Bharadwaj (Bijwasan), Joginder Solanki (Palam), Prem Kumar Chauhan (Deoli), Anjana Parcha (Trilokpuri), Vikas Bagga (Krishna Nagar), Naveen Chaudhary (Gandhi Nagar), Jitender Singh Shunty (Shahdara), and Adil Ahmad Khan (Mustafabad).Six sitting councillors have been given tickets — Dinesh Bhardwaj, Mukesh Goel, Rakesh Jatav, Punardeep Singh Sawhney, Pravin Kumar and Prem Kumar Chauhan from Dakshinpuri.

NGOs and activists can’t try to run the country through PILs: SG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ngos-activists-cannot-try-to-run-country-through-pils-centre-tells-supreme-court/articleshow/116152752.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: With NGOs and social activists attempting to perpetuate covid pandemic time free ration to migrant labour, the centre on Monday told the supreme court that it continues to provide food grains to needy strictly under the Food Safety Act but strongly resisted what it called attempts by the petitioners to run the country through PILs.Appearing for a PIL petitioner, activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan said the government may be giving free ration to around 80 crore persons but has illegally left out around two to three crore poor people from the scheme by telling the states that the stock of food grain meant to be distributed under the scheme is exhausted.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Manmohan said it may fall under the policy domain of the government to decide its food security policy, but suggested to solicitor general Tushar Mehta that if the present financial status of 80 crore beneficiaries of free ration is re-evaluated and if few crores of people have crossed the below poverty line parameters, it could consider including those left out from the scheme.The bench said the states are indiscriminately issuing ration cards for free food grains knowing fully well that it is the Centre’s liability to provide the grains. “If the states are asked to provide free ration, then most of them would run away citing financial crunch. We should concentrate on generating more employment,” Justice Kant-led bench said.Mehta said these proceedings were initiated suo motu by the SC in 2020 when the covid pandemic was at its peak to ensure that no one went hungry. “Bhushan is riding on that and trying to run the government and frame policies,” he said.The SG said, “During the Covid pandemic time, thousands of people lent a helping hand to minimize the impact on the poor. But a few armchair activists like Bhushan sat in their air-conditioned homes and drafted PILs. These NGOs and activists must file affidavits detailing what they did to help ameliorate the condition of the poor during the pandemic.”A hurt Bhushan said, “Mehta has the habit of making some barbed comments against me in every case he opposes me in the SC as I had made public some damaging emails featuring him.”Mehta said these emails were placed by Bhushan before the SC, which after perusing them had passed strictures against a petitioner, who was represented by Bhushan, for bringing on record the emails. The SG said, “He cannot attempt to run the government. We have and will always oppose such attempts from him.”Calling a truce, the bench said, “The question that emerges now is that if the states keep on issuing ration cards, should they be made liable to pay for the ration instead of depending on the Centre”. The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 8.","The centre told the supreme court that it continues to provide food grains to needy strictly under the Food Safety Act.

NEW DELHI: With incidents of sexual harassment of women workers/members of political parties often hushed up, SC on Monday asked the Election Commission to examine whether registered political parties could be brought under the ambit of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.Appearing for advocate-petitioner Yogamaya G, senior advocate Shobha Gupta told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Manmohan that though many women are active members of political parties, only CPM has set up an internal complaint committee with external members.AAP lacks transparency about its committee, while BJP and Congress have admitted not having an adequate ICC structure mandated under law, the petitioner alleged, while demanding the law must apply in equal rigour to parties which owe allegiance to the Constitution that mandates protection of dignity of women.The bench said the petitioner's analogy to equate political parties as employers and workers/members as employees may not be apt, but agreed that this is an important issue that should be adjudicated by EC.SC told the petitioner that if she does not receive any satisfactory response from EC on the issue raised by her, she is free to approach court again.The PIL quoted a 2014 NDTV article titled 'Congress seeks security for Nagma, winks at party leader who kissed her', which narrated an incident of a Congress member publicly kissing the actress who was seen walking off without addressing a rally.Quoting a report from Ranjana Kumar's organisation, Centre for Social Research, published in Economic Times, it said, ""Nearly 50% respondents said they faced verbal abuse and 45% said physical violence and threats were common, particularly true during election campaigns. Sixty-seven per cent of women politicians said perpetrators were male contestants and 58% party colleagues. Violence and harassment at the hands of colleagues is a reason why we see only women from political families in politics.""Interestingly, in March 2022, Kerala HC ruled that political parties are under no compulsion to establish internal complaints committees, as mandated by the 2013 law, since parties lack the employee-employer relationships.","SC asked the Election Commission to examine whether registered political parties could be brought under the ambit of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.

Two schools in Delhi received bomb threats via e-mail |RK Puram | Paschim Vihar | Delhi Police

NEW DELHI: Over 40 private schools in Delhi received bomb threats via email on Sunday night at 11.38 pm. Among these, five schools that received these threats are Delhi Public School in Vasant Kunj and in R.K. Puram, G.D. Goenka School and Doon Public School in Paschim Vihar, and Brilliant's Convent School in Pitampura.An official said calls of bomb threats were received from DPS RK Puram at 7.06 am and GD Goenka Paschim Vihar at 6.15 am.A team from the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) immediately reached the spot. The police, bomb disposal squad, and dog squad, along with DFS personnel, are checking the entire premises of the school.As of now, nothing suspicious has been found, a police official said.The schools were targeted in a threatening email, which claimed that hidden bombs were planted within the premises. The email asserted that multiple bombs were strategically placed inside the building, posing a significant threat to the students and staff.The anonymous sender demanded a ransom of $30,000, warning that failure to comply would result in the detonation of the bombs. The school administration took immediate action, sending students back home who came to attend classes. Parents were asked to pick up their children as a precautionary measure.""I planted multiple bombs inside the building. The bombs are small and hidden very well. It will not cause very much damage to the building, but many people will be injured when the bombs detonate. You all deserve to suffer and lose limbs. If I do not receive $30,000 I will detonate the bombs,"" the email read.Most schools that received the threat suspended their classes and sent students back home as officials said. Further checking was underway.Earlier on November 19, the Delhi high court directed the local government and police to create a thorough action plan, including a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for handling bomb threats and similar emergencies. The authorities were given eight weeks to complete these instructions.The Court specified that the SOP should clearly outline the duties of all involved parties--law enforcement, school management, and municipal authorities--to ensure seamless coordination and implementation.Justice Sanjeev Narula's bench, responding to an application by Advocate Arpit Bhargava, instructed the Delhi Government and Police to complete a comprehensive action plan, including an SOP for managing bomb threats and related emergencies.The action plan must be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including school representatives, law enforcement agencies, municipal authorities, and other state departments.Meanwhile, Delhi chief minister Atishi attacked the Central government and said that the BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security.""After the daily incidents of ransom, murders, firing in Delhi, now threats of bombing of schools are being received. The law and order situation in Delhi has never been so bad before. The BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security to the people of Delhi,"" Atishi posted on X.Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal slammed Union Home Minister Amit Shah and said that the people of Delhi have never seen such a bad state of law and order.""The people of Delhi have never seen such a bad state of law and order in Delhi before.

The pleas, including the one filed by the West Bengal government, challenging the high court's May 22 verdict came up for hearing before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan.""Reservation cannot be on the basis of religion,"" Justice Gavai observed.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the state government, said, ""This is not on the basis of religion. This is on the basis of backwardness.""The high court had struck down the OBC status of several castes in West Bengal granted since 2010, holding as illegal the reservation for them in public sector jobs and state-run educational institutions.In its verdict, the high court said, ""Religion indeed appears to have been the sole criterion for declaring these communities as OBCs.""The high court further said the ""selection of 77 classes of Muslims as backwards is an affront to the Muslim community as a whole"".Deciding the petitions challenging the provisions of the state's reservation law of 2012 and reservations granted in 2010, the high court clarified that the services of citizens of the struck-down classes, who were already in service or had availed the benefit of reservation, or succeeded in any selection process of the state, would not be affected by the judgment.The high court, in total, struck down 77 classes of reservation given between April, 2010 and September, 2010.It also struck down 37 classes for reservation as OBC given under The West Bengal Backward Classes (Other than Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) (Reservation of Vacancies in Services and Posts) Act, 2012.During the hearing on Monday, the top court asked the lawyers appearing in the case to give an overview of the matter.While referring to the high court's verdict, Sibal said the provisions of the Act were struck down.""So these are very serious issues involved. It affects rights of thousands of students who are aspiring to be admitted to universities, people who are wanting jobs,"" he said.Sibal therefore urged the bench for some interim order to be passed and an ex-facie stay on the high court order.The bench also heard submissions of other lawyers, including senior advocate P S Patwalia, who was representing some of the respondents in the matter.The top court said it would hear the detailed submissions on January 7.While hearing the matter on August 5, the apex court asked the West Bengal government to provide quantifiable data on social and economic backwardness of fresh castes it had included in the OBC list and their inadequate representation in public sector jobs.While issuing notices to the private litigants on a plea of the state government against the high court verdict, the top court then asked the state to file an affidavit giving details of the consultations, if any, conducted by it and the state's backward classes panel before including 37 castes, mostly Muslim groups, in the OBC list.","The high court had struck down the OBC status of several castes in West Bengal granted since 2010.

Opposition to move resolution to remove Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar: Sources,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-to-move-resolution-to-remove-rajya-sabha-chairman-jagdeep-dhankhar-sources/articleshow/116147160.cms,"NEW DELHI: A joint move against the Rajya Sabha chairman has put the INDIA bloc back together. The turbulent relations between Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar and the Opposition members of the INDIA bloc came to a head on Monday, with the opposition camp considering submitting a notice ""very soon"" for moving a resolution to remove the vice president, who also serves as chairman of the Upper House from his office, according to sources.While the move may fail to remove him from the chair as the numbers are not stacked in favour of the opposition parties, it would be the first ever attempt to remove the VP, in India’s parliamentary history, and would be seen as a blemish to the chair.The opposition sources confirmed that they had the “required number of signatures” from all the INDIA bloc parties, when the move was first planned in August during the Monsoon session, but they did not move on it, as they decided to give Dhankhar ""another chance but his conduct on Monday"" convinced them to go ahead with the plan.The sources said Congress had taken the lead on the issue and TMC and the Samajwadi Party, besides other INDIA bloc parties, were supportive of the move. “This is not about the Chair, it is about BJP,” a TMC source said, when asked about the joint move.In August, sources said opposition parties were concerned that the microphone of the leader of opposition was allegedly being turned off repeatedly. “The opposition wants the House to be run by rules and conventions, and personal remarks against members are unacceptable,” a source said.The procedure for removal of the chairman has to begin with a resolution moved in the upper House to remove the vice-president, who acts in his dual role as chairman of Rajya Sabha. The resolution must be passed by 50% of the members present, plus one member, of those present in the House on that day. If the resolution gets passed, it has to go to Lok Sabha to be passed by a simple majority for it to get accepted, explained a senior RS MP. This procedure follows from Articles 67 (b), 92 and 100 of the Constitution.The move, on Monday, comes in the backdrop of Rajya Sabha witnessing chaotic scenes as the BJP MPs alleged top Congress leadership has links with George Soros and that the issue be discussed as it is connected to national security.While Dhankhar had rejected all notices under rule 267, several BJP and NDA MPs continued to demand an immediate discussion on it. Congress MPs claimed this was being done to divert attention from the Adani issue.Leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh and Pramod Tiwari asked how the chairman was allowing BJP MPs to raise the issue when he had rejected their notices in this regard. Laxmikant Bajpayee (BJP) was given the floor to raise his Zero Hour mention and he started speaking on national security.Later Ramesh alleged, “the opposition wants the Parliament to function. In the last 2 to 3 days it has become clear that the govt does not want the House to function...What I saw in Rajya Sabha today was unbelievable. The LOP was not allowed and the leader of house was given number of chances to speak,” while speaking to the media.Pointing out that it is for the first time that government — BJP MPs were issuing Rule 267 notices for discussion, which is a weapon in the hands of the opposition to raise issues. “Today’s strategy of the ruling party was clear that both Houses of Parliament should not function. Now we wonder if the govt is running away from the discussion on the Constitution scheduled for December 13 and 14 in Lok Sabha and 16 and 17 in Rajya Sabha,” Ramesh alleged.The Opposition parties planned to raise all the issues that they had planned for to take on the govt, to be brought as part of the discussion for the Constitution.","Jagdeep Dhankhar and Opposition members of the INDIA bloc came to a head on Monday.

Congress MPs were heard saying that they had submitted notices to move a privilege motion against BJP's Nishikant Dubey for attempts to link Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi to Soros-backed outfits allegedly involved in anti-India activities. TMC and RJD members stood in the aisle or at their seats in support of the protest. Noisy protests forced an adjournment till 2pm and then till 3pm, before proceedings were called off for the day.Rajya Sabha too was adjourned for the day amid uproar over BJP and allies accusing top Congress leaders of colluding with Soros to destabilise the country. As soon as the House met, senior JD(U) leader Sanjay Jha said, ""There are reports in national and international media that a senior Congress leader has links with George Soros. There should be a debate on this. He (Soros) has said that he has set aside $1 billion to remove Modi govt.""In response, leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""Speaking about a member who is not present in the House is not right. We should not damage someone's image."" To this, chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar asked, ""Who is the member... which member are you referring to?"" BJP's Sudhanshu Trivedi said no one from the treasury benches had taken any name. ""If the LoP is raising the matter, it means someone who is not present in the House is the one,"" he said.Soon after the House reassembled for zero hour at noon, BJP's J P Nadda raised the Soros issue.

NEW DELHI: The opposition is considering submitting a notice for a resolution to remove vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar from office after the rift between the Rajya Sabha chairman and the opposition's INDIA bloc intensified on Monday, news agency PTI reported citing sources.According to the report, opposition parties had gathered the required signatures for the notice in August but refrained from acting, hoping to give Dhankhar ""another chance."" However, his conduct in the House on Monday reportedly pushed them to proceed with the move.The Congress spearheaded the move, with support from the TMC, Samajwadi Party, AAP and other INDIA bloc parties.The INDIA bloc's proposed resolution invokes Article 67(b) of the Constitution, which outlines the process for removing the vice president. A resolution requires a majority vote in the Rajya Sabha, with subsequent agreement from the Lok Sabha, and must be preceded by at least 14 days' notice.Meanwhile, both houses of the parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, have been adjourned till Tuesday. The adjournments came after disruptions in the proceedings.Tensions flared during zero hour after leader of the house JP Nadda accused Congress leaders of links with the Forum of Democratic Leaders in the Asia-Pacific (FDL-AP), which he claimed received financial backing from the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and viewed Jammu and Kashmir as a ""separate entity.""Nadda further alleged connections between FDL-AP and billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a claim that sparked sharp reactions from opposition members.As BJP members pressed for a discussion on these allegations, chairman Dhankhar sought an explanation for their protests. Several BJP and NDA MPs argued that the issue was tied to national security and demanded immediate deliberation. The opposition, however, said that this was a diversion tactic.After BJP's Laxmikant Bajpayee was given the floor to raise his Zero Hour mention and started speaking on the issue of national security, Congress leaders challenged Dhankhar’s handling of the situation, questioning how he could allow BJP members to raise an issue he had previously dismissed by rejecting their notices under Rule 267.""This is most unfair,"" said Ramesh.

Also give details of action taken by the state in each of these incidents and whether the properties which have been encroached upon or illegally occupied have been restored to the original owners and whether the encroachers have been penalised,"" ordered a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar.The bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati that the court is not going to pass any orders on supplementary applications filed by other persons as ""it is Union and state governments that have to take action, not us"".Mehta told the court that governments are aware of the ground situation and are taking remedial measures. ""We are advisedly not resorting to aggressive action which could be counterproductive to the priority of restoring peace in the state."" The SG also informed the court that details of the properties burnt, damaged, looted or illegally occupied would be given in sealed cover to the court as making it public could trigger violence. ""We will also give details of recovery of looted arms and ammunition,"" he said.Appearing for Justice Gita Mittal Committee, senior advocate Vibha Datta Makhija said the committee is doing commendable work in rehabilitation of people displaced by ethnic violence and required certain directions from the court. The bench asked Union home ministry to coordinate with Manipur government in ensuring that the recommended measures for rehabilitation of displaced persons are implemented at the earliest.SC, which first heard the petition filed by one Dinganglung Gangmei on May 8 last year, has since conducted 27 hearings during which it appointed Justice Mittal Committee more than one and a half years ago and appointed a ""seasoned sleuth"" to supervise investigations into criminal cases filed against members of both communities for their roles in the ethnic crisis.It all started with Manipur HC's April 2023 order directing state government to respond to a more than decade old letter from Union government seeking its view on demand from Metei community for declaring them tribal community entitled to reservation like Kukis in government jobs and admissions to government educational institutions. The Kukis in tribal areas started violent protests against the HC order, which they apprehended would dilute their recruitment to government jobs.","SC asks the state to give details of properties burnt, damaged, looted or illegally occupied.

Can't give reservation based on religion: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-give-reservation-based-on-religion-sc/articleshow/116152103.cms,"Supreme Court

While hearing Bengal government's plea challenging the decision of Calcutta HC to quash the OBC classification of 77 communities, mostly belonging to the Muslim religion, SC observed that reservation could not be given on the basis of religion but the state clarified that the basis was not religion but backwardness, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the state, said reservation was granted not on the basis of religion but on the basis of backwardness of the communities. ""The ground of religion is not an issue here. It happens that they belong to a religious community but they are backward,"" he said. The issue of whether Muslims as a community should get quota has become a wedge issue with BJP, in particular, opposing it on the ground that it has not been provided for in the Constitution. After a brief hearing, the bench adjourned the case to Jan 7.","Bengal government's plea challenging the decision of Calcutta HC to quash the OBC classification of 77 communities, mostly belonging to the Muslim religion.

BELAGAVI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah hinted in the assembly Monday that Congress govt would restore the 4% Muslim quota that the erstwhile BJP-led coalition scrapped in March 2023, citing saffron party's subsequent affidavit in court that purportedly talks about maintaining status quo on the contentious issue.Siddaramaiah raised the opposition's hackles by saying BJP's move smacked of doublespeak -first transferring the Muslim quota to two other communities and then allegedly saying the opposite in its affidavit in SC.""The former ex-BJP govt did not include the Panchamasali Lingayats in the 2A quota. Instead, it snatched the 4% Muslim quota under 2B and redistributed it - 2% to Veerashaiva-Lingayats and 2% to Vokkaligas under 3A and 3B...This led to injustice,"" he said.CM's remarks came amid an uproar over the state govt clamping restrictions on the Panchamasali Lingayat community's proposed protest at the assembly complex.When BJP MLAs R Ashoka and CN Ashwathnarayan demanded proof of their party contradicting its decision to scrap the Muslim quota, Siddaramaiah said, ""I shall table the affidavit filed by the previous govt tomorrow itself.""BJP's Basangouda Patil Yatnal requested that he table a copy of the affidavit in the assembly Wednesday, pointing to the ongoing Panchamasali Lingayat protests for 2A reservation. Siddaramaiah agreed to it.The day's session saw more heated exchanges as BJP members alleged that the Congress govt was ""stifling free speech"" by barring the Panchamasali Lingayats from staging their planned gherao of the Suvarna Vidhan Soudha. ""This is a blatant attack on democratic rights,"" BJP said.Belagavi DC Mohammad Roshan issued an order Sunday evening prohibiting the use of vehicles and tractors during the rally.Clarifying govt's stance, home minister G Parameshwara said, ""We have not banned the protest by Panchamasali Lingayats. It is their democratic right to demand reservation. However, allowing vehicles, including over 5,000 tractors, could create a law-and-order crisis.""BJP accepted the justification, but demanded that govt engage directly with the community. Siddaramaiah informed the assembly that he had already met representatives of the Panchamasali Lingayats twice. ""I explained to them that the permanent backward classes commission needs to submit its report on the merits of reservation before we can provide reservation to the Panchamasalis.""",Siddaramaiah raises opposition's hackles by saying BJP's move smacked of doublespeak.

NEW DELHI: The Common University Entrance Test is set for changes in 2025, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) preparing to announce a shift back to computer-based test mode, a standardised 60-minute duration for all papers, requirement for candidates to attempt all questions, and a reduction in foreign language papers.These revisions, aimed at enhancing efficiency and credibility of the test, have been finalised in consultation with National Testing Agency (NTA) - the delivery partner for CUET-UG and CUET-PG.At present, the 105-minute CUET-PG paper comprises 75 questions from various subjects, including 12 foreign languages. CUET-UG papers vary in duration, with domain and language papers lasting 45 minutes and the general test 60 minutes. Conducted in hybrid mode for the first time in 2024, the UG test offered computer-based test (CBT) mode in 48 subjects and pen-and-paper mode in 15. ""These proposed changes will unify the testing process and eliminate the logistical complexities of hybrid exams,"" a UGC official said.CUET was introduced in 2022 to streamline university admissions across India, but its implementation has been fraught with challenges. The inaugural year witnessed logistical failures, including abrupt changes of exam centres, technical glitches, and widespread cancellations, which delayed announcement of results until Sept.Score normalisation across multiple shifts added to dissatisfaction. ""The first CUET exposed glaring gaps in our preparedness to manage a high-stakes national-level exam,"" admitted an official familiar with the process.In 2023, errors in the answer key sparked outrage among students, especially since corrections required a fee of Rs 200 per challenge. Technical issues persisted, and in 2024, the NEET-UG paper leak allegations further delayed CUET results. The first hybrid-mode test faced abrupt cancellations in Delhi due to logistical issues, drawing widespread criticism.""Past incidents necessitated changes and improvement,"" noted a senior official from the education ministry. To address these concerns, the UGC constituted an expert committee to review the test structure, syllabus alignment, and operational logistics. ""The committee's recommendations were thoroughly discussed at a recent UGC meeting,"" said a source in the NTA.The UGC is expected to release a draft proposal inviting feedback from stakeholders, including students, parents, and educators soon. With 283 universities adopting CUET in 2024 and over 13.47 lakh registrations, its importance as a unified admission gateway remains undisputed.","The Common University Entrance Test is set for changes in 2025.

MANDYA: Demand for non-veg food has stirred the pot at the three-day All-India Kannada Literary Conference in Mandya starting Dec 20. While organisers have announced a veg-only menu, several groups supporting inclusive and liberal causes are seeking non-veg food items, too, at the jamboree.Sources said lit fests over decades have not served non-veg food. Kannada Sahitya Parishat , the apex Kannada body which is organising the event, has lobbed the ball into the administration's court. ""All decisions on food are taken by a 32-member food committee and district administration. Parishat's role is to invite poets and writers for successful conduct of the event,"" said Parishat president Mahesh Joshi.Federation of Progressive Organisations Monday protested outside Mandya DC's office by consuming eggs and raising the slogan: ""Let there be meat with lentils, kebabs with papad, egg bhurji with kosambari, & meat with mudde.""They contended the literary event was a matter of pride for the region, but exclusion of non-vegetarian food was concerning.

""When culture and faith are hurt, the country becomes weak,"" he said while hearing a case pertaining to cow slaughter.At the Allahabad event, VHP co-convener Abhishek Atrey stoked another row by invoking J&K in reference to turmoil in Bangladesh. With Justice Yadav looking on, he said, ""Bangladesh appears to be another Kashmir. We have to stay united to protect our identity.""VHP's international president Alok Kumar told TOI that the plan to engage with advocates and judges across all states by March next year was an extension of the work done by the organisation's legal cell to spread awareness about UCC and the need to amend the Waqf Act of 1995 and repeal the Mussalman Wakf Act of 1923.

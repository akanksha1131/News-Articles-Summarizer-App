An exhibition celebrating his 101st anniversary captures the many faces and moods of Vajpayee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/an-exhibition-celebrating-his-101st-anniversary-captures-the-many-faces-and-moods-of-vajpayee/articleshow/126182637.cms,"NEW DELHI: On the occasion of Atal Bihari Vajpayee ’s 101st birth anniversary, an exhibition titled ‘Atal Prashasti’ is seeking to bring to life various aspects of the former PM’s life including the many hats he wore, from that of a statesman to that of a poet and orator par excellence.The exhibition, which will be on till Jan 23 at the Prime Ministers Museum and Library (Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya) at the Teen Murti campus, tells the Vajpayee story over three themes: ‘the statesman in action’, roots of conviction’, and ‘words of wisdom’ and follows a descending curatorial narrative.It opens with Vajpayee’s public and political life as remembered by the nation, then delves into the struggles, ideals, and experiences that shaped his convictions, and finally reveals his most intimate dimension as a poet and thinker.Born on December 25, 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, Vajpayee held office as Prime Minister for three terms. Beginning his career in journalism, he later emerged as a towering political leader and reformer who laid the foundation for important milestones in India’s development.The exhibition highlights Vajpayee multifaceted personality - as a poet, journalist, orator, social worker, and literature, admired across political lines for his intellect, eloquence, and humanism.Besides photographs marking his political journey and time as PM, the exhibition also carries impressions from his days at school and college. The exhibition has been installed at the foyer between Block 1 and Block 2, near Vajpayee’s iconic Ambassador car exhibit. Famous lines of some of his poems that have been inscribed on cloth scrolls welcomes visitors while recordings of his poems in Vajpayee’s distinct voice, with their deliberate pauses, play in the background.As one crosses a scroll highlighting the words from his poem “Bharat ka Mastak Nahin Jhukega”, the wall on the other side captures in pictures Vajpayee and President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin signing the Moscow declaration between India and Russia on international terrorism in Moscow in 2001.A photo of Vajpayee visiting Bhuj after the earthquake and one of him addressing the Army during a visit to Kargil and Srinagar in 1998 also find pride of place. There is also a photo of Vajpayee addressing the nation from Red Fort on the first Independence day of the new century on August 15, 2000.The exhibition also has photos that reflect Vajpayee’s softer side like one where he is seen distributing sweets to children and interacting with them during a visit to Warsaw in June 1979 when he was India’s external affairs minister. Another iconic memory is a striking photo that captures Vajpayee and actor Dev Anand in a Janta Party rally in Delhi in December 1979.Also on display are Vajpayee’s books - his speeches and poems and photos reflecting the many awards and honours he received ranging from the Padma Vibhushan to the Bharat Ratna.At the end of the pavilion is an image that is the highlight of the exhibition - a candid shot that captures Vajpayee stepping out of his ambassador and it is aptly captioned as the “silent companion” and just outside one sees on display his “faithful Ambassador” car.","Atal Bihari Vajpayee was born on December 25, 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.

Parl panel omits G RAM G bill reference; its chairperson insists will discuss it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parl-panel-omits-g-ram-g-bill-reference-its-chairperson-insists-will-discuss-it/articleshow/126182233.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Congress MP-headed parliamentary committee, whose move to call a meeting on VB-G RAM G bill and comparing it with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme had drawn protest from the panel's BJP members, has revised the agenda of its Dec 29 sitting and omitted any direct reference to the new law.The original subject of the meeting of the standing committee on the rural development and panchayati raj was a briefing by the rural development department on “Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission-Gramin Bill and its comparison with the MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme)”.However, some BJP members of the panel saw red in the reference to the bill, now a law after assent from the President and gazette notification, as its provisions are yet to be rolled out.That Congress and other opposition parties have stridently criticised the new law which replaces the UPA-era Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) meant that BJP members believed the meeting's agenda, which is generally a discretion of chairman, was aimed at political point-scoring.In an apparent attempt to defuse any row, the agenda is now revised as ""briefing by the representatives of the department of rural development on the subject ‘MGNREGA and other issues relating thereto”, deleting any direct reference to the G RAM G law.However, the change may not preclude political confrontation in the Dec 29 meeting as the committee’s chairman Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka, a Congress MP from Odisha, insisted that they will still discuss the new law as it has now received President’s assent, which was not the case when the initial agenda was circulated. “We will discuss it,” he told TOI.Signalling differences with the chairman BJP MP Vivek Thakur, a member of the committee, was dismissive of the changed agenda. “The improvisation of the agenda is meaningless still. Once G RAM G bill is gazetted and the date of implementation is announced through it, it makes sense to discuss the new law. But right now, this smacks of an intent to politicise the agenda of a standing committee.”The ‘VB G RAM G’ bill had drawn strong protest from opposition members, and Ulaka had written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that it should be referred to his committee for scrutiny, a drmand not accepted by the govt.","The original subject of the meeting of the standing committee on the rural development and panchayati raj was a briefing on the VB-G RAM G bill.

Congress asks workers to attend govt convened gram sabhas to expose disbanding of MGNREGA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-asks-workers-to-attend-govt-convened-gram-sabhas-to-expose-disbanding-of-mgnrega/articleshow/126181843.cms,"Congress Questions BJP’s Renaming Of MGNREGA, Hits Out At Gandhi Hatred

NEW DELHI: Congress is joining the fight for MGNREGA right at the first step. The party has asked its workers to participate in greater numbers in gram sabha meetings that the central govt has called from Friday to spread “awareness” about the new “VB-G Ram G Act” that will replace MGNREGA, and to calmly counter the govt’s “misinformation” about the new law.Through an instruction by Congress general secretary KC Venugopal to state units, it has asked workers to lay before villagers the fact that the new law has essentially turned the “right to work” into a budget-controlled scheme and practically ended the demand-driven programme that had become a lifeline of the poor and marginalised communities over 20 years. The Congress directive has called the special village assembly meetings as a “platform to mislead rural workers and beneficiaries by projecting the new legislation as pro-poor”.In the wake of the opposition’s attacks over the disbanding of MGNREGA and threats of protests, the union ministries of rural development and panchayati raj led by secretaries Sailesh Kumar Singh and Vivek Bharadwaj have written to the states to convene gram sabhas on Friday to disseminate the salient features of the new law among villagers, especially SC/ST households and women.The opposition and the Modi govt have cross swords over the new law, which was suddenly brought in Parliament during the recently concluded winter session, and passed with a debate that saw the two sides wrangle over the finer points of the law.The opposition full-throatedly backed MGNREGA while slamming the new scheme as a govt bid to push the budgetary burden on the states.Congress has asked the states for mobilisation of workers, elected representatives and frontal organisations, with the direction that they should wholeheartedly participate in the gram sabhas and debunk the “misinformation” by the govt, while explaining how the new law takes away the poor friendly provisions of MGNREGA.In the upcoming CWC meeting on Saturday, Congress is likely to discuss the job scheme and may even draw up a protest plan for what Rahul Gandhi has called the party’s determination to force the govt to take back the new law.",The party has asked its workers to participate in greater numbers in gram sabha meetings that the central govt has called from Friday.

Heavy traffic blamed for delay

CHITRADURGA/BENGALURU: The passengers who escaped the bus fire after a collision with a truck near Hiriyur, Karnataka, in the early hours of Thursday said surviving the flames was only the first battle; the second was the long wait in the bitter night cold for medical help.While three passengers in the sleeper coach survived serious wounds including burns, 25 others suffered minor injuries. Most passengers were asleep when the crash jolted them awake. Thick smoke quickly filled the bus, leaving many gasping for breath. With no time to think, several passengers kicked open windows and jumped out of the burning vehicle, sustaining injuries as flames engulfed the bus behind them.Hemaraj, who was travelling with his wife Kalpana and eight-year-old son to Gokarna, said: ""We were in deep sleep. I suddenly felt something falling on my head from above. When I looked around, everything was dark and filled with smoke. I realised a fire had broken out, and I immediately pushed my son out through the window. Then my wife jumped. I looked towards the back of the bus and heard people crying for help and shouting in panic. By then, the fire had reached us. I had no choice but to jump out through the window,"" he said.For many passengers who escaped, panic soon turned into anger.""We were alive, but in pain. We were shivering in the cold, injured, with the bus still burning in front of us. There was no ambulance,"" Varun, a techie travelling on the bus, told TOI.According to the survivors, despite repeated calls to emergency numbers, the first ambulance reached the spot nearly an hour and half later. Two more ambulances arrived only between 3.40am and 4am. ""The passengers were crying for help. We had burns and fractures, standing in the cold, waiting. There was no quick response at all,"" another survivor said. Manjunath M, who suffered nearly 70% burns, faced a harrowing time while waiting to be shifted to the hospital.Several passengers pointed out that firefighters reached the site within 20 minutes, but medical help lagged far behind.

We helped them escape,"" he said. With ambulances still missing, locals eventually helped shift the injured to Hiriyur and Shira govt hospitals once vehicles arrived.The drivers of the ambulances which reached the accident spot maintained that they got delayed because of a massive traffic jam on the highway.

UDAIPUR: A manager at a private IT company alleged that she was gang-raped by her company's CEO and an executive head's husband in a moving car, the city police said Wednesday. The manager alleged that the woman executive head was also present in the vehicle when the gang-rape and molestation occurred. All three accused were detained and questioned Wednesday.The crime allegedly took place in the city's Sukher area on Dec 20, during what was supposed to be a celebratory outing for the company CEO's birthday.According to the survivor's statement, she attended the CEO's birthday and New Year party, which began at a hotel in Shobhagpura around 9pm and continued until nearly 1:30am. During the party, heavy drinking ensued, and the manager became nearly unconscious. It was at this vulnerable moment that the hosts, including the company's CEO, the woman executive head, and the executive's husband, allegedly took advantage of her.The survivor reported to police that when the other guests departed, the trio offered to drop her home. They allegedly coerced her into the executive head's car and instead of heading directly to her residence, they stopped on the way and purchased an item resembling a cigarette from a local shop.The survivor was allegedly forced to consume this item, which left her unconscious.Upon regaining partial consciousness, she realised that the CEO molested her and that the executive's husband raped her.

NEW DELHI: After a brief breather earlier this week, Delhi’s air quality deteriorated again on Friday, slipping into the ‘very poor’ category, with transport emissions and pollution drifting in from neighbouring NCR districts continuing to weigh on the capital’s air.The city’s average Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 292 at 8am, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, placing Delhi firmly in the ‘very poor’ bracket and reversing the marginal improvement seen over the past two days.Of the 39 air quality monitoring stations across the city, 22 recorded AQI levels above 300, indicating 'very poor' air. Anand Vihar (377), Jahangirpuri (372), Bawana (363) and Ashok Vihar (333) were among the worst-hit locations, while the remaining stations reported air quality in the 'poor' to 'moderate' range.Under CPCB classification, an AQI between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very poor’, while readings above 401 fall in the ‘severe’ category.Data from the Decision Support System (DSS) for Air Quality Management showed vehicular emissions remained the single largest contributor to Delhi’s pollution load, accounting for 18.5%, followed by industrial emissions from Delhi and surrounding areas (9.5%), construction activity (2.5%) and waste burning (1.6%).Among NCR districts, Jhajjar in Haryana emerged as the biggest external contributor to Delhi’s pollution, accounting for 17.6%, followed by Rohtak (5.9%) and Sonipat (3.1%).The air quality is likely to deteriorate to the very poor category in the coming days, according to the forecast.Meteorological conditions offered limited relief. The predominant northwesterly winds remained weak, with speeds of up to 10 kmph during afternoon hours, restricting dispersion of pollutants, the Air Quality Early Warning System said.On the weather front, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 22.6°C, nearly 2 degrees above normal, while the minimum settled at 6.5°C, slightly below average, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.

Osman Hadi's Brother Accuses Yunus Regime Of Murder Plot To Defer Bangladesh Polls Scheduled in Feb

Inqilab Moncho issues ultimatum, warns of tougher protests



Government promises speedy trial as arrests continue







The brother of slain youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi accused Bangladesh’s interim government, of orchestrating the killing to destabilise the country and derail the upcoming national election in February.Sharif Omar bin Hadi, speaking at a protest rally in Shahbagh on Tuesday, said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder, which took place just days after the election schedule was announced. Osman Hadi, a convenor of the political platform Inqilab Moncho, was shot on December 12 and later died of his injuries in Singapore on December 18.Addressing a “Shahidi Shopoth” programme organised by Inqilab Moncho outside the National Museum, Omar Hadi accused “a quarter within the government” of planning the killing to disrupt the electoral process. “It is you who had Osman Hadi killed, and now you are trying to foil the election by using this as an issue,” he said as quoted by The DailyStar.He said his brother had been firmly in favour of holding elections by February and had actively worked on the ground to prepare for them. “Respecting his wish, we demand that the election environment is not disturbed,” Omar Hadi said, warning that the government had so far shown “no visible progress” in delivering justice.He claimed Osman Hadi was targeted because he refused to bow to any agency or “foreign masters”. If justice was denied, Omar Hadi warned, those responsible would one day be forced to flee the country. Protesters later took an oath vowing to remain on the streets until “speedy and exemplary justice” was secured.Earlier, Inqilab Moncho’s member secretary Abdullah Al Jaber, speaking as the keynote speaker, alleged a “deep conspiracy” involving international intelligence agencies and domestic “fascist associates” aimed at undermining Bangladesh’s sovereignty and the gains of the July uprising.The platform has given the government a 30-working-day deadline to identify and arrest the killers, warning of tougher nationwide programmes if the demand is not met. While the group said it would pause formal protests on December 25, the day BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman is due to return to Bangladesh, it announced wall-writing and social media campaigns across December 24 and 25, with further agitation planned from December 26.In a parallel development, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina also blamed the interim government for the deteriorating law-and-order situation, saying the killing reflected “lawlessness” under Yunus.The interim government has rejected suggestions of inaction, with Law Adviser Asif Nazrul saying the case would be tried under the Speedy Trial Tribunal Act, requiring completion within 90 days of the investigation report being filed. Home Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said the case was being treated as a top priority.Joint forces comprising police, the Rapid Action Battalion and Border Guard Bangladesh have arrested at least 10 people so far, including family members of the prime suspect, Faisal Karim Masud. Authorities say efforts are ongoing to arrest the main accused.Osman Hadi’s killing came a day after the Bangladesh Election Commission announced February 12 as the date for the next national polls. A prominent figure of the 'July Uprising' and a potential candidate for Dhaka-8, his death had fuelled major protests in Bangladesh.","Sharif Omar bin Hadi said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder.

What should have been a simple decision, booking a flight, instead turned into hours spent navigating visa websites. The episode, he wrote, showed how routine travel can become unnecessarily complicated.In his post, Kushwaha described standing in long airport queues while other travellers passed through quickly. He said he often carries folders of documents he has already submitted many times. Schengen visa applications, he added, feel like a full-time job. They require bank statements, cover letters and detailed explanations for ordinary trips.“I’m not angry. I’m tired,” he wrote. Kushwaha stressed that his frustration is practical rather than emotional.He said national pride does not reduce the mental effort needed to deal with constant paperwork.The post also pointed to wider questions about passport strength. India ranks low on global mobility indexes and offers visa-free access to relatively few destinations. Kushwaha argued that these rankings translate into real constraints for professionals who travel frequently for work, conferences and collaboration.Many replies to his post shared similar experiences. Users posted stories of delayed appointments, short visa validity periods and uncertainty even for repeat travellers with established international careers.Kushwaha also touched on issues beyond travel. He said investments made in India had lost value over time because of the rupee’s decline. He also mentioned air pollution and outdated banking and KYC processes as factors that add to everyday friction.","Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport. In a viral post on X, he described how visa rules and paperwork often disrupt his travel plans. He said he often carries folders of documents he has already submitted many times.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126147904,imgsize-104856,width-400,resizemode-4/indian-passport-no-longer-adds-value-to-my-life-tech-educator-frustrated-over-visa-hurdles.jpg"

NEW DELHI: It has been a year bookended by elections. It started with the intense campaigning for the Delhi assembly elections and ended with the surprising results of Bihar. In between, there were parliamentary showdowns, infights and figures emerging and fading away from the centre stage.In 2025, while several heavyweights failed to live up to expectations, many asserted their place back in, proving themselves the dark horses of Indian politics.The year was also a reminder that power is rarely static — and that survival often matters as much as victory.So, who were the winners and losers in politics in 2025? Here's a look.Ahead of the Bihar assembly elections, the opposition was in a hurry to write the political obituary of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Throughout the campaign, Nitish’s former deputy and RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav claimed that the chief minister was ""mentally unfit"" and ""too old"" to govern the state.Additionally, political pundits were also skeptical about Nitish’s return. They flagged anti-incumbency and infighting within the NDA to argue that the odds were stacked against him.However, the results presented a different picture. Bihar once again handed a sweeping mandate to the NDA, extending Nitish Kumar’s two-decade-long hold on power.The NDA secured a thumping majority, winning 202 seats in the 243-member House.Within the NDA, the BJP emerged as the strongest performer, securing 89 seats -- its best-ever result in the state -- followed by Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) with 85 seats.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in Karnataka on November 20, talk of a secret agreement became public. Several MLAs and MLCs from deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar ’s faction camped in Delhi to press the party high command to honour the “deal” and make him chief minister for the next two and a half years.DKS added fuel to the speculation after he confirmed the “secret deal,” claiming that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five or six leaders” soon after the Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.This triggered one of the most cordial tussles between chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy. The two leaders even sat down for breakfast meetings to reach an understanding, but the question over the chief ministerial post remained unanswered.For now, the standoff appears to have eased. Siddaramaiah seems to have bought more time from the high command, while DKS appears to have chosen to wait it out, with both leaders refraining from making any public remarks on the issue.Bihar MLA Nitin Nabin’s elevation as the working president of the Bharatiya Janata Party was a rise that few saw coming. While political pundits were speculating about the names of bigwigs with strong RSS links, Nabin’s appointment marked a major organisational shift at the top of the ruling party.Although he is only 45 years old, Nabin is a five-term MLA and has handled several key organisational responsibilities. He served as the Bihar president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha from 2016 to 2019 and managed the BJP’s Lok Sabha and assembly campaigns in Sikkim in 2019, before being appointed co-incharge of Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh in 2021.At a time when the Congress was considered the frontrunner to retain power in the 2023 Chhattisgarh assembly polls, Nabin’s inputs to the BJP leadership predicted victory, which ultimately came true.Caste arithmetic also aligns with Nabin’s elevation as party president. The choice of Nabin, an upper-caste Kayastha -- a community that constitutes barely 0.6% of Bihar’s population and is considered politically insignificant in the state -- is significant because Kayasthas are among the key castes in West Bengal, where assembly elections are scheduled for May next year.Political mobilisation of the women vote bank through welfare schemes saw its peak in the 2025 Bihar assembly elections. Just days ahead of the elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rolled out the Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, which credited Rs 10,000 to the bank accounts of 1.2 crore women. Additionally, social security schemes like free electricity up to 125 units and a pension increment were also announced by chief minister Nitish Kumar in the run-up to the elections.This translated into the polling booths as women voters outnumbered men and shattered turnout records. While the overall turnout stood at 66.91 per cent, an extraordinary 71.6 per cent of women cast their votes -- nearly nine percentage points higher than the 62.8 per cent turnout among men.This overwhelming participation tilted the mandate toward the NDA, boosted by welfare schemes for women. The contrast between the two alliances was simple: the NDA had already delivered the benefit, while Mahagathbandhan’s offer remained a campaign promise. For many women, that difference -- money already in the bank versus a promise of future help -- mattered.At a time when stars are not aligning for Dalit leaders like Mayawati and Jitan Ram Manjhi, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan emerged as the third hero in the NDA's success in Bihar.LJP(RS) won 19 out of 29 seats, propelling the NDA past the 200-seat mark.Chirag’s dominance in Bihar and within the NDA was evident even during the seat-sharing talks, when his party got a fair share despite only one of its 143 candidates winning during the 2020 assembly polls. His bargaining power came from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when LJP(RV) won all five seats it contested.The fortune wheels did not spin for Congress this year either, as 2024 was marred with poll routs and infighting for the party. Wounded by the defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra in 2024, the grand old party continued its lackluster performance in 2025.It began with the poll rout in the Delhi assembly elections, where Congress could not win even a single seat. In addition to the poll results, it also suffered an alliance breakup as collateral damage after the Aam Aadmi Party decided to walk away from the INDIA bloc.In the Bihar assembly elections, Congress experienced its steepest decline after it managed to win only six seats. Rahul Gandhi travelled over 1,300 kilometres to galvanise voter support but fell flat in comparison to the local issues that resonated more strongly with Bihar's electorate.Meanwhile, the party encountered another crisis in Karnataka after a tussle broke out between Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar over the chief ministerial post. Although the situation seems defused for now, the party is sitting on a ticking time bomb that may detonate soon.Moreover, several Congress leaders flagged serious problems within the party. One of them was former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim, who wrote to Sonia Gandhi, calling for an “open-heart surgery” in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and its workers.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi dated December 8, ex-Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim highlighted six consecutive election losses in Odisha and three in the Lok Sabha while also questioning the selection of Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader, claiming that the 83-year-old veteran “is unable to resonate with India's youth.”2025 was a year of autumn for the Lalu clan. Lalu Yadav, along with his family and party, had to suffer setbacks throughout the year. In the Bihar elections, the party only won 25 seats in the assembly elections, registering one of its poorest performances.Soon, things went south on the family front as well. Just days after the poll results, Rohini Acharya -- the second of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's nine children and the donor of the kidney that saved him -- announced that she was quitting politics and “disowning” her family.Reportedly, Rohini had a heated argument with her brother Tejashwi Yadav over RJD's assembly election disaster. She also alleged she was accused of donating a “dirty kidney” to her father after “extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket.”Earlier, Lalu had expelled his eldest, Tej Pratap Yadav, from the party for six years after he shared a photo with a woman on Facebook and claimed he had been in a relationship with her for 12 years.Later, Tej Pratap went on to form his own party -- Jan Shakti Janta Dal -- which drew a blank in the assembly elections.Prashant Kishor, once hailed as India’s top election strategist, entered the Bihar polls as a political aspirant and walked out as its biggest loser.After a two-year padyatra across Bihar and massive media hype around Jan Suraaj, Kishor positioned himself as a transformative alternative to both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. However, Jan Suraaj did not manage to win a single seat, losing security deposits in the majority of the constituencies where it fielded candidates.However, PK has repeatedly said that he won’t back down. His next test comes much sooner than 2030 -- the panchayat elections in 2026 -- where he may attempt to make a comeback.After two sweeping victories in 2015 and 2020, Kejriwal's AAP was swept out of power in the 2025 Delhi assembly elections. Of the 70 assembly constituencies, the BJP clinched 48 seats, while AAP managed to secure only 22.Adding insult to injury, Kejriwal also lost the New Delhi seat to BJP's Parvesh Verma.Rising to power as an anti-graft crusader, Kejriwal found himself embroiled in corruption cases days ahead of the elections.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post, seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.Despite pulling every trick in the book, DK Shivakumar failed to replace Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah. After the tussle came out in the open, DKS made several trips to Delhi, but the high command has not budged.DKS checked all the criteria to become the Karnataka CM. He generated funds for the party during the elections, and Vokkaliga seers -- one of the strongest sects in Karnataka -- are also backing him. Additionally, the majority of Congress MLAs are on his side.Despite this, DKS has decided to take a step back, obey the party high command and wait for the right time to come as the high command huddles in Delhi to deliver an answer.Through his charm and “Tharoorosaurus,” Congress MP Shashi Tharoor remained in the headlines throughout the year. Another reason he grabbed eyeballs was his standoff with his own party on different occasions. Despite being a member of the CWC, the Thiruvananthapuram MP skipped several important party meetings and refused to toe the party line on multiple issues. This irked many senior leaders of the grand old party, leading to repeated to-and-fro exchanges on social media platforms and in media bites.It all began after Shashi Tharoor emerged as one of the prominent voices articulating New Delhi’s position following the Pahalgam terror attack and India’s Operation Sindoor. Later, the Centre invited him to lead an Indian delegation as part of a global outreach after Operation Sindoor, even as the Congress was raising tough questions for the government. This did not go down well with his party colleagues, who accused him of cozying up to the BJP.However, just ahead of the Kerala assembly elections, The grand-old-party is reluctant to take strict disciplinary action against a popular leader in the state, effectively giving Tharoor a free lane to drive on the wrong side.Now, it is yet to be determined whether Tharoor came out as a winner or a loser after the tug-of-war session with his own party.","In 2025, several heavyweights failed to live up to expectations.

"Cousins unite, MVA disintegrates? How Thackeray alliance isolates Congress in Maharashtra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cousins-unite-mva-disintegrates-how-thackeray-alliance-isolates-congress-in-maharashtra/articleshow/126175367.cms,"'Batenge Toh Katenge': Uddhav & Raj Thackeray Unite For Mumbai Civic Polls | Shiv Sena (UBT) | MNS

NEW DELHI: The much-hyped reunion of the Thackeray cousins after 20 years has altered the political landscape of Maharashtra with the new alliance signalling the silent end of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) - the opposition front which Uddhav formed with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s NCP in 2019 to keep the BJP out of power after the assembly elections.The MVA, which ruled the state for two-and-a-half years, was dealt a body blow in 2022 when the Shiv Sena and the NCP split down the middle after rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Despite the setback, the opposition coalition came back strongly in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, winning 30 out of the 48 seats in the state. But that glory was short-lived as the MVA was decimated in the assembly elections held later in the year and could collectively win only 46 out of the 288 seats.While the assembly elections had already taken the sting out of the MVA, the Thackeray alliance has now literally left the coalition on the verge of disintegration. Sharad Pawar has indicated he will align with the Thackeray cousins, but the Congress has been left in the lurch as it refused to join hands with Raj Thackeray ’s MNS, given his aggressive “outsiders” pitch against north Indians.So, where does the Congress go from here? The immediate test for the grand-old-party is the elections to 29 civic corporations in Maharashtra, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, on January 15.The just-concluded municipal council and nagar panchayat elections, which were swept by the BJP-led Mahayuti, saw the Congress emerge as the main opposition party. While the Congress won 824 seats, its MVA allies - NCP (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT) - could manage only 256 and 244 seats respectively. Little wonder, the Congress, which had for some time now played second fiddle to both Uddhav and Sharad Pawar, was quick to assert that it has now emerged as the principal opposition in the state.Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal on Thursday said his party is holding discussions to form an alliance with Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) for the upcoming municipal corporation elections. But will this alliance be enough to help the grand-old-party counter the force of ruling Mahayuti on one hand and the strong Marathi pitch of the Thackeray brothers on the other?The Congress move to chart its own course in Maharashtra is a bold gambit. The party which had a fairly strong presence in the state politics till 2009, has since seen its electoral fortunes decline. In the 2024 assembly elections, the Congress could win only 16 seats out of the 101 it contested in the 288-member assembly. The Congress vote share stood at 12.42% - which is the lowest for the party in Maharashtra, but still more than all other players in the state except the BJP.The Congress would be hoping to draw support from the minorities, Dalits and also the migrant voters by staying away from Raj Thackeray. It would also hope to insulate itself from anti-incumbency against Uddhav Thackeray, whose Shiv Sena has dominated the BMC for many years.However, this solo fight pitches the Congress against the BJP - which has been an undisputed winner in all recent electoral contests. The move also ends up dividing the opposition space in the civic polls, giving the BJP-led Mahayuti an advantage. The local body elections will also put to the test the Congress’s organisational strength - which has seen a decline in many states. If, despite these challenges, the Congress does manage a decent show in the civic polls, it could pave the way for a changed thinking in its alliance politics. On the flip side, a poor show could push it more towards oblivion and reduce the party’s bargaining power.The Congress, for now, says that independent contests by MVA constituents in civic elections should not be seen as a rift within either the MVA or the INDIA bloc. Leader of Opposition Vijay Wadettiwar justified the party’s solo stance and said that while the INDIA bloc had fought the Lok Sabha elections together and the MVA contested the assembly polls as a united front, local body elections operate under different political realities.However, if the Thackeray clan bonhomie translates into electoral gains for both Uddhav and Raj, the Congress will have to be prepared for a long solo stint in the state.",Uddhav & Raj Thackeray reunite for Mumbai Civic Polls.

There is an old saying, borrowed from Latin and later made popular in English: Nulla nuova, buona nuova- no news is good news. In 1640, writer James Howell noted that Italians believed no news was better than bad news. Even before that, King James I of England had said much the same thing.But 2025 did not feel like a year of “no news”. It was loud, crowded, and often heavy. Every day brought fresh alerts, arguments, and anxieties. And yet, in between all that noise, some moments did not ask for attention but earned it anyway. Small moments. Humane moments. Acts of kindness that reminded people that decency still exists.This is a look back at some of those moments. Not because they went viral, but because they felt real. Because they sounded like stories you would tell someone you love, late at night, to remind them that the world is not entirely broken.Note inside an autoIt was past midnight. A woman was travelling alone. She had booked an auto, shared her live location, and done everything she was told would keep her safe. Still, she was tense until she reached her door. For many women in India, this is routine, not an exception. However, one such late-night ride in Bengaluru became something entirely different.A woman travelling in a Rapido auto noticed a handwritten note inside the vehicle. It read: “I’m a father/brother too. Your safety matters. Sit back comfortably.” The woman recorded a short video and shared it online. In it, she says that it was 12 at night, she was alone, and reading that note made her feel safe. Not watched. Not judged. Just safe.The auto driver did not speak on camera. He did not explain himself. The note spoke for him. It told passengers that he saw them as people, not fares. As someone’s daughter or sister, just as his own family was someone else’s responsibility.Women’s safety during late-night travel is a serious concern across Indian cities. Incidents of harassment make news regularly. But this moment showed something quieter: that trust can also be built in small ways. A piece of paper. A few honest words. No grand promise. Just reassurance.A sandwich at 2 amAnother Bengaluru cab, another late night, but this time, a different kind of kindness. Content creator Yogita Rathore had just finished a long shoot and was heading to the airport for a 2 am flight. She was tired, hungry, and overwhelmed.Sitting in the back of an Uber, she spoke to a friend on the phone and broke down. She mentioned she had not eaten all day and did not know when she would get food.A few minutes later, the cab stopped. The driver said he'd be back. The woman thought he was taking a short break. Instead, he returned with a sandwich.In her video, the driver says calmly that he heard her talking about being hungry. He says that if his sister were hungry, he would feel bad too.The video ended with a simple message: people are carrying more than we can see, and a small act can change someone’s entire day.Online, viewers responded with warmth. Some said the moment was sweet and unexpected. Others admitted they would normally hesitate to accept food from a stranger, but understood why this felt different.A luxury car, and a shared joyBusinessman Anand Mahindra shared a video that left a deep impact on him. In the clip, a luxury car owner notices a poor man trying to take a selfie with his vehicle.When the man sees the owner approaching, he panics and tries to leave. Instead of scolding him, the owner does something else. He takes photos of the man with the car. Then, he offers him a ride. The video was part of content creator Seenu Malik’s “365 good day challenge”.Mahindra wrote that the video reminded him that cars are not just machines. They carry emotion. Joy. Aspiration. As someone who works in the automobile industry, he said he hoped designers and engineers would remember that vehicles are meant to make people feel something, not just move them from one place to another.An unlikely guest at SRK's MannatShah Rukh Khan lives in Mannat, a bungalow worth hundreds of crores. A short video showed a stray dog sleeping peacefully inside Mannat, which was under construction.The dog lay undisturbed near the entrance. No one chased it away. The clip was shared by a social media user who said that Khan’s staff feed stray dogs around the house every day.Fans flooded the comments. Some said this quiet compassion was why they admired the actor. Others said that if more people treated strays with care, fear would reduce.The video also came as the Supreme Court modified its earlier order directing civic bodies in Delhi-NCR to capture and confine stray dogs. The court said the directive was too harsh and instead asked authorities to sterilise, deworm, and release the dogs. It also called for designated feeding areas.'What a lovely man'A Scottish YouTuber Hugh Abroad was standing by a busy road in Chennai, waiting for transport. A man on a two-wheeler stopped and asked where he was going. Hugh explained. The man said he was heading towards the city too and agreed to drop him part of the way.Before starting again, the man stopped at a juice shop. He asked Hugh what he would like. Hugh chose orange juice. The man paid, refusing to let Hugh cover the cost.The moment was simple. Hugh looked genuinely moved. “What a lovely man,” he said in the video.The clip crossed over 20 million views on Instagram. Many viewers said this was everyday India, kindness without reason. Several spoke about Indian hospitality, about welcoming strangers without calculation.Happy birthday, delivery partner Zomato delivery executive arrived at a customer’s door, expecting another routine order. Instead, he walked into his own birthday celebration.The customers had arranged a cake and waited for him. As they sang, the delivery partner stood stunned, trying not to cry. He cut the cake there, in the middle of his workday.The video, shared on Instagram, struck a chord. The caption read: “Our Zomato delivery guy just got delivered with lots of love.”For someone who spends most days moving quickly from one door to another, this pause mattered. It said: we see you.Kids choose care over comfortIn Noida, during peak summer, two young boys were filmed pushing a makeshift cart. Inside it lay their injured dog, weak after being attacked by another stray.The boys wore worn clothes and slippers. They had no visible resources. But they were taking their dog to an animal hospital. When asked, one boy said they had already been once and were returning for further treatment.Viewers praised the boys’ compassion. Some asked for contact details to help cover medical costs. Others said the children showed courage that many adults lacked.Son for a dayInfluencer Anish Bhagat spoke to the security guard in his society, 65-year-old Byas Ji. Byas Ji shared that his son had abandoned him. When asked about his wish, he hesitated, then said he wanted to visit the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya with his son.Bhagat decided to take him. He booked flight tickets and surprised Byas Ji. Together, they travelled to Ayodhya. Byas Ji prayed at the temple. He hugged Bhagat, overwhelmed.Bhagat later spoke about the responsibility children have towards ageing parents. The video received wide appreciation. Many said it made their day. Others said it reminded them of family bonds often taken for granted.Rs 20 MangalsutraIn Maharashtra, a 93-year-old farmer named Nivrutti Shinde walked into a jewellery shop with his wife Shantabai. He had Rs 1,120 saved. He wanted to buy her a mangalsutra.The couple were on a pilgrimage to Pandharpur for Ashadhi Ekadashi when they stopped at the shop. Initially, staff assumed they needed help. Then they heard his reason. The jeweller accepted only Rs 20 and treated the rest as blessings.The video of the moment went viral. People online were moved by the couple’s bond and the shopkeeper's gesture.India always welcomesAn Australian woman shared a video of her daughter Gaia joining an Indian family’s picnic. One moment, they were walking past. Next, the child was eating with them.A text overlay on the video adds a playful note: “When your kid crashes an Indian family lunch like she’s been invited,” capturing the effortless warmth with which the family welcomed the child.The response was emotional. Viewers spoke about Indian hospitality. About welcoming strangers. About Atithi Devo Bhava, the belief that a guest is like God. It was a small moment. But it travelled far.2025 did not lack problems. But it also did not lack kindness. These moments did not fix systems. They did not solve big issues. But they softened something. They reminded people that empathy still shows up in autos, cabs, streets, and homes.",The year 2025 did not feel like a year of “no news’. Some moments did not ask for attention but earned it anyway. Acts of kindness that reminded people that decency still exists.

‘No one knows where missile came from’: Nitin Gadkari recalls meeting Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh hours before assassination; how he reacted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-one-knows-where-missile-came-from-nitin-gadkari-recalls-meeting-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-hours-before-assassination-how-he-reacted/articleshow/126171409.cms,"Nitin Gadkari Reveals Shocking Experience of Meeting Hamas Leader Before His Assassination in Iran

NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari has recounted how he came face to face with Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh just hours before the latter was assassinated in Tehran, linking the incident to what he described as the growing role of technology in modern conflict and national security.Speaking at a book launch event, Gadkari said he had travelled to Iran at the request of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to represent India at the swearing-in ceremony of Iran’s newly elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian. According to the minister, foreign dignitaries were staying at a five-star hotel in Tehran ahead of the ceremony.“I had gone for the Iranian Prime Minister's ceremony. There is a 5-star hotel there where all heads of state stayed. Modi ji had sent me,” Gadkari said.He recalled noticing one individual among the dignitaries who was not a head of state. “I wondered who he was. I also shook hands and asked. He was the head of Hamas,” he said, adding that Haniyeh later walked into the ceremony alongside Iran’s president and chief justice, while other delegates followed.Gadkari further described how he was woken early in the morning amid the chaos of Haniyeh’s assassinations.“I also came to my hotel and after eating dinner, went to sleep. At 4 o'clock, the ambassador came and knocked on the door saying ""Sir, we have to evacuate."" I asked why. He said there's been a big problem. What happened? He said the Hamas leader who was here yesterday, a powerful man, was killed in his room.”Iranian authorities later confirmed that Haniyeh was killed at around 1.15am on July 31, 2024, while staying in a highly secure military complex under the supervision of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). His bodyguard was also killed in the attack, according to official statements cited by the Associated Press.Gadkari told the audience that the exact method of the assassination remained unclear. He went on to suggest how the future high-tech is important from the perspective of national security, modern warfare, and critical infrastructure.“No one knows from where the missile was fired, where it entered - now some say it was his mobile phone number, he was specially hidden in one place in a bungalow, went to that room and killed him there. So the coming time is futuristic, technology and futuristic vision for development in defence, agriculture, industry, trade, business export - we will have to do all this.”At the same event, Gadkari remarked that strong nations are difficult to target, citing Israel as an example of how technological and military capability translate into global influence.Iran’s revolutionary guards authorities had said a short-range missile was used to strike the building where Haniyeh was staying.The Telegraph claimed that Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad may have orchestrated the killing by planting explosives inside the guesthouse, citing Iranian officials.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality improved for the second consecutive day on Thursday, though pollution levels continued to remain a concern.The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 234 at 4 pm, placing it in the ‘poor’ category, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The reading marked an improvement from an AQI of 271 recorded at the same time on Wednesday and a sharp recovery from the ‘severe’ level of 412 recorded on Tuesday.Of the 40 functional air quality monitoring stations in the capital, 10 reported ‘moderate’ air quality with AQI levels below 200. These included Lodhi Road, IIT Delhi, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Aya Nagar. Meanwhile, 27 stations continued to record air quality in the ‘poor’ category.Two stations — Jahangirpuri and Bawana — recorded ‘very poor’ air quality, with AQI levels crossing 300.Despite the recent improvement, forecasts indicate that air quality is likely to deteriorate to the ‘very poor’ category in the coming days.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 to 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 to 200 ‘moderate’, 201 to 300 ‘poor’, 301 to 400 ‘very poor’ and 401 to 500 ‘severe’.Data from the Decision Support System (DSS) for Air Quality Management showed that vehicular emissions were the largest contributor to Delhi’s pollution load on Wednesday, accounting for 18.5 per cent. Industries in Delhi and adjoining areas contributed 9.5 per cent, followed by construction activities at 2.5 per cent and waste burning at 1.6 per cent.Among NCR districts, Jhajjar in Haryana emerged as the highest contributor to Delhi’s pollution at 17.6 per cent, followed by Rohtak at 5.9 per cent and Sonipat at 3.1 per cent.","The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 234 at 4 pm, placing it in the ‘poor’ category.

PM Modi Flags Off Two Highways To Curb Congestion In Delhi-NCR

NEW DELHI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Wednesday slapped an ""intention to termination notice"" - the final procedure before termination - on Roadways Solutions India Infra Ltd (RSIL) for failing to meet the construction target of a 35-km stretch of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. The physical and financial progress on this stretch in Gujarat was barely 4.9% and 4.6%, respectively, of the target.The progress on two other stretches - 27 km and 25 km - being constructed by the company in the state is at 23% and 36%. The dismal pace of construction may push the revised deadline of the project beyond March 2028, sources said.Pune-based RSIL is an engineering and construction company that operates mainly in the roads and highways sector. The company had bagged the packages of the expressway in Gujarat in 2021.Suprisingly, NHAI had terminated the contract of RSIL for two stretches in March 2023 and then re-awarded them to RSIL in Nov 2023 after it again put in the lowest bid. TOI on Feb 14 had first reported how the slow progress on these three stretches, with a total length of 87 km in Gujarat, was delaying the over Rs 1 lakh crore project.In a letter to RSIL, NHAI said the ""intention to termination notice"" has been issued on account of contractor's ""absolute and continued non-performance"".It said, ""...despite the contractor having been granted repeated indulgences and more than adequate opportunities through the execution of three settlement agreements, the contractor has achieved a negligible financial progress of only 4.59% (after lapse of 16 months from the appointed date of Aug 31, 2024)"".The letter said that as per the originally envisaged timeline of 18 months commencing from Aug 31, 2024, the contractor ought to have achieved approximately 70% financial progress. Mentioning how little progress has been made even after 16 months conclusively establishes that completion of the Jujuwa-Gandeva section of the expressway by Nov 15, 2026 ""is wholly impossible"", it said.The highways authority claimed that despite granting repeated opportunities and its extended assistance to the contractor, it ""failed to demonstrate any improvement or to achieve the requisite progress"". It said that even after three settlement agreements, the contractor failed to meet targets. ""In the settlement agreements, it was specified that if it fails to achieve agreed milestones, NHAI will terminate the contract without any cure period notice. So, we have served the notice,"" said an official.Cure period notice is issued to a contractor to fix any breach in 60 days. NHAI said the communication may be treated as a ""15-day notice"", as per the contract agreement, and after the expiry of this period, the authority ""shall be entitled to terminate the contract agreement"". It has also said the incomplete three packages under RSIL are creating significant public inconvenience across multiple fronts. In the case of two other sections, NHAI is likely to give a cure period notice to RSIL.","Pune-based RSIL is an engineering and construction company that operates mainly in the roads and highways sector.

Navy Chief Confirms India’S Third Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Soon

NEW DELHI: India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4, which is designed to hit targets 3,500-km away, from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.There was no official word from the defence ministry on the missile test conducted off the coast of Visakhapatnam from the 6,000-tonne INS Arighaat, which is operated by the tri-service strategic forces command.Sources, however, confirmed the missile was the solid-fuelled K-4, which can carry a two-tonne nuclear payload and is critical for India to strengthen the sea leg of its nuclear weapons triad.""A comprehensive analysis will determine whether Tuesday's test actually met all laid down technical parameters and mission objectives or revealed some shortcomings. It usually takes several tests for ballistic missiles, especially those launched from submarines, to achieve full operational status,"" a source said.After multiple trials from undersea platforms in the shape of submersible pontoons over the last several years, the two-stage K-4 missile was tested for the first time from INS Arighaat in Nov last year.INS Arighaat, the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), was commissioned on Aug 29 last year.Her forerunner INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018, can carry only the 750-km range K-15 missiles.India will commission its third SSBN as INS Aridhaman in the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth in 2027-28 under the secretive over Rs 90,000 crore ATV (advanced technology vessel) programme launched decades ago. These two SSBNs are slightly larger, with a displacement of 7,000 tonnes each, than the first two 6,000-tonne ones.There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones on the first four submarines.India's existing SSBNs, of course, are less than half the size of the ones with the US, China and Russia. The operational deployment of K-4 missiles, which will be followed by the K-5 and K-6 missiles in the 5,000 to 6,000-km range class, will somewhat help India narrow the huge gap with countries like the US, Russia and China, which have a range of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).The first two legs of India's nuclear triad are much more robust, with the land-based ballistic missiles led by the Agni-5 with a strike range of over 5,000 km and fighters like Rafales, Sukhoi-30MKIs and Mirage-2000s capable of delivering nuclear gravity bombs.The SSBNs, however, impart India's deterrence posture with much more credibility because they are considered the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory strikes in line with the country's ""no first-use"" policy.","India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4 from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.

JAMMU: After Rajouri and Poonch, now authorities in Jammu’s Kathua district have suspended Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for two months, citing security concerns.The preventive action has been taken under section 163 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita as VPN services are being misused by certain individuals and groups to bypass cyber restrictions and access prohibited applications, websites and digital content, the order issued by district magistrate Rajesh Sharma on Wednesday stated.The suspension came into force with immediate effect (Dec 24), and will apply to all individuals, institutions, cyber cafes and internet service providers operating within the district, “except those explicitly permitted by govt through a specific official order”. Any violation will invite legal action under the relevant provisions of law, the order said.Kathua SSP has been directed to ensure strict enforcement of the order.On Nov 30, Poonch DM Ashok Kumar Sharma had ordered suspension of all VPN services in the border district for two months, citing their potential misuse for unlawful activities. “The SSP informed that there has been an unprecedented high usage of VPNs in the past few days at different locations of the district by suspicious internet users,” Sharma said in the order.It was informed that VPN transmit gets encrypted and creates a point-to-point tunnel, masks IP addresses, and sidesteps website blocks and firewalls on the internet, thus making sensitive data vulnerable to cyber attacks.A day before, on Nov 29, Rajouri DM Abhishek Sharma had issued a similar order following a communication from police.Prior to this, the Doda administration had, through an order on May 6, ordered suspension of VPNs citing public safety, cybersecurity and integrity of digital governance in the district.","Authorities in Jammu’s Kathua district have suspended Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for two months, citing security concerns.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday ordered states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravallis and expand protected zones, a major move amid public outcry over the ""new definition"" of the mountain range.The Union environment ministry said the decision was aimed at the ""conservation and protection"" of one of the world’s oldest mountain systems, covering the stretch from Delhi to Gujarat. The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region and to put an end to unregulated mining across the region.As part of the announcement, the ministry instructed the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to identify further zones across the Aravallis where mining must be prohibited, beyond those areas already notified by the Centre-based on ecological, geological and landscape-level assessments.The Centre also said it intends to expand the list of areas protected and restricted from mining across the range. For mines that are currently operational, state governments have been asked to ensure ""strict compliance"" with environmental safeguards and adherence to Supreme Court orders.On Monday, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said at a press conference that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Responding to the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of the Aravallis, he said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He further underlined the government’s efforts such as the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and global recognition of India’s forest cover, adding that the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".The Supreme Court's acceptance, classifying any landform in Aravalli districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief as Aravali Hills-sparked concern among several stakeholders, who fear the new definition could leave more than 90% of the range open to mining, as most landforms fall below the 100-metre threshold.","The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) on Wednesday released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission from liftoff to satellite separation.The footage shared by Isro on X features visuals captured by cameras onboard and documents each major phase of the ascent. The footage shows the rocket lifting off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, followed by the separation of the twin S200 solid strap-on boosters. It then captures the separation of the L110 liquid core stage and the jettisoning of the payload fairing, before concluding with the successful separation of the BlueBird Block-2 satellite into Low Earth Orbit.The stunning visuals were recorded during Isro’s successful commercial launch of the next-generation US communication satellite for AST SpaceMobile earlier in the day. The 6,100 kg satellite was placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, approximately 15 minutes after launch.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed all mission events as planned.The space agency said the mission, designated LVM3-M6, marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle, nicknamed ‘Bahubali’ for its heavy-lift capability. Isro chief, Dr V Narayanan, described mission’s success as a ""season’s gift"" to the country.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a Low Earth Orbit constellation being developed by US-based AST SpaceMobile. The satellite is designed to enable direct-to-mobile connectivity, providing 4G and 5G voice and video calls, text messaging, streaming and data services directly to standard mobile smartphones.Developed by Isro, the three-stage LVM3 has a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes and a payload capability of 4,200 kg to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. In earlier missions, it has successfully launched Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and two OneWeb missions carrying 72 satellites.","Isro released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission.

NEW DELHI: In a crackdown on the functioning of a dummy school that enrolled hundreds of students in higher secondary classes, the Delhi high court on Wednesday barred it from running classes XI and XII or admitting new students.High court also initiated contempt of court proceedings against the owner and management of Richmondd Global School for flouting its earlier undertaking given to the court in this regard.Justice Jyoti Singh ordered the management to deposit Rs 75 lakh with the court registry as the money was charged from hundreds of students in these classes who, the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) found, never turned up to attend classes but were enrolled only on paper.CBSE had carried out a surprise inspection, suspecting the students were taking coaching classes but paid the school to remain eligible to sit for the class XII examination and become eligible for quotas in Delhi's engineering and medical colleges.Justice Singh, while penalising the school, allowed 128 students out of 1,300 enrolled in classes XI and XII to be transferred to a nearby CBSE-affiliated school, and asked the board to open its online portal so they could apply for examination registration.""A team of CBSE officials shall visit the school on December 26 at 2.30 pm, inspect the records and verify the admissions as also the attendance of 128 students studying in class XII. The school shall issue transfer certificates to the students within a week's time.

It said this, ""Information shall be disseminated amongst the students of classes X and XI and also put up on the notice board at a prominent place so that these children are made aware that they will not be promoted to classes XI and XII in the next academic session"".The court was hearing petitions by the school and some of its students against CBSE's decision to withdraw affiliation.",Richmondd Global School barred from running classes XI and XII or admitting new students.

LUCKNOW: Mounting yet another scathing attack on Congress, PM Narendra Modi Thursday accused past govts of glorifying one family while neglecting contributions of other national icons, and practising political untouchability. BJP govt freed the country from the “tendency” to attribute every achievement to just one (Nehru-Gandhi) family, he said.Speaking after inaugurating Rashtra Prerna Sthal, a memorial dedicated to Jan Sangh stalwarts, on the 101st birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Lucknow, Modi also said, “BJP is proud that our govt had the opportunity to tear down the wall of Article 370”.He said the legacy of good governance created by BJP-led NDA govt was now being taken to new heights at both central and state levels.“After Independence, a tendency emerged to associate all the good work that took place in India to the same family. Be it books, govt schemes, institutions, streets, roads or squares, it was all connected to the pride of one family... “...Our govt, serving Mother India, is giving respect to her every child, to everyone’s contribution.” he said.Rashtra Prerna Sthal houses 65-ft tall statues of Vajpayee, Syama Prasad Mookherjee and Deen Dayal Upadhyay.Constructed at a cost of Rs 230 crore, the memorial sprawling over 65 acres also houses a lotus-shaped museum depicting the life and journey of the stalwarts.Reiterating BJP’s sharp narrative contrasting dynastic politics with merit based recognition, the PM asserted his govt was honouring national icons who were ignored earlier across party lines.BJP did not let the legacy of B R Ambedkar be undermined, he said, referring to the ‘panchteerth’ associated with the Dalit icon. He accused Congress of attempting to dismantle Ambedkar’s legacy.","PM Narendra Modi accused past govts of glorifying one family while neglecting contributions of other national icons.

GUWAHATI/RAIPUR: Right-wing vandals smashed Xmas decorations in Assam and Chhattisgarh on Christmas Day, leading to the arrests of four people in Nalbari, Assam, and an FIR in Raipur against 25-30 activists.The arrests in Assam — three activists of VHP and one of Bajrang Dal — took place after Christmas decorations were smashed at St Mary’s School in Nalbari. A group of Hindutva activists stormed the school, tearing down and burning banners and posters. They also targeted nearby shops in Nalbari town selling Christmas items and dismantled a Nativity crib on the school premises.Nalbari SSP Bibekananda Das confirmed the four arrests. “We earlier identified three active members, though the group was larger. All were locals of Nalbari district,” Das said. The case was registered after Fr Baiju Sebastian, the school principal, filed a complaint. He claimed that around 2.30 pm on Wednesday, miscreants entered the school premises, and damaged decorations, lights and plant pots, and set other articles on fire.Those arrested are VHP district secretary Bhaskar Deka, VHP district vice-president Manash Jyoti Patgiri, and VHP assistant secretary Biju Dutta, and Nayan Talukdar, a Bajrang Dal district convener.The activists shouted “Jai Shri Ram” and warned school authorities against celebrating Christmas. They allegedly threatened school officials and asked whether they celebrated Saraswati Puja on campus. “From this year, you have to stop Christmas celebrations,” one activist told a school official, according to a purported video of the event.In Raipur, stick-wielding members of a fringe outfit stormed Magneto Mall during Thursday’s Chhattisgarh shutdown against the violence around Kanker burial and alleged religious conversions. They vandalised property, gilded Christmas decorations, and damaged a Christmas tree and a Santa Claus figure. The mall management said they had suffered losses running into lakhs.The mall management claimed 40-50 people with rods and hockey sticks, allegedly asked staff and others inside, “Are you Hindu or Christian? What is your caste?” They even checked ID cards and badges of staff, officials said.An FIR was lodged based on a complaint by the mall.","Right-wing vandals smashed Xmas decorations in Assam and Chhattisgarh on Christmas Day.

Newspaper reading now a must for students in UP government schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/newspaper-reading-now-a-must-for-students-in-up-government-schools/articleshow/126180714.cms,"AI image

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh government has made newspaper reading compulsory for students of all state-run secondary and basic schools to cultivate reading habits, reduce screen time and develop critical, and logical thinking skills among them.An order issued by additional chief secretary (basic and secondary education) Partha Sarthi Sen Sharma, on December 23 says newspapers, both English and Hindi, should be made an integral part of the daily reading culture of schools.This is in continuation of an earlier order in November, which had discussed ways to inculcate reading culture among students. Discouraging excess screen time, the December 23 order advises students to read ""physical"" newspapers as it would help them enhance their focus and concentration.""A 10-minute slot should be allocated for 'news reading' from newspapers during the daily morning assembly. Students, on a rotational basis, will read out the main points of editorial articles and major positive news from national, international, and sports events,"" says the December 23 order.Asked about the directive, Sen Sharma told TOI: ""These are directions as well as advice, to be followed by state-run schools, but others can also follow if they find sense.""The order lists manifold benefits of regular newspaper reading. ""To begin with, it will strengthen students' GK and understanding of current affairs , which is extremely important for future competitive examinations. Second, regular reading improves vocabulary and language style. Reading various types of articles and editorials develops their writing skills.""Sen Sharma stressed that reading diverse perspectives ""develops critical thinking and the ability to distinguish between right and wrong in students, making them aware in the era of fake news"".Another benefit of reading newspapers is that students become aware of their local community, events, and public projects. ""This connects them to their surroundings and helps them understand how local events are connected to national and global issues,"" the order states.In addition, human interest stories and news related to social issues published in newspapers help students understand the experiences and challenges of others. This develops empathy in them and guides them towards becoming responsible citizens. Sudoku, crosswords, and word puzzles available in newspapers are not just for entertainment; they train students' brains for logical challenges and problem-solving, the order says.The order says students focus on favourite subjects, while newspapers exposes them to science, culture and sports.","Uttar Pradesh government has made newspaper reading compulsory for students of all state-run secondary and basic schools.

Bangladesh Slipping Into Pakistan’s Pocket: Sushant Sareen Warns India Of New Eastern Security Front

SUTI(MURSHIDABAD)/SAMBALPUR: A 20-year-old villager from Suti, who went to work as a mason in Odisha’s Sambalpur five days ago — his first job outside Bengal — was beaten to death on Tuesday by a mob that accused him of being a Bangladeshi, according to the deceased’s family and witnesses.Odisha IGP Himanshu Lal, however, claimed the violence stemmed from a monetary dispute and there was “no communal or linguisitic” aspect.Local police said the monetary dispute escalated after local youths asked the workers for bidis. Two other Bengal migrant workers were injured and are in critical condition. “All six accused have been arrested and further investigation is under way,” IGP Lal said.In a written complaint to Suti police, Juel Rana’s mother, Nazma Bibi, stated that her son had left for Sambalpur on December 20.“On Dec 24, at 8.30 pm, I received a call that some seven or eight locals had attacked my son and his colleagues close to where they lived in Odisha.

Colonel Bath accused SIT of 'shielding' accused policemen

MOHALI: CBI has filed a chargesheet in a Mohali court against four Punjab Police personnel in connection with the assault on Colonel Pushpinder Bath, naming an inspector as the prime accused.The central agency has dropped charges of attempted murder and instead invoked charges for 'causing grievous hurt' and 'wrongful restraint'. The chargesheet names inspector Ronnie Singh as 'principal accused' in the case. On the intervening night of March 13-14 this year, a group of policemen, in civilian clothes, thrashed Colonel Bath and his son over a parking dispute in Patiala.The Armyman and his son were standing beside their car at a roadside eatery when a group of men, later identified as cops in civilian clothes, asked him to move his vehicle to make space for theirs.The family has alleged that this exchange escalated into violence, following which more than a dozen police personnel assaulted Colonel Bath and his son with rods and sticks, injuring both of them. The FIR was registered eight days later on the Colonel's complaint.Initially, Patiala police named inspectors Harry Boparai, Ronnie Singh and Harjinder Dhillon in the FIR under BNS sections for attempted murder, causing hurt, wrongful restraint and criminal intimidation.Another inspector's name was added on charges of rioting and insulting a religion.Dissatisfied with the probe, Col Bath approached Punjab and Haryana high court, which handed the case to Chandigarh Police on April 3. On July 14, the Colonel filed a petition in HC, accusing Chandigarh SIT of 'shielding' the accused cops.On July 16, HC handed the case to CBI, remarking that Chandigarh Police probe was ""tainted"" and there were ""no prospects of a free and fair investigation"". ""The court is convinced that the investigating agency is not only trying to create loopholes in the investigation but trying to make craters in the investigation so as to ensure that once the chargesheet is filed before the court, the case of the prosecution should hardly be able to crawl in court,"" Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj said in his scathing remarks.Around a week after this, four accused cops, who were suspended till then, reported at their new postings. Thus far, police had told the court that all of them were ""untraceable"". Col Bath's family criticised the rejoining, saying the officers had 'surfaced' to avoid being declared 'proclaimed offenders' (POs).",CBI files chargesheet against four Punjab Police personnel in connection with assault on Colonel Pushpinder Bath.

LUCKNOW: Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered on Thursday a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Maulana Shamsul Huda Khan, a govt-recognised madrassa teacher from Azamgarh who fraudulently drew salary and retirement benefits for a decade while living abroad, acquiring British citizenship, and allegedly nurturing links with Pakistan-based religious networks.ED sources said Huda amassed properties worth Rs 33 crore and cash worth Rs 5 crore from suspicious entities. Officials termed the case as ""one of the most extraordinary instances of administrative collusion and systemic breakdown"" in the state's madrassa education framework.Action was initiated following multiple FIRs, an ATS probe, and a detailed reference sent by police authorities in Sant Kabir Nagar flagging suspected foreign funding, misuse of NGO structures, and ideological influence operations in eastern UP.According to official records, Huda was a serving madrassa assistant teacher, regularly availing medical leave, updating service records, and ultimately securing voluntary retirement in 2017 with full benefits.However, Huda left India in 2007, settled in the United Kingdom, and obtained British citizenship by 2013. Despite his absence, he received his salary uninterrupted for 10 years, estimated to be Rs 16 lakh, apart from pension benefits.ED is scrutinising Huda's bank accounts and foreign investments.

Major anti-Naxal success: Rs 1.2-crore bounty Maoist Ganesh Uike among four gunned down in Odisha

Ganesh killing a turning point: Shah

BHUBANESWAR/BERHAMPUR/HYDERABAD: He vanished at will - sometimes robed as a swamiji, stick in hand, towel over his shoulder - shedding names as easily as trails.On Thursday, bullets caught up with Maoist commander Paka Hanumanthu, better known as Ganesh Uike, with a collective bounty of Rs 1.1 crore, who refused to surrender and died in a security operation in Odisha.The 69-year-old CPI (Maoist) central committee member - the Odisha in-charge of the banned outfit and a veteran of more than four decades underground - was among four Maoists killed before dawn in Kandhamal district, a hilly, forested region in southern Odisha bordering Chhattisgarh. His death raised the number of rebels killed in Kandhamal to six over the past 24 hours.Security agencies linked Ganesh to several major Maoist operations, most notably the May 2013 Jhiram Ghati ambush in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh, where a convoy of Congress functionaries was attacked, killing at least 27 on the spot and wounding 34. That episode kept him high on most-wanted lists across Maoist-affected states.Thursday's operation followed the Dec 22 surrender of 22 Maoists from Chhattisgarh in Malkangiri district in southern Odisha. Police said credible intelligence from the surrendered cadres helped track Ganesh's movements.Two Maoists, including an area committee member, were killed Wednesday. Ganesh fell hours later, becoming the first Maoist commander and central committee member neutralised in Odisha.Kandhamal SP Harish BC said security forces found four bodies — two men and two women — all in uniform, along with two INSAS rifles and a .303 rifle. “Ganesh’s identity has been verified. Identities of the other three cadres are being established,” he said.Home minister Amit Shah called the operation a turning point. “A significant milestone towards Naxal-free Bharat,” his office said in a post.“We are resolved to eliminate Naxalism before the 31st of March 2026.” Shah has set March 2026 as the nationwide deadline to end Maoist insurgency and said Odisha is on the verge of becoming free of left-wing extremism.Police sources said Ganesh showed no signs of surrender. In recent months, he had publicly criticised central committee colleague Chandranna for surrendering to Telangana police & insisted the movement would continue despite setbacks. Ganesh carried bounties of Rs 40 lakh in Chhattisgarh and Rs 25 lakh each in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.Born in Pullemla village of Nalgonda district in Telangana, Ganesh — known by aliases Rupa, Rajesh Tiwari, Chamu, Chamru and Somudu — studied in Nalgonda, left his BSc unfinished, and went underground in 1982 amid violent campus politics.He later emerged as an organiser and commander in West Bastar, a dense forest belt in southern Chhattisgarh, serving as secretary and in-charge of the divisional committee and overseeing the south sub-zonal bureau.","Maoist commander Paka Hanumanthu, better known as Ganesh Uike, with a collective bounty of Rs 1.1 crore, refused to surrender and died in a security operation in Odisha.

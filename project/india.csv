Bihar polls: Lalu jumps gun amid bickering over seat sharing deal in INDIA bloc; distributes tickets to RJD leaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-lalu-jumps-gun-amid-bickering-over-seat-sharing-deal-in-india-bloc-distributes-tickets-to-rjd-leaders/articleshow/124543155.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: A seat-sharing deal has yet to be announced by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan, despite the last date for nomination for the first phase of Bihar assembly elections inching closer. However, RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav on Monday jumped the gun and gave away party tickets to candidates favoured by him.A large crowd gathered outside Lalu's residence after he reached Patna from Delhi, where he had appeared before a court. According to news agency PTI, aspirants who apparently received phone calls from the party began pouring in, only to emerge minutes later with the party symbol in their hands and a broad smile on their faces.Prominent among those who got RJD symbols were Sunil Singh (Parbatta), who quit Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) last week, and Narendra Kumar Singh alias Bogo, a several-term former MLA from Matihani, who had won the seat twice for the party headed by the CM.These leaders' candidature is being seen as part of the strategy of Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD supremo's son and heir apparent, to win over a section of Bhumihars, a powerful upper caste that has traditionally supported the BJP-led NDA.However, the party symbols were reportedly taken back from the leaders.This is not the first time Lalu has distributed tickets to his party leaders without a nod from alliance partners. Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, he had given tickets to several RJD leaders well before Congress , RJD, and Left parties had reached a seat-sharing agreement.However, the alliance partners eventually fell in line.This comes as Lalu's son Tejashwi met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday evening and is learnt to have discussed a seat-sharing arrangement ahead of the Bihar assembly polls. Congress general secretary (Organisation) K C Venugopal and the party's in-charge for Bihar, Krishna Allavaru, were present during the meeting at Kharge's residence, PTI reported, citing sources.Sources said Tejashwi Yadav had earlier held discussions with Allavaru and Venugopal, where Bihar Congress chief Rajesh Ram and CLP leader in the Bihar Vidhan Sabha Shakeel Ahmad Khan were also present.The Mahagathbandhan alliance in Bihar is likely to finalise seat-sharing in the next few days and may announce its candidates along with a joint manifesto this week. The Congress is likely to get fewer seats than last time due to its dismal performance in the 2020 assembly polls, when it won 19 out of the 70 seats it contested. The RJD contested 144 seats and bagged 75 in the 243-member Assembly.On the other side, BJP state in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday announced that JD(U) and BJP will contest 101 seats each; Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vikas) on 29 seats; and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) of Jitan Ram Manjhi and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) of Upendra Kushwaha will contest six seats each.Bihar assembly polls are slated in two phases on November 6 and 11, and the counting of votes will be conducted on November 14. The filing of nominations began on October 10 for the first phase, in which 121 seats will go to the polls.",RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav on Monday jumped the gun and gave away party tickets to candidates favoured by him.

Tensions Escalate As Pakistan-Taliban Trade Warnings After Heavy Clashes Along Afghanistan Border

NEW DELHI: BJP leader Nishikant Dubey on Monday lashed out at Pakistan for violating the agenda of the United Nations ’ Children and Armed Conflict (CAC) by carrying out attacks in India and Afghanistan.Delivering India’s statement on the “Promotion and Protection of Rights of Children” at a UN General Assembly session, Dubey thanked member nations for recognising New Delhi’s efforts to uphold child rights through initiatives like the child helpline and measures to counter child trafficking.The BJP MP described Pakistan as “one of the worst violators of the UN’s CAC (Children and Armed Conflict) agenda” and highlighted serious concerns not just within Pakistan but also in neighbouring regions.“We strongly condemn Pakistan's attempt to divert the world's attention from the grave abuses against children within their borders, as evidenced by the Secretary-General's report on CAC 2025, as well as ongoing cross-border terrorism,” he said.Dubey, leading a parliamentary delegation at the UNGA, pointed out that many Afghan children have been harmed or killed due to cross-border attacks and airstrikes by Pakistan’s military in areas near the Afghanistan border. He also sharply criticised the Pakistani army for firing at Indian border villages in May 2025, which caused deaths and injuries to innocent civilians.He called Pakistan’s international statements “highly hypocritical,” saying it was inappropriate for the country to speak on global platforms after engaging in such acts.Dubey also referenced India’s counter-terror operations, noting, “During Operation Sindoor, India carried out well thought-out strikes on nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and killed several terrorists.”“Pakistan must look at itself in the mirror, stop preaching on this platform, act to protect children within its borders, and stop targeting women and children within its borders,” he added.",BJP leader Nishikant Dubey lashed out at Pakistan for carrying out attacks in India and Afghanistan.

NEW DELHI: The seesaw in the Bihar seat-sharing saga seems to continue in the Mahagathbandhan as no party in the bloc appears to get off first without squeezing out every last seat possible.In the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, allies are busy balancing ambition and arithmetic, each hoping to tip the scale in their favour before the final deal is struck.In Bihar's opposition camp, the tension isn't just political. It's poetic. As seat-sharing talks appear to hit a rough patch, RJD’s Manoj Jha and Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi traded shayaris that spoke volumes about the unease simmering between the allies.After RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav met Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on the seat-sharing agreement, Manoj Jha wrote on X: "". (“Don’t snap the thread of love, Rahim says — once broken, it may be tied again, but the knot will always remain"".)Replying to ally Manoj Jha's post, Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi wrote: """" (Tears can still be brought to the eyes; even a burning city can still be saved.)The rhyme didn't just reveal the rift, but it sparked the question: Can the Mahagathbandhan stay united, or are its allies gearing up to go solo?The seat-sharing puzzle in Bihar’s Mahagathbandhan continues to test tempers and timing. Despite several rounds of talks between the Congress, RJD and Left leaders, the INDIA bloc is yet to crack the final formula.“Tejashwi and Congress leaders may finalise seat-sharing in the next few days and could announce their candidates along with a joint manifesto this week,” an RJD functionary said.Bihar Congress in-charge Krishna Allavaru sounded cautious yet confident: “Seat distribution is being finalised. The list of candidates will be released soon. Our effort is to form a good govt for the people of Bihar so that the alliance is not harmed and Bihar benefits.”But the Congress may have to settle for a smaller slice this time, given its poor 2020 performance, bagging only 19 of the 70 seats it contested. The RJD, by contrast, had fought 144 seats and won 75 in the 243-member Assembly.Earlier on Monday, the Congress held its Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting in New Delhi to fine-tune its Bihar strategy. Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge , KC Venugopal, and BPCC chief Rajesh Ram were among those present.Rajesh Ram said, “All issues were discussed in the INDIA alliance meeting, in which Rahul Gandhi and other senior leaders participated. The discussions were positive, and preparations for seat announcements are underway. There is a possibility of a meeting with Tejashwi Yadav soon.”Meanwhile, sources said VIP chief Mukesh Sahni has been offered 18 seats by the RJD, of which 10 would have RJD’s own candidates contesting on the VIP symbol. The RJD, not waiting for last-minute chaos, has already asked its likely candidates to begin filing nominations for the first phase of polling.","The seat-sharing puzzle in Bihar’s Mahagathbandhan continues to test tempers and timing.

MUMBAI: Bullion markets in India and abroad continued to see hectic activity as prices of gold and silver rose to record levels in both markets. As jitters are being felt across markets, especially due to shortage of supply of the white metal, Tata MF temporarily suspended inflows into its silver ETF fund of fund (FoF). And outside of India, Bank of America raised its target for gold to $5,000/ounce, a rise of nearly 25% from current levels and $65/oz for silver, a 30% appreciation.The global supply crunch has hit the silver market at a time when the demand for the metal, used in industries like solar and EVs, is rising. In addition, rate cuts in the US, which is making the dollar cheaper against major currencies are also leading to higher demand for silver and gold.In international markets, since these metals are priced in dollar, a weaker greenback would translate to fall in prices of these two precious metals, leading to higher demand. In the domestic market, silver prices hovered close to the Rs 1.8 lakh/kg level, a new all-time peak, while gold traded at close to Rs 1.3 lakh/10gm level. Late on Monday, on MCX, the futures prices for gold for Dec delivery was at close to Rs 1.25 lakh while silver futures for Dec delivery was trading at close to Rs 1.55 lakh level.During the day, Tata MF suspended purchases, switchins, fresh SIPs etc into its Silver ETF FoF, effective Oct 14. Tata MF is the fourth fund to take this step to protect investors’ interest. Kotak MF was the first one, followed by SBIMF and UTIMF to take such a decision for their silver ETF FoF.","Bullion markets in India and abroad continued to see hectic activity as prices of gold and silver rose to record levels.

NEW DELHI: A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration and Haryana government 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.Kapur is among the officers named by Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, for allegedly abetting her husband’s suicide.The committee made this demand during a mahapanchayat in Chandigarh on Sunday. Heavy police were deployed around the venue.“The Haryana DGP and former Rohtak SP should be arrested. The DGP must be removed from his post. We have given 48 hours, after which we will decide the next course of action,” a committee spokesperson told reporters, as quoted by news agency PTI.Six days have passed since Kumar, who was last posted as IG at the Police Training Centre in Rohtak’s Sunaria, died. His post-mortem and cremation have not been conducted, as the family is refusing consent until their demands are met.The mahapanchayat saw tension when former Haryana MP Raj Kumar Saini reportedly made a controversial remark, sparking anger among attendees. Calm was restored after organisers intervened.A message from Kumar’s family was read, appealing for support in their pursuit of justice. Committee members also demanded a judicial probe into the case, said Gurmail Singh, a committee member. “The family and dalit community fear that if the last rites are conducted, the government may not take action against the accused,” said Karamvir, a committee member. He also questioned the work done by the Special Investigation Team set up by Chandigarh police.Fifty-two-year-old Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7. In an eight-page note reportedly left behind, he named eight senior officers, including DGP Kapur and former Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, accusing them of harassment and tarnishing his image. The note also mentioned caste-based discrimination.The Haryana government has transferred Bijarniya, replacing him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria.In her complaint to Chandigarh Police, Amneet P Kumar sought an FIR against Kapur and Bijarniya under Section 108 (abetment of suicide) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, demanding their arrest. She also requested amendments to the FIR to include all accused officers’ names.Haryana ministers and senior officials, including chief secretary Anurag Rastogi, recently met the family to persuade them to agree to the post-mortem and cremation.","Y Puran Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7.

Asian markets tumbled on Monday after US President Donald Trump escalated tensions with China, threatening last week to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods.Hong Kong's HSI traded at 25,374, down 916 points or 3.49%. Shanghai and Shenzhen also dipped 1.3% and 2.56% respectively.Japan's Nikkei also traded in red, reaching 48,088, shedding 491 points or 1.01%. Kospi, too followed the downward trajectoy, falling 1.66 points to 3,550 at 10:30 AM IST.Trump had posted on social media on Friday that he would levy an additional 100% tariff on China and warned he might cancel a summit with Xi.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Monday praised India and called Prime Minister Narendra Modi “a very good friend” during his speech at the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit in Egypt. The remarks came after the signing of a historic peace agreement to end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.“India is a great country with a very good friend of mine at the top, and he has just done a fantastic job,” Trump said. He also added, “I think that Pakistan and India are going to live very nicely together,” signalling optimism for future relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Trump’s comments follow a recent phone call between him and PM Modi, during which PM Modi congratulated the US President on the success of the Gaza peace plan. PM Modi also discussed progress in trade negotiations.“Spoke to my friend, President Trump and congratulated him on the success of the historic Gaza peace plan. Also reviewed the good progress achieved in trade negotiations. Agreed to stay in close touch over the coming weeks,"" PM Modi posted on X. This was the second conversation between the two leaders in a month.The summit also saw a moment when Trump invited Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to address the gathering.Interrupting his own speech, Trump asked Sharif, “Do you want to say something” and encouraged him to “say what you said to me the other day.” PM Sharif praised Trump’s role in the peace process, calling him “a man of peace.” He said, “I would say this is one of the greatest days in contemporary history, because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts.

CHANDIGARH: In past few weeks, security agencies manning anti-drone systems along Punjab border began noticing a strange trend - drones from Pakistan would be detected and tracked, but would whirr back behind the fence before they could be brought down.ISI-backed smugglers in Pakistan routinely try to send arms, including AK-47s and grenades, and drugs, slung under drones, across the 532km-long border with Punjab. There was a lull in the immediate aftermath of Operation Sindoor, but it picked up after a few weeks. Detection and interception also rose on the Indian side as the three anti-drone systems (ADS) were strengthened.Now, these new drones have upped the cat-and-mouse game. ""Technology changes every day. What is happening now is that drones coming from Pakistan are largely programmed with a fail-safe mechanism with default settings of back-to-home. After sensing disruption in the signal between the drone and base station during our attempts to jam, lock, and neutralise them, the drones are programmed to return to the point where they took off,"" said a senior Punjab Police officer, describing it as ""a tech challenge"" in Punjab's war against Pakistan's ISI-backed smuggling network.The Indian anti-drone systems are up to the task as most attempts to smuggle arms and drugs via drones get detected, the officer said. ""The drones are either brought down or fly back across the border. Either way, it's foiled,"" he added. ""The detection rate is very high, eight or 10 a day, sometimes even 15,"" he said, adding: ""We need at least 100 such ADS for wider coverage of border areas.""Amid its ongoing 'Yudh Nashian Virudh', Punjab government deployed 3 vehicle-mounted ADS in the first phase, with an official launch by Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal in Tarn Taran on August 9. Punjab plans to deploy nine such systems at a total cost of around Rs 51 crore.Since deployment of ADS, Tarn Taran police have registered 12 FIRs and arrested as many suspects in Bhikhiwind subdivision alone for receiving contraband via drones. The haul includes four pistols, 75 bullets, five magazines, over 3kg heroin, 492g ICE, and 506g opium.Bhikhiwind DSP Preetinder Singh said: ""ADS has proved very effective in combating smuggling of drugs and weapons from Pakistan via drones. Earlier, we had to rely on sound to track drones. This technology gives us exact coordinates of the drone along with speed, altitude and other parameters."" ""Up to a certain range and distance, jamming can neutralise the drone. But sometimes, the drone is at such a distance that jamming is ineffective, even though it can be detected. Detection has helped us make recoveries and arrests,"" the DSP added.","ISI-backed smugglers in Pakistan routinely try to send arms, including AK-47s and grenades, and drugs, slung under drones, across the 532km-long border with Punjab.

Poll What do you think is the most important measure to prevent such incidents in the future? Strict action against harassment at workplace Better mental health support for officers

CHANDIGARH: In a late-night development, the Haryana government has sent Director General of Police (DGP) Shatrujeet Kapur on leave amid the controversy surrounding the death of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, who had named Kapur in his suicide note. The decision has come just a day before the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi was to visit the victim officer's family.The decision comes following a tense standoff, with the family of the deceased officer refusing to allow the autopsy or cremation of the body until Kapur was removed from his post. Rajiv Jaitly, media adviser to CM Haryana confirmed the development over phone. However, the official order was not released till the filing of this report.Y. Puran Kumar, a senior Haryana cadre 2001 cadre IPS officer, had committed suicide on October 7 leaving behind a detailed eight page suicide note in which he had name DGP Kapur triggering widespread outrage and demands for action.The state government on Saturday transferred another IPS officer, Narendra Bijrania, who was also accused by the deceased cop for harassing him along with Kapur, from the post of SP Rohtak.In his “final note”, Kumar accused several senior officers, including Kapur and Bijarniya, of harassment and caste-based discrimination, which he claimed contributed to his distress. A total of 16 officers including IAS and IPS were named by Kumar before taking the extreme step.The dead body of the deceased cop is lying in mortuary, as the deceased's wife P Amneet Kumar, who is also a 2001 batch IAS officer, has been demanding action against Kapur. The Haryana IAS officers association had also appealed to the Chandigarh administration and the Haryana government to take appropriate action on Amneet’s complaint filed with the Chandigarh Police on Wednesday and her representation given to the Haryana CM. In her complaint, Amneet alleged that her husband had endured “years of systematic humiliation, harassment, and persecution” at the hands of senior officials, particularly DGP Shatrujeet Singh Kapur.On Sunday, a ‘Mahapanchayat’ (congregation) was also organized in Chandigarh by 31-Member Committee fighting for justice to Puran Kumar’s family in which a 48-hour ultimatum has been given to the Chandigarh Administration and the Haryana government. The deadline was to end on Tuesday.The primary demand of the committee was immediate removal of Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur from his post within 48 hours.In a rare gesture, the Haryana governor Aseem Kumar Ghosh had also visited the deceased officer's family on Sunday to offer condolences.On October 9, the Chandigarh police had registered an FIR against ""all those named in the final note"" on charges of abetment to suicide and sections of SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. The original FIR had invoked section 3(1)(r) of the Act, which provides for a jail term of a minimum six months, extendable to five years, and a fine. Apart from this, the police had also charged the accused under section 108 of BNS for abetting suicide, which provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years.In the FIR’s column, which provides details of accused/suspect, the FIR had referred all those mentioned in deceased officer’s suicide note including around 16 senior IPS/IAS officers with specific allegations against Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and the then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarnia. However, on October 12, the Chandigarh police amended the FIR to include Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which provides a punishment of life imprisonment and a fine if the offence is found to be motivated by the victim’s caste.",Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur sent on leave amid controversy surrounding death of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar.

The ""individual strands of the cheating"" between 2005 and 2014 were ""intrinsically interwoven"" with a larger network of collusion among multiple accused, he added.According to CBI , when Lalu was railway minister between 2004 and 2014, two BNR Hotels of railways - in Ranchi and Puri - were first transferred to IRCTC and then leased to Patna-based Sujata Hotels through a manipulated tender process. In return, land parcels in Patna were allegedly transferred at undervalued rates to Lalu's family through firms linked to the hotel owners. Investigators allege this quid pro quo formed the heart of the scam. CBI registered the FIR on July 5, 2017, and filed its charge sheet in April 2018. Court took cognisance of the final report on July 30, 2018, and prosecution sanction followed in July 2020.Those named in the charge sheet include former IRCTC group general managers VK Asthana and RK Goyal, and Sujata Hotels directors Vijay and Vinay Kochhar, who also own Patna's Chanakya Hotel.Two firms - Sujata Hotels and Delight Marketing Company (now LARA Projects LLP) - are among the accused.""You conspired for the undervalued purchase of land parcels. You conspired with other accused for the subsequent transfer of effective control over these land parcels to Rabri Devi and Tejashwi Yadav,"" Judge Gogne said while pronouncing the order. All accused, including the Yadav family, were present in court. The court said the transfer of land to Lalu's wife and son by ""commercial players"" suggested ""an instance of crony capitalism fostered in the guise of eliciting private participation"" in the operation of railway hotels. ""This conspiracy may be sublime but not entirely hidden from the court's view,"" the judge said.Judge Gogne said CBI had presented a ""cogent chain of evidence"" linking the accused, adding that the agency ""was possibly led by the stench to the rot"". He described Lalu's ""institutional awareness and possible intervention"" as the ""glue"" binding the conspiracy, calling the alleged quid pro quo ""a principal conspiracy among multiple persons"" from the start.Concluding that there was ""adequate substantiation"" of the allegations, the judge said the criminal conspiracy alleged by CBI is ""the thread"" connecting all accused - marking the start of trial proceedings in one of the country's most politically charged corruption cases.","A Delhi court framed Monday charges against former railway minister Lalu Prasad, his wife Rabri Devi, son Tejashwi Yadav and 11 others in the alleged IRCTC scam.

The parliamentary panel is set to be a much-watched platform given that the three bills on the issue, moved by home minister Amit Shah in the monsoon session of Parliament, had triggered bedlam in the Lok Sabha, with the opposition bloc opposing them vehemently.The government has not been able to constitute the JPC despite the passage of nearly two months since the Lok Sabha's decision to send the three bills to the parliamentary panel.Sources said the government had conveyed last week its intent to go ahead with the JPC, holding that if the opposition parties boycotted the panel, it would fill the vacancies with representatives of smaller outfits and independents. The message was sent to the Congress interlocutors as the opposition had been dragging its feet on names for the panel despite repeated reminders.The sole holdout, CPM , also gave its nod to the boycott on Monday after Congress reached out to persuade the Left ally.CPM MP John Brittas told TOI, ""We are for opposition unity. In that spirit, we are with other opposition parties on the issue of JPC.""While major anti-BJP parties headed by Congress were earlier keen to join the JPC, an uncompromising Trinamool Congress queered the pitch for the INDIA bloc by announcing in Aug that it would boycott the panel. It then drew support from SP, AAP and Shiv Sena.They argued that parliamentary panels were being used by the Modi government to bulldoze bills without considering the views of the opposition, citing the example of the Waqf Bill. The upfront announcement by key allies put Congress in a bind as it did not want to come across as breaking ""opposition unity"" for a legislation which anyway was jointly opposed by INDIA bloc.

The new normal’s impact was visible on Pakistan — we outperformed it in every field, including sports,” General Chauhan said while addressing students at the 128th Foundation Day celebrations of Scindia School in Gwalior.He emphasised that a war is not fought by armed forces alone but by the entire nation, with political leaders, diplomats and soldiers all playing critical roles.“Operation Sindoor created a new matrix of decision and timing in warfare. Many challenges still lie ahead for the armed forces. No war is fought by the armed forces alone; the whole nation fights it.

The coming era belongs to India, and we, the 140 crore people of this country, can achieve this together,” he said, urging the youth to actively contribute during “Amrit Kaal.”Union minister and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, foreign secretary Vikram Misri, alumni and parents of students attended the event held at the Gwalior Fort, reported PTI.","“The country cannot tolerate even the threat of a nuclear attack.

They also sought restoration of property rights and estate of minorities which were grabbed during the previous regime.The delegation, led by Afghan Minorities Council in coordination with the Indian World Forum, comprised around 30 prominent Hindus and Sikh members of the community who came to India over the decades and many of them now hold Indian citizenship.Indian World Forum President Puneet Chandhok said, “we hope that the present regime will ensure foolproof rights of minorities living there.”After the meeting, Guljeet Singh, a prominent voice from the community, told TOI that “The foreign minister assured us that he will take up all our concerns back home.” Singh said that there are about 5,000 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Delhi.

The three new Scorpenes were to add to the six such submarines already built at MDL under the over Rs 23,000 crore `Project-75’, which was inked way back in Oct 2005.The first, INS Kalvari, was commissioned in Dec 2017 after much delay and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, in Jan this year. All the six Kalvari-class submarines will, however, be retrofitted with the air-independent propulsion (AIP) system being developed by DRDO for greater underwater endurance.AIP gives a diesel-electric submarine the stealth capability to remain underwater for around two weeks, while a boat without it must surface or `snorkel’ every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge its batteries.The German submarines to be constructed at MDL under `Project-75India (P-75I), in partnership with ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), will have AIP, land-attack cruise missiles and other new-generation technologies.The decision to take forward the final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines -- with the option for another three of them at a later stage -- was taken after extensive deliberations among the defence ministry, Navy, the National Security Council Secretariat and others, the sources said.Consequently, the official contract talks for MDL to build the six German submarines began last month. “These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” another source said.Considering France’s expansive strategic partnership with India, there is however still the possibility that the case for three more Scorpenes could be revived if there is top-level intervention.Sources, on their part, say France should be pleased that it is on course to bag several other major projects. For one, the govt-to-govt deal for additional Rafales under the IAF’s around Rs 2 lakh crore project for 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA), in which the bulk of the jets will be manufactured in India, is now in the works, as was reported by TOI.For another, the collaboration to co-develop a new powerful jet engine with French major Saran – at a cost of Rs 61,000 crore -- for India’s fifth-generation stealth fighter called AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft) has also been virtually finalized.Amid all this, the Navy is keeping its fingers crossed. Apart from the six Scorpenes, the Navy is left with just six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines in its conventional underwater fleet. It also has two nuclear-powered submarines armed with ballistic missiles.China, incidentally, has over 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines.

SC: Karur case has shaken nat'l conscience, deserves fair probe

NEW DELHI: Noting that the Karur stampede in Tamil Nadu shook ""national conscience"" and the case has ""political undertone"", Supreme Court Monday decided to hand over the probe into the tragedy to CBI & also appointed a three-member panel headed by its former judge Ajay Rastogi to supervise the investigation.Questioning the fairness of the investigation, a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria noted that top state police officials had made a statement that their subordinates were not at fault and said, ""Prima facie, this fact in itself creates a doubt in the minds of the public about the independence and impartiality of the investigation.""The families of those who died and got injured are in the doldrums and what they want is a free and fair probe, with the political tussle over the stampede being of little solace to them.The incident of Karur stampede has definitely left an imprint in the minds of the citizens throughout the country, wherein 41 persons died in a stampede and more than 100 were injured; it has wide ramifications in respect of the life of the citizens and in this context enforcing the fundamental rights of the families who lost their kith and kin is of utmost importance.Therefore, looking to the political undertone of the case and the fact that without having regard to the gravity of the incident, the comments which have been made before the media by the top officers of the police department may create doubt in the minds of the citizenry on impartiality and fair investigation.The faith and trust of the general public on the process of investigation must be restored in the criminal justice system, and one way to instill such trust is by ensuring that the investigation in the present case is completely impartial, independent and unbiased,"" the bench said.""Looking to the fact that the issue involved certainly has a bearing on the fundamental rights of the citizens and the incident which has shaken the national conscience deserves fair and impartial investigation. As such, by way of interim measure, direction deserves to be issued to hand over the investigation to the CBI, which would lead to fair administration of justice. There cannot be any doubt that fair investigation is the right of a citizen,"" it said.Immediately after the court passed the order, the state govt brought to its notice the fact that families of two victims, whose name was used to petition for CBI probe, had denied any role in filing the petitions. Senior advocates A M Singhvi and P Wilson, appearing for the state, said that fraud was being played on the court. Taking note of their submission, the bench said it would take cognizance of the issue but added that the controversy would not have a bearing on its order as other petitioners too had sought a CBI probe. One of the petitioners is the TVK party. Though it did not seek a CBI probe, the party had requested the court to direct that the ongoing probe be supervised by a retired SC judge.The bench also sought an explanation from the Madras high court on the manner in which a single-judge bench of the court had taken suo motu cognizance of the case and ordered SIT probe when a similar matter was pending before the Madurai bench of HC.""..it is clear that the division bench at Madurai denied the CBI investigation, holding that the investigation by the local police is not flawed, while the learned single judge at the Main Seat (Chennai), dissatisfied with the police investigation, directed for constitution of SIT. Such recourse prima facie indicates the lack of sensitivity and propriety to deal with such a matter, creating multiplicity of proceedings, for reasons best known to the Hon'ble Judges,"" the bench said.""But by taking suo motu cognizance even during pendency of writ petitions before the Madurai bench within whose jurisdiction the incident took place and also ignoring that the Hon'ble Chief Minister of the State has already constituted an Enquiry Commission comprising a retired Judge of the High Court, how far the order of the learned Single Judge was correct in taking suo motu cognizance and creating a SIT, is an issue.

Poll Do you support the government’s Rs 6.4 trillion transmission plan for hydroelectric capacity in the Brahmaputra basin? Yes, it’s a positive step for sustainable energy No, I have concerns about environmental impact

China begins construction of dam on Brahmaputra



NEW DELHI: The Union government has prepared a Rs 6.4 trillion ($77 billion) transmission plan to transfer more than 76 gigawatts of hydroelectric capacity from the Brahmaputra basin by 2047 to meet rising electricity demand, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) said on Monday.In a report released on Monday, the CEA said the plan includes 208 large hydro projects across 12 sub-basins in the northeastern states, with 64.9 GW of potential capacity and an additional 11.1 GW from pumped-storage plants. ""In view of the substantial hydroelectric potential identified within the Brahmaputra basin, it was felt to have a comprehensive transmission system plan for evacuation of power from this assessed potential. Consequently, a transmission system master plan has been formulated for the evacuation of 65 GW of hydroelectric generation capacity from 12 sub-basins of the Brahmaputra basin,"" the CEA said in the report.The Brahmaputra River, which rises in Tibet and flows through India and Bangladesh, has significant hydro potential in its Indian stretch, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh near the China border.The basin’s transboundary nature and proximity to China make water management and infrastructure planning a strategic issue, amid the government's concerns that a Chinese dam on the Yarlung Zangbo (the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra river) could reduce dry-season flows on the Indian side by up to 85 per cent.The Brahmaputra basin covers parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, and West Bengal, and holds more than 80 per cent of India’s untapped hydro potential, the report said. Arunachal Pradesh alone accounts for 52.2 GW, news agency Reuters reported.Phase one of the plan, running until 2035, will require Rs 1.91 trillion, while phase two will cost 4.52 trillion rupees, according to the CEA, as cited by the Reuters.India aims to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by achieving 500 GW of non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2070.China began building a major dam on the Brahmaputra in southeastern Tibet in July, near the border with India. Premier Li Qiang attended the groundbreaking ceremony.India had raised concerns about the project earlier this year. In January, the ministry of external affairs said, ""China has been urged to ensure that the interests of the downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas.""","The Brahmaputra River, which rises in Tibet and flows through India and Bangladesh, has significant hydro potential in its Indian stretch.

The move comes just a day after US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor met PM Modi and held discussions with Agrawal. “During my visit to India, I met with commerce secretary Agrawal & discussed US-India economic ties, including increased investment in US,” Gor posted on X Sunday.US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor’s post indicates Trump administration is also nudging Indian companies to commit to investing in the US, a move meant to strengthen the President’s claims that his tariff actions and negotiations with countries have resulted in investment commitments that add up to $17 trillion, a number that is facing scrutiny.While some Indian IT companies are looking to set up offices and hire more locally, a handful of Indian players have invested in the US.So far, the discussions were focused largely on India slashing import duties, including on farm products, in return for getting a favourable “reciprocal tariff” for its exports. Besides, Trump has cited India’s purchase of Russian crude to impose a crushing 50% tariff, which has hurt Indian textiles, gems and jewellery and leather and footwear players.The 25% reciprocal tariff on India, which came after Indian negotiators held their ground on not allowing American corn and soybean and genetically modified food, is higher than several competitor countries.

Delhi government plans ride-hailing service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-government-plans-ride-hailing-service/articleshow/124540849.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Delhi government plans to launch the city's first ever cooperative ride-hailing service, aiming to offer drivers an alternative to corporate platforms while providing passengers more affordable, surge-free options.Officials said the service would ensure drivers retain 100% of their earnings, wherein they don't have to pay any commission to cab aggregators. Officials of the registrar cooperative society have been tasked with preparing a detailed blueprint to take the plan forward.Cooperative minister Ravinder Indraj announced the initiative during the annual general meeting of Delhi Citizen Cooperative Bank on Sunday, describing it as part of govt's larger effort to ""revitalise the cooperative movement in the city with new direction and energy"".Speaking to TOI on Monday, Indraj said, ""I have asked officials to prepare a feasibility report and develop a framework so Delhi can get cooperative taxi-hailing service. The details are being worked out, but we intend to roll it out soon.""Delhi's scheme draws inspiration from the Sahkar Taxi cooperative currently being developed in Maharashtra and other states, a concept championed by the Union ministry of cooperation.Earlier this year, Union home minister Amit Shah announced plans for a cooperative taxi service across the country that would include registration of two-wheelers, taxis, rickshaws and four-wheelers under a single umbrella. The profits generated would be shared equitably among driver-members, bypassing corporate intermediaries.In Delhi, the proposed service will operate through a dedicated app, connecting passengers directly with driver-members of the cooperative. Unlike conventional corporate-run ride-hailing firms, the platform will be owned and managed by the drivers themselves. This model seeks to eliminate commission charges, promising fair and transparent pricing.""The main objective is to uplift taxi drivers by improving their income, working conditions and overall quality of life. By making drivers active members and stakeholders, govt hopes to build a sustainable model that benefits drivers and consumers alike,"" said an official.Passengers, too, stand to gain from the cooperative framework, with promises of reliable service, transparent fares, and no unexpected price surges. ""This approach aims for a win-win scenario where drivers enjoy social security benefits and fair profit-sharing, while commuters get affordable rides,"" the official added.Maharashtra's Sahkar Taxi is expected to start operations by Dec 2025. Delhi's model will be tailored specifically to the capital's unique needs and commuting patterns, said Indraj. ""Our service won't be an exact replica of Maharashtra's, but will be designed to suit Delhi's conditions,"" he told TOI.The official said the app will directly connect passengers with drivers. The cooperatives will govern the platform, maintain transparent fare slabs, and ban algorithmic price hikes. Delhi govt will also facilitate necessary regulatory clearances to smooth the rollout, he added.Taxi industry representatives have welcomed the move. Sanjay Samrat, president, Delhi Taxi and Tourist Transporters Association, said, ""Cab aggregators take up to 40% commission on every ride, severely cutting into drivers' earnings. When these firms were launched, their commission was zero, but that has changed drastically.""Samrat said the cooperative scheme should allow the registration of both existing and new CNG vehicles. ""Forcing drivers to switch only to electric vehicles will be difficult because of high cost and limited profitability,"" he said, urging govt to provide affordable loans to drivers to buy vehicles.","Delhi government plans to launch the city's first ever cooperative ride-hailing service.

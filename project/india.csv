"Digital divide: Working computers in just 57% of India's schools, internet in 54%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digital-divide-working-computers-in-just-57-of-indias-schools-internet-in-54/articleshow/116867829.cms,"Dropout rates rise from 5.2% in middle school to 10.9% at secondary stage: Study

India's school infrastructure presents a mixed picture of progress and persistent challenges, as highlighted in the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2023-24 report. While over 90% of schools have basic amenities like electricity and gender-specific toilets, advanced facilities such as functional desktops, internet access and ramps with handrails remain limited.Only 57.2% of schools have functional computers, 53.9% have internet, and 52.3% are equipped with ramps, underscoring significant gaps in accessibility and tech readiness.The enrolment landscape has seen changes, with total number of students down by 37 lakh to 24.8 crore in 2023-24. Boys account for 51.9% of enrolments and girls 48.1%. The shift from aggregated school-level data to individual student records, facilitated by Aadhaar-linked unique educational IDs, is a step forward. ""Student-wise data gives a more accurate picture of the education system,"" said a ministry official, adding that the new methodology may partly account for the observed variations.This approach marks a departure from the earlier school-level aggregated data, enhancing the monitoring of progression and retention. The introduction of unique educational IDs alongside Aadhaar aims to streamline beneficiary identification for government schemes, reducing duplication and promoting equitable resource distribution.Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) reveals disparities across educational levels. While the preparatory level boasts a GER of 96.5%, the foundational level is at a mere 41.5%. Middle and secondary levels are at 89.5% and 66.5%, respectively. Dropout rates also rise sharply at higher education levels, from 5.2% in middle school to 10.9% at the secondary stage. Retention rates reflect a similar trend, plummeting from 85.4% at the preparatory level to just 45.6% at the secondary stage.Disparities among states further complicate the picture. West Bengal has 79% foundational and preparatory schools but only 11.6% secondary schools, creating a risk of higher dropout rates. Conversely, Chandigarh's 75.6% secondary schools indicate a focus on higher education but highlight a shortage of foundational institutions at 6.1%. Infrastructure gaps and teacher deployment issues exacerbate these challenges. ""Despite efforts under NE, infrastructure gaps hinder our progress toward universal education. Optimising resources is key to meeting the ambitious targets for 2030,"" the ministry official added.Teacher deployment and pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) remain critical issues. Several states, including Jharkhand, Bihar, and West Bengal, exceed NEP-recommended PTR of 30:1 at the secondary level. In contrast, Delhi and Chandigarh have optimal PTRs aligned with NEP norms. However, states such as Assam, Odisha, and Karnataka face underutilised infrastructure due to low student-to-school ratios.NE prioritises inclusion and equity, and UDISE+ data offers a snapshot of representation. Girls constitute 48.1% of total enrolments, and minorities account for 20%, with Muslim students representing 79.6% of this group. Social category data shows that 45.2% of students belong to the OBC category, followed by 18% SC and 9.9% ST students. Aadhaar seeding stands at 79.4% nationally, but states like Meghalaya (24.1%), Bihar (38.8%), and Manipur (51.8%) lag, which could impact targeted interventions.""Universal access to education and reducing dropout rates by 2030 is a primary goal of NE and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"" the report states. Aadhaar-linked educational IDs enhance dropout tracking and re-enrolment efforts while streamlining governance for schemes like Samagra Shiksha and PM POSHAN.Despite strides in foundational enrolment, transition rates between educational stages remain uneven. While 98.1% of students progress from foundational to preparatory levels, only 83.3% transition from middle to secondary education. These statistics underscore systemic challenges in retaining students and ensuring smooth educational progression. The UDISE+ report serves as a call to action for optimising infrastructure, improving teacher deployment, and addressing disparities in enrolment and retention. These measures are essential for realising NEP's vision of equitable and inclusive education by 2030.","The enrolment landscape has seen changes, with total number of students down by 37 lakh to 24.8 crore in 2023-24.

"After 40 years, convoy carrying gas tragedy waste heads out of Bhopal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-40-years-convoy-carrying-gas-tragedy-waste-heads-out-of-bhopal/articleshow/116867788.cms,"MP pollution control board explains safety steps to allay fears over toxic waste disposal

BHOPAL/INDORE: Trucks carrying hazardous waste left over from the 1984 gas tragedy began rolling out of the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal for a disposal plant in Pithampur, 230km away, on Wednesday night, even as workers of other factories in the industrial estate near Indore voiced concern about their safety.""Transportation to Pithampur has begun. The convoy has been fortified with the highest security protocol ever witnessed in movement of industrial waste in the country,"" said MP gas relief & rehabilitation department director Swatantra Kumar Singh.TOI had reported Wednesday that the trucks were loaded and ready to move. At 9pm, the convoy carrying 337 metric tons of waste in sealed containers set out from Bhopal, escorted by police and emergency vehicles along a green corridor.Forty years of wait and four days of suspense had ended. The scars of the world's worst industrial disaster may never heal, but a chapter from the tragic episode is drawing to a close. It would take about seven hours to reach the final destination, said Singh.The convoy of 40 vehicles stretched over a kilometre. Twelve trucks are carrying the hazardous cargo. It's a no-halt, no-stop journey to Pithampur Waste Management Pvt Ltd, where the waste will be incinerated. Five district administrations are on high alert. Around 700 security personnel have been deployed for the convoy.""The 337 MT of UCIL waste will undergo scientific disposal within three to nine months,"" said Singh.It took strong words from Madhya Pradesh HC to get the administration moving on the long-pending disposal of this toxic waste. ""Are you waiting for another tragedy,"" a division bench of Chief Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Vivek Jain had asked the authorities in their Dec 3 order. HC set a deadline of four weeks to shift the hazardous waste for disposal.Singh has repeatedly assured all safety factors have been taken care of and there is no risk to the environment, land, or people around the disposal plant at Pithampur.On Wednesday, aiming to ease anxiety among Pithampur residents and industrialists about the Union Carbide waste disposal, MP pollution control board regional officer in Indore Shriniwas Dwivedi issued a video statement explaining the safety precautions. ""A special shed has been created with a concrete floor. It is leakproof,"" Dwivedi says in the video, adding: ""No activity will be carried out that will affect the people, farm, property, land or environment.""At Pithampur, however, workers at other plants are worried about potential fallout. ""Employees are scared. We are receiving calls from family members of our employees enquiring about the situation in Pithampur. Some employees have requested leave. The circumstances are extraordinary and everyone is under immense pressure,"" said Dr Darshan Kataria, an industrialist at Pithampur.Another industrialist from Pithampur Sector 2, where the waste disposal factory is situated, said he has lost count of calls made to various govt departments and fellow industrialists regarding contingency measures.""What occurred in Bhopal was an unfortunate accident, but what is happening now can be handled by taking everyone in confidence. It presents a difficult situation and is deeply unsettling for us as we cannot be immune to the problem,"" said Rajendra Modi, director of an engineering products manufacturing unit in Pithampur.Local industrialists say govt officials neither initiated discussions with them nor apprised them about safety measures implemented for industries and residents in proximity to the disposal facility.Swatantra Kumar Singh has, through public statements, repeatedly allayed safety concerns and assured disposal and incineration shall be conducted under expert supervision without any adverse consequences.",Trucks carrying hazardous waste left over from the 1984 gas tragedy began rolling out of the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal. Workers of other factories in the industrial estate near Indore voiced concern about their safety.

2024 was India's hottest year since records began in 1901,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2024-was-indias-hottest-year-since-records-began-in-1901/articleshow/116867730.cms,"Slightly more rainfall than normal in Jan, forecasts IMD

NEW DELHI: 2024 was by far the warmest year on record in the country since 1901, IMD said Wednesday. It also noted that the last three months of the year (Oct-Dec) together were the warmest on record whereas Oct 2024, individually, was the warmest month in 123 years.With an annual mean temperature of 25.75 degrees Celsius, 2024 was 0.65 degree C above the long-term average (1991-2020 period). The previous warmest year, 2016, had an anomaly of 0.54 degree C. As annual averages go, the difference of 0.11 degree C between the mean temperature in 2016 and 2024 is quite huge.The record heat in India was in sync with worldwide rise in annual average temperatures as global warming accelerates. World Meteorological Organisation has observed that 2024 was globally the warmest year on record, exceeding the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degrees C of warming above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time. This follows on from the record-breaking 1.45 degrees C rise in 2023, the previous globally warmest year on record.Releasing the outlook for January, IMD said monthly minimum (night) temperatures are likely to be ""above normal"" (warmer) over most of India except parts of UP and Rajasthan, some parts of MP and Gujarat and portions of east India such as Bihar, where normal to below normal temperatures are likely.IMD chief M Mohapatra, however, said ""above-normal cold wave days"" are expected over western and northern parts of central India during the month of Jan.Specifically asked about the weather situation in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh (Jan 13-Feb 26), Mohapatra said though there was a possibility of below normal (colder) minimum (night) temperature during the period, IMD would provide more precise forecast closer to the religious festival.Probabilistic forecast map for Jan, released by Met department, shows the possibility of colder day and night (normal to below normal minimum/maximum temperatures) in the region, Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, during the month.Otherwise, the monthly maximum (day) temperatures for Jan are likely to be above normal (warmer) for ""most parts of the country except some parts of the northwest, central and adjoining east India and central parts of South Peninsula"" where it is likely to be normal to below normal.As far as rainfall is concerned, Jan is likely to witness slightly more rainfall than normal rains for the month - a situation which may be helpful for the standing rabi (winter sown) crops during the period if its distribution is uniform.IMD said, ""Monthly rainfall for Jan over north India consisting of seven meteorological subdivisions (East Uttar Pradesh, West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) is most likely to be above normal,""It said the monthly rainfall even over the country in Jan is also most likely to be above normal. ""Above-normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country except some parts of northwest India and some pockets of the northeast and central India where normal to below normal rainfall is likely,"" said Met department.","2424 was by far the warmest year on record in the country since 1901, IMD said Wednesday. The last three months of the year (Oct-Dec) together were warmest on record whereas Oct 2024, individually, was warmest month in 123 years.

Josh Allen And Hailee Steinfeld Out On A Date Night



Hailee Steinfeld Is Fitting In With The Buffalo Bills’ W.A.Gs



The Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen seems to be enjoying his time in Buffalo with his fiancee, actress Hailee Steinfeld . Recently, they were spotted at a fine dine restaurant in Buffalo, New York where Hailee was spotted sipping on a red wine and relaxing while Josh was sporting a black baseball cap and is sipping on a drink. While it is not clear what Josh was sipping on, both Josh and Hailee looked like they were having a good time.The picture was posted by a fan account of Hailee Steinfeld’s on Instagram called “haileesteinfeldhq”. While neither Hailee nor Josh posted anything about their date night , fans have gone into a frenzy as their date night pictures have now gone viral. Though it is not confirmed which fine dine restaurant it is, it looks like eagle eyed fans have started posting that it is the Mulberry’s restaurant in Buffalo, New York.This is the second time in a row that Hailee has been spotted having the time of her life and enjoying herself as she temporarily lives in Buffalo with her fiance Josh. A few days ago, pictures of her had gone viral when she was spotted shopping casually at the Wegmans store for groceries. Fans could not get enough of how Hailee, being an Oscar nominated actress, had no airs about herself and was spotted interacting and posing with her fans.It looks like Hailee, even though has come from a completely different career, has found her spot in the Buffalo Bills. Recently, Josh’s fiancee Hailee was also spotted attending the Buffalo Bills Christmas party where she had a good time with the other wives and girlfriends of the Buffalo Bills’ players. Hailee looked stunning at this Christmas party as she turned up in a full sleeved red dress with a thigh slit. She opted for a low bun and few side fringes and kept her makeup very minimal.It is not just about the Christmas party though; recently, Shane Buechele, Josh’s teammate and the quarterback of the Buffalo Bills, hosted a baby shower for his wife, Paige Buechele who is currently pregnant with a girl.

Late Drama and Rain-Shortened Day

Looking Ahead

The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday, with both teams achieving record-breaking feats.Zimbabwe's first innings saw them amass a colossal 586 runs, surpassing their previous highest Test score of 563/9 against the West Indies in 2001. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699 all out, establishing their own record for the highest innings total, beating their previous best of 545/4, also achieved against Zimbabwe in 2021.The Afghan innings was highlighted by captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's historic 246, a national record, and Rahmat Shah's 234. Together, they forged a massive 364-run third-wicket partnership, the highest in Afghanistan's Test history for any wicket. Shahidi’s 246 eclipsed his previous best of 200 against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi. Wicketkeeper Afsar Zazai also contributed a maiden Test century with 113 runs, further solidifying Afghanistan's dominance in their first innings.Zimbabwe's Brian Bennett, a 21-year-old spinner in only his second Test, showcased his all-around brilliance. Bennett took a career-best 5/95 in Afghanistan's innings and earlier contributed an unbeaten 110 with the bat in Zimbabwe's first innings.Afghanistan’s innings ended in a collapse, with the last six wickets falling for just 20 runs in four overs, largely due to Bennett's spin. In their second innings, Zimbabwe reached 142/4, avoiding further damage thanks to an unbroken 54-run partnership between veterans Sean Williams (35) and Craig Ervine (22).The match's conclusion was impacted by mid-afternoon rain, which caused a delay of over an hour. Zimbabwe showed resilience, with debutant Ben Curran impressing with 41 runs before a run-out, and opener Joylord Gumbie contributing 24.The second and final Test of the series begins Thursday, also in Bulawayo, with both teams eager to build on the momentum from this high-scoring encounter.For context, Sri Lanka still hold the record for the highest-ever Test innings score with 952/6 declared against India in Colombo in 1997.","The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday.

WATCH VIDEO

The closing stages of the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia in Melbourne were marred by controversy around Yashasvi Jaiswal 's caught-behind decision, which was given out by the third umpire.During the last session of the match, Jaiswal missed a pull shot against Pat Cummins and the ball went past his bat and gloves as the bowler went up in appeal, but the umpire shook his head in denial. Cummins signalled for a review straight away and the third umpire gave it out, overruling the on-field decision.Seeing no deviation on the 'Snickometer' during replays shown on the giant screen, Jaiswal had a long discussion with the umpires before walking back.Former players and experts remained divided in their opinion on the decision. However, a latest video released by the Australian media hints at Jaiswal possibly telling Travis Head that he did get a touch on the ball and the Australian batter could be seen raising his arms in delight, signalling 'out' to his teammates.The decision left India staring at a defeat, as Jaiswal, who scored 84, was the last hope to save the Test. But India slipped from 121 for 3 to 155 all out, resulting in a 184-run victory for Australia, which gave them a 2-1 lead in the five-match series with just the Sydney Test left to play.After the match ended, India captain Rohit Sharma was asked about his views on the controversial call during the press conference.He felt Jaiswal did get a touch.""It didn't show on Snicko, but with the naked eye there was a deflection. In all fairness, it looked like he touched it, but more often than not we fall on the wrong side of such decisions,"" Rohit said.Australia now need just a draw in the last Test at Sydney to reclaim the Border Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2014.","Yashasvi Jaiswal's caught-behind decision marred by controversy.

Himanta Biswa Sarma says 'we should not encourage Bangladeshi Hindus to come to India'; Congress hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/himanta-biswa-sarma-says-we-should-not-encourage-bangladeshi-hindus-to-come-to-india-congress-hits-back/articleshow/116859794.cms,"Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma (Pic credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister and senior BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday said Hindus staying in Bangladesh should not be encouraged to come to India as they are patriotic Bangladeshis who do not want to leave their land despite ""tremendous atrocities"" they face there. He also praised the Hindus in Bangladesh for acting ""very maturely"" by not coming to India. Sarma's remarks evoked a strong retort from the Congress which accused the BJP and RSS of exploiting the plight of Hindus for their political gains.""I explained why the Hindus are not coming. I think the numbers are very less. Whoever wanted to come must have come earlier, thirty or forty years back. These are the people who do not want to come out of Bangladesh. They must have some affinity to the soil of the land. They must be patriotic Bangladeshis. Even after tremendous atrocity they do not want to come out of Bangladesh because their forefathers were in that land. I think we should also not encourage them to come into India. Prime Minister is working overtime to give security and to create a condition of security in Bangladesh itself,"" Sarma said.""Bangladesh Hindu people are acting very maturely and they are not coming. At least we have not detected any Bangladeshi Hindu in Assam in the last five months,"" he added.""We have put the security forces on high alert at the International Border following the unrest in Bangladesh to check infiltration. The police have detected a good number of illegal immigrants on a daily basis along the International Border. However, no Hindu infiltrator from Bangladesh was arrested in the last five months,"" the Assam chief minister said calling the situation ""very worrying.""Reacting sharply to the Assam chief minister's remarks, Congress leader Rashid Alvi accused the BJP and RSS of exploiting the Hindus.""The statement of Assam CM proves that the BJP and RSS only exploit the Hindu community and they have nothing to do with their problems. The BJP and its government at the Centre are anti-Hindu. They are not bothered about what is happening with the Hindus in Bangladesh. Their only objective is to talk about Hindus during elections and provke their sentiments for political gains,"" Alvi said.""There are a lot of Hindus in Bangladesh. Indian government raises this issue only within India for political gains,"" he added.The Assam chief minister also blamed the textile factory owners, especially in Tamil Nadu, for encouraging the infiltration of workers from Bangladesh.""After the unrest in Bangladesh, the textile industry collapsed there. So workers working in the textile industry in Bangladesh are coming to India. They are trying to enter the country to go to the textile industries in Tamil Nadu, and ""owners of these industries are incentivising them to come to get cheap labour. I have also discussed this issue with Union home minister Amit Shah in my last meeting. So this is a very worrying issue for us because we have never detected so many infiltrators before,"" Himanta Biswa Sarma said.The Hindus in Bangladesh have been faced increased atrocities amidst the ongoing political turmoil after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina 's ouster in August last year. Attacks targeting minorities, primarily Hindus, have increased in Bangladesh since then.The Centre for Democracy, Pluralism and Human Rights (CDPHR) last month presented a report on the state of minorities in Bangladesh. The report titled 'Bangladesh Minorities Under Siege: A Wake-Up Call for the International Community' details the incidents of violence and unrest affecting the Hindu communities in the country in the wake of the political changes.According to the report, there were 190 reported cases of looting, 32 homes were set on fire, 16 temples were desecrated and two incidents of sexual violence were recorded between August 5 and 9 after Hasina's resignation.By August 20, the number of reported incidents had increased significantly, with 2,010 total cases of violence against the Hindus, including the desecration of 69 temples and attacks on 157 families, the report states.The report claims that the situation for religious minorities continued to deteriorate despite the formation of an interim government under Muhammad Yunus on August 8.",Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Hindus staying in Bangladesh should not be encouraged to come to India. He said the Hindus are patriotic Bangladeshis who do not want to leave their land.

How Manmohan-era retail firm contributed to Chandrababu Naidu's Rs 931 crore wealth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-manmohan-era-retail-firm-contributed-to-chandrababu-naidus-rs-931-crore-wealth/articleshow/116859142.cms,"NEW DELHI: After the release of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) report on the wealthiest politicians,Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu's family firm Heritage Foods Ltd issued a clarification, stating that approximately 82% of CM's wealth worth Rs 931 crore is on account of his kin's shareholding in a dairy product retailing firm.His family's ownership in a dairy retail enterprise was established during India's economic liberalisation under Manmohan Singh over 30 years ago, according to company officials.Heritage Foods Ltd, established in 1992 and listed publicly in 1994, has no direct shareholding by Naidu. However, his wife Bhuvaneswari Nara 's 24.37% stake, valued at roughly Rs 763 crore, contributes to the Andhra chief minister's reported wealth.The ADR has identified Naidu as the wealthiest chief minister with assets exceeding Rs 931 crore.Heritage Foods officials emphasised that the company operates purely in dairy retail, avoiding sectors typically associated with crony capitalism like infrastructure.The company's success relies solely on consumer acceptance, without government subsidies or support. Notably, the firm's establishment preceded Naidu's chief ministership, occurring when he was merely an MLA, and its stock market listing came before his elevation to the chief minister position.In the early 1990s, Chittoor district in united Andhra Pradesh, Naidu's home region, led in milk production.The district experienced a milk surplus and marketing challenges for dairy farmers in 1992.Following Dr Manmohan Singh's economic liberalisation in 1991-92, various sectors, including dairy, welcomed private investment and entrepreneurship.Capitalising on this opportunity, Naidu launched Heritage Foods in 1992, investing Rs 50 lakh initially to establish the first milk chilling unit in Chittoor, supported by Bank of Baroda loans. He served as managing director for two years.Upon becoming minister in 1994, Naidu stepped down, with his wife assuming the role of executive director and later managing director. The company's public listing in 1994 showed a market capitalisation of Rs 25 crore, which grew alongside the company's expansion.The organisation cleared all loans from Bank of Baroda and other nationalised banks, achieving debt-free status post-COVID.Currently, Heritage Foods commands a market value of Rs 4400 crores, generates Rs 3750 crores in revenue, and maintains operations across 12 Indian states. Its asset base stands at Rs 600 crores, with recognised strength in quality dairy products and distribution.The enterprise operates under the leadership of Managing Director Bhuwaneswari Nara and Executive Director Nara Brahmani, Naidu's daughter-in-law, who has served for a decade. Brahmani, married to Nara Lokesh, holds a Stanford business school degree and brings experience from prominent global dairy organisations.","Heritage Foods Ltd, established in 1992 and listed publicly in 1994, has no direct shareholding by Naidu.

Singh attributed Manipur’s ongoing challenges to what he called the “sins of the Congress,” singling out decisions made during previous administrations.“Everyone, including yourself, is aware that Manipur is in turmoil today because of the past sins committed by the Congress,” Singh said, directly addressing Ramesh on X.He cited the repeated settlement of Burmese refugees and the signing of the Suspension of Operations (SoO) Agreement with Myanmar-based militants, which he claimed were initiated under the tenure of then-Union home minister P Chidambaram.Ramesh had earlier questioned why PM Modi had avoided visiting Manipur despite the state’s prolonged unrest. “Why can't the Prime Minister go to Manipur and say the same thing there? He has deliberately avoided visiting the state since May 4th, 2023, even as he jets around the country and the world,” Ramesh remarked.Singh defended Modi’s stance, turning the spotlight on Congress’s past handling of ethnic conflicts in the region. “The clashes began in 1992 and continued at varying intensities for around five years (1992–1997). This period marked one of the bloodiest ethnic conflicts in northeast India, deeply affecting relations between the Naga and Kuki communities in Manipur.""""Did Shri PV Narasimha Rao, who served as the Prime Minister of India from 1991 to 1996 and was the President of the Indian National Congress during this time, come to Manipur to extend an apology? TheKuki-Paite clashes claimed 350 lives in the state. During most of the Kuki-Paite clashes (1997–1998), Shri IK Gujral was the Prime Minister of India. Did he visit Manipur and say sorry to the people?” Singh asked.The chief minister argued that Congress’s focus on politics was undermining efforts to resolve Manipur’s core issues. He also referenced his recent apology to victims of the 2023 violence, “The apology I extended today was a sincere act of expressing my grief for the people who have been left displaced and become homeless.”Singh’s remarks followed his New Year’s Eve address, where he outlined measures for Manipur’s recovery, including a significant reduction in violence and a roadmap for rehabilitation and development. The state has reported a sharp decline in casualties and unrest since May 2023, with over 2,000 displaced families returning home and numerous welfare initiatives launched.“Our commitment is unwavering. These measures not only aim at rehabilitation but also aspire to propel Manipur towards self-reliance and growth,” the Manipur CM said.","Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh has sharply countered Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s “absence’ from the conflict-hit state.

Agricultural women workers were 32% more likely to undergo a hysterectomy compared to other occupation groups, said the study published in the 'Journal of Medical Evidence' recently. It found a high number of hysterectomies - many unnecessary - among Indian women. The prevalence of hysterectomy in women aged 25-49 years was 4.8% as per National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) and increased slightly to 4.9% in NFHS-5 (2019-21).The study also found that seven out of every ten hysterectomies are performed in private health facilities, while 32.2% of hysterectomy surgeries are performed in public health facilities. ""Private practitioners are emphasising the need for hysterectomy with a profit motive even for benign conditions which can be treated with less invasive methods and medications,"" said authors Gaurav Gunnal of Deonar-based International Institute of Population Sciences and Dr Sudeshna Roy of National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi.For instance, in Maharashtra, while 2.2% of professional women in 25-49 age group underwent hysterectomy, the percentage was double (4.4) for agricultural workers. In Andhra Pradesh, the corresponding numbers were 10.3% for professional women and 14.5% for those from the agriculture sector.

""Women belonging to households with health insurance coverage are more likely to undergo hysterectomy than women from households without proper coverage,"" said Gunnal.The main causes for hysterectomy were prolonged excessive bleeding (55.4%), followed by fibroids/cysts (19.6%) and uterine disorder (13.9%). The authors blamed cultural and social influences for the trend: ""Menstrual taboos and limited knowledge about reproductive health contribute to the high prevalence of hysterectomy, with some women opting for it to avoid menstrual issues or due to fear of reproductive health cancers,"" they said.",Study: Agricultural women workers were 32% more likely to undergo a hysterectomy than other occupation groups.

NEW DELHI: RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday expelled his elder son and former Bihar minister, Tej Pratap Yadav , from both the party and the family, citing repeated misconduct and violations of family values. Lalu's daughter, Rohini Acharya, has come out in firm support of the decision, defending her father's actions and stressing the importance of ""dignity, discipline, and tradition within the family and party. ""Tej Pratap’s removal has sparked political debate in Bihar just months before the crucial assembly elections, with many seeing the move as an attempt to draw a clear line between personal controversies and party discipline.Rohini Acharya, a key figure in the RJD, issued a strong message on X: “Those who take care of the dignity of the environment, tradition, family and upbringing are never questioned… We will never accept that the reputation of [Papa, family, and party] is tarnished due to anyone.”Reinstating her loyalty to RJD supremo and father, she added: ""For us, Papa is like God, family is our temple and pride and the party built by Papa's tireless efforts and struggles, and the concept of social justice is our worship. We will never accept that the reputation of these three is tarnished due to anyone.""Lalu Yadav explained his decision in a detailed post, saying: “The activities, public behaviour, and irresponsible conduct of my eldest son are not in line with our family's values and cultural ethos… Therefore, due to the above circumstances, I remove him from the party and family… He is expelled from the party for six years.”He also made it clear that others were free to choose their stance: “All those who will have relations with him should take their own decisions.”Reacting to the development, Tejashwi Yadav , Tej Pratap’s younger brother and former Deputy CM, called the situation unfortunate but stressed that it was a personal matter: “Political life and personal life are different… He is an adult and free to make decisions… Our party's chief has made it clear.”The controversy erupted after a post from Tej Pratap’s Facebook account claimed he was in a long-term relationship. Tej Pratap later alleged his account had been hacked and his photos were maliciously edited.He had earlier made headlines over his troubled marriage with Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former Bihar CM Daroga Rai.The open family rift comes months ahead of high-stakes electoral battle in Bihar, where RJD is going to face formidable NDA alliance.","RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday expelled his elder son and former Bihar minister, Tej Pratap Yadav.

Omar’s party goes unrepresented as party MP opts out of outreach trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omars-party-goes-unrepresented-as-party-mp-opts-out-of-outreach-trip/articleshow/121400097.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K’s National Conference (NC) has no plans to nominate another representative for the all-party delegations briefing foreign nations and UN members about India’s anti-terrorism position and Operation Sindoor after party MP Mian Altaf Ahmad declined to join the team currently visiting key countries. NC will not have political representation in any of the seven delegations.Centre had nominated the Anantnag–Rajouri MP for the delegation led by DMK MP Kanimozhi in his capacity as NC’s parliamentary head, party sources said Sunday. The team includes Rajiv Rai (SP), Capt Brijesh Chowta (BJP), Prem Chand Gupta (RJD), and ambassador Jawed Ashraf. It was in Russia Saturday.Three politicians from J&K — Ghulam Nabi Azad (Democratic Progressive Azad Party), Mian Altaf (NC), and Ghulam Ali Khatana (BJP) — had been named for these outreach efforts.Altaf opted out as he is engaged with the annual religious ceremony of Hazrat Mian Nizamuddin Kiyanvi, popularly known as Baba Nagri, held in early June at Wangath in Kangan of Ganderbal district. The event draws thousands of devotees across J&K.A senior NC functionary said while the party was consulted and Altaf’s consent was sought, the nomination was Centre’s decision. “Centre didn’t ask us for his replacement after he declined,” the functionary said.“Since he was nominated as parliamentary head, I don’t think anyone else can represent NC now.”Tensions within NC also surfaced Sunday, as MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi accused party brass of yielding to Centre on Article 370 . On X, Mehdi wrote: “Oh leader! Either rise and speak up for your people, or step down, wear bangles, and remain confined to a palanquin.”The post appeared to target CM Omar Abdullah , who had earlier posted: “Sunday musing. There are doers & there are talkers. That’s why I don’t talk as much as some people I know.”The internal rift became public during NC’s working committee meeting on May 21, where Mehdi voiced frustration over lack of progress on restoring Article 370.",NC will not have political representation in any of the seven delegations.

KOLKATA: Pension is not ""an act of charity"" but a legal right of employees, Calcutta high court said while reprimanding Hooghly Chinsurah municipality for blaming technological lapses for a delay in releasing the pension of 148 people who retired as Group D workers. The court said the employees earned the right by putting in years of service.Justice Gaurang Kanth said, ""Pension and other retiral benefits, once earned by an employee after rendering long and continuous service ought not be delayed even by a single day. Delay in such cases causes undue hardship to the retired employees who depend on these dues for their sustenance.""He made the observation while hearing a petitioner's case who, along with 147 others, was employed in 1991-92.The posts — coolie, dome, methor, trailorman and jharuyali — were later clubbed under one umbrella post of ‘conservancy worker’. All of them were treated as permanent employees and were to receive monthly pension. However, following the petitioner’s retirement in 2023, her pension and other benefits were not released.In 2021, Bengal municipalities adapted an e-pension portal. Data for this comes from an integrated online salary management system — Urban Local Bodies Human Resource Management System — introduced in August 2017.Despite change in names of traditional posts, retired employees didn’t feature on the portal. Directorate of local bodies submitted in court that the municipality failed to provide details of all Group D employees. Hence, pension and retiral benefits had not been released.Court directed the municipality to submit all documents to the directorate within a week and the latter redesignate the employees within two weeks. Justice Kanth said any undue delay in disbursement of pension, “especially if occasioned by technological shortcomings or administrative lapses, is impermissible and contrary to the principles of equity, justice, and good governance”.","Calcutta high court reprimanded Hooghly Chinsurah municipality for blaming technological lapses for a delay in releasing the pension of 148 people who retired as Group D workers.

Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025

NEW DELHI: A video showing rainwater overflowing from a canopy at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport after a heavy downpour has sparked a political row, with the Congress taking a direct swipe at the BJP government over infrastructure quality.The incident occurred early Sunday as the National Capital Region was battered by rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds.The Kerala unit of the Congress shared the video on social media platform X, sarcastically commenting, ""Vikas overflows in Delhi airport after a drizzle.""The video showed water collecting in the middle of a sloped canopy before eventually spilling over, soaking the surrounding area.In a separate post, the party criticised the waterlogging near Terminal 3 of IGI Airport that disrupted travel, saying, “This G20 infra built at inflated cost joins the long list of crumbling 'Modi-quality' constructions.”As seen in the video, the canopy collapse happened due to the design's bowl-like structure, which allowed water to pool in the centre. As the pressure mounted, the tensile fabric failed to hold the accumulated water, leading to a dramatic overflow.As per ANI, the heavy rains led to the diversion of 49 flights, including 17 international flights, between 11.30 pm and 4 am. In a passenger advisory issued at 6.50 am, Delhi airport said, “Passengers are advised to check their flight status regularly and stay in touch with airline staff for updates.”Visuals from other parts of Delhi, including Moti Bagh and Minto Road, showed widespread waterlogging. A car was seen submerged at Minto Road, while traffic snarls were reported at several key junctions including Dhaula Kuan.The IMD had issued a red alert for Delhi and surrounding areas, predicting thunderstorms, lightning, and wind speeds up to 100 km/h.Also read: IMD issues warning as pre-monsoon showers hit Delhi, Kolkata, Goa & other cities The incident comes nearly a year after a roof collapse at Terminal 1 of the Delhi airport during similar weather conditions, which left one person dead and several injured.

We should be able to defend ourselves. No one should be able to conquer us—not even if multiple powers come together.”The magazine noted that this conversation took place before Operation Sindoor at the Organiser-Panchjanya office, ahead of the RSS's Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha scheduled for March 21–23.Bhagwat reiterated, “A virtuous person is not safe just because of his virtues. Hence, virtues should be combined with strength. Mere brute power can be directionless, leading to blatant violence. Therefore, power should be combined with righteousness.”When asked about global human rights defenders’ concern for Hindus facing oppression in neighbouring countries, Bhagwat suggested that support would only come when Hindus demonstrate strength.“As Hindu society and Bharat are intertwined, the glory of Hindu society will bring glory to Bharat. Such a strong Hindu society can present a model for including the people of Bharat who no longer consider themselves Hindus—as they, too, were once Hindus.”“If Hindu society in Bharat becomes strong, then automatically Hindus will gain strength globally,” he asserted.Bhagwat acknowledged that efforts to strengthen Hindu society are underway, noting that progress is “slow but steady.”“Slowly but surely, the situation is evolving,” he said, adding, “This time, the way anguish over atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh has been expressed is unprecedented. Even local Hindus (in Bangladesh) now say — ‘We won’t flee. We’ll stay and fight for our rights.’”","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat reiterates need to unify Hindu society and build Bharat into a formidable military and economic power. “We have no option but to be powerful, as we have been witnessing the wickedness of the evil forces on all our borders,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121395780,imgsize-1133227,width-400,resizemode-4/121395780.jpg"

Public urged to stay vigilant

Salvage efforts being explored

Sensitive ecosystem at risk

NEW DELHI: The Kerala government on Sunday declared a statewide emergency after a Liberian container ship, MSC ELSA 3, carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo, capsized and sank off the state’s coast, triggering fears of a major ecological disaster.Following a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary A Jayathilak, Kerala issued a statewide alert, warning coastal districts of potential environmental damage.Fishermen have been asked to stay ashore, and the public has been told not to touch or approach any drifting containers or oil slicks that may wash ashore. “Maintain a minimum distance of 200 metres and inform the emergency number 112,” read the official note.All 24 crew members aboard were rescued, 21 by the Indian Coast Guard and 3 by Indian Navy’s INS Sujata.According to Navy PRO Athul Pillai, the final three were rescued on Sunday morning after the vessel became too dangerous to remain aboard. “If they stayed put more, it was a danger for them,” he said, adding the rescue was carried out amid high winds and floating debris.As per PTI, the ship had 84.44 MT of diesel and 367.1 MT of furnace oil in its tanks.Some of this has already begun leaking into the sea. The fuel is drifting at around 3 km per hour, raising fears it may reach Kerala’s sensitive coastline.The Indian Coast Guard confirmed a “significant oil leak” and has deployed ICGS Saksham, Samarth, and a Dornier aircraft with oil dispersants to contain the spill.According to ANI, the vessel was carrying 12 containers of calcium carbide, a substance that reacts violently with seawater, producing highly flammable acetylene gas. This cargo poses a serious risk to marine life and coastal communities.The Coast Guard, leading pollution response efforts, is operating under the National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan, directly overseen by its director general.Surveillance aircraft with advanced oil spill mapping technology are conducting assessments. “We are fully geared to respond to the emerging scenario,” the ICG said.The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) warned that oil films or debris may appear along coastal areas. “There is a possibility that the containers and the oil can reach the state's coast,” said KSDMA member secretary Sekhar Kuriakose, as quoted by TOI. Locals have been urged to report any sightings to police.Before the ship sank, salvage operations were being planned, but the situation deteriorated rapidly.The vessel, which had departed Vizhinjam on May 23 and was en route to Kochi, began listing dangerously on May 24 afternoon.A Defence PRO confirmed some containers had already fallen into the sea by Saturday evening.The Kerala coast is home to rich biodiversity and is a key tourist destination. Authorities are bracing for the worst-case scenario, especially for districts like Thrissur, Kochi, and Alappuzha, which could face the brunt of the pollution.Authorities continue to monitor the situation closely as containment operations intensify.","The Liberian container ship, MSC ELSA 3, carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo, capsized and sank off the state's coast.

NEW DELHI: Citing 'made in India' defence equipment playing a decisive role in precision strikes under Operation Sindoor , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed gratitude to the country's engineers and technicians, and urged people to take a pledge to prioritise products made in the country and boost the ""self-reliant India"" resolve.""Our soldiers destroyed terror bases; it was their indomitable courage, along with the power of weapons, equipment and technology made in India. It also included the resolve of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ',"" Modi said in the 122nd edition of 'Mann Ki Baat'.The sweat of our engineers, our technicians, in fact, that of everyone... is involved in this victory,” PM said in his monthly radio talk, which he opened with remarks on the success of Operation Sindoor, lauding the valour of the armed forces.During his recent Adampur airbase visit, Modi had said in the last decade, the world’s best technologies had entered the country’s forces and India now not only fought with conventional weapons but also with drones, data and precision technology.Operation Sindoor witnessed extensive use of ‘made in India’ products as Indian forces, without crossing the Line of Control, struck terror infrastructure and eliminated multiple threats. Whether in drone warfare, layered air defence or electronic warfare, the operation marked a milestone in India’s journey towards technological self-reliance in military operations. Effective deployment of made in India BrahMos missile was cited as another key factor in Operation Sindoor.Modi said the entire country was filled with anger and was united against terrorism. He said, “Operation Sindoor is not just a military mission; it is a reflection of the country’s resolve, courage and a transforming India, infusing the nation with a sense of patriotism. It has deeply influenced people, with many families making it a part of their lives.” He cited examples of thousands of people participating in ‘Tiranga Yatra’, marching to honour the country’s armed forces.Modi praised the precision and accuracy with which the forces destroyed terrorist hideouts across the border and called it remarkable. “Operation Sindoor has instilled new confidence and enthusiasm in the global fight against terrorism,” he added. The PM said renewed energy was visible in the country regarding ‘Vocal for Local’. He cited the remarks of a parent, who said, “We will now buy toys only made in India for our children. Patriotism will start from childhood.”“Some families have taken a pledge, we will spend our next vacation in some beautiful place in the country. Many young persons have taken a pledge to ‘Wed in India’... that they will get married in the country itself. Someone also said, ‘now whatever gift we will give, it will be made by an Indian artisan’,” he added.","Modi: Operation Sindoor is a reflection of the country’s resolve, courage and a transforming India.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan considers India an ""existential threat"" and will continue to pursue efforts to modernise its military and develop its battlefield or tactical nuclear weapons to offset New Delhi's conventional military advantage, the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) has said.In its 'World Threat Assessment' report, which notes India's Operation Sindoor to strike terror hubs in Pakistan and the subsequent escalation in hostilities, the DIA says PM Modi's defence priorities will ""probably focus"" on demonstrating global leadership, countering China, and enhancing India's military power. ""India views China as primary adversary and Pakistan more as an ancillary security problem to be managed, despite cross-border attacks in mid-May by both militaries,"" the report said.China has played a big role in facilitating a proliferation nexus to help Pakistan and North Korea to steadily boost their nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals over the years.Global estimates say India and Pakistan have around 170 N-warheads each, with Islamabad also frequently brandishing its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other missiles as a counter to New Delhi's conventional military superiority, as earlier reported by TOI.The report says China's nuclear stockpile has probably crossed 600 operational warheads. ""We estimate China will have over 1,000 operational warheads by 2030, much of which will be deployed at higher readiness levels for faster response times,"" it said.Pakistan is modernising its nuclear arsenal and maintaining the security of its nuclear material, and command and control structures. “Pakistan almost certainly procures WMD (weapons of mass destruction)-applicable goods from foreign suppliers and intermediaries,” the report says.Early on May 10, India had struck nine airbases in Pakistan in what constituted some clear strategic messaging before the understanding on ceasing hostilities came into effect in the evening. In particular, the deep precision hits on the Nur Khan and Sargodha airbases rattled Pakistan. Nur Khan in Rawalpindi is located close to the headquarters of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division that handles the country’s nuclear arsenal, as was then reported by TOI.The DIA report says Pakistan “primarily is a recipient” of Beijing’s “economic and military largesse”, and its forces conduct multiple military exercises with Chinese forces every year.“ Foreign material and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programmes are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transhipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkiye, and the UAE,” it says.The report says India is giving priority to advancing its bilateral, trilateral and quadrilateral defence partnerships in the Indian Ocean Region and Indo-Pacific through exercises, training, arms sales and information sharing to counter China’s influence and boost its global leadership role.India will almost certainly continue promoting its ‘Made in India’ initiative this year to build its domestic defence industry, mitigate supply chain concerns, and modernise its military, it says.In 2024, India conducted a test of its nuclear-capable Agni-I Prime medium-range ballistic missile and the Agni-V multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle (multiple warheads on a single missile). “India also commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine (INS Arighaat) to strengthen its nuclear triad and bolster its ability to deter adversaries,” it says.Referring to troop disengagement in Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh in Oct last year, the report says it “did not resolve the long-standing dispute about border demarcation but reduced some tension still lingering” since the Galwan clash in 2020.","Pakistan considers India an ""existential threat"" and will continue to pursue efforts to modernise its military and develop its battlefield or tactical nuclear weapons.

She then collapsed, briefly regaining consciousness once before passing out again.A neighbour called the woman's family and they took her home, barely half a kilometre away, instead of a doctor.She died between 1.30pm and 2pm, after which police were informed, Raghuwanshi said.Postmortem revealed that the victim had been brutalised with a sharp, hard object that caused fatal internal injuries. ""The preliminary postmortem report confirms grievous trauma that ripped internal organs. Based on this, a case of gangrape and murder was registered against Hari (40) and Sunil (30), both labourers from the same village,"" the ASP said.According to the family, the woman was carrying Rs 20,000 - savings handed to her by her younger son and daughter, who had recently returned from Goa after a working stint with a road construction company there.

"With Rs 44,000 crore, India to revive minesweepers plan amid China threat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-rs-44000-crore-india-to-revive-minesweepers-plan-amid-china-threat/articleshow/121399040.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has revived its long-pending case for the indigenous construction of 12 specialized warships to detect, track and destroy underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.Defence ministry sources say the procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for the Navy, at an estimated cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, will soon be placed before the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council for the grant of “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”.The “open tender” or RFP (request for proposal) will then be issued for Indian shipyards to submit their techno-commercial bids. “It will take at least 7-8 years, if not more, for the first MCMV to roll out after the contract is inked,” a source said.The MCMVs are crucial in the backdrop of Chinese nuclear and conventional submarines, which can quietly lay mines, regularly coming to the Indian Ocean Region. Pakistan, too, is rapidly adding to its underwater combat fleet, with eight new Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines to be delivered by China.The Indian Navy, alarmingly, does not have a single MCMV at present, with its earlier six Karwar-class and two Pondicherry class of minesweepers having progressively retired several years ago.The force is making do with “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the critical capability gap when it needs 24 MCMVs to guard the country’s 7,516-km long coastline with 13 major ports and over 200 minor ones.Both state and non-state actors can choke harbours and ports by planting underwater mines, which are cheap and relatively easy to use, to blow up warships, merchant vessels and tankers.The acquisition case for 12 MCMVs had begun way back in July 2005, which eventually led to Goa Shipyard tying up with South Korea firm Kangnam to build the specialized vessels. The negotiations, however, remained deadlocked on the costs, technology transfer and build strategy. The Rs 32,000 crore project was finally scrapped by the MoD in 2017-2018.With a displacement of around 900-1,000 tonne, the MCMVs have non-magnetic hulls and high-definition sonars, acoustic and magnetic sweeps to detect marooned and drifting mines. The vessels then use remote-controlled systems like small underwater vehicles to detonate the mines at safe distances.The over 130-warship Navy, of course, played a silent but crucial role during Operation Sindoor earlier this month in dissuading Pakistan from escalating hostilities by forward deploying its aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, warships and submarines in the northern Arabian Sea.The force currently has 60 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards, while it will also commission its second 3,900-tonne multi-role frigate built in Russia as INS Tamal at Kaliningrad next month.It also has the initial approval or AoNs for another 31 warships, including seven new-generation frigates, eight corvettes and six stealth diesel-electric submarines. The MCMVs will add to the numbers.The Navy, however, will reach a force-level of just about 160 warships by 2030, given the slow pace of construction in Indian shipyards as well as the progressive decommissioning of older warships, as earlier reported by TOI.","The procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for the Navy will soon be placed before the defence acquisitions council.

During that conversation, Putin had agreed with Modi on the need for an ""uncompromising"" fight against terrorism and also stressed that the perpetrators and their backers had to be brought to justice.NSA Ajit Doval is also expected to visit Moscow for the 13th international meeting of high representatives for security issues on May 27-29 for which Russia has invited more than 150 countries.While Modi had twice visited Russia last year - first for the annual summit and later for Brics - Putin's upcoming visit will be his first to India since the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in Feb 2022. The summit this year will provide an opportunity for the leaders to review defence and security cooperation, facilitation of mutual energy security, ongoing cooperation to ramp up bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030 and use of national currencies for bilateral settlement.India wants to increase its supplies of goods to Russia for a more balanced trade relationship.The Modi-Putin summit was expected to take place early this year but Putin has remained preoccupied with the Ukraine war and ongoing international efforts to broker peace.

"Tej Pratap: Rebel without cause, felled by poll cause",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tej-pratap-rebel-without-cause-felled-by-poll-cause/articleshow/121398999.cms,"PATNA: In Bihar's complex political theatre, few figures are as erratic, unpredictable and, at times, bewildering as Tej Pratap Yadav , elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad . Once introduced as a rising heir to his father's legacy, Tej Pratap has evolved into a political liability, a family outcast, and, most curiously, a man whose personal whims have routinely overshadowed the party's agenda.This election year in Bihar, Tej Pratap has become the proverbial thorn in Lalu's side, a distraction the veteran socialist could no longer ignore. On Saturday, Tej Pratap again seized headlines, not for strategy or statesmanship, but for posting on social media about a new ""relation"" with a woman. The announcement was casual, dramatic and ambiguous, a pattern now familiar to those who have followed his journey over the past decade.While dynastic politics in the country often comes with high expectations, Tej Pratap never seemed to settle into the role. His early appearances as state health minister in 2015 - more notable for clumsy media interactions than policy achievements - left many wondering whether he was suited for public life at all. Reports of him consulting astrologers for state matters and allegedly bringing a cow into his ministerial bungalow for ""positive energy"" became tabloid fodder and marked the beginning of a reputation built more on eccentricity than governance.Tej Pratap's dramatic personal life has also been central to his public persona. His 2018 marriage to Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former CM Daroga Rai, was supposed to cement a powerful political alliance. Instead, it turned into a scandal. Within months, he filed for divorce, alleging domestic discord, while Aishwarya accused him of abuse and erratic behaviour.Family tensions spilled into public view as Lalu and Rabri Devi struggled to contain the fallout. In one infamous episode, Tej Pratap declared he was going on a pilgrimage to escape ""toxic atmosphere"" of home. His tantrums did not stop there. He often skipped key party events, launched public tirades against younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav , now firmly established as Lalu's political heir, and floated vague threats of forming his own political outfit.Saturday's post, just months before assembly elections, appears to be another in a long line of personal dramas staged in public view.In a rare but decisive step, Lalu Prasad finally acted. Tej Pratap was formally expelled from RJD and disowned by family. The message was clear - political survival trumps paternal indulgence.","Tej Pratap Yadav has evolved into a political liability, a family outcast, and a man whose personal whims have routinely overshadowed the party's agenda.

"In Chambal, ex-dacoits' wives turn water warriors to battle drought",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-chambal-ex-dacoits-wives-turn-water-warriors-to-battle-drought/articleshow/121398982.cms,"KARAULI (RAJASTHAN): Until about 15 years ago, Sampatti Devi and many women like her in Rajasthan's Karauli district lived in constant fear, dreading the day their husbands might not return home. Repeated droughts, driven in part by declining rainfall linked to climate change, had turned their lands barren. Water sources dried up, crippling agriculture and animal husbandry, the lifeblood of their livelihood.With no other way to survive, many men were forced into dacoity, hiding in jungles and risking their lives every day to evade police. Karauli's average annual rainfall dropped from 722.1mm (1951-2000) to 563.94mm (2001-2011), according to govt data. But in the 2010s, something remarkable happened. The women, weary of fear and despair, resolved to reclaim their lives. They convinced their husbands to come out of the jungles and give up arms.Together, they began reviving old, dried-up ponds and constructing new pokhars (water bodies) with the help of Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS), an Alwar-based NGO dedicated to water conservation since 1975. ""I would have been dead by now.She convinced me to come back and start farming again,"" recalled Jagdish, Sampatti's husband, now 58, who surrendered his weapons and chose peace.Pooling every penny earned over the years by selling milk, they built a pokhar at the base of a hill near their village, Alampur, in 2015-16. When the rains came, the pokhar was filled and for the first time in years, their family had enough water to sustain them for a longer period. ""Now, we grow mustard, wheat, pearl millet and vegetables,"" says Sampatti, sitting proudly on the pokhar's embankment. She even rents it out for water chestnut cultivation, earning about Rs 1 lakh each season.Over the years, TBS and the local community have together built 16 such pokhars in the forest surrounding the village and around 500 across district, each capturing runoff from the slopes, preventing droughts and floods. Karauli, once among Rajasthan's worst-hit dacoit areas, witnessed a transformation.The district is part of Chambal region, which extends across Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. It has historically been notorious for dacoity due to its rugged terrain, ravines and forests that provided hideouts for dacoits.""With community-led conservation efforts, stability is returning,"" said Karauli SP Brijesh Jyoti Upadhyay. He said rainfall in the region is erratic and leads to periods of both water scarcity and intense short-term downpours. ""Karauli faces droughts during dry times and flash floods when it rains heavily, like last year, when the monsoon brought over 1,900 mm of rain.""Sumit Dookia, an associate professor at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University & a native of Rajasthan, said the rocky terrain makes water run off quickly and stops it from soaking into the ground. ""With all this going on, smart water management is really important.""The wave of conservation in Karauli has transformed Serni, once a seasonal river, into a perennial one. Just a decade ago, the river would run dry after Diwali, leaving people desperate for water. ""Now, it holds water even at the peak of summer, thanks to around 150 water harvesting structures constructed along its entire length and breadth. The groundwater level has risen to just 5 to 10 feet below the surface,"" said TBS' Ranveer Singh.Forty years ago, he said, the river flowed all year round, but overuse and climate change had left it dry. With no options left, some men migrated to cities in search of work while others turned to mining or dacoity. ""Illegal mining exposed them to lethal silica dust, causing silicosis, a painful and incurable lung disease. Many did not live past 40,"" said Rajendra Singh, a Magsaysay Award and Stockholm Water Prize-winning water conservationist who leads TBS. A 2013 study by National Institute of Miners' Health found that 74% of surveyed sandstone workers in Karauli suffered from silicosis.Now, on a scorching May afternoon, water shimmers in Karauli's ponds and pokhars. Serni river flows gently, with children splashing and cattle grazing along its banks. ""A decade ago, no one would have imagined this. But our women made this possible!"" said Ranveer.","Until about 15 years ago, women in Rajasthan's Karauli district lived in constant fear, dreading the day their husbands might not return home.

""It is the need of society,"" he added.As presentations on seven best governance practices were made by CMs and deputy CMs, Modi suggested that a panel be set up to study them and how they could be integrated elsewhere.Sources said the PM asked leaders to avoid speaking out of turn, seen as an expression of disapproval in the backdrop of rows triggered by insensitive and contentious remarks made by members of the alliance following Operation Sindoor.

Kerala oil spill sparks fears of threat to marine species,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-oil-spill-sparks-fears-of-threat-to-marine-species/articleshow/121398968.cms,"KOCHI: The sinking of MSC ELSA 3 container ship in the Arabian Sea off Kochi's coast on Saturday will have serious ecological impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, principally fishing, experts said on Sunday.While a lot depends on the scale of leakage from the vessel carrying hazardous cargo of calcium carbide, diesel and furnace oil smothering can impact sensitive marine ecosystems, said Grinson George, director of Kochi-based Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI).""Oil smothering could threaten sensitive marine species and disrupt fishing activities, particularly affecting artisanal fishers in coastal regions. If the spill spreads, it may harm marine productivity, especially during the monsoon - a critical period for pelagic fish breeding and growth. This could have lasting consequences for fisheries,"" George said.Monsoon typically supports high marine productivity, George said, adding that much will depend on how the ship's leakage can be contained. To examine the impact, CMFRI will conduct field surveys, collect samples, and track the spill's movement.A study on the long-term impact of the very low sulfur fuel oil spill (VLSFO) from the site of Wakashio, a ship which sank off Mauritius in July 2020, shows contaminated sediments and mangroves. The study was published in Elsevier's Marine Pollution Bulletin recently, three years after the sinking. This was the world's first major spill of VLSFO since a global sulfur cap took effect from January 2020.Chemical analysis in March 2023 of sediment samples collected from mangroves close to the site of Wakashio's sinking confirmed biodegradation. The researchers have concluded that the mangroves differed in their sensitivity to oil, resulting in the more tolerant species obtaining a competitive advantage to recolonise other systems.In such cases, it is crucial to know locations of the spilled oil and monitor such sites with health checks on mangroves and associated plants and animals.","The sinking of MSC ELSA 3 container ship in the Arabian Sea off Kochi's coast on Saturday will have serious ecological impact on marine and coastal ecosystems.

NEW DELHI: Indian astronaut-designate Shubhanshu Shukla and three other crew members are headed into quarantine as launch preparations begin for the Axiom Mission-4 (Ax-4), which is scheduled to be launched on June 8 for the journey to the International Space Station. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch the Axiom-4 mission crew aboard a Dragon spacecraft to the ISS from the Kennedy Space Center in the US.The critical phase of quarantine ensures the four astronauts remain in optimal health, free from any infections that could jeopardise the mission.Before heading into isolation, Axiom Space employees gathered to celebrate the crew’s send-off, Shukla, who will pilot the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS, was oozing with confidence. While thanking Axiom-4 ground staff and technical team, astronaut-designate Shukla said, “Thank you so much for your contribution, I may not know you personally but I understand that it is each one of you that have contributed to this mission being a success and am sure it will be a success. ”Quarantine protocols are a vital part of pre-launch preparations, minimising any health risks that could impact the mission.

Once docked, the astronauts are scheduled to spend up to 14 days aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting a mission comprising science, outreach and commercial activities.Isro has shortlisted seven microgravity research experiments proposed by Indian principal investigators from various national R&D labs or academic institutions for implementation on ISS by the Indian astronaut. These include studying ‘water bears’ — micro animals — to understand how living things adapt to microgravity. According to Isro, the experience will nurture a microgravity research ecosystem back home, leading to the induction of advanced experiments that make up India’s space programme.Experience from the ISS mission will give momentum to India’s first human spaceflight programme ‘Gaganyaan’ and also future manned missions to space.","Indian astronaut-designate Shubhanshu Shukla and three other crew members are headed into quarantine.

Both Carney and Modi have committed to strengthening the partnership, but Modi's absence at the summit, if indeed Canada chooses to not invite him, will likely be seen as a missed opportunity.Modi has been invited for every G7 summit since 2019, when French President Emmanuel Macron invited him for the meeting in Biarritz.",Canada will host the leadership summit of the world's seven most economically advanced countries and the European Union from June 15-17.

A bold comeback that highlights her fearless style

Wayne Gretzky’s daughter, Paulina Gretzky , is once again stealing the spotlight — and not just because of her famous last name. The model and social media personality recently dropped jaws with a daring, stripped-down photoshoot that celebrates confidence, authenticity, and feminine power. Fans can’t stop talking about it, and for good reason.Paulina took to Instagram to unveil a new series of intimate photos shot by Miami-based photographer Isabella Lanaro. The shoot captures her posing in nothing but a pair of blue jeans, using only her arms to cover her chest. With loose beach waves styled by celebrity hairstylist Leah Caso and minimal makeup by Joanne Marchevsky, Paulina radiates effortless beauty and confidence. Her caption for the post was simple yet telling: “undone. ”The understated caption paired with the powerful visuals signals a shift in her public persona — one that embraces vulnerability as a form of strength. It's a continuation of the bold aesthetic she previously embraced in 2020 when she shared a similarly revealing photo with the caption: “Je t’aime St. Barts.”Though she’s been in the public eye for most of her life, Paulina has been candid about her journey toward self-acceptance.In a past interview with Kind Magazine, she opened up about the pressures of being constantly scrutinized and the turning point that helped her move past that.“I was stuck in this, ‘What is Paulina Gretzky going to do?’ But like, I don’t always know and it’s OK to not know—not many of us do—but at the same time, I like who I am—I love who I am—and I’m ready to venture out now,” she said.She also spoke to the emotional toll women face from societal judgment, especially from one another. “I feel like women can be our own harshest critics... but sometimes we do it to each other. I’ve learned over time that it’s OK to be upset. Let’s just process it in a healthy way.”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky stuns Instagram fans with bold topless photo and heartfelt support for husband Dustin Johnson With this recent shoot and her growing confidence, Paulina Gretzky is showing the world that she’s more than a celebrity daughter — she’s a woman reclaiming her identity and redefining beauty on her own terms.","Paulina Gretzky took to Instagram to unveil a new series of intimate photos shot by Miami-based photographer Isabella Lanaro.

Brett Favre implies he's being targeted because of his conservative politics

Documentary revisits scandals that reshaped Favre's post-NFL image

Critics question his legacy, but Favre doubles down

NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre is once again at the center of controversy—not for his past on-field glory, but for how he believes he’s being portrayed in the new Netflix documentary Untold: The Fall of Favre. The former Green Bay Packers quarterback has implied that the documentary’s critical tone is less about justice and more about politics, suggesting he's being singled out for his outspoken support of Donald Trump.While Favre hasn’t issued a direct statement about the documentary, his actions on social media are telling. He recently reposted two messages on X (formerly Twitter) that accuse Netflix of political bias, insinuating that the streaming giant is punishing him for backing Trump. Though Favre didn’t write the tweets himself, his amplification of them speaks volumes and aligns with a narrative that he is a victim of political targeting.The Fall of Favre explores two major controversies linked to the legendary quarterback: his alleged involvement in the $77 million Mississippi welfare fraud scandal, and sexual harassment claims from his brief tenure with the New York Jets. The documentary paints a sharp contrast between the public's image of Favre as the “everyman” quarterback and the less flattering reality of his legal and ethical troubles.One particularly damning detail is the $5 million that allegedly went toward constructing a volleyball stadium at the University of Southern Mississippi—Favre’s alma mater and the school where his daughter played. Text messages released in 2022 show Favre asking if the funding could be kept under wraps, fueling public suspicion. Though he hasn't been criminally charged, he remains involved in ongoing civil litigation.The documentary also revisits the sexting allegations brought by former sideline reporter Jenn Sterger, who accused Favre of sending unsolicited explicit content. The NFL fined him $50,000 for not cooperating with their investigation, though no formal action was taken on the allegations themselves.As The Fall of Favre garners attention, so does the political undertone of its reception. “Never meet your heroes,” one interviewee quips, capturing the disillusionment felt by many.Also Read: Tom Cruise leaves Pat McAfee stunned after comparing death-defying stunts to NFL quarterbacks' pressure and precision Favre, however, sees this as more than a reputation crisis—he sees it as political persecution. As the legal drama unfolds and the public reevaluates one of the NFL’s most iconic figures, the question remains: is this accountability, or a politically charged takedown?","Brett Favre implies he's being targeted because of his conservative politics.

Taylor Swift’s quiet date night with Travis Kelce in Palm Beach sparks concern amid Blake Lively drama

Travis Kelce trains hard while Taylor Swift seeks peace of mind

P op superstar Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce were spotted together on a subdued date night in Palm Beach, Florida, drawing both fan admiration and media speculation. The couple, usually vibrant and playful in public, appeared noticeably restrained as they exited Harry’s restaurant late Friday evening, marking one of their few public sightings this year.Observers noted Taylor Swift looked “a little down,” a contrast to her usual radiant demeanor. While she eventually relaxed over dinner—reportedly enjoying a glass of white wine and smiling while placing her order—the somber mood raised eyebrows. It’s a shift that many believe stems from recent personal upheaval involving longtime friend Blake Lively and actor Justin Baldoni.The typically private Swift was drawn into an unexpected legal conflict between Lively and Baldoni, a dispute that reportedly threatened to expose personal messages between the singer and the Gossip Girl actress. A subpoena issued earlier this month demanded Swift’s involvement, but it has since been withdrawn.Despite the legal resolution, the emotional strain seems to linger.According to reports, Baldoni’s legal team claimed that Lively had ""pressured Swift to publicly side with her,"" potentially putting their friendship—and Swift’s reputation—on the line. The singer, known for her meticulous control over her public image, remained silent throughout the ordeal, avoiding public comment and any legal entanglements that could compromise her privacy.While Swift takes time off from touring to recover emotionally and mentally, Kelce is taking a different approach to the offseason. The Kansas City Chiefs star has been laser-focused on fitness, reportedly shedding 25 pounds and undergoing grueling training sessions in Miami ahead of the team’s May 27 activities.“Travis Kelce confidently shows off his hairy back during an intense offseason workout session,” a headline teased, showcasing his transformation and commitment to a stronger 2025 season. After a tough Super Bowl loss to the Eagles in February, Kelce appears determined to bounce back.Also Read: “A lovely gentleman?”: Taylor Swift’s past praise for Diddy resurfaces as he faces sex trafficking indictment The couple’s dinner in West Palm Beach, though low-key, offered a glimpse into the contrasting worlds they currently occupy—Swift navigating emotional tension, and Kelce doubling down on football.

But one thing is clear: even in rare moments of calm, the spotlight continues to follow.","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were recently spotted on a quiet date in Palm Beach, Florida.

‘They lost Annabelle?’ Internet meltdown over haunted doll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-lost-annabelle-internet-meltdown-over-haunted-doll-heres-what-really-happened/articleshow/121392274.cms,"Annabelle doll (Screengrab from FB video posted by Ryan D. Buell.)

The haunted doll that terrifies millions

From horror icon to internet meme





The infamous Annabelle doll, known as one of the most feared haunted objects in the world, became the center of an internet firestorm in the past few days after social media users claimed it had mysteriously vanished during a paranormal tour in the US. The doll, currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit, reportedly wasn’t visible to visitors at a recent stop, sparking fears, conspiracy theories, and viral panic online.The speculation intensified after a fire broke out at the historic Nottoway Resort in White Castle, Louisiana- just days after Annabelle had been displayed in the state. While officials confirmed that no injuries occurred and dismissed any supernatural link to the blaze, social media users quickly pointed to the doll’s presence as a chilling coincidence.“So the streets are saying after they moved the Annabelle doll out of the Warren museum (when they explicitly said never to move it) she's now gone missing.” one user posted on X (formerly Twitter), echoing the sentiments of thousands who feared the worst. Another exclaimed, “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN THEY LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL??? ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED POSSESSIONS?? THAT ANNABELLE?""Despite the viral meltdown, the panic was short-lived.Dan Rivera of the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), which oversees the Warren Occult Museum’s collection, released a video showing the doll safe and sound in its protective glass case back in Connecticut.“Some wild and crazy internet rumours this morning claiming that we lost Annabelle. She/it is NOT lost,” read the caption alongside the video, posted by Ryan D. Buell.The Annabelle doll’s legend dates back to the 1970s, when it was reportedly given as a gift to a nurse in Hartford, Connecticut. What appeared to be a harmless Raggedy Ann doll soon exhibited disturbing behavior- moving on its own, leaving handwritten notes, and allegedly attacking one of the occupants.The case caught the attention of famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who concluded that the doll wasn’t possessed by a child’s spirit, but manipulated by a demonic entity. The Warrens took the doll into their care and placed it inside a sealed glass case in their Occult Museum, where it has remained under lock and key- until recently.Though the museum in Monroe, Connecticut, remains closed to the public, Annabelle is currently on a national tour, part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit. The event showcases haunted artifacts from the Warrens' collection and has drawn massive interest across the country. In May, the doll made headlines after appearing at the former Moundsville State Penitentiary in West Virginia- a notoriously haunted site. A video of the doll being moved into the penitentiary racked up over 9 million views on TikTok, reigniting public fascination with the paranormal.Annabelle’s legend exploded into the mainstream with the 2014 release of Annabelle, the horror film that spun off from The Conjuring franchise. The series has since grossed more than $800 million globally, turning the doll into a pop culture icon—and a consistent source of real-world fear.Following its West Virginia appearance, Annabelle’s tour has included stops in New Orleans and is scheduled to continue in San Antonio, Texas, and other cities, including locations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.In the meantime, whether the doll ever left the museum or whether the sightings were part of a promotional stunt remains unclear. What is certain, however, is that Annabelle continues to captivate and terrify the public imagination.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","The Annabelle doll is currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run’ exhibit.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""

Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way. Ema Matthews' unwavering dedication turned sacrifice into success, fueling Auston’s NHL dreams. Her story inspires countless families, proving love and grit can break barriers—even in a sport as costly as hockey.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL.

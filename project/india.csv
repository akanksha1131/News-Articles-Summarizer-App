CEASEFIRE: India Pakistan Stop Firing After 3 Days of Standoff | Operation Sindoor |

Here's what happened after the ceasefire

Just hours after the ceasefire agreement, J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned the truce deal as Srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on Saturday evening. “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!! This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up,” Abdullah posted on X.

questioned the truce deal as Srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on Saturday evening. “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!! This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up,” Abdullah posted on X. Earlier, the US had taken credit for the ceasefire, as according to CNN, it had been told that it was Vice President JD Vance who finally called Prime Minister Modi ""at noon Eastern time on Friday"" to urge him to get India to talk directly to Pakistan ""to consider options available for de-escalation"". According to CNN, the officials said Vance first took the intelligence to Trump and then called PM Modi to tell him that the US believed that if hostilities continued over the weekend, there was ""a high probability of a dramatic escalation"".

Sirens blared and explosions echoed across border states on Saturday evening as Pakistan once again launched drones into Indian airspace. Loud blasts were reported in Srinagar, while air raid sirens went off in Udhampur and other parts of the Jammu region.

Blackouts were enforced in several areas across Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Rajasthan as a precaution amid what marks another Pakistani drone intrusion in a series of nighttime provocations.

An alert sentry at Nagrota Military Station thwarted a possible intrusion with timely action, triggering a brief exchange of fire and sustaining minor injuries, the Army's White Knight Corps said. A search operation was also launched for the suspect.

Foreign secretary Vikram Misri held a press briefing after the ceasefire violation and said: "" For the last few hours, this understanding is being violated by Pakistan. The Indian Army is retaliating and dealing with this border intrusion. This intrusion is extremely condemnable and Pakistan is responsible for it. We believe that Pakistan should understand this situation properly and take appropriate action immediately to stop this intrusion.""

Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with Indian National Security Advisor Doval. As per Chinese foreign ministry, ""Doval said that the Pahalgam terrorist attack caused serious casualties among Indian personnel and that India needed to take counter-terrorism actions. War was not India's choice and was not in the interests of any party. India and Pakistan would be committed to a ceasefire and look forward to restoring regional peace and stability as soon as possible.""

as soon as possible."" External affairs minister Jaishankar said after the ceasefire that India and Pakistan had reached an understanding to stop ""firing and military action."" He further reiterated New Delhi's ""uncompromising stance"" against terrorism in all its forms.

After the ceasefire violation, the government gave the Indian armed forces instructions to deal strongly with any instances of repetition of the violations along the LoC and international border.

Amritsar was placed under a red alert early Sunday morning following heightened security concerns, with district authorities urging residents to remain indoors. The situation in Jammu city remained normal on Sunday, a day after intense shelling from Pakistan. No drones, firing and shelling were reported during the intervening night of May 10-11. The situation was also normal in Poonch area after no drones, firing and shelling were reported during the night.

India's BIG ULTIMATUM As Pakistan Army Violates Ceasefire; Vows 'Strong Response' | FULL

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan agreed to an immediate ceasefire on Saturday, following a sharp escalation in cross-border tensions triggered by the deadly April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pahalgam.The breakthrough came after what the US President Donald Trump called ""intense diplomatic engagement"" over the past two days.The tension began when Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians in Pahalgam.In retaliation, India launched ' Operation Sindoor ' on May 7, carrying out precision strikes on nine terror camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK).Pakistan responded with drone attacks targeting areas in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. These attacks were intercepted by Indian defence systems but raised fears of a broader conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Amid growing concern, the United States played a key role in de-escalating the situation. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said he and Vice President JD Vance held discussions with senior officials from both countries. Rubio also commended PM Modi and Pakistan for choosing dialogue over confrontation.However, just a few hours after the ceasefire declaration, violation was witnessed by Pakistan in Srinagar and other border areas.Before the ceasefire was announced, India, in a drastic revision of its security doctrine, Saturday declared that it would from now on consider every instance of terrorism directed against it as an ""act of war"" and would respond accordingly.Sources explained that the decision considerably lowers the threshold for India to give full-scale military response to attacks orchestrated from across the border. Although India responded militarily to terrorist attacks in Uri in 2016, Pulwama in 2019 and, most recently, Pahalgam by exercising the military option, the decision on Saturday bakes the new security posture into a doctrine.","India and Pakistan agreed to an immediate ceasefire on Saturday, following a sharp escalation in cross-border tensions triggered by the deadly April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: From Chennai to Patna, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has initiated a series of actions against bureaucrats and middlemen allegedly involved in taking bribes for influencing award of govt contracts.In one case, the agency Friday carried out searches at 16 locations in Chennai associated with various state officials and middlemen in connection with irregularities in award of govt contracts in Tamil Nadu.Around Rs 5 crore was seized during the searches.""The searches unearthed a deep-rooted and systemic corruption network involving prominent consultants across key govt departments. Evidence reveals that consultants/brokers acted as middlemen, floated shell companies and consultancy firms through which kickbacks were routed under the guise of service fees and consultancy payments,"" ED said.In another case related to irregularities in procurement of medical items in Patna Medical College and Hospital, ED attached 10 properties and other assets worth Rs 3 crore of various suppliers in Greater Noida, Patna and Darbhanga. The attachment in this case has exceeded Rs 6 crore, with over Rs 3 crore of assets attached earlier.PMCH case relates to procurement of medicines, reagents, machines and equipment at exorbitant rates and in higher quantities. Former PMCH superintendent OP Choudhary is one of the accused in the case. The alleged irregularities were committed during 2008-10.ED said the total irregularities and loss to govt has been estimated to be over Rs 12 crore. Bihar vigilance department has also filed a case and chargesheet against the accused persons.In the Chennai case, ED conducted searches in Chennai and Vellore on May 6 at 16 at premises associated with certain officers and prominent consultants engaged with Tamil Nadu govt departments.ED's money laundering case is based on an FIR by state vigilance department that had booked S Pandian, superintendent in the state's environment department, and others in an alleged disproportionate assets case.The agency claimed the web of corruption was found to operate through fixed commissions paid to officials for obtaining illegal and expedited clearances.ED said its investigation in the Chennai case has ""confirmed the role of key consultants: Prabhakar Sigamony, AK Nathan, Naveen Kumar, Santhosh Kumar and Vinoth Kumar, in facilitating illegal approvals"". Unaccounted cash of Rs 4.7 crore, intended for bribe payments, was seized during the searches, it added."," Enforcement Directorate (ED) has initiated a series of actions against bureaucrats and middlemen allegedly involved in taking bribes for influencing award of govt contracts.

'India saw 9.3% excess deaths during first 2 Covid years': Government sources,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-saw-9-3-excess-deaths-during-first-2-covid-years-government-sources/articleshow/121071073.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India recorded 9.3% 'excess deaths' in 2020-21, the first two years of Covid-19 pandemic, government sources said on Saturday referring to the latest Civil Registration System (CRS) data.Excess deaths, which refer to additional deaths from any cause observed during these years, over and above the expected fatalities in the absence of pandemic, was much higher in other high- and middle-income countries, govt sources said.""US reported 17.6% more deaths than expected in 2020-21 while Italy and UK reported 11.8% excess deaths and Russia reported 29.9% such deaths. France, Germany and Canada reported 6.7%, 5.3% and 5.2% excess deaths. Among the middle-income countries, Mexico had 43.6% excess mortality while Brazil had 12.6% excess mortality,"" they added.In the past, reports of exorbitantly high excess deaths in India during 2020 and 2021, based on modelling methodology, have emerged in public domain. A WHO report estimated India's excess deaths at 47 lakh. Another report in a top journal cited a figure of about 41 lakh excess deaths in this period. Some experts also suggested that the excess deaths were essentially caused Covid-19 and that Indian govt played them down.Govt sources said excess deaths in these years are not equal to deaths caused due to Covid. It includes reported Covid deaths (4.81 lakh by the end of 2021), unreported Covid-19 deaths, deaths due to all other causes, and possible indirect effects of Covid-19, they said.Officials from health ministry said the number of deaths documented in CRS has been increasing over time, even in the years preceding Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. The annual increment observed each year, compared to the previous year, has varied from 1.3% in 2016 to 9.9% in 2019, with the average increase over three preceding years (2016 to 2019) estimated at 6.4% per annum. ""Our teams conducted preliminary analyses of CRS data to assess cumulative excess deaths in the years 2020 and 2021,"" said an official. He added that based on the three-year (2016-19) annual rate of increase of 6.4% mentioned above, the expected number of deaths would be 81,31,869 in 2020 and 86,54,185 in 2021. However, the observed deaths were 81,15,882 in 2020 and 1,02,24,506 in 2021.""The excess deaths, defined as observed minus expected deaths, were (-)15,987 and 15,70,321, respectively,"" said the official. ""Thus, the total excess deaths over the two-year period amounted to 15,54,334. As a percentage, this is 9.3% higher than the expected deaths. This translates into about 1,249 excess deaths per one million population,"" he added.",Excess deaths refer to additional deaths from any cause observed during these years.

"Behind the scenes of ceasefire: Calls from Pakistan, Washington",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/behind-the-scenes-of-ceasefire-calls-from-pakistan-washington/articleshow/121068548.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: It was shortly after 9am that India’s director general of military operations , Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, got a call on the hotline from his Pakistani counterpart Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah.Abdullah sounded Ghai out on a ceasefire and, it is learned, referred to the conversation US secretary of state Marco Rubio had with Pakistan Army chief Gen Asim Munir, in a clear indication that the feelers were coming from his boss.Ghai briefed his bosses on the development but got no instruction from them to engage with Abdullah.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri made no mention of the contact made by Pakistan in the media briefing he held at 10.50am, where he disclosed the losses that IAF had inflicted on Pakistan’s airbases. IAF had stepped up attacks by the time Rubio called foreign minister S Jaishankar around 11am.In fact, IAF kept pressing on the escalation pedal after the conversation with Jaishankar where the latter, going by his post on X, appears to have maintained that ""India's approach has always been measured and responsible and remains so"".If Rubio had insisted on immediate de-escalation, his pitch certainly did not have much resonance at the meeting PM Modi held with defence minister Rajnath Singh, NSA A K Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Anil Chauhan and the three service chiefs - Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Adm Dinesh Tripathi and Air Chief Marshal AP Singh - and chiefs of IB and RAW, Tapan Deka and Ravi Sinha.Sources said the participants were unanimous on consolidating the upper hand that India had - something that was acknowledged also by Pakistan when it reached out for ceasing hostilities.The meeting also took into account the advantages India would have had going forward: high morale of forces, adequate firepower, comfortable fiscal situation, international sympathy and the ace in the form of 'blue water' Indian Navy.No wonder, when India and Pakistan reached an understanding just a couple of hours later, it came as a surprise to many who scrambled to find clues to the sudden turn.CNN cited defence sources to say it was US vice-president J D Vance's call to Modi on Friday where he shared US intelligence about Pakistan's plans for a dangerous escalation: perhaps shorthand for use of nukes, which made India relent.But that also seemed to be an inadequate explanation. For one, Pakistan has always talked brazenly about its willingness to use its nukes. For another, India had steadily moved higher on the escalation ladder for the full 24 hours after Vance's purported counsel. In fact, it had on Saturday mocked Pakistan when it called a meeting of the National Command Authority, the body which deals with its nuclear arsenal, only to call it off.The absence of any response on the pause in hostilities from Modi, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, even BJP, only deepened the puzzle.",Abdullah sounded Ghai out on a ceasefire and referred to conversation US secretary of state Marco Rubio had with Pakistan Army chief Gen Asim Munir.

This came even as the opposition party has offered its support to the government in its efforts against terrorism after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people on April 22.""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India,"" Tharoor said in a post on X. BJP posted a video on X criticising the UPA regime for its ""passivity"" and calling it out on its ""futile peace talks"" with Pakistan.""The message to the enemies is loud and clear. Don't mess with us! Unlike the UPA regime’s passivity, New India has no patience for futile peace talks,"" it said.Tharoor's reaction comes at a time when his appreciation for the Modi-government in certain foreign policies made headlines fueling rumours of rift with the grand old party. BJP leader Amit Malviya even took a jibe at him calling him PM Modi's fan after he sided with the current government's stance on Russia-Ukraine policy. ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters… Old ones are turning into his fans,"" Malviya had said.Additionally, his presence at Vizhinjam port inauguration and sharing stage with PM Modi gained attention after the prime minister said that the event would give ""sleepless nights to several people"" taking a jibe at INDIA bloc.However, BJP leader CR Kesavan criticised Congress saying, ""We salute the exemplary courage and unparalleled commitment of our brave armed forces in decisively defeating the cowardly attacks of Pakistan on Bharat and our civilians...But unfortunately, the poisonous political propaganda of the Congress Party and their noxious fake narratives have now been weaponised by the enemy state of Pakistan...After Operation Sindoor commenced, Udit Raj of the Congress Party gave the name Operation Sindoor a communal colour. So the Congress Party is failing the nation again and again. It's high time they stop politicising the army and stop their fake factory of false narratives...""Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have agreed to stop the military action against each other with the former categorically maintaining ""a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations"".""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action.

NEW DELHI: Before the pause in hostilities on Saturday evening, cross-border combat had rapidly moved up the escalation ladder with India strongly striking back at Pakistan by targeting nine airbases and two radar sites to inflict heavy damage in the early hours of the day.The operational situation seemed to be flaring up once again barely two hours after the cessation of hostilities at 5pm, with multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistan and air intrusions by its drones being reported from all along the western front.Senior officers, however, stressed that ""all major military actions"" have stopped from either side, though it may take some time for things to settle down on the ground amid the surcharged tensions between the rival forces.""As decided, Indian DGMO Lt-General Rajiv Ghai will talk to his Pakistani counterpart Major General Kashif Abdullah on Monday to work out the nuts and bolts of the truce,"" a senior officer said.The exchange of fire and shelling along the 778-km Line of Control petered out later in the night after taking place at multiple locations like Akhnoor, Nowshera, Poonch, Rajouri, Jammu, RS Pura, Arnia and Kathua in the evening.Some of the drones spotted at different locations in J&K, Rajasthan and Gujarat were taken down, while the rest flew back. ""There is no firing happening along the LoC now,"" an officer said.In the early hours of Saturday, India's swift and calibrated precision attacks came after Pakistan deployed fighters like F-16s and JF-17s, high-speed missiles like Fatah, armed drones and loitering munitions against Indian military bases at over 26 locations under its Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos (Iron Wall).With Pakistan firing several missiles at different airbases, India accepted it sustained ""limited damage to equipment and personnel"" at IAF bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj. Pakistan, however, has suffered ""very heavy and unsustainable losses"" after Operation Sindoor was launched in the early hours of May 7.India's hit-back was particularly severe. Long-range weapons fired by IAF fighters caused extensive damage to crucial Pakistani airbases like Skardu, Jacobabad, Bholari and Rahim Yar Khan, with deep craters being formed on their runways.The other airbases to be targeted were Rafiqui, Murid, Nur Khan-Chaklala, Sukkur and Chunian as well as radar sites at the Pasrur and Sialkot aviation bases. The weapons used included BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Crystal Maze-2 missiles, Scalp air-to-ground cruise missiles, Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions and Spice-2000 precision-guided bombs.""In addition, the loss of air defence weapon systems and radars made the defence of Pakistani airspace untenable,"" Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said. Colonel Sofia Qureshi, in turn, said there was also ""extensive and precise damage"" to military infrastructure, command control centres, and logistical installations across the LoC.The officials did not take questions about how many fighters India had lost during the high-tempo Operation Sindoor, nor were the number of casualties given.They, however, warned Pakistan to cease and desist. ""Every misadventure by Pakistan has been met with strength. Every future escalation will invite a decisive response. We remain fully operationally, ready to launch whatever may be required in the nation's defence,"" Commodore Raghu R Nair said, after the truce was announced.The military officers also slammed Pakistan for a ""malicious misinformation campaign"" with ""totally false"" claims of destruction of an Indian S-400 air defence system in Adampur, the BrahMos missile base in Nagrota and the Suratgarh and Sirsa airfields, among others.""Pakistan also made false allegations that the Indian Army had damaged mosques. I want to make it very clear that India is a secular nation and our Army is a very beautiful reflection of the constitutional values of India,"" Col Qureshi said.","Pakistan and India have agreed to a truce after days of cross-border combat.

NEW DELHI: India's Operation Sindoor, conducted on the night of May 6 and 7, resulted in the elimination of around a dozen high-value terrorists in Pakistan, including IC-814 hijacker Yusuf Azhar , chief of Lashkar's Muridke headquarters Abu Jundal aka Mudassar, and the son of the 2016 Nagrota attack plotter.Sources termed the deaths of the jihadi commanders as a severe setback to Pakistan's military-terror nexus, adding that fresh estimates show that at least 130-140 terrrorists were killed in the strikes India launched to avenge Pahalgam killings.The precision strikes also exposed the thin veil that had been long placed between the Pakistani govt and its terror proxies with the funerals of jihadi A-listers being attended by the military-political establishment.Mudassar, the head of LeT's headquarters at Muridike and one of the most notorious figures among the killed, received a guard of honour by Pakistan army at his funeral.Indian intelligence has gathered video evidence, which prove that a wreath was laid on behalf of Pak army chief Asim Munir and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz. ""His funeral prayer was held in a govt school. A serving Lt General of Pakistan army and IG of Punjab Police attended the prayer,"" a senior intelligence officer said.Another high-value target was Yusuf Azhar, who went by the alias of Ustad and was a wanted man with an Interpol Red Notice. He was a brother-in-law of Maulana Masood Azhar, who had covertly entered India using a fake passport arranged by his handler Abdul Latif, prior to the 1998 Kandahar hijacking.India had formally requested Pakistan to take action against him, listing him as a wanted terrorist in 2002. However, he had continued to operate from Jaish-e-Mohammed 's Markaz Subhan Allah at Bahawalpur, which was destroyed in the strikes. Masood Azhar's eldest brother-in-law Hafiz Muhammed Jameel was also killed in the strikes, sources confirmed. He was in charge of the Markaz at Bahawalpur.The other high-value target was Abu Akasha alias Khalid, affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba . He was involved in multiple terrorist attacks in J&K and was engaged in weapons smuggling from Afghanistan, sources said. ""His funeral was held in Faisalabad and attended by senior Pakistani army officials and deputy commissioner of Faisalabad,"" said a senior officer.The Indian surgical strike also resulted in the elimination of Jaish's Mohammad Hassan Khan, son of Mufti Asghar Khan Kashmiri, operational commander of JeM in POK. He played a key role in coordinating terrorist attacks in J&K, including the Nagrota attack.""This time, the message was loud and clear: India knows where to find the perpetrators of heinous attacks, from Parliament in 2001 to the Pahalgam attack. The carefully drawn list of targets effectively communicated that India can strike at will, settling a two-decade-old score,"" the officer added.The biggest outcome of Operation Sindoor was the destruction of Muridke and Bahawalpur - terror sanctuaries that thrived for decades.Markaz Subhan Allah, JeM's primary hub for training and indoctrination of jihadis, was spread across 15 acres. It was here that Maulana Masood Azhar had resurfaced on Nov 30, 2024, addressing cadres for the first time in two years. His speech reiterated anti-India rhetoric, vowing revenge for construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.Over a dozen major terror strikes, including the 2019 Pulwama attack, were planned here. The perpetrators of the Pulwama attack had even trained at this facility, which was home to over 600 cadres and hosted regular training sessions for JeM members.India had dealt the first major blow to the Pak-sponsored terror factories in 2019 by bombing terror camps at Balakot, regarded as the 'first launchpad for jihad'.","India's Operation Sindoor, conducted on the night of May 6 and 7, resulted in the elimination of around a dozen high-value terrorists in Pakistan.

Srinagar: While India and Pakistan agreed to a pause in firing and military action, with no mention of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) which India has put in abeyance, two gates of the Baglihar dam were thrown open on Saturday, causing Chenab River to swell.Sources said two gates of the dam remained open from around 8.30am till 4.30pm. The gates were opened to regulate rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region on Friday.The IWT gives India exclusive rights to use the waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - and their tributaries, before they enter Pakistan, while the latter secured rights over the waters of the western rivers - Chenab, Jhelum and Indus.Following the Pahalgam terror attack, India put the treaty in abeyance.On May 3, National Conference president and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir , Farooq Abdullah , said his party had consistently opposed the IWT as it was harming the interests of J&K, and asserted that it was time to divert Chenab water to Jammu and harness power from the Jhelum in Kashmir. ""We have been saying for a long time that this treaty has to be reviewed,"" he added.NC has maintained that the IWT gave away the rights over the rivers to Pakistan without consulting J&K, and the treaty should be re-looked.In March 2003, J&K legislative council had adopted a resolution moved by NC, then in opposition, asking the Union govt to review the IWT with a view to safeguarding the interests of the UT (then a state). In 2011, Omar Abdullah, as the then CM, had asked compensation from the central govt on account of losses incurred by the State due to the IWT. In 2010, J&K government had accorded sanction to engage a consultant to quantify the losses suffered by J&K because of the treaty.","Two gates of the Baglihar dam were thrown open on Saturday, causing Chenab River to swell.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday dismissed claims that the pause in hostilities between India and Pakistan was driven by US pressure , emphasising that the agreement was firmly on New Delhi's terms. Contrasting the current understanding with past instances where India lost strategic advantages, the party credited the govt for rewriting the narrative.Citing India's new ' war doctrine ' that any act of terror will be treated as an 'act of war' against India, a BJP neta said only the US and Israel had comparable doctrines, marking India's assertive global stance.The functionary also highlighted India's leverage over the Indus Waters Treaty , which remains unaffected by the current India-Pakistan border understanding. Notably, World Bank, once a guarantor, has distanced itself from the treaty, strengthening India's position.""India is a rising economic power , while Pakistan is a struggling state. Our focus is the welfare of 140 crore Indians, not wasting time on a delinquent jihadi state,"" the BJP neta said. BJP contrasted the current pause in hostilities with historical agreements where India ceded advantages. The 1949 ceasefire, based on the Karachi Agreement, followed US-brokered talks and UN monitoring.The 1965 war ended with the Tashkent Declaration, mediated by the Soviet Union and the US, forcing India to return hard-won territories. The 1971 war, despite Pakistan's surrender, led to the Simla Agreement under Moscow's and Washington's influence. India released 99,000 prisoners without securing strategic gains, such as Pakistan vacating POK or formalising borders.The Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) operation in Sri Lanka (1987-1990) drained resources and ended in withdrawal, costing the life of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. Similarly, the 1999 Kargil war ceasefire, facilitated by the Clinton administration, saw India halt its offensive just as victory was in sight, missing a tactical opportunity.BJP said the current pause in hostilities reflected New Delhi's terms, prioritising national security and economic progress while maintaining strategic leverage. This approach, the party argued, ensured India's rise as a global power, unburdened by past concessions or external pressures.",BJP says pause in hostilities reflects New Delhi's terms.

NEW DELHI: When India struck terror facilities hard in Pakistan on Wednesday, for many the act underlined the govt's seriousness of response to the heinous Pahalgam massacre on April 22. Since then, as the Army continued to display the same intensity of intent, both in its offensive and defensive manoeuvres, the public mood on social media platforms largely favoured a military action strong enough to guarantee a deterrent both for terrorists and their handlers.In this prevailing ambience, the Saturday announcement that pauses the raging conflict has been lauded by some but also seen by others as letting Pakistan off the hook.Foreign affairs analyst Brahma Chellaney wondered on X, ""Does this mean that Prime Minister Modi has decided not to take ' Operation Sindoor ' to its logical conclusion by ending, once and for all, the Pakistani military generals' four-decade-long strategy of waging a 'war of a thousand cuts' against India through terrorist proxies?""In a detailed post issued shortly later, he said, ""Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory has long been an Indian political tradition"", and gave examples of India erring in similar fashion against both China and Pakistan over the decades.Chellaney said that India agreed to a ceasefire against Pakistan in 1948 when the Army was marching toward victory. Again, in 1972, at Shimla, India gave away its 1971 ""war gains at the negotiating table without securing anything in return from Pakistan.""True Indology, a pro-right handle with over 330,000 followers, blamed the US for allegedly denying India the triumph it deserved. ""A very well-deserved victory of the Indian army has been neutralized by cheap US politics. Ultimately, Pakistan will continue to exist. It is only a matter of time before Pakistan launches terror attacks into India. This is very disappointing as all our sacrifices resulted in nothing once again. Not an inch of the land illegally occupied by Pakistan has been gained. The dagger to stab India's back has been protected once more.""However, columnist Amrita Bhinder, whose followers include PM Modi, read the announcement as an ""inking"" of India's stance. ""New beginnings. War can be won in so many different ways. The 'right wing' guys (Trump-Modi) have shifted the war from bloodshed to trade. Money talks. India gets to grow economically. Pakistan has to worry about water.""Rishi Bagree, who has nearly five lakh followers on X and has been backing the govt during the conflict, listed what he felt were India's gains. ""1. Took revenge of (sic) Pahalgam by hitting 24 terror targets deep inside Pakistan. 2. Destroyed (sic) their 7 Air bases 3.

You mean after Osama, Pakistan has again been exposed for its terror links?

What do you say about Congress’s stand on the post-Pahalgam situation?

Is there a shift in Congress’s stand?

How do you see the whole situation as an army man?

Why did Congress take the decision to pause its political activities?

Congress leader and Territorial Army officer Sachin Pilot said Osama bin Laden was found hiding in a Pakistan military town and India has again exposed Pakistan as a country that harbours terror.He toldthat India has done what needed to be done post-Pahalgam, and Congress stands firmly with the govt and the armed forces.The valour and bravery of the Indian armed forces is second to none, and Pakistan has got a befitting reply to the misadventure they conducted in Pahalgam. The brutal killings of innocent tourists was intolerable. India has responded adequately, the attack on terror infrastructure was imminent, it had to be done. The Indian armed forces have done an exemplary job of avoiding civilian casualties and targeting those areas and individuals who have always propagated terror in India.We should not forget that it was Pakistan that gave a safe haven to Osama bin Laden, and that too in Abbottabad, which is a military station. It shows that the Pakistan military was involved in protecting Osama. In fact, all the known terrorists, like Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed, have been associated with the State of Pakistan. Now, Pakistan is calling for a fair inquiry, but inquiry into the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks clearly showed that Pakistan was directly involved in those attacks.Pakistan has been directly involved in all terror attacks that have taken place in India in the last 20 years. That is why Pakistan is in the UN watch list of nations harbouring terror. Pakistan has to be taught a lesson and I think time has come to eradicate terror from its root. Pakistan cannot conduct these barbaric atrocities on Indian soil any more.It is well documented and world acknowledges it. Senior Pakistani ministers have said for decades that Pakistan used terror as a state policy and harboured and nurtured terror camps. It is beyond doubt. That is why Pakistan has not got any support from any major player in the world.The day the Pahalgam terror attack happened, the Congress president immediately announced that Congress, as the principal opposition party, stood with the govt in any adequate response that needed to be given to Pakistan. The Congress Working Committee passed a unanimous resolution supporting the govt. Rahul Gandhi said the same. Whatever our differing political opinions and ideologies within, when it comes to the nation and to countering Pakistani terror, we are united. The 1.4 billion people support the action taken by the armed forces.There are no two views on the issue. Let’s not forget that when Indira Gandhi as PM was forced into a corner and a war had to be waged to break Pakistan into two parts and Bangladesh was created, entire country, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, supported her actions. When Parliament was attacked on Dec 13, Sonia Gandhi as leader of opposition told PM Vajpayee on the floor of the house that entire Congress and opposition was with him in giving Pakistan a befitting reply. The same tradition continues. Whether Congress is in govt or opposition, we always have the policy of ‘nation first’ and zero tolerance on terror. It is Congress that has lost its leaders to terror, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. We know how to fight terror. We are on the frontlines of fighting terror. And, Indian security, life of its citizens, is far more important that any other political issue or ideology.There is a general concern about escalation.Look. What was needed to be done has been done and now we have to wait and watch how the situation develops. There is a flood of good and bad information in the public domain. The all-party meeting has happened. Some information cannot be divulged in national interest, and I, too, won’t comment on it. But the Indian people are behind the govt and the armed forces in fighting terror. We have never tried to disturb any country but when faced with a challenge, we fight with full force. Whatever the consequences, terror has to be rooted out from Pakistani terrain. The entire world supports India and Congress stands with the armed forces.Besides being a politician, I do serve in the Territorial Army, and I could not be more proud of what our defence forces have done over last 70 years and continue to do. We owe a large debt to all those in uniform. The armed forces have shown that they are second to none. The technology, bravery and precision involved in the way the army conducted these operations shows that it is a world class organisation. We are best not just in tech and equipment but also in morale and love for the motherland.Because this is a tense moment for all of us and there is action on the border. As a party, we suspended our political activities for the moment in support of our armed forces and also for families who have sent their young ones to the border.","Sachin Pilot: India has done what needed to be done post-Pahalgam. Pakistan has been directly involved in all terror attacks that have taken place in India in the last 20 years, he says. Pilot: Pakistan has to be taught a lesson and I think time has come to eradicate terror from its root.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121068945,imgsize-883649,width-400,resizemode-4/article-88.jpg"

LONDON: Sky News has traced social media accounts expressing support for jihadist terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and al-Qaida to the exact location of the building in Muridke, Pakistan, which was struck by India last week in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack .A Sky News forensics and data team geolocated to Markaz Taiba in Muridke multiple videos on TikTok, YouTube and Google which express support for the LeT and ""313"", referring to the 313 Brigade , al-Qaida's military wing in Pakistan.The videos were posted before India blew the complex up last week. The channel confirmed the video locations using satellite imagery in and around the complex.According to Stanford University's mapping militants project, members of 313 Brigade include Taliban and allied jihadist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammed . 313 Brigade has been behind many high-profile attacks and bombings inside Pakistan.Captions, hashtags and usernames posting these videos express support for either or both the LeT and ""313"". One video shows a man with a gun and the username states: ""Lashkar Taiba - Markaz Taiba Muridke - 313 Bhai Group - Mujahid Force PK"".A TikTok video with the text ""313"" is captioned ""bring your arms and ammunition and go to war"".Muskan Sangwan, senior intelligence analyst at TRAC, a terrorism research consortium, said: ""These young men posing with rifles are using 313 label as a badge for jihadist identity,"" which, she said, would help with recruitment.One video with the hashtag ""313 jihad"" shows children practising sword-fighting inside the mosque, with the caption ""We are little soldiers, and we fight the non-believers"". The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) told Sky News: ""It has been known for decades that LeT has its headquarters in Muridke.""Pakistan-based Resistance Front, an LeT proxy, initially claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack. Khawaja Asif, Pakistan's defence minister, said: ""This appears to be a random video with background music added later - consistent with how TikTok trends often function. If this is to be considered credible evidence, we could produce millions of similar clips ourselves."" Any suggestion that the mosque was used as a base by terrorists was a ""completely false social media made up hoax,"" he added.","Sky News traced social media accounts expressing support for jihadist terrorist groups to the exact location of the building in Muridke, Pakistan.

JAISALMER\CHANDIGARH: Multiple missiles and drones launched from Pakistan were intercepted and destroyed by Indian forces in Jaisalmer, Barmer and other Rajasthan districts Saturday.Many spots in Punjab's Ferozepur, Bathinda, Jalandhar and Amritsar reported damage to homes and farms as debris from weapons lay strewn around.The attacks, which began late Friday night and continued until noon Saturday, occurred just hours before a pause in fighting was announced Saturday evening.Unconfirmed reports suggested some damage to Pathankot airbase in Punjab, though authorities remained tight-lipped on the matter.In Rajasthan, residents across multiple districts reported loud explosions and bright flashes throughout Friday-Saturday night.

Jodhpur range IG Vikas Kumar confirmed the attack, saying the area was secured by Army and Air Force personnel soon after.The impact was particularly hard on Jaisalmer's Bhagu village, where a missile created a 10ft wide and 2ft deep crater around 4:30am Saturday. Similar attacks were reported near Jamla village, where missile debris damaged local fencing as well as a house, though no casualties were reported.In the high-security Pokhran region of Jaisalmer district, missile parts were strewn at four different locations, including areas near Veermdevra and Ugras villages in Ramdeora area. Weapon debris was also found scattered near Dhadu village, in addition to Sankra and Mandwa areas.Throughout the Pakistani offensives, district administrations maintained high alert, with sirens blaring through the night. While no significant damage or casualties were reported, the attacks created an atmosphere of chaos among residents.Indian armed forces successfully intercepted all incoming threats, demonstrating their preparedness in protecting border areas.In Punjab's Ferozepur, Pakistani drones hit private properties in several areas, with the objects falling in fields, causing craters and damaging crops. In Jallupur Khera village of Amritsar, cracks appeared in a building, possibly after being hit by a drone.In Jalandhar's Adampur, possible drone debris were strewn across fields in Alwalpur Kureshian, Mahadipur, and Isharwal Dhandor Chak villages. Adampur MLA Sukhwinder Singh Kotli, who visited all the sites, said that except for one village, the debris did not cause any damage as they fell in open fields.","Residents in Rajasthan reported loud explosions and bright flashes throughout Friday-Saturday night.

Booze-related health problems spiked in AP from 2019 to 2024: Data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/booze-related-health-problems-spiked-in-ap-from-2019-to-2024-data/articleshow/121066692.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Liver and kidney problems induced by alcohol consumption went up manifold in Andhra Pradesh between 2019 and 2024, a study by the state's health department has found, with the period under question coinciding with the YSRCP regime that is also facing charges of a massive ""liquor scam"".Studying the admissions under the Arogyasri scheme for free treatment to patients between 2014 and 2024, a three-doctor team set up by the health department found that alcohol-associated liver patients went up from 14,026 in 2014-19 to 29,369 in 2019-24.The worst affected were people in the 35-44 years age group - the number of patients in this category shot up from 4,419 to 9,362 during the two five-year periods, a startling 100% increase.Similarly, alcohol-related neurological patients shot up from 1,276 to 12,663 between 2014-19 and 2019-24, with the younger segment (35-44 years age group) being the worst hit - the number of patients in this segment rose from 260 to 2,882, a 1000% increase.Following the same pattern, alcohol-related kidney patients rose from 49,060 to 90,385, an 84% increase.While the jump in the number of patients associated with alcohol consumption would have been just a health problem, the backdrop of the alleged ""liquor scam"" during the Jaganmohan Reddy govt has added a political dimension to the medical woes of locals. The spike overlapped the change of govt in AP, and now, the comparative study of health department under the TDP govt indicts the previous YSRCP dispensation.Speaking with TOI, Krishna Babu, special chief secretary (health and family welfare) said making sense of the results of the study was tricky as medical problems because of alcohol use have shot up massively without the matching spike in alcohol consumption year-on-year.He said, ""We have to check the reason why it has happened. The reasons can be excess consumption, nature of alcohol used and the process of distillation.""The finger, thus, may point to the quality of liquor available in the state during the same period - a point that may be politically fraught given the backdrop of the ""liquor scam"", whereby the allegation is that national brands disappeared from liquor stores in AP and were replaced by unknown and lesser-known labels. YSRCP has denied the allegations of a scam, calling it a narrative peddled by the governing TDP to castigate the opposition party and besmirch its tenure.","Alcohol-associated liver patients went up from 14,026 in 2014-19 to 29,369 in 2019-24.

As she lists one mansion, Taylor Swift transforms another possibly for life with Travis Kelce

After taking some well-earned time off, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are slowly easing back into their busy schedules. Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Taylor Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Taylor Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season. With a decorated career behind him, this upcoming chapter is set to be both meaningful and emotional.Alongside his return to football, Travis Kelce is also continuing his popular podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his older brother and former Philadelphia Eagle, Jason Kelce. The podcast has become a fan favorite, offering a candid and often humorous glimpse into their lives both on and off the field.Parallel to Swift’s efforts, Kelce is also making big changes to accommodate their shared future. In response to safety concerns following a high-profile burglary at his Kansas City mansion where over $100,000 in valuables were stolen Kelce has significantly enhanced the security of his home. He installed a $40,000 alarm system, multiple CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and floodlights.Additionally, Kelce built a fortified safe room and an underground man cave. Two guard dogs, costing $9,000, and 24/7 private security at $6,000 per month have also been added. These improvements are largely aimed at ensuring Swift feels safe during visits, especially given the intense public and media attention surrounding their relationship.Beyond these two main properties, Swift is reportedly eyeing new real estate in Nashville and Kansas City. Nashville, her long-time base, offers proximity to family and friends, while Kansas City would place her closer to Kelce during the NFL season. Sources indicate that the couple may even be considering purchasing a home together in Kansas City, a move that strongly suggests they are planning for a more settled, domestic life.Also Read: “External forces trying to unbalance them”: Living Nostradamus claims cosmic fate ties Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, warns of looming challenges ahead All these developments point to a serious turn in their relationship. With Taylor Swift reworking her iconic mansion for shared living and Travis Kelce upgrading security to protect their privacy, the two appear deeply invested in aligning their lives. These property moves go beyond luxury they’re deliberate steps toward building a stable future together.","Taylor Swift is renovating her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island.

Paul Skenes struggles as Livvy Dunne enjoys offseason break

Paul Skenes' girlfriend, Olivia Dunne, is taking some time off in Florida. The ex-LSU gymnast is on vacation at Hutchinson Island South with her older sister, Julz. The two have been soaking up the sun and relaxing by the ocean and playing in the water. Livvy closed out her gymnastics career at LSU in April. LSU wasn't at the NCAA finals this year, so her team couldn't retain their title from 2024.It was her fifth season and last at LSU, and she bid the team adieu after the semifinals.Livvy Dunne posted vacation photos as a story on Instagram on Wednesday. In an image, she's fishing in a red bikini and denim shorts, captioned ""Catching dinner."" In another, she's in black, sprawled outside said the tiniest shack, maybe taking a sip.Livvy Dunne had an injury on the knee during a meet against Arkansas, after which she was unable to compete for much of the season. Despite this, she stayed around her teammates and supported them. After their final meet, Livvy Dunne sat through an emotional tribute video that spanned nearly twenty years of Livvy's gymnastics career.With her college days over, Livvy Dunne has been on the move. She was most recently spotted at the Kentucky Derby as well as Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles rooting on Paul Skenes as he pitched against the Dodgers.While Livvy Dunne gets her time off, Paul Skenes is struggling in his second year in the MLB with the Pittsburgh Pirates . After a fine rookie season, things have not been as successful in 2025. Four wins, three losses, a decent 2.77 ERA, 47 punch outs, and 0.95 WHIP, but the wins certainly did not come easy.The last outing was against the St. Louis Cardinals on May 6, allowing two runs over six innings. The Pirates lost, Paul Skenes wants to rebound in his next start on May 12 against the New York Mets.Despite her relaxing vacation, Livvy remains supportive of Paul amid his pitching struggles. Fans eagerly watch both stars—one enjoying beach days, the other seeking a bounce-back on the mound.While Livvy enjoys the sun and surf, Skenes faces pressure to deliver on high expectations. Fans and analysts are beginning to question if he can maintain consistency throughout the long MLB season.Also Read: Paul Skenes’ Girlfriend Livvy Dunne Responds To Viral Backlash With Grace And Humor","Paul Skenes' girlfriend, Olivia Dunne, is taking some time off in Florida.

Towards the end, heated rivals, Damian Priest and Drew McIntyre, took the fight in the crowd, and Priest delivered a South of Haven chokeslam from a raised platform. Back in the ring, Solo Sikoa appeared to save Jacob Fatu as LA Knight was about to put him through a table. Knight took out Solo, but was attacked by the surprise debut of Jeff Cobb. This led to Fatu to capitalize and hit the moonsault to pick up the win and retain his title.Lyra Valkyria defended her WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship against Becky Lynch. They engaged in a heated combat and delivered a spectacular match. Some spots saw Lynch beating Lyra in front of her fiancé, who was sitting in the front row, and The Man trying to use some underhanded tactics. However, Valkyria managed to roll up Lynch to score the pinfall and win. Right after that moment, Lynch lost it and laid a beatdown on her opponent before walking away.Dominik Mysterio defended his WWE Intercontinental Championship against Penta in a rematch from RAW. Both high-flyer superstars displayed an excellent showing in the ring. Penta fought the interference of all Judgment Day members who came to Mysterio's aid. In the end, Penta's rival, El Grande Americano, appeared and nailed him with the object in his mask. Dirty Dom hit the frogsplash and pinned Penta to win the match.Pat McAfee displayed an excellent effort against a much stronger Gunther in the match. However, the Ring General had dominated him towards the end, which led to Michael Cole leaving his commentary duties to come to his aid. Cole tried his best to assist McAfee, but Gunther managed to lock him in the sleeper hold and win the match. Following the bout, he showed a sign of respect to McAfee before leaving the ring.This was the headliner match for the Undisputed WWE Championship. Randy Orton had the hometown crowd on his side, while Cena went up against Orton with everything he had. The match saw fans erupting in a This is Awesome chant and saw massive chaos towards the end. Orton had multiple opportunities to pin Cena, but every time, a referee was taken out. Moreover, Orton also RKOed multiple WWE officials, including Nick Aldis, who came out to check on the referees. Just as he was about to punt kick Cena, R-Truth showed up to stop him and also ate an RKO. Cena utilized the opportunity to hit Orton with a low blow and hit him with the belt to retain his title.Also read: WWE Backlash 2025 results: John Cena successfully retains the WWE Undisputed title","WWE presented their latest Premium Live Event, Backlash, from the Enterprise Arena in St.Louis, Missouri.

Shedeur Sanders picked off on Day 1, but Browns still see upside in rookie QB



The NFL dream has finally begun for Shedeur Sanders, as the former Colorado standout took the field in Berea, Ohio, for his first rookie minicamp with the Cleveland Browns . While the spotlight was bright and the expectations even brighter, Sanders' NFL debut was a mixture of rough starts and promising flashes.The very first pass Shedeur Sanders threw during team drills didn’t go according to plan.Under pressure from a free rusher, he attempted a play-action pass in the red zone, lofting the ball toward the left sideline—only to have it intercepted by a defender. A forgettable first impression? Perhaps. But for a quarterback known for his 74 percent completion rate in his final college season, this was less about mechanics and more about adjusting to the unforgiving speed of the NFL.Yet, Sanders didn’t let that early mistake define his day.Despite the shaky beginning, Sanders settled in and delivered a performance that revealed why the Browns were willing to bet on him, even after his surprising draft slide to the fifth round at No. 144 overall. Participating in various drills and 7-on-7 sessions, Sanders demonstrated his passing range—from sharp short throws to tight-window touchdowns.Browns insider Brad Stainbrook captured and shared glimpses of Sanders in action, highlighting two touchdown passes during scrimmage plays and several well-placed throws over defenders. Stainbrook later noted that Sanders “looked sharper than Dillon Gabriel,” the other quarterback in the rookie camp, who was selected by the Browns 94th overall.The quarterback competition is already becoming one of the more intriguing storylines of Cleveland’s offseason. Sanders and Gabriel, both entering the league with impressive college résumés, will have every opportunity to climb the depth chart. And while Gabriel got the first reps, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski made it clear that nothing is set in stone. “I wouldn't look into anything,” Stefanski remarked. “I think you'll see the whole weekend, going through the spring. I mean, we don't pay too close attention to who is in there first.” When asked if the order would change, he simply replied, “I’ll see who.”For Sanders, Friday marked more than just his first practice—it was a statement of intent. Dressed in shorts, a jersey, and helmet—far from full NFL gear—he still managed to showcase glimpses of poise and precision that hint at his potential to grow under center.“This is only the beginning,” Stainbrook wrote. And for Shedeur Sanders, whose college career spanned from Jackson State to the bright lights of Colorado, this beginning may come with challenges—but also a chance to shape his legacy in Cleveland, one pass at a time.Also Read: Despite buzz, Aaron Rodgers not locked in with Steelers; retirement rumors keep gaining steam",Shedeur Sanders made his Cleveland Browns rookie minicamp debut on Friday.

“I have decided to retire from the National Football League,” shares New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr

Fans react to Derek Carr’s retirement from the NFL after 11 seasons

Also read:

34-year-old New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr retires after 11 seasons, the NFL announced on May 10 via their X account. A fan commented, “Are you surprised that Derek Carr decided to retire?” The reason for his retirement is a significant degenerative injury to the rotator cuff of the right shoulder.According to the official website of the New Orleans Saints, “In late March, while ramping up his preparation for the 2025 NFL season, Derek experienced pain in his right shoulder.It was his first time throwing a football at a significant volume since recovering from both a concussion and left-hand injury sustained during play on December 8, 2024. Derek immediately contacted the Saints Medical Team. Eventually, medical scans determined objectively that Derek sustained a labral tear and also had significant degenerative changes to his rotator cuff.”Since the shoulder injury, Derek Carr thought of a pathway to follow after consulting with his medical staff - surgery was an option but it would ruin his 2025 NFL season, and could not guarantee the kind of play he would have as a quarterback post-surgery.Derek Carr shared with the New Orleans Saints official website, “Upon reflection of prayer, and in discussion with Heather, I’ve decided to retire from the National Football League. For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience. It’s difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials, and especially the fans who made this journey so special. Your unwavering support had meant the world to us.”NFL shared an X post with the caption: “Saints QB Derek Carr is retiring after 11 seasons. (via @rapsheet, @tompelissero, @mikegarafolo)”Fans reacted to it with varied emotions. Some expected it, while some did not see it coming.“The Saints future is looking ROUGH 👀”“Are you surprised that Derek Carr decided to retire?”“Doing this after free agency and the draft is nasty work. I love it 😂”“Just when we thought the Saints could have been competitive this upcoming season”“One of the best average QBs ever somehow”“Damn. Rough way to end it”“I’m pretty sure he retired about 2 years ago”“Wow.. his shoulder must be screwed like mine.”“Now he can ride of into the sunset with his millions of dollars“Felt like much longer, 11 seasons is an eternity in football days”“I’ll admit, Saints now have the worst QB room.”“Makes passing on Shedeur seem worse”“This is possibly the biggest surprise of the season”","34-year-old New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr retires after 11 seasons.

Explained: Why India abstained instead of voting no on IMF Pakistan loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-why-india-abstained-instead-of-voting-no-on-imf-pakistan-loan/articleshow/121039577.cms,"India abstained from voting on IMF loan package for Pakistan

Decision-making at the IMF

The IMF executive board consists of 25 directors who represent member countries or groups of countries. It handles daily operational matters, including loan approvals.

Unlike in the United Nations , where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. For instance, countries like the United States hold a disproportionately high voting share. Thus to simplify things, the IMF typically makes decisions by consensus.

, where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. For instance, countries like the United States hold a disproportionately high voting share. Thus to simplify things, the IMF typically makes decisions by consensus. In cases where a vote is required, the system does not allow a formal ""no"" vote. Directors can either vote in favor or abstain. There is no provision to vote against a loan or proposal.

Why India abstained?

India questioned the effectiveness of ongoing IMF assistance, noting that Pakistan has received support in 28 of the past 35 years including four programs in just the last five without meaningful or lasting reform.

India strongly highlighted the Pakistani military’s continued dominance in economic affairs, which undermines transparency, civilian oversight, and sustainable reform.

India firmly opposed providing funds to a country that continues to sponsor cross-border terrorism, warning that such support carries reputational risks for global institutions and undermines international norms.

NEW DELHI: India raised concerns during Friday's International Monetary Fund's Executive Board meeting regarding IMF's financial assistance to Pakistan While abstaining from voting, India said, ""Pakistan has been a prolonged borrower from the IMF, with a very poor track record of implementation and of adherence to the IMF's program conditions. ""India further highlighted that the recurring financial support has led Pakistan to amass significant debt obligations, effectively making it a 'too big to fail debtor' for the IMF.Read more: India targets Pakistan on IMF bailout package; abstains from voting over misuse of funds for terrorism Here's why India abstained to vote on Pakistan loan package according to government sources:India abstained from the recent IMF vote on approving a loan to Pakistan not due to a lack of opposition, but because IMF rules do not permit a formal “no” vote.By abstaining, India conveyed its strong dissent within the constraints of the IMF’s voting system and used the opportunity to formally record its objections.

Why Game 3 is a must-win for the Boston Celtics (May 10, 2025)

Can the Boston Celtics turn things around?

Theface a critical Game 3 against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, trailing 0-2 in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. After squandering 20-point leads in both home games, the pressure is on. The biggest question looming over the matchup: Will Kristaps Porzingis be healthy enough to make an impact?Good news for Celtics fans - Kristaps Porzingis will play and start in Game 3.He has no official injury designation, but his recent performances reveal a player struggling with a lingering viral illness.- In Game 1, he played just 13 minutes and failed to score.- In Game 2, he logged 14 minutes and managed only 8 points before exiting.Adding to Boston’s challenges , forward Sam Hauser is listed as doubtful with an ankle injury. His absence hurts the Celtics’ wing depth and removes a key three-point threat off the bench.With Porzingis limited and Hauser likely out, Boston’s rotation will be tested. Mazzulla may need to rely more on small-ball lineups and extended minutes from Al Horford and Luke Kornet.History is not on Boston’s side. No NBA team has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit—teams in that spot are 0-159. The Celtics themselves nearly pulled off the impossible in 2023, rallying from 0-3 against the Miami Heat before falling in Game 7.Another loss tonight would put them on the brink of elimination. After blowing two big leads at home, they can’t afford another slip-up. Every possession matters, and the margin for error is gone.The Knicks are rolling, but Boston still has the talent to make this a series. If Kristaps Porzingis can give them even 20 productive minutes and the bench steps up without Hauser, they have a shot. If not, their season could effectively end tonight.Also read: Will Jaylen Brown play tonight against the New York Knicks?

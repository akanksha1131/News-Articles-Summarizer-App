"Bhupender Yadav heads for two-nation trip ahead of COP30, sets tone for the UN climate summit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhupender-yadav-heads-for-two-nation-trip-ahead-of-cop30-sets-tone-for-the-un-climate-summit/articleshow/124494031.cms,"Image/Website: COP 30

NEW DELHI: With India gearing up to submit its updated climate action pledge ahead of the UN climate summit (COP30) next month, the Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Saturday headed to Brazil for a pre-COP meeting, scheduled on Oct 13-14in Brasilia, to put forward the country’s expectation from the main annual conference next month.Besides pitching for Global South’s demand for more predictable climate finance, he is likely to flag the need for adaptation strategies and the functioning of the global carbon market.India has time and again raised that the financial support of $300 billion annually to the Global South (developing countries) by 2035 is insufficient and stressed that developed countries have the moral responsibility to support developing countries for implementation of their climate action pledges. Yadav is expected to flag it at the pre-COP meeting as well.At last year’s UN climate summit (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, developed countries had agreed to mobilise merely $300 billion annually by 2035, far short of the $1.3-trillion target set by developing countries.On his way back, Yadav will attend the G20 working group ministerial meeting on climate and environmental sustainability on Oct 16-17 in Cape Town, South Africa, where he is expected to set the tone for COP30 which is to be held in Belem, Brazil from Nov 10 to 21.""India is expected to submit its national adaptation plan and updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) - climate action plan for 2035 - to the UN climate body ahead of COP30,"" said an official.India's first national adaptation plan will be a blueprint for the country's approach to integrate adaptation into national development plans and policies across economic sectors. It has been framed to build resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate-related risks across various sectors/regions such as agriculture, water resources, the Himalayan region, coastal regions, health, disaster management etc.The NDC will, on the other hand, specify the country's greenhouse gas emission reduction target and a goal on enhanced footprints of electricity from non-fossil fuel resources by 2035. The present NDC has such plans till 2030.",India gearing up to submit its updated climate action pledge ahead of the UN climate summit (COP30) next month.

Every instance of failure to act in financial matters not white-collar crime: Ex-CJI Sanjiv Khanna,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-instance-of-failure-to-act-in-financial-matters-not-white-collar-crime-ex-cji-sanjiv-khanna/articleshow/124493570.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former chief justice of India Sanjiv Khanna said on Saturday that every instance of failure to act in matters that have financial implications cannot be termed a white-collar crime.He said this while speaking at the ""National Conference on White Collar Crime"", organised by the Terapanth Professional Forum.""White-collar crime is a cliche which we hear every day in, day out, but very few of us really understand what is a white-collar crime. This expression was coined in 1939 by a sociologist, who described it as a non-violent offence committed by individuals of position and responsibility,"" Justice Khanna said.He said these crimes are committed by people in positions of trust, authority or respectability, usually for personal or organisational gain, and these are generally non-violent and economic in nature.""Yes, white-collar crimes can also lead to violence and they are then classified as red-collar crimes. Now, it will be wrong to say that every act of failure to act that has financial implications is a white-collar crime.To me, financial or monetary wrongs can be divided into three categories,"" the former CJI said.He said the first category includes crimes motivated by greed or advantage, such as fraud, embezzlement, insider trading, cyber crime, money laundering, intentional tax evasion, bribery and corruption.""The second category of wrongdoings is unintentional, largely due to a lack of awareness or knowledge. It is without malicious or bad mental intent. The third category of financial crimes are technical or procedural wrongs, like not taking prior permission, filing errors, compliance oversight, which happens due to a misunderstanding of law or lack of awareness,"" Justice Khanna said.He said a difficulty arises when the legislature equates the first category of white-collar crimes with other categories, or a disproportionate punishment is prescribed with penalties or even a sentence of imprisonment, notwithstanding that the lapse is involuntary or without the intent to gain financially or cause harm, but on account of lack of awareness or confusion.""This morning, I read in the papers that there is active discussion going on to reduce the number of offences under the Income Tax Act. While these moves are right, at the same time, white-collar crimes, especially cyber crimes, are increasing. The only way to deal with it is public awareness and knowledge that you can be subjected to a white-collar crime,"" Justice Khanna said.The former CJI said nothing prevents an individual from approaching police in case of falling prey to white-collar crimes.Posing a question for lawyers, he said, ""How many of you have ever written to the government that your client, who is briefing you, has indulged in money laundering? I do not think anybody would have done it. All of us have been brought up to understand that there is a professional privilege.""I am looking forward to the day when a taxpayer approaches his accountant, chartered accountant, lawyer with the question, 'please tell me what is the right amount of tax I have to pay', and not with the question, 'please tell me how I can reduce or evade taxes'. The day that happens, a lot of things will change.""Justice Khanna said people are afraid to go to law-enforcement agencies in case of being victims of white-collar crimes because going to such government authorities is a ""Herculean task"" and ""a source of harassment"".""And that fear factor, invariably, is used by cyber criminals to digitally arrest you or swindle you. There has to be a change in the mindset of the ordinary people when they deal with this situation. You should be able to have the courage to go to law-enforcement agencies and not fear.""You should not feel that if I go to a law-enforcement agency, I will be harassed more, I would rather pay up the amount demanded,"" the former CJI said.","Former chief justice of India Sanjiv Khanna said every failure to act in matters that have financial implications cannot be termed a white-collar crime.

""In my view, such cases must be dealt with differently,"" he remarked. ""While ignorance of the law cannot be an excuse, the real difficulty arises when the legislature equates white-collar crimes with conventional offences, ignoring the degree of intent and mental element involved"", he added.He noted that financial offences can broadly be classified into three categories, those committed with clear criminal intent, those arising from negligence or misunderstanding and those resulting from procedural lapses.""He emphasised that mental intent, is the key differentiator.Justice Khanna also expressed concern over the growing trend of reverse burden of proof in financial legislations, where the accused must prove their innocence rather than the prosecution proving guilt. Such provisions, he said, must be applied with caution. Further, the CJI added that the law must distinguish between those who act with mala fide intent and those who commit errors without any corrupt motive.","Former Chief Justice of India, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, on Saturday called for a more sensitive and nuanced approach in the application of laws that govern financial frauds.

Donald Trump’s New Envoy To India Sergio Gor Arrives In Delhi With Big Agenda On Trade And Security

NEW DELHI: The underlying priority of India’s trade negotiations is to secure fair and balanced agreements in the best interest of the nation and the people, a top PMO official said on Saturday, asserting that the economy continues to demonstrate remarkable dynamism and resilience amid global uncertainty.Delivering the Kale memorial lecture at the Punebased Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, principal secretary-2 to PM Modi Shaktikanta Das said the global economy is going through a phase of unprecedented uncertainty and fundamental reset.“A rules-based trading framework that promoted globalisation and free trade for over eight decades is under challenge. Established rules are being increasingly questioned while new norms are yet to be firmly established,” said the former RBI governor. He said the pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict have accelerated the move toward self-reliance.“This transformation is also evident in the growing influence of regional trade agreements (RTAs), which reflect a shift towards more fragmented yet practical trade alliances,” said Das, adding that India is a signatory to 14 free trade agreements (FTAs) and six preferential trade agreements (PTAs), with the UK, Australia and the UAE being the recent additions among FTAs.He said that at present, India is in free trade agreement negotiations with the US, the EU, Peru, Oman, New Zealand, among several others.Das said that amid the uncertain global environment, India continues to demonstrate remarkable dynamism and resilience.“Guided by a decade of structural reforms and strategic global positioning under the vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, the nation has successfully weathered multiple global headwinds,” said Das who has helped navigate several economic headwinds in the past during his stint at RBI and the finance ministry.“India’s robust domestic demand, together with prudent macroeconomic and financial sector policies, has enabled the country to withstand many external shocks. India is now poised to contribute about one-fifth of the world’s GDP growth.”The former RBI governor said India continues to record impressive growth, as several favourable factors, such as a younger demography and greater reliance on domestic demand, provide the strength to withstand the negative spillovers from global turbulence. Das also said India’s average economic growth during 2014-15 to 202425 was 7.1% (excluding the Covid-19 years of 2020-21 and 2021-22) and in the last three years (2022-23 to 2024-25), GDP growth averaged 7.8%.",Shaktikanta Das said the global economy is going through a phase of unprecedented uncertainty and fundamental reset.

PM Modi's BIG OUTREACH To India's Farmers, Launches Agri Schemes Worth ₹35,000 Crore Before Diwali

NEW DELHI: With the campaign for Bihar elections gathering pace, PM Modi on Saturday launched two mega central schemes with a total outlay of Rs 35,440 crore to transform 100 low-performing agri-districts and increase production of pulses to reduce imports, urging farmers to focus on both selfreliance and exports.Addressing a gathering of farmers and farm policymakers at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, he said, “On one hand, we will have to be self-sufficient, while on the other hand, we will have to produce for the global market...We have to focus on those crops which can dominate the world agri market. These two schemes – PM Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana (with an outlay of Rs 24,000 crore for 100 lowperforming districts) and Mission for self-sufficiency in pulses (with an outlay of Rs 11,440 crore) – will play vital roles in this journey. He further emphasised farmers’ vital contribution in making the country self-reliant in food production and calling upon them to lead the way in building a developed India.On the occasion, he also virtually inaugurated 1,054 completed projects valued at over Rs 5,450 crore and laid foundation stones for an additional 50 projects, worth around Rs 815 crore, relating to agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and food processing sectors.Both the newly launched centralschemeswill be implemented from the upcoming rabi (winter sowing) season, extending till 2030-31. Under the PM Dhan Dhaanya Yojana for 100 low-productivity districts, farm output will be enhanced through various interventions, including a focus on higher irrigation coverage and crop diversification.Among the 100 identified districts, Uttar Pradesh accounts for the highest number (12). It is followed by Maharashtra (9); Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan (8); Bihar (7); Gujarat, Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and West Bengal (4); Assam, Kerala and Chhattisgarh (3); and Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and UT of J&K (2).These districts have been identified based on three factors: low productivity, moderate crop intensity and belowaverage access to credit. Thirty-six different schemes of 11 departments will be converged to implement the programme. “We have often heard the phrase ‘36 ka aankda’; a way of saying that two parties are completely at odds with each other. But as a government, we challenge such perceptions and reverse them,” PM Modi said, underlining that the govt has brought together 36 schemes under PM DhanDhaanya Krishi Yojana to develop the identified districts.","PM Modi launched two mega central schemes with a total outlay of Rs 35,440 crore to transform 100 low-performing agri-districts.

'Let Them Decide': Trump At Oval Office When Asked About NOBEL PRIZE After Gaza Deal

Will Trump get the Peace Prize?



Also read:

Who are the contenders?







The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The award is considered one of the most anticipated and unpredictable honours.Experts say the committee usually focuses on lasting peace, international cooperation, and the work of institutions that promote these goals.The announcement will be made in Oslo, Norway, where the committee will name the laureate who reflects the values of Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish industrialist who founded the prize.There has been speculation about the possibility of US President Donald Trump winning the prize, a discussion partly driven by Trump himself. However, experts who follow the Nobel process say his chances are low despite his involvement in several international peace efforts.The announcement comes just hours after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that could help end the two-year conflict in Gaza.While Trump has claimed credit for pressuring both sides to reach the deal, the timing makes it unlikely that the Nobel Committee considered it.The five-member committee held its final meeting on Monday, when it completed the statement explaining its choice, which is usually decided days in advance.""The Gaza deal has absolutely no significance for the choice of the 2025 laureate because the Nobel Committee has already made its decision,"" historian and Peace Prize expert Asle Sveen told news agency AFP.""Trump will not win the prize this year. I’m 100 percent certain,"" he said.A total of 338 individuals and organisations have been nominated for the 2025 Peace Prize, but the list remains secret for 50 years. With no clear favourite, several possible names are being discussed in Oslo.Among them are Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms, a network of volunteers helping civilians during war and famine; Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which monitors elections.The committee could also choose a laureate that signals its position on global issues, even if it invites criticism from the United States.Possible choices include UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres , the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), or international courts such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).Organisations defending press freedom, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) or Reporters Without Borders (RSF), are also being discussed as potential winners.Last year’s prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings that campaigns against nuclear weapons.The Nobel Peace Prize includes a diploma, a gold medal, and a $1.2 million cash award.The economics prize, to be announced on Monday, will conclude the 2025 Nobel season, which has already seen awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and peace.","The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

Exam transparency under scrutiny

11 foreign medical graduates also disqualified

In a significant disciplinary move, the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has cancelled the NEET PG results of 22 candidates for alleged use of unfair means in examinations conducted between 2021 and 2025. The action, announced through an official notification, includes 13 candidates from the NEET PG 2025 session alone.According to the NBEMS, the scorecards and results of all 22 candidates stand null and void. “Producing the said scorecard and/or result of NEET-PG of the respective session for any purposes, including but not limited to, employment, enrolment, registration, or admission to PG courses, shall be unlawful,” the board stated in its notice.The NBEMS further clarified that it will not be responsible for any admissions, employment, or registrations obtained using the cancelled results. “NBEMS disclaims any responsibility or liability arising from employment, admission, or enrolment based on the NEET PG result cancelled herein above,” it added.Of the 22 candidates whose results were invalidated, 13 appeared in NEET PG 2025, three in 2024, four in 2023, and one each in 2022 and 2021.The board’s Examination Ethics Committee took the decision after a detailed inquiry into malpractice incidents reported across multiple sessions.One candidate, Srusti Bommanahalli Rajanna, was disqualified following the disposal of Writ Petition No. 5785/2025 before the Karnataka High Court. The remaining 21 candidates were found guilty of using unfair means by the NBEMS ethics panel.This year’s NEET PG exam saw participation from over 2.42 lakh candidates, of whom 1,28,116 were declared qualified for admission to Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Surgery (MS), and PG Diploma courses. However, the counselling schedule for NEET PG 2025 is yet to be announced, as the exam remains under legal scrutiny over transparency concerns and a pending petition seeking the release of full question papers and answer keys.Alongside NEET PG candidates, the NBEMS has also cancelled the candidature of 11 students who appeared in the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) between 2021 and 2025. These candidates were similarly found to have used unfair means during the exam.The FMGE, which allows foreign-trained medical graduates to obtain a licence to practice in India, reported a sharp decline in pass percentage this year. The June 2025 session recorded a pass rate of 18.61%, down by nearly 11% points from the previous year. Out of 37,207 registered candidates, only 6,707 managed to qualify.The NBEMS has reiterated its commitment to maintaining the integrity of medical entrance and licensure examinations, warning that strict action will continue against any candidate found compromising the fairness of the assessment process.","The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has cancelled the NEET PG results of 22 candidates for alleged use of unfair means.

Afghan Taliban Strikes Pakistan; Heavy Fighting On 7 Border Points Along Durand Line





Afghanistan’s eastern frontier flared up this weekend — a border that has rarely known peace since colonial lines sliced through Pashtun lands. The Taliban , now the state it once fought from the shadows, said its forces launched armed reprisals against Pakistani troops after Islamabad’s alleged air strikes on Afghan soil. From Kunar to Helmand, provinces that have lived on the edge of someone’s war for decades, local officials confirmed that clashes were ongoing.On Saturday, Afghanistan’s Taliban forces launched armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the shared border, accusing Islamabad of carrying out air strikes on its soil, senior officials from several provinces said.“In retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces,” Taliban border forces in the east “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas,” the Afghan military said in a statement, quoted by AFP.On Thursday, two explosions were heard in the Afghan capital and another in the southeast of the country. The following day, the Taliban-run defence ministry blamed the attacks on Pakistan , accusing its neighbor of ""violating its sovereignty.""Later, Taliban defence ministry spokesman Enayat Khowarazm told news agency AFP that the operations had concluded ""successfully"" at midnight.He added a warning: ""If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan’s territory, our armed forces are prepared to defend it and will respond decisively.""Islamabad did not confirm that it was behind the attacks, but called on Kabul ""to stop harbouring the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) on its soil."" The TTP, trained in combat in Afghanistan and claiming to share the same ideology as the Afghan Taliban, is accused by Islamabad of having killed hundreds of its soldiers since 2021.""This evening, Taliban forces began using weapons. We fired first light and then heavy artillery at four points along the border,"" a senior official in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, told AFP.""Pakistani forces responded with heavy fire and shot down three Afghan quadcopters suspected of carrying explosives. Intense fighting continues, but so far, no casualties have been reported,"" he continued.In recent months, TTP militants have intensified their campaign of violence against Pakistani security forces in the mountainous areas along the border.Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to expel militants who use Afghan territory to launch attacks on Pakistan, an accusation denied by authorities in Kabul.","Afghan Taliban forces launch armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the shared border.

Threats faced by girls now extend into the digital world, says

CJI

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice B R Gavai on Saturday said despite constitutional guarantees, many girls continue to be tragically denied their fundamental rights and even basic necessities for survival and face harmful practices like female genital mutilation (FGM). Interestingly, a PIL challenging the validity of FGM, practised among certain Muslims, is pending before a ninejudge SC bench, which is also seized of the challenge to alleged discriminatory practices against women at Sabarimala, Agiyari of Parsi communities and mosques.A a national consultation on ‘Safeguarding the girl child: towards a safer and enabling environment for her in India’ organised by juvenile justice committee headed by Justice B V Nagarathna, CJI B R Gavai said, “This vulnerability exposes them (girls) to disproportionately high risks of sexual abuse, exploitation, & harmful practices such as FGM, malnutrition, sex-selective abortions, trafficking, and child marriage against their will. ” He said advancement in technology, though empowering, has given rise to new vulnerabilities for the female child.“Threats faced by young girls are no longer confined to physical spaces, they extend into the digital world. From online harassment, cyberbullying, and digital stalking to misuse of personal data and deep fake imagery, the challenges have evolved in both scale and sophistication,” the CJI said. Calling upon institutions, policy makers & enforcement authorities to realise realities of presentera challenges, he said technology must serve as a tool for liberation rather than exploitation.“Safeguarding the girl child today means securing her future in classrooms, workplaces, and on every screen she encounters,” he said. Justice Nagarathna said, “A young girl in India can be said to be a truly equal citizen only when she can freely aspire to do anything that her male counterpart does and receive the same quality of support and resources to do so, facing no barriers specific.”","Despite constitutional guarantees, many girls continue to be tragically denied their fundamental rights, says Chief Justice B R Gavai.

NEW DELHI: Notorious fugitive gangster Rashid Cablewala, who has been linked to several murders in Delhi, was detained in Azerbaijan on arriving from Istanbul, sources confirmed, with Indian intelligence agencies now gearing up to bring him back, reports Rajshekhar Jha.It is unclear whether he was imprisoned there or kept under surveillance post-bond. Cablewala, who is on the ‘most wanted’ list, was detained by immigration authorities at Baku’s Heydar Aliyev International Airport due to “anomalies in his travel documents”, a relative said. A senior cop confirmed the developments and said they would share details of his criminal history and dossier through appropriate channels.Cablewala is a close associate of jailed gangster Hashim Baba and was handling operations for the gang. He is also linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate. His name emerged in the killing of businessman Nadir Shah in Greater Kailash-I in Sept last year. He was then accused of a double murder in east Delhi on th e night of Diwali in Oct 2024. When his name croopped up again, in the killing of businessman Sunil Jain in east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar last Dec, Cablewala became one of Delhi Police ’s most sought-after fugitives.Speaking with TOI from an undisclosed location in December 2024, Cablewala claimed that Jain’s murder was “retribution” for the twin murders reported from the same area in Oct but denied his involvement. Cablewala told TOI that Sachin alias Golu was one of the assailants who had accepted payment from two parties to kill another individual. “Jain was not the target. The target was this man named Virat and he will be eliminated. ..,” he had revealed.Sources said Sachin was still on the run and may have fled abroad too.Authorities said Hashim Baba and Cablewala shared an extensive history. They initially gained notoriety when they, along with their former associate Nasir, eliminated Akil Mama during a funeral in 2013. Following Nasir’s imprisonment, Hashim Baba and Cablewala assumed control of the gang. They eventually separated and established their individual operations.A history-sheeter linked to multiple homicide cases, Cablewala carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh before his arrest in 2018. At the time, he was apprehended while attempting to escape to Saudi Arabia. He established a garments enterprise in Riyadh and was expanding into Thailand. This, investigators said, was to launder illicit proceeds. In 2019, he was charged under MCOCA by the crime branch. In 2020, he was apprehended again by the special cell. He escaped using a forged passport in early 2022.","Rashid Cablewala was detained by immigration authorities at Baku’s Heydar Aliyev International Airport due to “anomalies in his travel documents”, a relative said.

IPS Officer 'Suicide': Wife Seeks FIR Against Haryana DGP, Rohtak SP Over 'Harassment And Abetment'

Body taken to mortuary but autopsy put off

Pressure on Haryana governement to take action against DGP

CHANDIGARH: In the strongest commitment yet of action in the alleged suicide of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warned on Saturday that no one will be spared, “no matter how influential”.The CM’s statement came hours after Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya was removed from his post. Bijarniya has not been given any posting and will be attached to police HQ in Panchkula. Bijarniya and Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur were named in Puran Kumar’s suicide note and his wife IAS officer Amneet P Kumar’s complaint to policeas the alleged “harassers” who drove him to suicide.Amneet has refused to allow an autopsy of her husband’s body until action is taken against the DGP & SP. It has been nearly five days since Puran Kumar’s suicide. On Saturday evening, while addressing the BJP state executive in Panchkula, Saini began by offering condolences to the deceased IPS officer. He expressed solidarity with the IPS officer’s family and said: “Our governement will conduct a thorough investigation into this matter.” He urged the opposition not to play politics.Chandigarh police faced backlash from the family of the IPS officer when it tried to get an autopsy done on Saturday, leading DGP Sagarpreet Hooda to say that the postmortem would not be conducted until the family agreed, reports Pawan Tiwari.Wife Amneet’s brother Amit Rattan, an AAP MLA, alleged police shifted the body without notifying the kin. The body was moved to PGI mortuary, where a team was ready for an autopsy. However, the family’s objection forced police put it on hold. DGP Hooda, IG Pushpendra Kumar & SSP Kanwardeep Kaur went to Amneet to get her nod, but she refused.Amneet P Kumar was a member of Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation on an official tour of Japan when her husband, Y Puran Kumar, allegedly shot himself dead. She flew home immediately. On returning from Japan, CM Saini had called on Amneet at her Chandigarh residence.During the meeting, Amneet had handed him a two-page letter seeking justice and protection for her family and action against those named in the suicide note, especially DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, for abetting her husband’s “suicide”. Two days later, on Saturday, Haryana governement removed Bijarniya and replaced him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria. This was the first action initiated by governement. Pressure is mounting on the governement to take action against Kapur as well. There is intense speculation that he may be asked to go on leave, but till Saturday evening there was no word from governement.The question in bureaucratic circles is whether governement will take action against the DGP. A section of Haryana IAS officers has also demanded Kapur’s arrest. Amneet said a “false FIR” registered in Rohtak was the “trigger point” for her husband’s “suicide”. Bijarniya was the supervising officer of the case in which head constable Sushil Kumar, PSO to Puran Kumar when he was IG Rohtak, was arrested on allegations of extortion. Police claimed Sushil had “confessed” during questioning that he had demanded money on behalf of Puran Kumar.A day after the IPS officer died, Bijarniya said, “The complainant provided audio-visual evidence which led to Sushil’s arrest. He was taken into custody for two days and confessed to demanding on behalf of Kumar. We were in the process of further investigation when we came to know about this incident (Kumar’s alleged suicide).” Kumar was shifted out as IGP (Rohtak range) on September 29. Sushil was arrested soon after. A day after the FIR was lodged, Kumar allegedly died by suicide. State chief secretary Anurag Rastogi and ACS-home Sumita Misra spent almost the entire Friday trying to pacify Amneet, but she stuck to her stand.",Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warns that no one will be spared.

Denial of justice

, says lawyer on repeated recusals

DEHRADUN: In what is being termed an unprecedented series of recusals, another judge has decided to withdraw from a case involving Uttarakhand-cadre Indian Forest Service officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi. Justice Alok Verma of the Uttarakhand high court became the 16th judge to recuse from Chaturvedi’s case, and the second one within a fortnight. Verma’s recusal order, dated Oct 8, simply stated, “List before another bench,” without assigning any reason continuing a pattern seen in previous recusals in Chaturvedi’s matters.Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s counsel, Sudershan Goel, termed the repeated recusals “a denial of justice” and an infringement of his client’s constitutional right. “Judges usually recuse themselves when they have previously represented a party, share a familial relation, or have a financial association. Any other or non-reasoned recusal amounts to impropriety and betrayal of the constitutional oath of office,” he said.Verma’s withdrawal comes 12 days after Justice Ravindra Maithani of Uttarakhand HC similarly recused himself from hearing one of Chaturvedi’s cases. The present matter involves a contempt petition filed by Chaturvedi against CAT members and the registry for alleged wilful disobedience of a stay order.Advocate Goel said this sets a record in the judicial history of the country, as never before have so many judges recused from hearing cases of a particular person.","Justice Alok Verma of the Uttarakhand high court became the 16th judge to recuse from Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s case, and the second one within a fortnight.

Taliban seek opening of India-Pak border for trade with India; government to accept Taliban diplomats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-stand-on-recognising-kabul-regime-will-be-aligned-with-international-communitys/articleshow/124465388.cms,"Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi

Jaishankar-Muttaqi Meet Marks Strategic Shift in India-Afghan Ties, Pak Faces Pressure: Experts

Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi backed trade through the Chabahar port route and called for opening the India-Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India. At a press conference in the Afghanistan embassy, following his meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Muttaqi also announced that the Taliban will appoint diplomats in India.Pakistan does not allow India to export to Afghanistan via the land route, and the Indian government has used the Chabahar port in Iran for trade and commerce with Afghanistan. The US, however, last month revoked the 2018 sanctions waiver that allowed India to develop the port and access Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.Muttaqi said trade is meant to benefit people and should not be mixed with politics. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all 3 countries,’’ said Muttaqi, addressing a press conference at the Afghanistan embassy for which no woman journalist was invited. He also announced the formation of a trade committee to remove obstacles in commercial ties with India.Muttaqi also reiterated Afghanistan’s position that it won’t allow the US to take control of the Bagram airbase, even as it remains open to diplomatic ties with Washington. Indian government sources later confirmed India had agreed to work with the Taliban to have their diplomats stationed here but added India’s position on formal recognition will remain broadly aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi addressed the media with a small flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), Taliban’s name for the country, placed on the table. He told reporters the embassy building, which still flies the flag of the erstwhile Islamic Republic, belonged to the IEA. “The appointment of diplomats will be a step towards normalisation and further improvement of ties,” said Muttaqi. The appointment will not be at the ambassador level, in the absence of formal recognition by India. The diplomats appointed by the Taliban will be allowed to work from the embassy.Asked about women’s rights, a sticking point in the Taliban’s ties with the international community, Muttaqi said all countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected. He was also non-committal on whether girls or women would be allowed to travel to India for studies.""In the recent earthquake in Afghanistan, India was the first responder. Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations. We are ready to create a consultative mechanism of understanding, which helps towards strengthening our relations,” said Muttaqi.The issue of women rights has been flagged by Indian authorities from several multilateral forums. India believes Taliban must work towards the formation of a truly inclusive government and preservation of women, children and minorities.Muttaqi also said he and Jaishankar discussed security concerns in detail. “The IEA has proven in the last four years that the territory of Afghanistan will not be used against others. And it remains committed to that policy that the territory of Afghanistan is not used to threaten others,” said Muttaqi.","Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi called for opening the India- Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India.

Clear messaging to Pakistan



Strategic recalibration: Delhi steps in



Economics, connectivity and regional stakes



Security calculus: Terrorism and recognition



Presence restored, recognition withheld



Regional balancing act



Strategic hedging, not endorsement



NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124482977,imgsize-36624,width-400,resizemode-4/amir-khan-muttaqi-foreign-minister-of-the-islamic-emirate-of-afghanistan-talibanexternal-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-general-asim-munir-chief-of-army-staff-pakistan-army.jpg"

RPL, its top execs accused of alleged diversion of funds



NEW DELHI: The ED late on Friday arrested Reliance Power’s chief financial officer Ashok Pal after questioning him at its headquarters here in a case of fake bank guarantee. He was produced before a court here on Saturday and remanded in two days of ED custody. Pal, the CFO of Reliance Power Limited (RPL), an Anil Ambani Reliance group company, has been taken into custody in an ongoing money laundering probe related to banking fraud against Ambani and his group entities. “The degree of fraud can be gauged from the fact that Reliance Power group submitted a bank guarantee from FirstRand Bank, Manila, Philippines. The fact is that there exists no branch of FirstRand Bank in the Philippines,” sources said.Fake and spoofed domains of commercial banks, such as sbi.17313@s-bi.co.in a look alike of SBI email was created by inserting a hyphen to commit the fraud, an official said. Similar emails of other PSU banks have also been used by the accused. Reliance Power Limited (RPL) is a listed company where public holds more than 75% shares. The company and its top executives are accused of alleged diversion of funds. “Board resolution empowered CFO Ashok Pal and others to finalise, approve, sign and execute all documents for Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) BESS tender, and to use RPL’s financial capability for the bid,” the agency sources said.In a statement, RPL said, “The company & its subsidiaries acted bonafidely and are a victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy. We also wish to clarify on media reports that Anil D Ambani is not on Board of Reliance Power Limited for more than 3.5 years and is not concerned with this matter in any manner.”On Aug 1, ED had conducted searches at three premises in Bhubaneswar and one at Kolkata after its investigators found alleged evidence of Rs 68 crore fake bank guarantee provided to SECI on behalf of Reliance NU BESS Ltd/Maharashtra Energy Generation Ltd. The fake bank guarantee was generated by a shell entity registered at Bhubaneswar, allegedly linked to Anil Ambani group. Spoofed email accounts were created to make them look genuine, sources said. Besides the allegedly forged bank guarantee, Anil Ambani’s Reliance group is also being probed for alleged fake bills for commission. The agency sources alleged that Pal “played crucial role in submitting a bogus bank guarantee of over Rs 68 crore to SECI, with an intention to cheat the PSU”. The probe has revealed that Pal was instrumental in selecting Biswal Tradelink Pvt Ltd to provide fake bank guarantee. Director of BTPL Partha Sarathi Biswal was arrested earlier and is currently in judicial custody.

What is Darul Uloom Deoband?



The Afghan connection: How Deobandi Islam reached Afghanistan



NEW DELHI: Taliban ’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday, meeting Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind President Maulana Arshad Madani and other senior officials of the seminary.Muttaqi expressed gratitude for the warm reception and optimism about India-Afghanistan ties. “I am thankful to all of you for the warm welcome given to me by everyone in Deoband and the love showered upon me. I will pray to God that India-Afghanistan relations improve further,” he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.The Afghan leader highlighted the significance of educational and cultural ties, noting that no political discussions took place but that historical connections were celebrated.As per news agency ANI, Maulana Arshad Madani emphasised the historical role of Afghanistan in India’s independence struggle and reassured that Afghanistan would not allow terrorists to use its soil against India.This visit is part of a week-long trip to India by Muttaqi, marking the first high-level delegation from Kabul since the Taliban took power in 2021.Darul Uloom Deoband, established in 1866 in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is one of South Asia’s most influential Islamic seminaries.It was founded by scholars including Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi and Maulana Rashid Muhammad Gangohi to educate Muslim youth in a rigorous, orthodox understanding of Islam, known as Deobandi Islam.The seminary was originally part of an anti-colonial movement aimed at revitalising Islam and resisting British rule in India. Over the decades, Deobandi schools spread throughout India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of South Asia.While Darul Uloom Deoband is in India, its teachings spread across the border into Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pashtun communities were instrumental in establishing Deobandi seminaries along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, according to The Conversation.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 accelerated this process as Deobandi madrassas, supported by Pakistani authorities and funding from Saudi Arabia and the CIA, educated Afghan refugee youth who would join the anti-Soviet resistance.Many of these students later became key figures in the Taliban. The movement’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other Taliban leaders were educated in Deobandi-inspired seminaries in Pakistan, adopting a version of the ideology that included ultraconservative Wahhabi influences, as per NPR.While the Taliban identify as Deobandis, scholars at the original Indian seminary emphasise that their interpretation diverged from classical Deobandi teachings.“The Taliban say they are doing what we did in India. The way we kicked the British out of India, that’s what the Taliban are doing in Afghanistan,” said Maulana Arshad Madani back in 2021 when the Taliban took control over Afghanistan, clarifying that there is no organisational link between the seminary and the Taliban, as per NPR.This visit of Taliban’s foreign minister comes amid efforts to improve India-Afghanistan relations, as Muttaqi emphasised hopes for increased exchanges and cooperation, including in regional projects like the Chabahar port in Iran.The visit reinforces the soft-power and cultural dimension of diplomacy between the two countries while acknowledging the centuries-old educational and religious links that connect them.",Taliban’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday.

Taliban presser in New Delhi



NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi on Saturday led a wave of opposition outrage after women journalists were barred from a Taliban press conference in New Delhi. Taking direct aim at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress MP addressed PM Modi and said, ""you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. ”The remark came as several opposition leaders condemned the government for allowing such an event, calling it a shameful affront to women’s rights and democratic values.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, voiced his disappointment over the incident and criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, writing on X, ""Mr. Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them.""He added, ""In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space. Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti.""BJP responded sharply to Rahul Gandhi's criticism of the Taliban press conference, denying the allegations and linking him to Pakistan, while calling Congress the ""best friend of Pakistan.""BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said, ""Yet again Rahul Gandhi is batting for Pakistan by spreading fake news!""He also fact-checked Rahul on X, noting, ""Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961 Article 22 declares embassy land as 'inviolable' and belonging to the embassy.""It was not just Rahul Gandhi, but several other opposition leaders also targeted PM and Centre. Lok Sabha member Priyanka Gandhi also addressed the issue, asking the prime minister to clarify the government’s position. She wrote on X, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India. ""Priyanka added, ""If your recognition of women’s rights isn’t just convenient posturing from one election to the other, then how has this insult to some of India’s most competent women been allowed in our country, a country whose women are its backbone and its pride.""Former home minister P Chidambaram expressed shock over the exclusion, writing, ""I am shocked that women journalists were excluded from the press conference addressed by Mr Amir Khan Muttaqi of Afghanistan. In my personal view, the men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).""TMC MP Mahua Moitra also targeted the Modi-led government, saying, ""The government has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.""She added in another post on X, ""How dare our government allow Taliban foreign minister Amir Muttaqi to exclude women journalists & hold a ‘male-only’ news conference on Indian soil with full protocol? How dare EAM Jaishankar agree to this? & why did our emasculated spineless male journos remain in room?""The press conference was held at the Afghanistan embassy hours after Taliban FM talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, where women journalists were barred from entry. The forum was only opened to a few male journalists, reflecting the Taliban’s ongoing record of gender discrimination.Sources say the decision on journalist invitations was made by Taliban officials accompanying Muttaqi. The Taliban government in Kabul has faced sustained global condemnation, including from the United Nations, for its restrictions on women’s rights, education, and participation in public life.Amid backlash, the ministry of external affairs clarified to ANI that India had ""no involvement"" in the press interaction held by Muttaqi.When asked about the condition of women in Afghanistan, Muttaqi sidestepped the question, saying, ""Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and there should be respect for them."" He claimed Afghanistan’s situation had improved since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, contrasting current conditions with previous years. ""Some 200 to 400 people died in Afghanistan every day before Taliban started ruling the country,"" he said.","Rahul Gandhi led a wave of opposition outrage after women journalists were barred from a Taliban press conference in New Delhi.

The two leaders discussed the importance of critical minerals, Gor said.

Bilateral issues, including defence, trade and technology were also discussed, he said.

Gor noted that the United States“values its relationship with India” and emphasised that his visit underscored Washington’s commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation.

He also gifted a portrait to PM Modi with Trump's signature on it saying: ""Mr Prime Minister, you are great.""

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday met US Ambassador-designate Sergio Gor in New Delhi, marking the first high-level interaction between the two since Gor’s Senate confirmation as the next American envoy to India.The meeting comes amid ongoing trade tensions and hopes for renewed momentum in the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Sergio Gor said, “I had an incredible meeting with Prime Minister Modi. We discussed bilateral issues, including defence, trade and technology. We also discussed the importance of critical minerals.”He added, “President Trump considers Prime Minister Modi a great and personal friend. In fact, just before I left for New Delhi, they had an incredible phone call. And that is something that will continue over the weeks and months ahead.”PM Modi wrote on X, “Glad to receive Mr. Sergio Gor, Ambassador-designate of the US to India. I’m confident that his tenure will further strengthen the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.”Earlier in the day, he also held discussions with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Vikram Misri.“We had a great series of meetings,” Gor said, adding that both sides exchanged views on expanding defence ties and economic collaboration.EAM Jaishankar described his meeting with Gor as “productive,” saying on X, “Discussed the India-US relationship and its global significance. Wish him the best for his new responsibility.”Gor, accompanied by US deputy secretary for management and resources Michael J Rigas, is currently on a six-day visit to India.The trip comes amid ongoing strains in India-US relations following Washington’s decision to impose 50 per cent tariffs on Indian exports — including 25 per cent additional duties on crude oil purchases from Russia.Despite these challenges, the recent phone call between PM Modi and Trump, and Gor’s outreach in New Delhi, are being seen as signs of optimism in resetting trade negotiations.Earlier, during his Senate confirmation hearing, Gor had highlighted the “deep friendship” between Trump and PM Modi, calling it a “unique strength” in advancing bilateral relations.He said, “India is a strategic partner whose trajectory will shape the region and beyond.”Gor’s formal presentation of credentials is expected to take place at a later date, according to the US embassy.","Sergio Gor calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’ The two leaders discussed the importance of critical minerals, Gor said.

Sergio Gor Calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’

In a rare gesture, amidst ongoing efforts to repair the India-US relationship, PM Narendra Modi Saturday received US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor who delivered a message to him from President Donald Trump in the form of a framed photograph of their White House press conference earlier this year signed by the president as, “Mr. Prime Minister, you are great!”.Modi later said in a post on X he was glad to meet Gor. “I’m confident that his tenure will further strengthen the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership,” said Modi, who spoke to Trump for the second time in less than a month on Thursday. Gor responded by saying it was an honour to meet Modi, who is considered a “great and personal” friend by Trump, and the relationship with India will only strengthen over the months ahead.Gor’s engagements on Saturday - including with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri - have raised hopes of an early conclusion of the trade talks as well as a summit level meeting. A diplomatic source said positive outcomes are in the works.Gor also said that in his “incredible” meeting with Modi, both sides discussed bilateral issues, including defence, trade, and technology.In the middle of a fresh US-China row over rare earths and critical minerals, he also discussed the importance of critical minerals and the “importance of that to both of our nations”.“The U.S. values its relationship with India, and under the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Modi, I'm optimistic about the days ahead for both of our nations,” said Gor, adding he arrived from Washington in the morning and hit the ground running.It’s rare for the PM to meet an ambassador before the person has assumed office and the development suggests both sides might be within striking distance of a trade deal that could act as an antidote to the dramatic downturn in ties since May this year, if not earlier. The contentious negotiations for the agreement have threatened to undermine other aspects of the relationship. Modi had congratulated Trump on Thursday for the success of his Gaza peace plan, while also endorsing what he described as good progress in the negotiations and said the leaders agreed to being in close touch in the coming weeks.Whether or not that translates into a meeting on the margins of the Asean and East Asia summits in Malaysia later this month remains to be seen. Both leaders are expected to participate, but neither has officially confirmed it yet. Both sides seem keen on a bilateral meeting this year. The possibility of a Quad summit in the next few months is also not ruled out.The ambassador’s appointment has been confirmed by the Senate but he’s currently in India only for a 6-day trip, apparently to familiarise himself with his new responsibility. He will take charge at a later date. After his meeting with Gor, Jaishankar said in a post on X later that he discussed the India-US relationship and its global significance and wished him the best for his new responsibility.Gor is travelling to India, accompanied by deputy secretary for management and resources Michael J Rigas. In his engagements, there was focus on expediting the trade negotiations and building upon the several major initiatives announced during Modi’s visit to Washington in February to further strengthen the relationship. That Trump chose to remind him about the meeting then in the form of the photograph is being viewed positively by India, even as the US shows no sign of lifting the additional 25 percent tariff on India for its oil purchase from Russia.","Sergio Gor presented an autographed photo of PM Modi and Trump.

Sresan Pharma Owner G Ranganathan Arrested In Chennai Over Coldrif Cough Syrup Deaths

DEG test now must for finished products

SIT: Cough syrup case exposes deep systemic failures

BHOPAL: The MP SIT probing the Coldrif tragedy that claimed the lives of 20 kids from Chhindwara and three from other districts is examining the entire supply chain of the cough syrup — from procurement of raw materials to distribution of the contaminated drug — aiming to fix accountability at every stage.Investigators confirmed that Ranganathan Govindan, owner of TN-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals, had procured banned industrial-grade diethylene glycol for manufacturing Coldrif. The SIT is now trying to determine how long the chemical had been in use and whether other individuals or suppliers were complicit in the process.Ranganathan initially feigned ignorance about the cause of contamination, claiming he had delegated production responsibilities to subordinates.Drugs Controller General of India Friday made it mandatory for all raw materials and finished pharmaceutical products to be tested for diethylene glycol (DEG) and ethylene glycol (EG). Testing was earlier required only on raw materials, leaving a gap for toxic solvents to enter the manufacturing process.Ranganathan Govindan, owner of TNbased Sresan Pharmaceuticals, initially said he had no direct knowledge of how the industrial chemical entered the formulation.However, after sustained interrogation, Ranganathan reportedly confessed.“He has identified the person in charge of quality control, who will be detained soon. But this does not absolve Ranganathan of responsibility — he was the signatory authority and owner of the unit,” said a senior officer privy to the probe. The 12-member SIT, led by additional superintendent of police Anjana Tiwari, includes senior police officials and drug control officers. The team has divided its work among sub-groups — one focusing on the manufacturing trail in Tamil Nadu, another on the distribution and retail network in MP, and a third on forensic and toxicological analysis.“We are also looking into the factory’s production system — whether it was automated or semi-automated — besides examining if there was any sabotage angle,” an officer said, adding the technical team is reviewing machinery logs and batch production records to detect irregularities in the blending and testing process. Officials said more arrests are likely as the SIT expands its investigation to include the quality control team, raw material suppliers, and logistics handlers.Tamil Nadu authorities have already sealed Sresan Pharmaceuticals’ manufacturing unit in Sunguvarchatram, Kanchipuram district, after laboratory tests confirmed 48.6% DEG content in the syrup. “This case has exposed deep systemic failures — not just negligence, but a collapse of safety and compliance mechanisms. The probe will continue until every link in the chain is held accountable,” an Special Investigation Team member said. Meanwhile, three children remain in critical condition at hospitals in Nagpur. Teams of doctors and Madhya Pradesh health officials are monitoring their condition round the clock.","MP SIT probing the Coldrif tragedy that claimed the lives of 20 kids from Chhindwara and three from other districts.

Deadly Cough Syrup Case: WHO Points To Regulatory Gap In India

BHOPAL: After the death of 23 children in Madhya Pradesh, including 20 from Chhindwara, following the consumption of Coldrif, a cough syrup laced with the killer chemical diethylene glycol (DEG), Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) Friday made it mandatory to test for both DEG and ethylene glycol (EG) in all raw materials and finished pharmaceutical products.Earlier, such testing was required only for raw materials, leaving a crucial gap that allowed toxic solvents to enter finished syrups undetected. DCGI, which heads Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), is responsible for approving, regulating, and monitoring the quality of medicines in India. Moved by the disaster, Madhya Pradesh Food and Drugs Administration (MPFDA) wrote to DCGI Thursday, urging it to include DEG and EG testing in the “general monograph of the Indian Pharmacopoeia” (IP) — the national rulebook that sets quality standards and test methods for medicines sold in India.Within a few hours of receiving the MPFDA letter, DCGI notified the amendment and directed Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC) — the autonomous scientific body under Union ministry of health and family welfare responsible for setting and updating India’s official drug standards — to take immediate action. IPC Friday issued ‘Amendment List-09’ to IP 2022, officially introducing DEG and EG testing as a mandatory requirement for all oral liquid formulations.It also issued a circular across India, informing all state drug controllers, CDSCO zonal offices, members of the scientific body of IPC, directors of drug testing laboratories, and major industry associations, including IDMA, OPPI, BDMA, FOPE, FSSAI, and SmallScale Industry Associations, to enforce the new testing standards without delay.The order, signed by IPC secretary-cum-scientific director Dr V Kalaiselvan, directs that the amount of DEG and EG shall not exceed 0.10% and must be determined by gas chromatography. TOI is in possession of the MPFDA’s letter to DCGI and the IPC circular. “This closes a critical regulatory loophole exposed by repeated syrup-linked deaths,” an official said, calling it a decisive step toward restoring public trust in India’s drug safety system.","Earlier, such testing was required only for raw materials, leaving a crucial gap that allowed toxic solvents to enter finished syrups undetected. 23 children in Madhya Pradesh, including 20 from Chhindwara, died following the consumption of Coldrif, a cough syrup laced with the killer chemical diethylene glycol (DEG)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124492391,imgsize-1084588,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-34.jpg"

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror

Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021. Earlier, he said the “future of India‑Afghanistan relations seems very bright.”",Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’ It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124491584,width-400,resizemode-4/shehbaz-sharif-left-amir-muttaqi-and-s-jaishankar-file-agencies.jpg"

JAIPUR: A single judge bench of Rajasthan high court (HC) permitted an NEET-UG aspirant to participate in counselling after he was denied admission and his security deposit forfeited due to a minor delay in fee payment. The order was issued on Wednesday during a hearing of the petition filed by the candidate, Narendra Mahala.Justice Sameer Jain's bench ruled that forfeiture of the petitioner's Rs 5 lakh security deposit by the counselling board was arbitrary and constituted ""unjust enrichment"".""The court directed the authorities to permit the student to participate in the third round of counselling and ordered his security deposit to be adjusted against fees of any college he is allotted on merit,"" Tanveer Ahamad, the petitioner's advocate, said.Ahamad said Narendra Mahala, a fatherless student from a modest background, was unable to deposit the full college fee within the stipulated deadline due to death of his great-grandmother on Sept 29, and intervening public holidays. ""Court found delay of a few hours to be bona fide and reasonable,"" Ahamad said.Criticising the mechanical approach of authorities, Justice Jain stated that rigid deadlines should not override principles of equity and welfare, especially in education.""In the tussle between merit and money, the future of bona fide aspirants should not suffer,"" the court observed.Describing the case as an ""unambiguous illustration of the principles governing unjust enrichment,"" the court also directed that a copy of the order be sent to National Medical Commission, secretary of ministry of health and family welfare, and chief secretary, Rajasthan govt, for appropriate scrutiny.

'They shot down five planes': Donald Trump repeats India-Pakistan ceasefire claim for 25th time; Congress calls it 'silver jubilee',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/they-shot-down-five-planes-donald-trump-repeats-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-for-25th-time-congress-calls-it-silver-jubilee/articleshow/122848519.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)

American President Donald Trump on Tuesday night once again claimed credit for helping stop the recent India-Pakistan conflict and said that it was probably going to end up in a ""nuclear war"".""We stopped wars between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,"" Trump said at a reception in the White House.""They shot down five planes and it was back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. I called them and said, 'Listen, no more trade. If you do this, you're not going to be good…' They're both powerful nuclear nations and that would have happened, and who knows where that would have ended up. And I stopped it,"" the US president added.Moreover, the Congress questioned Prime Minister Modi's silence on Trump's repeated claims, saying that he is finding time only to travel abroad and to destabilise democratic institutions at home. ""As the Modi Govt continues in its refusal to give firm dates for a debate on Pahalgam-Sindoor in Parliament and as the Modi Govt persists in its refusal to commit to a reply by the PM in the debate, President Trump reaches the silver jubilee, the quarter century mark on his claims.He has trumpeted 25 times in the last 73 days but the Prime Minister of India is totally quiet - finding time only to travel abroad and to destabilise democratic institutions at home,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.Earlier, an American diplomat told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that recent ""de-escalations"" between India and Pakistan were facilitated by the United States — a claim that echoes President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions of mediating a ceasefire between the two neighbours, though New Delhi has consistently denied any third-party role.""Across the globe, the United States continues to work with parties to disputes, wherever possible, to find peaceful solutions,"" acting US representative smbassador Dorothy Shea said at a UN Security Council open debate on ‘Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes’. The meeting was chaired by Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, as Pakistan holds the rotating presidency of the Council for July.Shea said, ""In the past three months alone, the US leadership has delivered de-escalations between Israel and Iran, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and between India and Pakistan.""""The United States, under President Trump’s leadership, played an important role in encouraging the parties to reach these resolutions, which we applaud and support,"" she added.Meanwhile, India's permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said that India stopped the military operation at the request of Pakistan. ""On achieving its primary objectives, a cessation of military activities was directly concluded at the request of Pakistan,"" he said.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK in response to the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which killed 26 people. This led to four days of clashes between the two sides, which ended on May 10 after an understanding to stop further military actions.Since May 10, the Trump administration has repeatedly said that the US president ""helped settle"" the conflict between India and Pakistan. Trump has also claimed that he told both countries that the US would engage in ""a lot of trade"" with them if they stopped the conflict. However, New Delhi has consistently rejected these claims, saying that the decision to halt military action was made through bilateral channels, following a call initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) to his Indian counterpart.Last week, the US designated The Resistance Front as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. India welcomed the move.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday night once again claimed credit for helping stop the recent India-Pakistan conflict.

NEW DELHI: As Rajya Sabha met Tuesday morning - the second day of Parliament's monsoon session - the effect of Jagdeep Dhankhar's departure weighed heavily in the Upper House. The VP is also the Rajya Sabha chairman.Dhankhar, usually, would not miss chairing RS proceedings at the beginning of the day, but on Tuesday, all eyes were on deputy chairman Harivansh as he strode into the House as the clock struck 11. He greeted MPs with a zealous 'Vanakkam' and started the business of the day by calling the first speaker of zero hour.However, proceedings were disrupted following vociferous protests from opposition MPs who trooped into the well when the chair denied admission of a dozen notices to discuss issues ranging from Dhankhar's ""unexpected and unprecedented"" resignation, special revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, Pahalgam terror attack to Operation Sindoor. RS transacted no business during the day amid repeated adjournments.Similar scenes were witnessed in Lok Sabha which saw almost no business amid opposition protests.The corridors of Parliament were abuzz with speculation over Dhankhar's resignation. When TOI spoke to some MPs - governing and opposition - they said they were baffled by the development.Congress president and LoP in RS Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""He has resigned on his own, and therefore, we don't have to say anything on that because humko khushi bhi nahin hai, gham bhi nahin hai (we are neither happy nor sad).""

Was Justice Varma notice in Rajya Sabha just submitted or was it admitted?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/was-varma-notice-in-rajya-sabha-just-submitted-or-was-it-admitted/articleshow/122848328.cms,"High court judge Yashwant Varma (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: Was the notice for the motion of removal of Allahabad HC Justice Yashwant Varma only ""submitted"" or was it ""admitted"" as well. The seemingly technical issue goes to the heart of the fast-paced events that led to the resignation of Vice-President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday evening.It acquires significance because a determination would decide whether the RS Chairman would have a role in the choice of the three members of the investigation panel which, under the Constitution, would examine the veracity of the charges against Justice Varma.Dhankhar is learnt to have earned the annoyance of the govt and the governing coalition by acknowledging the notice given by 63 opposition MPs to seek the launch of proceedings for the HC judge's ouster. Sources termed it as a ""breach-of-faith"" issue by pointing out that the govt had already announced its decision that the process should start in Lok Sabha and had taken the first step by getting 145 MPs from all parties to sign the notice which was submitted to LS Speaker Om Birla on Monday morning.However, Dhankhar sidestepped this, and the RS notice had signatures of only opposition members. Although technically correct, the decision flew in the face of govt's desire to make the proceedings against Justice Varma an all-party concern.On Monday afternoon in RS, Dhankhar cited the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, to say that in a situation where such a notice is given in both Houses on the same day, ""no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses and where such motion has been admitted in both Houses, the committee shall be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman"".The ex-chairman said that the motion signed by 63 members ""meets the numerical requirement of setting in motion a process for the removal of an HC judge"" - reference to the stipulation that the motion for removal, in case of RS, needed to be signed by at least 50 members. He stopped short of saying whether the motion has been admitted, but emphasised that the chairman or the speaker has no right to admit or reject if ""a motion is presented on the same day in both the Houses"".However, the 1968 Act doesn't mention such a provision. Dhankhar had directed the RS secretary general to take necessary steps.Sources, however, said the final call on the issue will now be that of the deputy chairperson, Harivansh, who started as the officiating chairman after President Droupadi Murmu accepted Dhankhar's resignation.""There is no certainty he would endorse what Dhankhar observed,"" said a source. ""In any case, he has no special interest in matters concerning judiciary and is unlikely to diverge drastically from the speaker in the choice of the members of the inquiry panel,"" the source further said.",Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned as Rajya Sabha Chairman on Monday evening. He is learnt to have earned the annoyance of the govt and the governing coalition by acknowledging the notice given by 63 opposition MPs to seek the launch of proceedings for the HC judge's ouster.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122848450,imgsize-15858,width-400,resizemode-4/122848450.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Election to the vice-president's office must be held ""as soon as possible"" in the event of a vacancy caused by the death, resignation or removal of the incumbent, according to Article 63(2) of the Constitution. In the normal course, however, such an election must be held before expiration of term of the incumbent.A person who is elected to fill such vice-presidential vacancy caused by death, resignation or removal shall have a full term of five years.As per Article 66 of the Constitution, the vice-president is to be elected by an electoral college comprising members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The election follows the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote. In this system, the elector has to mark preferences against the names of the candidates. Preference can be marked in figures only and not in words. The elector can mark as many preferences as the number of candidates. While the marking of first preference is compulsory for the ballot paper to be valid, other preferences are optional.All MPs must vote by secret ballot.Election Commission conducts the election to the office of vice-president in accordance with Article 324 of the Constitution, read with Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952, and the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Rules, 1974.The current electoral college for election of the vice-president comprises 542 Lok Sabha members and 240 Rajya Sabha members. The value of vote of each MP is the same, that is, one.The election process will get underway with announcement of poll schedule by EC, followed by issue of the notification, after which candidates - who must be citizens of India, over 35 years of age and qualified for election to Rajya Sabha - can file their nominations. The returning officer for the election may be secretary general of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and is appointed by EC in consultation with the central govt.Each nomination must be subscribed by at least 20 electors as proposers and 20 electors as seconders. A security deposit of Rs 15,000 is required to be made along with the nomination paper.Polling for a vice-presidential election is taken on Parliament premises only.For marking the vote, the poll panel will supply particular pens to electors in the polling station. Voting by using any other pen shall lead to invalidation of the vote at the time of counting.Political parties cannot issue any whip to their MPs in the matter of voting in the vice-presidential election.During counting, the number of first preference votes secured by each candidate is ascertained and added up. The total is divided by two and one is added to the quotient disregarding any remainder. The resulting number is the quota sufficient for a candidate to secure his return at the election. If at the end of the first or any subsequent count, the total number of votes credited to any candidate is equal to, or greater than the quota, that candidate is declared elected.","Election to the vice-president's office must be held ""as soon as possible"" in the event of a vacancy caused by the death, resignation or removal of the incumbent.

"Can SC fix timeline for President, governor nod to bills? Centre, states' view sought",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-sc-fix-timeline-for-president-governor-nod-to-bills-centre-states-view-sought/articleshow/122848194.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday swiftly entertained President Droupadi Murmu's reference questioning SC's power and jurisdiction to fix timelines for the President and governors in granting, declining or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies while brushing aside 'maintainability' objections by Tamil Nadu and Kerala.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar issued notice to the Union and state govts on the presidential reference under Article 143(1) of the Constitution which seeks the SC's opinion on the correctness of the April 8 judgment of an SC bench led by Justice J B Pardiwala granting deemed assent to Tamil Nadu bills using the SC's exclusive powers under Art 142.The bench said it would post preliminary hearing on July 29 to fix a schedule for detailed hearing on issues raised by the President.Senior advocate K K Venugopal, for Kerala, and P Wilson raised the issue of maintainability of the reference. The bench said all questions raised in the reference were open for consideration. However, it said it would hear all parties on the issue of maintainability and asked Wilson not to raise it repeatedly.The bench said attorney general R Venkataramani would assist the court while solicitor general Tushar Mehta would represent the Union govt.On the opposite side were senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi, Gopal Subramanium and Rakesh Dwivedi.TOI was the first to report on May 15 about the President sending a reference to the SC for its opinion on the contentious issue of judiciary stepping into the domain of the executive, especially when the Constitution gave no power to the SC to grant deemed assent on behalf of the governor to bills.The reference had said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and the President respectively, “does not stipulate any timeframe or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a bill passed by an assembly. “The exercise of constitutional discretion by the governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, respectively, are essentially governed by polycentric considerations, including federalism, uniformity of laws, integrity and security of the nation, doctrine of separation of powers,” the reference had said. Article 200 mandates the governor, on presentation of a bill passed by an assembly, to grant assent or ‘as soon as possible’ return the bill, excluding money bills, for reconsideration by the House. And when the reconsidered bill is presented to the governor, he “shall not withhold assent”, the provision says.However, when a governor reserves a bill for consideration of the President, she under Article 201 is mandated to declare whether she assents to the bill or withholds it. If she directs the governor to return the bill for reconsideration of the House, then upon reconsideration within six months, it “shall be presented again to the President for assent”. It does not fix any timeline for the President.Critical of the SC using its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 bills pending with the TN governor were deemed to have been assented to, the President had said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the governor.”","President Droupadi Murmu questioned SC's power and jurisdiction to fix timelines for the President and governors in granting, declining or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies. Tamil Nadu and Kerala raised the issue of maintainability of the reference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122848202,imgsize-39568,width-400,resizemode-4/122848202.jpg"

Yes, it sends a strong message No, deeper social issues must be addressed





JAIPUR: The brutal murder of a 22-year-old man in Paldi Meena suburb, around 10 km from Jaipur, escalated into widespread protests and unrest, disrupting traffic movement for hours on Jaipur-Agra national highway Monday.The victim, Vipin Kumar, was stabbed around 14 times, allegedly by Mohammad Anas and his associates, late Sunday night in full public view, police said.The protest was finally withdrawn Monday evening after the family's demands for financial compensation, job guarantee and speedy justice were accepted by the administration.Anas, described by police as a ""history-sheeter"" with over a dozen criminal cases against him in Jaipur Commissionerate's Jamdoli police station, allegedly posted on social media claiming ""revenge"" after the attack.The murder sparked outrage, with large crowds gathering Monday morning to protest the killing. Demonstrators attempted multiple road blockades on the national highway, while some protesters targeted and damaged shops allegedly belonging to members of a particular community.Police took swift action and detained accused Mohammad Anas and his five accomplices in the afternoon. During the arrest, Anas allegedly attempted to seize an ASI's service pistol, forcing the police to shoot him in the leg.He was subsequently taken to a hospital for treatment under police custody.DCP (East) Tejaswani Gautam said the motive behind the murder remains under investigation. However, local sources pointed to an ongoing dispute between the victim and the accused spanning two years, despite previous attempts at mediation.Enraged residents claimed Anas had previously threatened multiple families in the area, including Kumar's. ""Anas had been arrested before. Police even paraded him in public, but he only grew bolder,"" said Sunil Khatik, a local resident.The victim's family demanded compensation, including employment guarantee and financial assistance, as they refused to proceed with the postmortem until their demands were met.As family members and locals demanded immediate justice, unrest spread, leading to repeated attempts at blocking traffic on the national highway. Police efforts to control the situation resulted in sporadic clashes, with some demonstrators damaging nearby shops before being pushed back.By the evening, while the size of the agitating crowd diminished, the local community remained insistent on compensation, including a job and financial support for Kumar's family, and the execution of the accused.A large police force, including Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Quick Response Teams (QRT), was deployed throughout the area.The roots of the conflict reportedly trace back two years to an incident involving a goat belonging to Kumar’s family.One sister recalled that the tension began two years ago, when Kumar’s goat strayed into Anas’s lane. Friends of Kumar said a possible dispute over a girl may have played a role. Police said this claim surfaced during early questioning but was unconfirmed.","Vipin Kumar, 22, was stabbed around 14 times, allegedly by Mohammad Anas and his associates.

England playing XI for fourth Test vs India:

Poll Is Liam Dawson's inclusion a good decision by the England selectors? Definitely Not sure No, they should have picked someone else

England have confirmed one change to their playing XI for the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, starting Wednesday. Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson replaces the injured Shoaib Bashir, marking his first Test appearance since July 2017.Dawson, a seasoned domestic performer, offers depth with both bat and ball on what is expected to be a spin-friendly surface in Manchester.Dawson steps in for Shoaib Bashir, who suffered a broken finger on his left hand during the first innings of last week's Lord's Test but showed great resilience by taking the final wicket to secure a 2-1 series lead for England. Bashir has since undergone surgery, with a wire inserted into his left pinkie to ensure proper healing. In Bashir's absence, Dawson will earn his fourth Test cap, with his last appearance dating back to July 2017 against South Africa.As a left-arm spinner, Dawson has claimed 371 first-class wickets. He has been particularly impressive in recent seasons, with 12 of his 15 five-wicket hauls—including three ten-wicket matches—coming since 2021. Since the start of the 2023 season, he has taken 124 wickets for Hampshire at an average of 25.64, complemented by 956 runs at 59.75, which earned him the prestigious men's PCA Player of the Year award last year.This summer, Dawson's performance includes 21 wickets at an average of 40.04, with an economy rate of 2.55, along with 536 runs at 44.66. Over the past five seasons, he has scored nine first-class centuries, including three in 2023 and three in 2024.His recent recall to the England squad marks a surprising turnaround, after seeming to have finished his international career. Earlier this summer, he returned to the T20I side after a three-year hiatus, delivering a notable performance of 4 for 20 against the West Indies in his comeback match, captained by England's newly appointed limited-overs captain, Harry Brook.""He's a wily, old fox,"" Brook said at Emirates Old Trafford on Monday. ""He's very experienced and a very skilful cricketer.

With support from Eknath Shinde, who split the Shiv Sena, the MVA government collapsed, and the BJP returned to power in alliance with the Shinde-led Sena faction.

""A 15-year-old girl, allegedly set on fire by three masked men in Odisha’s Puri district, was transferred to AIIMS New Delhi, where she remains in stable condition with 70-75%burn injuries.The class 9 dropout was walking to a relative’s home around 8.30am Saturday when she was reportedly intercepted near a river embankment, rendered unconscious by a chemical-lacedcloth, and doused with kerosene before being set ablaze.Screaming for help, she fled to a nearby house, where Dukshishyam Senapati extinguished the flames and gave her fresh clothes.Recalling the harrowing moment, Senapati said that when he answered his door, he was stunned to find the girl engulfed in flames and crying in agony, as he later explained to DGP YB Khurania during the official's site visit.""It was around 8.30 am when the girl came to my house, screaming. With the help of my wife, I doused the fire and gave her water as she was very thirsty.Later, the women of my family changed her clothes,"" he said.Upon questioning, the girl informed Senapati that three unidentified men had set her ablaze.

He explained that the attackers fled after setting her alight, presumably expecting her to perish. However, the girl managed to escape and reach his house.Due to delayed ambulance response, they resorted to an auto rickshaw for hospital transport. The girl remained at his residence for approximately 90 minutes.The incident has created fear in the village, particularly among children who are now afraid to venture out alone.

NEW DELHI: The auxiliary power unit (APU) located in the tail section of an Air India Airbus A321 (TV-TVG) caught fire at Delhi airport when passengers were disembarking from the aircraft after its arrival from Hong Kong on Tuesday. The aircraft, which had about 170 people on board, was damaged. Luckily passengers and crew were unhurt. The airline has reported this to the regulator. Sources say this could be due to a maintenance issue.An AI spokesperson said: “Flight AI 315, operating from Hong Kong to Delhi on July 22, 2025, experienced an APU fire shortly after it had landed and parked at the gate. The incident occurred while passengers had begun disembarking, and the APU was automatically shut down as per system design. There was some damage to the aircraft, however, passengers and crew members disembarked normally, and are safe. The aircraft has been grounded for further investigations and the regulator has been duly notified. ”According to aviation website Skybrary, APU allows an aircraft to operate autonomously without reliance on ground support equipment such as a ground power unit, an external air-conditioning unit or a high pressure air start cart.“The APU is a small jet engine which is normally located in the tail cone of the aircraft but, in some cases, is located in an engine nacelle or in the wheel well. The APU can be started utilising only the aircraft battery(s) and, once running, will provide electrical power to aircraft systems as well as bleed air for AC and for engine start,” the website says.There have been instances of APU failure of APU fire both on ground and inflight globally. In June 2016, the cabin of a fully loaded Airbus A330 of a foreign airline on ground at London Heathrow was engulfed with smoke and an emergency evacuation had to be initiated. Investigation found that the smoke had been caused when an APU seal failed and hot oil entered the bleed air supply.Also Read: Runway scare: 3 tyres burst, engine damaged as Air India flight veers off course during landing at Mumbai airport In July 2013, passengers still boarding an Air France Boeing 777-300 at Paris CDG felt a burning smell and then thin smoke in the cabin.

No one can hold on to a govt bungalow indefinitely.""The MLA's counsel Anil Mishra told SC that the rent demand for two years at Rs 21 lakh was exorbitant and requested the court to examine this issue. But the bench remained firm, forcing him to withdraw the petition to avail other remedies available in accordance with law.Singh, a five-time MLA from Dhaka constituency, resigned in March 2014 to contest Lok Sabha elections, which he lost. He was later nominated to the bureau. His petition against the demand of rent was dismissed by Patna HC, which had said the 2009 notification did not entitle him to continue in the bungalow earmarked for legislators.""It nowhere provides that a former MLA can retain the same quarters. The notification only allows general benefits such as accommodation, not a specific entitlement to a previous allocation,"" HC had said. It had asked Singh to pay 6% interest per annum on the amount due as rent to Bihar govt.The SC in two renowned judgments - 'Lok Prahari' and 'S D Bandi' cases - had ruled that public figures cannot unauthorisedly occupy govt bungalows using their clout and had ordered all govts to take eviction action against such occupants.","Former Bihar MLA Avinash Kumar Singh was ordered to pay a penal rent of Rs 21 lakh for overstaying at his govt bungalow.

Poll Do you believe businesses should display owner information publicly? Yes, it's necessary for transparency. No, it invades privacy

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed dhaba and restaurant owners along the Kanwar Yatra route to comply with the Uttar Pradesh government’s mandate requiring the display of licence and registration information.“At this stage, all the respective hotel owners shall comply with the mandate of license and registration certificate as required statutorily. We make it clear that we’re not going into the issues being argued. The application stands closed”, the top court stated in its order, as quoted by ANI.Earlier this year, the Uttar Pradesh government issued an order requiring eateries to display QR codes containing information about their owners. Shortly afterward, the Uttarakhand government issued a similar directive.Last week, the apex court had issued notices to the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.The petition, filed by academic Apoorvanand Jha and others, argues that such requirements violate citizens’ fundamental rights and could lead to discriminatory profiling.“The new measures mandate the display of QR codes on all eateries along the Kanwar route, which reveal the names and identities of the owners, thereby achieving the same discriminatory profiling that was previously stayed by this court,” said Jha, citing a June 25 UP government press release.""Vague and overbroad directives deliberately mix up the licensing requirements with the other unlawful demand to display religious identity, and leave scope for violent enforcement of such a manifestly arbitrary demand both by vigilante groups and by authorities on the ground. There is grave and imminent risk of irreparable injury to the fundamental rights of affected vendors, particularly from minority communities, unless this Court issues immediate directions to restrain Respondents from continuing this indirect implementation,"" it added.The plea urged the Court to restrict such mandates to standard licensing norms and eliminate vague directives requiring identity disclosures.Last year, the top court had restrained the UP and Uttarakhand governments from enforcing directives that required shop owners and hawkers along the Kanwar Yatra routes to display their names and those of their staff at their establishments.The Court held that food sellers were only obligated to indicate the type of food they were offering. In its 22 July order, the Court said: ""We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives. In other words, the food sellers (including dhaba owners, restaurants, foods and vegetable sellers, hawkers, etc) may be required to display the kind of food that they are serving to the kanwariyas. But they must not be forced to display the name/identity of the owners and the employees deployed in their respective establishments.""","The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed dhaba and restaurant owners along the Kanwar Yatra route to comply with the Uttar Pradesh government’s mandate.

NEW DELHI: SC Monday refused to entertain a petition filed by Samajwadi Party (SP) questioning eviction of the party from a Pilibhit municipality-owned building, and said when a governing political party abuses or misuses its powers to illegally allot buildings to itself, it faces difficulties when it is not in power.Brushing aside spirited arguments from senior advocate Siddharth Dave, Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said, ""If you (the party) misuse and abuse its powers to get municipality buildings allotted to itself, then it you cannot complain when the allotment gets cancelled when it is not in power.""Refusing to grant time to SP to vacate the premises, SC said, ""You do not remember the law when you are in a position to abuse your power. Or else, how do you get a prime municipal bungalow for Rs 150 monthly rent? We will not interfere with the Allahabad HC order. People in the country should feel there is rule of law which applies equally to everyone, including political parties.""The office premises at a prime location in Civil Lines near Nakatadhana square in Pilibhit was allotted to SP in March 2005 at a monthly rent of Rs 150. After more than 20 years, the municipality sent an eviction notice to SP on June 6, and four days later, came with police force to evict the party. It, however, relented after the SP district president gave an undertaking that the premises would be vacated by June 16.On June 18, the municipality asked the party to vacate in three days. The authorities locked the premises on June 23. A challenge to the eviction before HC was dismissed on July 2.","SC refuses to entertain a petition filed by Samajwadi Party questioning eviction of the party from a Pilibhit municipality-owned building.

Dhankhar's move to examine oppn's notice raised suspicions

NEW DELHI: ""Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar ji has had many opportunities to serve our country in various capacities, including as Vice-President of India. Wishing him good health,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X, shortly after President Droupadi Murmu accepted Dhankhar's resignation.Going by sendoff messages for politicians, the post was starkly terse and conveyed the tension that resulted in Dhankhar's abrupt resignation as vice-president on Monday evening. Political circles were quick to note that the PM had refrained from commenting on the outgoing VP's functioning as chairman of the Rajya Sabha: something that was taken as confirmation that Dhankhar's decision on Monday to admit the opposition's notice for the motion of removal of Allahabad HC's Justice Yashwant Varma, despite having known the govt's decision to start the process in the Lok Sabha (which TOI had reported on Tuesday, had not gone down well).The contrast from the effusive praise for Dhankhar three years ago, when the Modi govt elevated him to the second highest constitutional position, was glaring and fully captured the radical change in equations since he was plucked from near-obscurity to be appointed governor of West Bengal in 2019, a big ""opportunity"" that had come his way courtesy the current central dispensation.If brevity was the PM's chosen weapon to convey the disappointment, his senior cabinet colleagues said it all through sheer silence on their X handles.NDA partners were also equally conspicuous by their reticence, the sole exception being the Andhra ally, Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan.The 'cancellation' was a measure of the annoyance Dhankhar managed to generate by his moves through Monday, starting with his unusual generosity towards LOP Mallikarjun Kharge.The then Chairman, whom the opposition had relentlessly targeted for being partisan, chose to let Kharge speak ahead of the leader of the House and health minister J P Nadda, although by convention, the latter should have been given precedence.That Kharge launched a sharp attack on govt and the PM over the Pahalgam terror attack and US President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claim of having forced India and Pakistan to halt Operation Sindoor only added to the irritation that had begun to build up on treasury benches and which found expression in Nadda's uncharacteristic ""only what I say is going to be on record"" assertion to protesting opposition members.But it took the second 'provocation' of the day - Dhankhar's announcement post-lunch about having received a notice from 63 members in support of a motion for the removal of Justice Varma, and his directive to examine where it would stand vis-a-vis a similar move made by 153 members in the Lok Sabha earlier in the day - that turned the smouldering annoyance into anger and, crucially, sparked suspicion about his intent.All signatories to the RS notice were, in contrast to the all-party complexion of what had earlier been submitted in Lok Sabha, from the opposition - something which militated against govt's known desire for a ""consensus"" backing for action against Justice Varma's alleged corruption and could not have escaped Dhankhar's attention. Dhankhar's indulgence of the opposition would have ensured him a say in the choice of the three-member panel that is required to go into the charges of corruption against the judge.Already upset with him over the barbs he would routinely train at the judiciary, as well as the perception that they were officially sponsored, govt did not take kindly at the meddling.Similar activism from Dhankhar had earlier led Supreme Court to drop its inquiry against Allahabad high court Justice Shekhar Yadav in a case of alleged hate speech and fling the ball back into the Rajya Sabha's court.What followed was a flurry of moves. Amid deepening suspicions about the intent and buzz of a ""secret deal"", BJP managers scrambled to get the NDA contingent to sign off on a similar notice. Such was the hurry that many RS members trooping into the chamber of defence minister Rajnath Singh did not even get to see the text of the notice as they put their signatures on the paper put up before them.Simultaneously, both Nadda and parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju decided to skip the business advisory committee meeting Dhankhar had convened in the evening, leaving it for minister of state L Murugan and BJP's chief whip K Laxman to represent the governing side.The message for Dhankhar was clear and he lost little time in heeding it. Just hours later, he rushed to the Rashtrapati Bhavan to submit his resignation on ""health"" grounds.The dominant estimate in political circles is that he is not going to quietly fade away. Many feel the Supreme Court lawyer, who started off with Janata Dal and did a stint with Congress before landing in BJP, may launch himself in a different version: as a farm leader.There was also a sudden outbreak of ""sympathy"" for him in opposition quarters, with even Congress and Trinamool Congress, his chief tormentors, seeking to portray him as a victim.But he appeared to be receding from the proceedings he would lord over when presiding officer Ghanshyam Tiwari announced that his resignation had been accepted.",Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned as vice-president of India on Monday evening.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has slammed the Telangana Police for converting a civil land dispute into a criminal case at the behest of an influential builder to arrest and harass a retired Major General's 70-year-old widow, quashed the FIR and asked the complainant to pay Rs 10 lakh to her.The Delhi-based woman owned a 500 square yard plot in Gachibowli village in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district. In 2020, the complainant approached her husband for sale of the plot, then valued at Rs 7 crore. Before the deal could materialise, the retired Army officer passed away. As his wife and daughter found it difficult to manage the plot from Delhi, they orally agreed in Oct 2020 to sell it to the complainant for Rs 5.75 crore.The complainant paid Rs 4.05 crore through banking channels and later claimed he had paid Rs 75 lakh in cash. When the officer's widow demanded the balance and refused to sign the sale deed, the complainant lodged a complaint in Dec 2020. Police registered an FIR and arrested her in Jan 2021, resulting in eight-day incarceration. She had unsuccessfully moved Telangana high court for quashing the FIR.Accepting the woman's arguments presented through advocate Vanshaja Shukla, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta slammed the Telangana Police and said, ""In gross disregard to all tenets of law, the impugned FIR was registered for allegations which had no elements of any offence whatsoever what to talk of a cognizable offence.""Writing the judgment, Justice Mehta said, ""The fact that the widow was arrested in this frivolous FIR clearly shows the clout of the company, of which the complainant is an agent, on the police agency as not only did the complainant manage to get FIR registered but, thereafter, also saw to it that she is arrested and humiliated by keeping her in custody for eight days.""SC also criticised the high court for dealing with her quashing plea in a pedantic manner. The HC disposed of her petition in a cryptic manner without even touching the merits of the case, the apex court said.During the hearing of the appeal in SC, the woman had offered to return Rs 4.05 crore paid by the complainant, who refused and demanded interest on the amount to settle the dispute.SC said, ""It is a fit case wherein the complainant should be penalised with exemplary cost for misusing the process of criminal law in a case which was of purely civil nature."" It directed him to pay Rs 10 lakh to her and directed police to provide her security whenever she is in town to deal with her land.","The Delhi-based woman owned a 500 square yard plot in Gachibowli village in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district.

NEW DELHI: The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Tuesday rejected an appeal from Congress against the I-T department for withdrawing a tax exemption to the party for the assessment year 2018-19 and adding Rs 199 crore as its income through donations.The tribunal, headed by judicial member Satbeer Singh Godara and comprising M Balaganesh, declined to interfere with the department's assessment order against Congress. The I-T order rejected Congress's tax exemption for not filing returns for AY 2018-19 by the due date, and thus, added the income of Rs 199 crore to the party, on which it will be liable to pay tax.The appellate tribunal also refused to allow Congress to net its income against the expenditure on the grounds that it had violated section 13(A) of the I-T Act. The order also found violations of receiving cash donations of more than Rs 14 lakh, which were over Rs 2,000 each. Election Commission guidelines mandate that any donation above Rs 2,000 has to be through bank transfer. Congress's appeal was first rejected by the Commissioner of I-T (Appeal) after which the party approached the tribunal in March 2023.""Whether the assessee's impugned section 13A exemption claim violates clauses (b) and (d) of the first proviso thereto is concerned, we have already held that its return filed on Feb 2, 2019, was a time barred one, and the same stands academic and rejected accordingly,"" the bench observed.On the question of ""netting"" basis - claiming corresponding expenditure against receipts - the tribunal noted that the ""High Court's decision has concluded the very issue in the department's favour - the legal position is that no deduction can be allowed with respect to the expenditure incurred by the political party for any purpose whatsoever if it fails to comply with the basic requirements of the Act's section 13A. """"We thus conclude that given the fact the assessee has been held to have violated section 13A, third proviso in not filing its return within the prescribed due date, its impugned netting claim also deserves to be declined in very terms,"" the tribunal said dismissing Congress' appeal.","I-T department withdrew a tax exemption to the party for the assessment year 2018-19 and added Rs 199 crore as its income through donations.

'HC discarded confessions on technicalities'

NEW DELHI: A day after Bombay high court quashed the conviction of all 12 accused found guilty a decade ago for the 2006 Mumbai train blasts that killed 187 and injured 824 people, Supreme Court Tuesday agreed to hear on Thursday an appeal filed by Maharashtra govt challenging the acquittals.State govt told the apex court that HC misdirected itself into trivialities and misread cogent evidence, leading to failure of justice.Evidence had been meticulously collected by the prosecution to establish a chain, inculpating the accused for specific roles discharged by them to strike terror at the heart of the economic capital of India and wage a war against the country, govt added.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench led by CJI BR Gavai, “It (the plea) requires urgent hearing as it has serious ramifications. Can it be listed for hearing on Wednesday?” Gavai said he learnt from news reports that eight accused have already been released from prison. SG said it was true, but the petition required urgent hearing. Finding additional solicitor general Rajkumar Bhaskar Thakre alongside the SG, the CJI said, “It was Thakre who had argued the case before HC. We will list the petition for hearing the day after tomorrow (Thursday).”HC on Monday had acquitted all 12 accused, five of whom were awarded death penalty and the rest life sentences, in the case relating to seven coordinated bomb blasts in as many crowded suburban trains within six minutes from 6.23pm on July 11, 2006. In Sept 2015, the special trial court for crimes under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act had convicted the 12 accused while acquitting one.Maharashtra govt told SC that the evidence clearly pointed to central role of LeT commander Azam Cheema, a Pakistani national, and two other accused who masterminded the attack on Mumbai by sending three groups of terrorists from Pakistan who entered India through Kutch, Gujarat, and through various entry points to India from Bangladesh and Nepal. It said the confessions of the accused persons, admissible under MCOCA, were discarded by the HC on technicalities even when they formed a chain of events and outlined the conspiracy to launch the sinister attack on Mumbai suburban trains, which were full of people returning from offices, and cause maximum loss of lives."," Bombay high court quashed the conviction of all 12 accused found guilty a decade ago.

NEW DELHI: Parliament on Tuesday witnessed a strong opposition offensive against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, with members across party lines forcing a washout of proceedings in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, and holding a sit-in in the Parliament complex.INDIA bloc members Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, Kanimozhi, TR Baalu, Misa Bharti, Manoj Jha, Kalyan Banerjee, KC Venugopal and a host of other MPs gathered at the main gate of the Parliament building, where they raised slogans against the SIR and demanded that it be scrapped.At the meeting of the INDIA bloc in the chamber of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, the opposition decided to take up the issue in the two Houses to ensure that the urgent concern of RJD was not overshadowed by the controversy over Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor in the opening days of the Monsoon session.The issue figured prominently in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha that failed to transact any business. The opposition has listed Election Commission's electoral rolls review in poll-bound Bihar as its top priority alongside the terror attack for discussion. Congress whip Manickam Tagore said, ""In the first half, LoP (in LS) Rahul Gandhi wanted to speak but he was not allowed, just like Monday. We want a discussion on SIR which is a govt conspiracy to take away the right to vote of the poor. """,MPs across party lines forced a washout of proceedings in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha.

NEW DELHI: The first truly supersonic fighters to be inducted by the Indian Air Force from Russia in 1963 but plagued by an alarmingly high crash rate in later years, the MiG-21s will fly for the last time in Indian skies this Sept.The IAF is now left with only two MiG-21 'Bison' squadrons, totalling 36 fighters, at the Nal airbase in Rajasthan. The ceremonial farewell for the MiG-21s, after over six decades in service, which saw the old warhorses take part in all major conflicts, will take place at Chandigarh on Sept 19.After the first lot of MiG-21s were inducted from Russia, the single-engine jets were produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited in large numbers and also underwent upgrades later. The highly-unforgiving and ageing MiG-21s, however, continued to lack modern systems with built-in safety mechanisms.Huge delays in the production of the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, which were supposed to replace the virtually obsolete MiG-21s, means that the IAF will now be left with just 29 fighter squadrons. This when the IAF authorised 42.5 squadrons for the collusive challenge from China and Pakistan.TOI had earlier reported the two remaining MiG-21 squadrons will be retired this year after the IAF repeatedly deferred the phasing out of the delta-wing jets due to the depletion in the number of its fighter squadrons. The MiG-21 jets and the Cheetah/Chetak helicopters, which number around 350 in the armed forces, in particular, should have been retired at least a couple of decades ago.Of the 872 MiG-21s progressively inducted by IAF, over 400 were lost in accidents since 1971-72. Crashes of different MiG variants, the bulk of them being MiG-21s, have killed well over 200 pilots and 50 civilians on the ground over the decades. The MiG-21s, however, did play a stellar role especially during the 1965 and 1971 wars.","The first truly supersonic fighters to be inducted by the Indian Air Force from Russia in 1963.

NAVI MUMBAI: This is no flight of fancy. A Greater flamingo found injured in Nerul's NRI wetland, whose left leg had to be amputated, could soon take to the skies again.Makarand Saraf, a lecturer from Mumbai's All India Institute of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, and his team have successfully fitted a prosthesis on the adolescent bird. However, since the artificial leg only enables it to walk, not fly, the team's next goal is an improvised prosthesis that will help it take wing.The bird, suspected to have got its leg entangled in a fishing net or nylon fishing line, was first spotted by wildlife photographer Abhijit Chattopadhyay, who alerted forest officials led by Vikas Bairagi. After initial treatment, it was released back into the wetlands on May 15. But with it hovering around the same spot, the team decided to give it a prosthetic leg to help it move around.With Dr Anil Gaur, director of the institute, green-signalling the project, Saraf, Chattopadhyay and Bairagi took measurements for the prosthesis on May 17 using a plaster of Paris cast but abandoned a foam impression after noticing the bird's distress from human contact.Two firms then stepped in. Amit Mukerji, director-special projects at Otto Bock Healthcare India Pvt Ltd, supported prosthesis fabrication, while Rushabh Shah of Podiapro India Pvt Ltd provided the inner lining material, with technical inputs from Bhoomiksha Rathore.The team redesigned the leg from a closed-foot to a single-toe open foot with side support to solve buoyancy challenges and fitted it on July 6. The artificial leg has improved the flamingo's balance, mobility and its survival chances.A July 19 check showed no fitment or skin issues.Saraf said, ""The carbon fibre impregnated with a matrix of acrylic resin (carbon fibre used in manufacture of aeroplane parts and F1 racing cars) helped keep the prosthesis light, strong, waterproof, and durable - suitable for a wading bird's lifestyle.""","Greater flamingo found injured in Nerul's NRI wetland.

The move came after the June 12 crash of AI-171 in Ahmedabad. Both engines of the London-bound Dreamliner lost power mid-air soon after take-off.According to preliminary probe, fuel supply was cut off when FCS switches for engines 1 & 2 moved from ""run"" to ""cut-off"" - one after the other - with a gap of one second.

Cong’s J&K statehood stir leaves ally NC sulking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congs-jk-statehood-stir-leaves-ally-nc-sulking/articleshow/122843660.cms,"Omar Abdullah.

SRINAGAR: As Congress launched protests in Delhi on Tuesday for restoration of J&K’s statehood, chief minister Omar Abdullah voiced displeasure at not being consulted or informed by its INDIA bloc ally.“Let them talk to us first. We only read about these things (protests) in newspapers. No one reached out to us. Even during the recent INDIA bloc meeting (July 19), there was no mention of these things. Had they informed us, we would have joined,” Omar said when asked if NC would back Congress’s agitation.Omar’s statements mirrored “quiet frustration” within the ranks of his National Conference (NC) over Congress’s “sudden interest” in the issue, with some fearing such protests could delay statehood as the Narendra Modi-led NDA govt at the Centre would not want to be seen buckling under opposition pressure.Omar pointed out that statehood restoration had been a long-standing demand of his govt and his party. “We passed a resolution for it in the very first cabinet meeting (Oct 2024) and later in the assembly. It is good that Congress is finally remembering this issue after a long time. But if they need our support, they should first talk to us,” Omar said.On July 17, Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to Prime Minister Modi demanding statehood restoration by bringing a bill in Parliament’s ongoing monsoon session.Two days later, Congress held protests in Kashmir on the issue.NC sources said they were caught off guard by Congress’s letter to the PM and the subsequent protests. “At a time when we believed the Modi govt was showing some inclination towards restoring statehood, it was prudent for Congress to wait until the end of the monsoon session,” a senior NC functionary said.By jumping the gun, Congress may have politicised a sensitive issue and, possibly, delayed the restoration, NC sources said. “Modi govt is unlikely to give any impression that it is yielding to opposition pressure, even though the restoration of J&K’s statehood is its own commitment. Congress should have taken the CM (Omar) and NC into confidence before writing to the PM or going for the protests,” the NC senior said.",Omar Abdullah voiced displeasure at not being consulted or informed by its INDIA bloc ally.

Rahul Gandhi heads to Hathras amid Sambhal row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-heads-to-hathras-amid-sambhal-row/articleshow/116234547.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi on Thursday headed to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, a day after the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha along with Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi paid a visit to the families of five people who died in the Sambhal violence on November 24.Security arrangements were amped up in Boolgarhi village as he might meet the family of the 2020 rape victim.Reacting to his visit, state deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak said, ""Rahul Gandhi, you have a feeling of despair, you are a victim of frustration. You do not even know that the CBI has investigated Hathras case. The case is going on in the court...Today Uttar Pradesh is moving ahead rapidly to become the number 1 state in terms of infrastructure, in terms of law and order. The law and order of Uttar Pradesh is discussed in the whole nation. Today we can say that industrial revolution is coming in Uttar Pradesh.""""Whereas you want to throw Uttar Pradesh into the fire of anarchy, in the fire of riots, you want to incite people. Please do not do this, I request you that Uttar Pradesh is getting ready to become the number 1 state in the whole nation,"" he added.Rahul had met the family in 2020 and had also accused the Yogi Adityanath-government of ""exploitation"" and unleashing ""atrocities"" on the victim's family.""See, #Hathras what kind of exploitation and atrocities the victim's family had to face at the hands of the UP government. It is very important for every Indian to know the truth about the injustice done to him,"" he had said in a post on X.Exactly four years after the brutal murder and alleged sexual assault of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras on September 14, 2020, her family has yet to immerse her ashes, stating they are still waiting for justice. In an interview with TOI, the family expressed their frustration, saying they continue to live in ""jail-like conditions"" with restrictions on their movement and social interactions, while being surrounded by security personnel 24/7.The family also highlighted that promises made by the government, such as providing a job for a family member and a house, have remained unfulfilled. They further expressed their disappointment over the legal proceedings, with three of the accused being acquitted and only one sentenced to life imprisonment. According to the family, the release of the alleged perpetrators has denied them justice.","Rahul Gandhi on Thursday headed to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, a day after the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha along with Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi paid a visit to the families of five people who died in the Sambhal violence.

History will never forgive those not allowing level playing field: Sibal after opposition's no trust motion against VP Dhankhar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/history-will-never-forgive-those-not-allowing-level-playing-field-sibal-after-oppositions-no-trust-motion-against-vp-dhankhar/articleshow/116232950.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal on Thursday called the notice seeking the removal of vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar as the chairman of the Rajya Sabha an ""unprecedented"" move and a ""sad day for the mother of democracy"".Continuing his attack Sibal said that the history would never forgive those who ""do not allow a level playing field in the functioning of the House.""Earlier, Sibal had slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party for politicising the current proceedings of the House.""The point is that what we are seeing is played out in the House is politics. We really don't have to go to what one party said over the other. We only have to see the proceedings of the House. What is happening in the House is only politics. The people of India should know where the Rajya Sabha Chairman stands. For it, you just need to see the proceedings of the Parliament. They (BJP) will not allow it (Opposition's no-confidence motion against Rajya Sabha Chairman) to be moved. They will reject it. And that is politics,"" he told news agency ANI.Sibal's comments came just a day after the INDIA bloc upped the ante against Dhankhar with Congress chief Malikarjun Kharge calling the vice president speaker the ""biggest disruptor"" of the House. Addressing a press conference, Kharge had alleged that the vice president's loyalty is towards the ""ruling party"" and that ""he is acting as a government spokesperson for the sake of his next promotion.""""We have no hesitation in saying that the biggest disruptor in the Rajya Sabha is the Chairman himself,"" Kharge said.""His loyalty is towards the ruling party, instead of the Constitution and constitutional traditions. We can see that he is acting as a government spokesperson for the sake of his next promotion,"" he added.Kharge's comments were backed up by ally-Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut who said that Dhankhar was not running the Rajya Sabha but instead ""running a circus""“I have never seen such a terrible situation before, and our Chairman Sahib enjoys, enjoys. He is not running the Parliament, he is running a circus,” said the Shiv Sena (UBT) MP said.Meanwhile, the vice president while speaking at an event in Jaipur said that there is a ""well-planned effort going on to disintegrate the country, divide the country.""""There are some forces in the country and outside which are unable to digest India's progress. There is a well-planned effort going on to disintegrate the country, divide the country and insult its institutions. We must neutralize in togetherness every anti-national narrative,"" Dhankhar said.Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Naseer Hussain, representing the Opposition, submitted a notice on Tuesday to Rajya Sabha Secretary General P C Mody. The notice carried signatures from 60 opposition MPs, comprising members from various parties including the Congress, RJD, TMC, CPI, CPI-M, JMM, AAP, DMK, and Samajwadi Party.The Rajya Sabha's chairman position is automatically held by the vice president as an ex-officio role.","Kapil Sibal called the notice seeking the removal of vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar as the chairman of the Rajya Sabha an ""unprecedented"" move and a ""sad day for the mother of democracy"" Sibal said that the history would never forgive those who ""do not allow a level playing field in the functioning of the House""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116232944,imgsize-1723253,width-400,resizemode-4/116232944.jpg"
Supreme Court to take up today validity of Places of Worship Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-take-up-today-validity-of-places-of-worship-act/articleshow/116230991.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: A day before the Supreme Court hearing on a batch of petitions challenging the validity of Places of Worship Act , citizens from various walks of life, including noted academicians, historians, former IAS and IPS officers, MPs and political parties have filed applications in support of the law, saying it was intended to safeguard secularism and to ensure communal harmony.They told the court that the petition seeking scrapping of the law was based on complete ignorance of history and glossed over the fact that Hindu kings too demolished Hindu temples, Buddhist shrines and Jain temples of conquered territories and installed their own structures in their place.Countering submission that many religious structures were taken over and converted to mosques when Mughals invaded the country, some of the applicants said even if it was assumed that certain mosques were constructed after demolishing Hindu temples by invaders, then such claims could have no end, as many Hindu temples were erected on ruins of Buddhist stupas and Buddhists could claim a right to restore such temples to stupas. They said the Act was brought to put an end to the controversy and to maintain peace and communal harmony.Some of the prominent people who approached SC separately or in groups included former Punjab DGP Julio Ribeiro, former chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah, former Delhi LG Najeeb Jung, former chief election commissioner S Y Quraishi, Lt Gen Zamiruddin Shah (retired), former home secretary Gopal Krishna Pillai, noted historians Romila Thapar and Mridula Mukherjee, and MPs Manoj Jha of RJD and Thol Thirumavalavan of VCK. The common theme in their pleas was that the 1991 Act was meant to preserve India's social fabric and foster communal harmony and opposed reopening of settled issues concerning religious sites.Applications have also been filed in support of the petitioners to scrap the Act. Delhi-based NGO Hindu Shree Foundation , which claims to represent interests and rights of Hindu devotees both domestically and internationally, said the Act was arbitrary and there was no justification to fix a cut-off date of Aug 15, 1947. It said there was no rational nexus between political independence and creation of Republic of India and settling the civilisational conflict emanating from colonial erasure of Hindu identity and an imposition of cultural hegemony by Islamic invaders.Former MP Chintamani Malviya, too, filed an application alleging that the law itself was violative of secularism and should be done away with. ""The Act is void and unconstitutional for many reasons. It offends rights of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs to pray, profess, practice and propagate religion. It deprives them from owning religious properties belonging to deity misappropriated by other communities. It takes away their right of judicial remedy. Centre has transgressed its legislative power by barring remedy of judicial review which is a basic feature of the Constitution. SC, in a catena of decisions, held that right to judicial remedy cannot be taken away by the state,"" he said.A joint plea filed by Ribeiro, Habibullah, ex-IFS officer Deb Mukharji and ex-IAS officer Kamal Kant Jaswal said the questions raised in this case by the petitioners stemmed from a ""strong majoritarian and anti-minorities bias"" which is an anathema to the Constitution.""The petition shows a complete ignorance of history, since it glosses over the fact that rulers demolished places of worship of subjugated dynasties and kingdoms across Indian history and across religious sects. Critical historical scholarship shows that in the pre-Islam era, several situations of religious conflict existed between Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu sects,"" they said.The joint application filed by Jung, Quraishi, Pillai and others said, ""This country has been the cradle of not only one of the oldest human civilisations but several religions and religious denominations. It is also a matter of record that there have been struggles for supremacy and propagation of religion throughout the history of this nation. In the above circumstances, the Act was enacted with the avowed objective of not letting past acts/omissions on the part of one religious group or the other, destroy the destiny of future generations and, hence, the Act is pivotal for maintaining communal harmony and preventing conflicts that may arise from disputes having historical trappings.""","Citizens from various walks of life have filed applications in support of the law.

Oppn likely to move for removal of Allahabad HC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oppn-likely-to-move-for-removal-of-allahabad-hc-judge/articleshow/116230655.cms,"Digvijay Singh

Judge removal idea floated by Digvijay Singh, backed by Sibal, Tankha

NEW DELHI: The opposition is set to file a motion in the Rajya Sabha for removal of Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav, whose controversial comments on a uniform civil code and Muslims at a VHP event triggered a major row, with even Supreme Court seeking a report from HC.While the motion is likely to be submitted to RS secretary general on Thursday, there is a concern in the opposition camp that the Upper House office may not admit the motion. As a follow-up, the INDIA bloc is likely to file a writ petition in SC against the rejection. The opposition argues that acceptance or rejection of the motion by the Rajya Sabha constitutes administrative action, which is justiciable.The opposition is accusing Justice Yadav of "" hate speech and incitement to communal harmony "", which are violative of the Constitution. Crucially, the petition is likely to charge Yadav with entering into a public debate and expressing his views in public on political matters relating to UCC, which is a violation of the 'Restatement of Values of Judicial Life, 1997' laid down by SC.Sources said the idea for removal of the judge was initiated by senior Congress functionary Digvijaya Singh , and pushed by lawyers Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha. All opposition parties are endorsing the petition, with 38 signatures collected on Wednesday and the remaining 12 to be done by Thursday, they said. ""Senior leaders will put their signatures to the petition,"" a source said.The political class is worried about the growing trend of judges making political comments and associating themselves with BJP family's events, with members arguing that the drift needs to be arrested, else ""all hell will break loose"". That Justice Yadav's remarks constitute a ""blatant communal prejudice"" has only made the issue more urgent for the opposition. In seeking Yadav's sacking, the opposition is likely to argue that no litigant can expect justice in a court where a judge holds a biased, prejudiced and publicly expressed opinion against the minority community.As per procedure, the petition will urge the Rajya Sabha Chairman to accept the motion and forward it to the President, constitute an inquiry committee to investigate the charges of hate speech, communal disharmony and violation of judicial ethics, and later initiate proceedings to remove Justice Yadav from office, if the charges are proved.","The opposition is set to file a motion in the Rajya Sabha for removal of Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav.

NEW DELHI: India’s nuclear power generation capacity has nearly doubled in the past decade from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,081 MW in 2024, Union minister for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh informed the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.The minister also informed the House that the atomic energy capacity is projected to triple to 22,480 MW by 2031-32, showcasing India’s commitment to scaling up its nuclear energy infrastructure. He said that nine atomic power projects are currently under construction, with several others in the pre-project stage, demonstrating India’s dedication to expanding nuclear energy capacity.Singh emphasised the revision of India’s power distribution framework, which has increased the home state’s share of electricity from atomic plants to 50%, with 35% allocated to neighbouring states and 15% to the national grid. This new formula ensures equitable resource distribution and reflects the federal spirit of the nation.The minister attributed the progress in nuclear power generation to several transformative initiatives, including the bulk approval of 10 nuclear reactors, increased funding allocations, collaborations with public sector undertakings, and limited private sector participation. He credited advancements in technology and streamlined administrative processes for strengthening India’s nuclear infrastructure.Singh also highlighted diverse applications of atomic energy in various fields like agriculture, healthcare and defence sector. He noted its extensive use in agriculture, including the development of 70 mutagenic crop varieties. In the health sector, India has introduced advanced isotopes for cancer treatment, while in the defence sector, atomic energy processes have been used to develop cost-effective, lightweight bulletproof jackets.The minister also underscored India’s abundant thorium reserves, which constitute 21% of the global total. Indigenous projects like ""Bhavani"" are being developed to harness this resource, reducing dependence on imported uranium and other materials.","India’s nuclear power generation capacity has nearly doubled in the past decade from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,081 MW in 2024.

Govt working on new law to govern space sector: Singh

New Delhi: India will be in a position to commission its deep-sea mission by the end of next year, science and technology minister Jitendra Singh said on Wednesday.He also said by the end of next year, or maybe in 2026, “we will have the first Indian in space”. Simultaneously, a crew will be sent to the seabed, 6,000 meters deep, which is possibly the maximum depth of the sea, Singh told a press conference.While addressing the ‘States’ Policy Conclave 2024’, he said, “Exploring unexplored or under-explored sectors is vital for achieving the India 2047 goal” and underscored the need to explore sectors like the deep sea and the Himalayas.Singh said marine resources are one such area which is yet to be fully explored. The deep sea has a huge concentration of natural resources, which needs to be explored in such a way that it could contribute to the growth trajectory of the nation, he said.The Deep Ocean Mission or Samudrayaan is an ambitious initiative of the ministry of earth sciences, which aims at developing technologies and capabilities for deep sea exploration . With Samudrayaan, India is embarking on a crewed expedition to reach a depth of 6,000 metres.The historic journey will be accomplished by Matsya6000 , a deep-ocean submersible designed to accommodate a crew of three members. The decision to target a depth of 6,000 meters holds strategic importance due to the presence of valuable resources like polymetallic nodules and sulphides.On the space front, Singh, who also handles the department of space, said the govt is working on a new law to govern the space sector, which has witnessed reforms over the past four years, with private players making a mark in building and launching satellites. He said India's maiden human spaceflight programme Gaganyaan was also progressing well and the first uncrewed mission was expected to be launched early next year.India is set to achieve major milestones in space exploration with plans to establish its own space station, Bharat Antariksha Station, by 2035, and to land an Indian astronaut on the Moon by 2040, Singh said.He also emphasised the significant progress made in satellite launches under the Modi government. Singh noted that India has launched 432 foreign satellites from Sriharikota, with 397 of them, nearly 90%, launched in the last decade alone.",Govt working on new law to govern space sector: Singh.

PM, Shah to join Constitution debat

NEW DELHI: Parliament is set to hold a discussion on the Constitution of India in the backdrop of the 75th anniversary of its adoption, but the landmark event may see the rivals using the stage to target each other instead.Leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi met Speaker Om Birla Wednesday and urged that the House should function and the December 13-14 discussion on Constitution should not fall prey to disruptions by BJP. The governing party said its intent was evident from the fact that dates were fixed in the two Houses with the idea of holding the discussion.It added that PM Modi would reply to the debate in Lok Sabha, and home minister Amit Shah would initiate the debate in Rajya Sabha on December 16.But the general belief is that the bitterness may result in the Constitution being reduced to a cover the rivals will use to corner each other with their political agenda.There was a hint of what is to come in Rahul's remarks to reporters on Wednesday when asked about disruptions and BJP's allegations about Congress's links to George Soros. ""There is a commitment for debate on the Constitution on Dec 13. They can level any allegation against me, but it should happen. Govt does not want a discussion on Adani and they want to distract. But in the end, we will not spare them,"" Rahul said.With the two Houses having witnessed continuous disruption in the ongoing session in the wake of the govt's refusal to take up the Adani indictment, the debate on the Constitution presents the opposition with a readymade stage to try to embarrass govt and Modi. Issues such as caste census, removal of 50% cap on reservations, BJP's ""controlling"" of constitutional bodies, Manipur crisis, Places of Worship Act and incidents like Sambhal, communalism and bias against opposition-governed states are other subjects likely to dominate the speeches of Congress and the opposition.BJP is set to raise the issues of suspension of democracy by the Congress govt led by Indira Gandhi as well as efforts of non-BJP govts to roll out quotas for Muslims. It may retaliate against Congress's attack by creating openings to push its allegation that billionaire George Soros and Congress, including its representatives Sonia Gandhi and Rahul, had combined with ""anti-India"" forces. BJP has alleged Sonia had links to Forum of Democratic Leaders-Asia Pacific (FDL-AP) Foundation, an organisation financed by George Soros Foundation, which has backed the idea of Kashmir as an independent nation.Sources in Congress said the party's charge will be led by Rahul. It will also check with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for second speaker, while it has the likes of Gaurav Gogoi, Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tewari among others. SP's Akhilesh Yadav is another major face in opposition camp who would use the national platform to send out a signal to the electorate in UP. Modi's reply to the debate will be designed to answer the opposition's political offensive and he is adept at cashing in on the privilege of having the last word.The 2024 LS poll results gave opposition a boost, but BJP's victories in Haryana and Maharashtra have neutralised much of anti-BJP camp's momentum. The debate may set the trajectory of the battle going forward.",Parliament is set to hold a discussion on the Constitution of India in the backdrop of the 75th anniversary of its adoption.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash’s brother Bikas Kumar accused Subhash’s wife, her mother, brother, and uncle of filing false complaints and demanding Rs 3 crore for a settlement. Kumar claimed that the relentless harassment drove Subhash to end his life.A 34-year-old deputy general manager of a private firm, Atul Subhash, died by suicide in his flat at Manjunatha Layout’s Delfinium Residency on Monday.Subhash, originally from Uttar Pradesh, left behind a 24-page suicide note accusing his wife, her family members, and even a judge, of pushing him to the brink. He alleged explicit instigation for suicide, harassment, extortion, and corruption.The victim's father, too alleged that Subhash's wife framed Subhash in multiple cases. He said, ""He (victim) had said to us that those in the mediation court do not work as per law, not even as per the rules of Supreme Court. He had to go to Jaunpur from Bengaluru at least 40 times. She (the deceased's wife) used to frame one charge after another. He must have been frustrated but never let us feel that. Suddenly, we received the information about the incident - he sent a mail to our younger son around 1 am. It's 100% true (the allegations of the deceased against his wife and her family). We cannot express the level of tension that our son would have been in.""The Hoysala Police Control Room received a call early Monday morning about the incident. Upon reaching the flat, the police found it locked from the inside. Breaking the lock, they discovered Subhash hanging from a ceiling fan with a nylon rope.Subhash’s suicide note details his ordeal, highlighting nine cases filed against him by his wife. These included accusations of murder, sexual misconduct, harassment for money,domestic violence , and dowry demands. Subhash alleged that these cases were part of a larger conspiracy to extort money from him.Shockingly, the note also implicated a principal family court judge in Uttar Pradesh’s Jaunpur and a court officer, accusing them of corruption and bribery.Throughout the suicide note, Subhash repeatedly wrote “Justice is Due.” He recorded a video narrating his alleged harassment and urged his family not to immerse his ashes until justice is served.The note included a heartfelt message for his estranged four-year-old son, whom he claimed was kept away from him. Subhash called for his parents to be granted custody of the child.The police have registered a case under the BNS Act and initiated an investigation.","Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, 34, died by suicide in his flat on Monday.

INDIA bloc divided: Can Congress prevent another Delhi rout after Kejriwal says no to alliance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bloc-divided-can-congress-prevent-another-delhi-rout-after-kejriwal-says-no-to-alliance/articleshow/116220724.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress , already weakened by its losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, faces a tough start to 2025 with Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party ruling out any alliance with the grand old party for the Delhi assembly elections to be held early next year.On Wednesday, Kejriwal took to X to reiterate that Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) will be fighting the election on its own strength in Delhi. ""There is no possibility of any alliance with the Congress,"" the former Delhi chief minister said in a post.In a tit-for-tat response, Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav also said that his party will go solo in the polls as it is in a very strong position to win the contest. Yadav claimed the Congress had to pay a heavy price for aligning with the Kejriwal-led outfit in the Lok Sabha election held earlier in the year.The AAP and the Congress had fought the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi together earlier this year under the INDIA banner but lost on all the seven seats against the BJP.AAP's announcement was on expected lines especially after the snub Kejriwal's party got in Haryana earlier this year at the hands of the Congress. The two parties failed to reach seat-sharing agreement in Haryana despite several rounds of talks as an overconfident state Congress leadership led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda was not willing to accommodate the demands of AAP.AAP leader Raghav Chadha, who headed the Haryana talks as Arvind Kejriwal was then in jail, was absolutely categorical in rubbishing reports of alliance.""I am making it clear that AAP will contest the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections on its own strength. There is no question of any alliance. The reports of any kind of alliance between AAP and Congress are baseless. The AAP has won the last three Delhi elections alone, on its own. Fourth time also, when there will be Assembly elections in 2025, AAP will contest based on its work and Arvind Kejriwal's name, and win. There is no chance of alliance,"" Raghav Chadda said.The Delhi Congress unit, which has always opposed any tie-up with AAP, would be happy with the prospect of contesting the 2025 assembly elections on its own. However, the fact remains that the grand old party has been on the path of steep decline in Delhi and contesting the elections on its own will be a huge challenge for the party leadership.In the last two assembly elections, the Congress was completely decimated in Delhi as it even failed to open its account. In the 2015 and 2020 assembly polls, the AAP won 67 and 62 seats and the BJP won three and eight seats respectively. The Congress scored two consecutive zeroes in these elections.Not just that, the party's vote share which was at 48.1% in 2003 has seen a sharp dip to 4.3% in 2020. in 2013 when the Congress had won 8 seats it had a vote share of 24.6%. However, that came down to around 10% in 2015. A look at the comparative performance of the two parties shows that AAP made massive gains in 2015 and 2020 at the cost of the Congress, while the BJP managed to improve its vote share despite not winning enough seats.The state Congress leaders have already started raising their pitch against the AAP government, which is at present headed by Atishi. The Delhi Congress chief claimed that during the month-long ""Delhi Nyay Yatra"" the feedback received from lakhs of people was that the party should go alone in the assembly polls.Yadav claimed that the AAP has lost credibility and the people's trust after its leaders -- Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Satyender Jain and Sanjay Singh -- went to jail in connection with corruption and money-laundering cases.The Delhi Congress chief had also recently criticised AAP and its national convenor Arvind Kejriwal, for being responsible for the ""deteriorating"" law and order situation in the national capital.Yadav also demanded that Kejriwal should ask for the resignation of Delhi chief minister Atishi, the same way he asked for the resignation of former CM Sheila Dixit during the Nirbhaya case.The Delhi Congress president further alleged that the women are facing the brunt of increasing crimes, including gang wars, firing, murder, rape, harassment and snatching incidents.These attacks notwithstanding, the road ahead is likely to be very difficult for the Congress. It will be a Herculean task for the party leadership to reclaim the lost ground in Delhi. With the party already under all-round attack within the INDIA bloc over its electoral failures, another dismal show will add to the pressure it faces. Perhaps, a joint contest with AAP may have helped it win some seats and prevent another possible decimation.(With inputs from agencies)",Aam Aadmi Party rules out any alliance with the grand old party for the Delhi assembly elections to be held early next year. Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav also said that his party will go solo in the polls as it is in a very strong position to win.

'Like a beast': What Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash's wife Nikita said about husband in police complaint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/atul-subhash-suicide-what-bengaluru-techies-wife-nikita-singhania-claimed-in-police-complaint-against-husband-like-a-beast/articleshow/116219638.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the family of Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash ’s wife denied any wrongdoing and harassment leading to his suicide, details of Nikita Singhania 's police complaint against her husband have emerged.Subhash, 34, reportedly died by suicide on December 9, citing alleged harassment by his estranged wife and her family. In his suicide note, he said that nine police cases were filed by his wife to harass him.According to a PTI report, Nikita had lodged a complaint in Uttar Pradesh's Jaunpur on April 24, 2022 alleging harassment and assault for dowry. She had mentioned her husband, his parents and brothers-in-law as accused.A complaint was registered at Jaunpur's Kotwali police station, under IPC sections 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives), 323 (assault), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), along with relevant sections of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.According to Nikita, her marriage to Subhash took place on April 26, 2019.

LUCKNOW: The family of Nikita Singhania , estranged wife of Bengaluru-based automobile executive Subhash Atul , denied Wednesday any involvement in his death by suicide two day ago. Atul, 34, left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video alleging harassment from his wife and in-laws amid a contentious legal battle over divorce and child custody in a Jaunpur family court in UP.Nikita's paternal uncle Sushil Singhania said in Jaunpur: ""Neither I nor any family member was present at the scene. The claims made in the video will be addressed by Nikita shortly.""He said the family had no contact with Atul in the last three years and expressed trust in the judiciary. ""We are not guilty, and we trust the court to deliver a fair judgment."" A complaint filed by Atul's brother Bikas Kumar accused Nikita and her family of demanding Rs 3 crore to withdraw police cases and Rs 30 lakh to grant visitation rights for Atul to see his four-year-old son. In the video, Atul is seen wearing a board around his neck that read ""Justice is Due"".Nikita's lawyer Vinod Srivastava defended the court's handling of the divorce and child custody case, stating that judicial officer Rita Kaushik acted within legal bounds. The civil court of Jaunpur ruled on the matter in July 2024, setting specific alimony for the couple's son.Nikita had filed an FIR on April 24, 2022, at Jaunpur Kotwali, accusing Atul, his parents Anju Devi and Pawan Modi, and younger brother Bikas of dowry harassment and violations under the Dowry Prohibition Act.The FIR alleged that after their marriage on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi, Atul's family demanded a dowry of Rs 10 lakh. It also claimed that on Aug 16, 2019, Atul's parents again demanded Rs 10 lakh, leading to Nikita's father's sudden death the next day.In his note, Atuldenied any link between the dowry demand and her father's death, asserting that he had long been ill and was treated at AIIMS Delhi before passing away in a local hospital.","Atul, 34, left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video alleging harassment from his wife and in-laws.

NEW DELHI: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar Wednesday remained defiant in the face of continued opposition onslaught for his removal from Rajya Sabha chairman's post while an equally unfazed BJP and its allies rallied behind him, defending the presiding officer while seeking an apology from Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge for ""insulting"" a ""son of the soil"", who has been a ""protector of the House's dignity"".Signalling his combative intent at a public function in Jaipur, Dhankhar spoke about ""internal and external forces"", which are unable to ""digest"" India's progress and are trying to ""divide the nation and insult"" the country's institutions in a designed manner. ""Common man has a big role to play in this. We must neutralise in togetherness every anti-national narrative,"" he said.The nonchalance coincided with strong indication that the notice for his removal may be rejected shortly for not meeting the requirement of 14 days' notice. The notice was submitted on Tuesday and the Winter Session gets over on Dec 20, the timeline rendering the fate of the move almost a foregone conclusion.Dhankhar chaired proceedings of the upper House Wednesday and was completely unfazed when Congress MP Jairam Ramesh pointed out that they had submitted a notice against him. ""I am aware of it,"" Dhankhar said as he signalled start of proceedings.As the routine of treasury and opposition benches slugging it out against alleged Sonia Gandhi-George Soros and Narendra Modi-Adani links resumed, opposition MPs said they had given the notice against Dhankhar to ""protect democracy"". To this, the chairman retorted, ""I don't know who you are trying to save.""Allowed by Dhankhar to speak, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju accused Congress of aligning with anti-India forces, specifically mentioning an alleged nexus between Soros and Sonia. He highlighted Dhankhar's dedication to farmers and the poor, his role in protecting the Constitution and vowed to defend the Chair's honour. He criticised Congress for levelling ""baseless"" allegations against Dhankhar, emphasising the latter's commitment to democracy and respect for the Chair.Dhankhar did not let the opposition's charge about him being biased in favour of the govt come in the way of appreciating Modi govt once again.Addressing the India Maritime Heritage Conclave 2024 organised by the shipping ministry in Delhi barely an hour after RS was adjourned, Dhankhar praised the development during the last decade under Modi govt. ""In the last decade, we have seen many firsts in this country. This is one the firsts of its kind of steps that the govt under PM Modi has taken,"" he said.BJP displayed its support to him outside the House by playing up Dhankhar's background as a Jat farmer. Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, ""Mallikarjun Kharge ji should apologise to Dhankhar ji on behalf of Congress for insulting him. Congress and opposition parties are constantly wasting the time of Parliament and insulting democracy by creating a ruckus instead of discussing.""Pradhan said bringing a no-confidence motion against the Chairman had never happened before in Indian history, but this act of ""hurting the dignity of the temple of democracy"" had been done under leadership of Congress.BJP spokesperson and LS MP Sambit Patra condemned the opposition's move and described Dhankhar as a humble farmer's son, and claimed the notice was strategically timed after BJP highlighted alleged links between the Nehru-Gandhi family and Soros.""Jats are patriots. Jats have shed their blood for the freedom of Hindustan and for Hindustan. Today, you are making such allegations against a Jat vice-president. Somewhere you are trying to defame him by saying that he is not doing his work properly,"" Patra said.","Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar remained defiant in the face of continued opposition onslaught for his removal.

NEW DELHI: NCP Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Ajit Pawar has been allotted the second biggest category of government accommodation, a Type-VII bungalow, at 11 Janpath, which is virtually opposite the official residence of Sharad Pawar . Pawar Senior stays lives at the Type-VIII bungalow at 6 Janpath and his daughter Supriya Sule, a four-time Lok Sabha MP, stays with him.The allotment of the much-coveted Type-VII bungalow in Lutyens' Delhi to Sunetra gains importance considering that she is a first time MP and, going by rules, not entitled to an accommodation of the second-biggest category. The allotment is naturally being seen in political circles as a sign of her husband Ajit's rise as Maratha leader post the recent Maharashtra assembly elections and the corresponding diminution of Pawar Senior as Maratha chieftain. Ajit's NCP, which fought as an ally in the BJP-led Mahayuti, bagged 49 seats and has consolidated its position in the Marathwada region and his home turf as well.Ajit was first one to openly back Devendra Fadnavis name for CM's post as well.Sunetra was elected unopposed to RS on June 18 barely days after NCP drew a blank in the LS polls. She had also lost to her sister-in-law Sule in Baramati LS seat. Later, Ajit said it was a mistake to field his wife against Sule.TOI has learnt that while the 11 Janpath bungalow is under RS Pool, meaning the allotment is done by the House Committee of Upper Chamber, the bungalow at 6 Janpath is under the General Pool, which is managed by housing and urban affairs ministry.","NCP Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Ajit Pawar has been allotted the second biggest category of government accommodation, a Type-VII bungalow.

NEW DELHI: Can relatives of a man or woman, contracting a second marriage during the subsistence of his/her first marriage, be prosecuted for abetting the offence of bigamy under Section 494 of IPC/ Section 82 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita?Rajasthan HC took cue from SC's 2018 judgment in Joseph Shine that decriminalised adultery punishable under Section 497 of IPC, and had ruled ""the ambit of bigamy is narrow and limited to erring spouses alone. It cannot be expanded or said to have a wider connotation by way of abetment"".The woman, whose husband had contracted second marriage, had challenged this ruling of HC, which had quashed the case lodged against the brother and mother of the second wife of the husband.Adjudicating whether abetment would accompany the crime of bigamy, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said there cannot be presumption of non-involvement of other persons in the abetment of the crime as that would depend on the facts and evidence of each case. In the case in hand, the bench said no case of abetment is made out against the brother and mother of the second wife of the husband.However, it clarified that if during the trial on production of additional evidence, the first wife felt a case of abetment to bigamy is made out against other persons, she would be free to move the trial court under Section 319 of CRPC seeking to make them face trial as abettors .On HC's observations - ""the fact that bigamy is a compoundable, bailable and non-cognisable offence, reveals the peculiar nature of an offence"" - hinting that bigamy is a not a serious crime, the bench said SC has repeatedly ruled bigamy is a serious offence.","Rajasthan HC took cue from SC's 2018 judgment in Joseph Shine that decriminalised adultery punishable under Section 497 of IPC.

UP boy pushes mom to death

, hides truth from TN-based dad for 5 days

GORAKHPUR: The 17-year-old son of an assistant scientist with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) was arrested in UP's Gorakhpur Wednesday after he allegedly confessed to fatally injuring his mother and keeping the news from his father, who is based at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu, for five days.Investigators quoted the Class 11 student as saying that he pushed his mother in a fit of rage while arguing with her over something. She had purportedly scolded him in front of his classmates and teachers after learning during a visit to school on Dec 1 that her son hadn't been attending classes regularly.Additional SP (North) Jitendra Kumar Srivastava said that on Dec 3, the boy's mother asked him to go to school, but he refused. ""He asked for some money afterwards, and his mother allegedly threw cash at him. The boy told us he was furious and pushed his mother, resulting in her head crashing against a wall. She became unconscious and the boy left her like that.""On returning from school, the teenager found his mother dead. He allegedly locked the house and went to stay with a friend who lives in the neighbourhood.The Barc scientist didn't know about it until he telephoned his wife repeatedly, only to find his calls going unanswered. When he spoke to his son, the latter misled him into believing that his wife was busy with something. The boy then stopped taking his father's calls.On Dec 7, the scientist asked his sister-in-law to visit their home and find out what the matter was. She found out that her sister had been dead for five days.The teenager initially claimed that his mother accidentally fell and died, after which he left the house in panic. The autopsy report contradicted the claim, police said. ""CCTV footage confirmed that no outsider entered the house. While searching the boy's room, we found currency notes in denominations of Rs 500, Rs 200, and Rs 100,"" an investigator said.Gorakhpur SSP Gaurav Grover said the arrested boy was being kept in a shelter for juveniles.","17-year-old son of an assistant scientist with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre was arrested in UP's Gorakhpur Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: India, France and UAE on Wednesday kicked off a major air combat exercise called “Desert Knight” over the Arabian Sea, strengthening trilateral defence cooperation and enhancing military interoperability amid the ongoing geopolitical churn.The IAF deployed several fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs and Jaguars, backed by IL-78 mid-air refuellers and AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft, from air-bases like Jamnagar on the west coast for the exercise, while Rafale and F-16 jets and other aircraft from France and UAE operated from the Al Dhafra air-base, sources told TOI.The “large force engagement” with intensive combat manoeuvers was conducted around 350 to 400-km southwest of Karachi over the Arabian Sea. “The Desert Knight exercise will continue for three days. It is the second such trilateral endeavour this year to build synergy among the three air forces as well as improve combat skills, with multiple aircraft types operating in a realistic scenario,” a source said.The exercise is yet another indicator of the way India is steadily building military interoperability with countries in the region, especially the Persian Gulf, in conjunction with others like the US, France and Australia.All such exercises on a bilateral, trilateral or multilateral basis build strategic cooperation with like-minded countries in the crucial Indo-Pacific, a region where China’s continued muscle-flexing and expansionist tactics have raised concerns among many nations.The navies of India, France and UAE, incidentally, had also conducted their first ever trilateral maritime partnership exercise to hone their combat skills against traditional as well as non-traditional threats through a wide spectrum of operations on the high seas in June last year.Under the trilateral framework launched by their foreign ministers in 2022, India, France and the UAE are working on several areas, including defence, technology, energy and environment, in tune with an ambitious roadmap chalked out by the three countries.India and France, of course, have had a long-standing strategic partnership, which ranges from maritime security and defence-industrial collaboration to counterterrorism and information-sharing in the military domain. The two also regularly conduct the `Shakti’ exercise between their armies, `Varuna’ between their navies and `Garuda’ between their air forces.The defence partnership with the UAE, in turn, has witnessed a sharp upward trajectory in recent years, with regular professional exchanges, warship visits, staff talks, training programmes and combat exercises, as part of India’s wider outreach to the Persian Gulf region. The IAF, for instance, now often deploys fighters and other aircraft for the annual multi-nation `Desert Flag’ exercise at the Al Dhafra air-base.","The IAF deployed several fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs and Jaguars, backed by IL-78 mid-air refuellers and AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft.

""Many believed SAD represented their interests, but over time, the party became more focused on safeguarding the future of a select few, promoting nepotism, while neglecting Panthic sentiments.

I am sure that all state governments and the policymakers have taken note of this unfortunate incident, and more reforms will follow in all of these aspects.""He added, ""I think the time has also come for us to review many of these family-related legislations and also introduce, wherever possible, an aspect of gender neutrality so as to protect both partners in a marriage. The family is a very important institution. It is the founding block of the society. And legislations that can be misused by one partner can be a detriment to the very institution of family and will have very strong social repercussions if not addressed.""Reacting to the case, Actor-turned-politician and BJP MP Kangana Ranaut said, ""I am shocked.

Oppn steps up attack on Dhankhar, says he's the biggest disruptor of RS

NEW DELHI: A day after the opposition moved a notice to remove vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar , who serves as Rajya Sabha chairman, Congress president and leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge said the VP's ""commitment is not to the Constitution...but to the ruling party"".At a presser Wednesday by INDIA bloc of opposition parties, which was attended by the allies, Kharge said, ""Over the past three years his conduct is contrary to the dignity of the high office he holds. Sometimes he starts praising the govt and sometimes he starts calling himself Eklavya of RSS .""In RS, Dhankhar told opposition MPs he was aware of the notice against him. BJP and its allies rallied behind him and sought an apology from Kharge for ""insulting"" a ""son of the soil"".NEW DELHI: Alleging that ""the biggest disruptor of Rajya Sabha was its own chairman"", INDIA bloc on Wednesday stepped up its attack on Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar and said his ""biased and partisan conduct"" had forced the opposition alliance to bring a resolution seeking his removal.Members of the anti-BJP bloc led by the LoP in Rajya Sabha and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that Chairman Dhankhar was ""strangulating the opposition's voice"" and was acting as the ""govt's spokesperson and shield"" with an eye on his ""next promotion"".""This is not just a breach of protocol, but a betrayal of the Constitution and the people of India,"" Kharge told reporters at a press conference, while clarifying that the notice for Dhankhar's removal was not about personal grievances or political battles. Opposition parties on Tuesday submitted the notice to the Rajya Sabha secretary general.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP (Sharad Pawar), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and CPI (M) members were among those who attended the press conference. No member of AAP, a key constituent of the alliance, was present, but Congress's Jairam Ramesh said AAP was very much part of this coming together, and five AAP leaders were signatories to the notice. AAP members had to skip the press conference as they had an appointment with Election Commission.""We are saddened that 75 years after the adoption of the Constitution, the biased and partisan conduct of the Chairman has forced the opposition to bring this resolution against him,"" Kharge said. He claimed that those who held the post previously were unbiased and stayed away from indulging in politics.He said, ""Over the past three years his conduct is contrary to the dignity of the high office he holds. Sometimes he starts praising the govt and sometimes he starts calling himself the Eklavya of RSS.""""His commitment is not to the Constitution and constitutional traditions, but to the governing party. He is working like the government's spokesperson,"" Kharge said. He went on to call Dhankhar as the ""biggest reason"" for disruptions in the House.""Normally the opposition seeks protection from the Chair as they see the person on the post as their protector. But if the chairman himself starts singing praises of the PM and governing party in that situation, who will listen to the opposition?"" Kharge asked.He alleged that Dhankhar resorts to schooling senior leaders and speaking down to them like a headmaster. The chairman never ""missed an opportunity to insult opposition leaders,"" Kharge said.Recalling incidents of Monday in the House to target Dhankhar, he said it was ""particularly troubling as it was marked by blatant partisanship and a total lack of fairness"". ""The Chairman openly encourages and provokes the treasury benches to make outrageous remarks against the opposition,"" Kharge said.On BJP claiming that the opposition parties don't have the numbers to get the resolution passed, Kharge said, ""let them first allow and admit the notice, then we will also muster the numbers"".DMK's Tiruchi Siva, RJD's Manoj Jha, TMC's Nadimul Haque, SP's Javed Ali Khan and Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Raut also hit out Dhankhar and supported the notice against him, saying it was about ""about restoring of core principles of democracy"".","India bloc steps up attack on Dhankhar, says he's the biggest disruptor of RS.

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday lashed out at Congress neta Rahul Gandhi for making ""baseless statements"" about the state of public sector banks (PSBs), saying the country's banking sector, particularly state-run banks, has seen a ""remarkable turnaround"" under PM Narendra Modi.She was responding to comments by LoP in Lok Sabha on X about state of PSBs, which he alleged had been turned into ""private financiers"" only for the rich and powerful corporations and were being forced to prioritise profit over people and unable to serve the people effectively.Rahul also said that with staff shortages and ""toxic work environment"", PSBs are expected to reach unachievable targets without being provided a level playing field.Sitharaman, in a series of posts on X, said, ""Didn't the people who met with the LoP tell him that high concentration of corporate credit and indiscriminate lending during UPA tenure had resulted in significant deterioration in health of PSBs?"" She also alleged that PSBs were treated as ""ATMs"" for their cronies and shady businessmen during the Congress regime.The FM said since 2014, PSBs have recruited 3.94 lakh employees and as of Oct 2024, 96.6% of officers are in position and 96.7% of subordinate/award staff are in place, showing meagre vacancies which are also being filled.Responding to Rahul's charge of ""staff shortage"" and ""toxic work environment"", Sitharaman asked, ""Didn't the people who met with the LoP tell him that recruitment drives and Rozgar Mela initiatives have filled lakhs of vacancies across all central govt depts, including banks and PSBs?""The FM said that it was actually during UPA era when bank employees were harassed and forced to give loans to cronies through ""phone banking"" by then Congress-led UPA govt functionaries.Sitharaman also highlighted that women are excelling as MDs, CEOs and leaders in the sector. The Modi govt's commitment to women-led development is evident not just in policy but in practice, the FM added.Rahul had met a delegation of the All India Banking Officers Confederation and took to X to draw the attention of govt on the state of PSBs. ""Modi govt must stop using PSBs as an unlimited source of funds for their fraudulent friends. There's also more to a public sector bank than a dividend cheque to the govt at the end of the year,"" he said on X.","Sitharaman was responding to comments by LoP in Lok Sabha on X about state of PSBs.

""If you cannot respect the Chair, you have no right to be members of this House,"" he said. Nadda accused Congress of acting as a ""tool of external forces"". Demanding a discussion on the alleged link, he said, ""For last two days people have been raising the matter of what relationship does Congress' leadership have with Soros?""

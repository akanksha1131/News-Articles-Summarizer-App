NEW DELHI: Businessman Robert Vadra was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Haryana land deal . After the session, he said on Wednesday that he believes in the truth and is prepared to face any kind of pressure.""I'm here for any kind of unjust pressure. I believe in the truth, and truth will prevail ,"" Vadra wrote on Facebook.He also claimed that his charitable work during his birthday week was being interrupted. Taking a subtle swipe at the government, Vadra said he would continue helping people until he was stopped from speaking out against what he called ""injustice"" towards minorities.""Nothing is going to deter me from fulfilling people's wishes and needs,"" he said.""My Birthday Week Seva has been paused for a few days. Plans I have made for feeding the elderly and gifts for all the children in different areas will be continued as soon as I get over the 'Government's ways of stopping Me', from doing good and speaking about their unjust behaviour towards minorities, or if there are wishes and talks of me being in politics,"" Vadra added.After several hours of questioning by the ED, Vadra told reporters that he had answered all the questions before and was doing so again.""All the questions which I have answered before are being answered again. There is no issue. I have nothing to hide. Everything is answered; everything will be answered again,"" he said.The ED has asked Vadra to appear again for questioning on April 16.Speaking to the media, Vadra claimed he was being targeted whenever he tried to help people or speak out.""Whenever I talk for the people, they will try to suppress me. It's a political vendetta . They misuse the power of the probing agencies. I do not have any fear, as I have nothing to hide,"" he said.He pointed out that he had already submitted a large number of documents years ago and that the case was very old.""23,000 documents were submitted in 2019. The case that they are asking me about is a 20-year-old case. This is politically motivated. We abide by all the rules and regulations when we do any transaction. The ruling government always misuses the agency. They can ask me as many questions. I have nothing to hide. All is good,"" he said.Vadra expressed his frustration, saying there was no real case and that the questioning was just a distraction from other issues.""Case mein kuch nahin hai yaar... I hope there is a conclusion. They call me when they want to digress from the original issues,"" he said.Outside the ED office, Congress supporters shouted slogans like ""Jab jab Modi darta hai, ED ko aage karta hai,"" accusing the Modi government of using the agency to target opposition voices.","Businessman Robert Vadra was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Haryana land deal.

NEW DELHI: An undertrial's prolonged incarceration cannot be a ground to grant bail in terror cases, where the intent is to destabilise the country's unity, Delhi high court recently held.A bench of justices Navin Chawla and Shalinder Kaur made the observation while denying bail to separatist Nayeem Ahmad Khan in a terror funding case involving Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed.Khan, who had challenged a trial court order of Dec 2022 rejecting his bail plea, argued the trial was not likely to conclude in the near future, and he ought to be granted bail to balance the period of custody he had undergone with his fundamental right to liberty.Rejecting the contention, the bench said: ""While we are aware that the right of an undertrial to a speedy trial is of paramount consideration, in cases involving terrorist activities ,which have nationwide implications and where there is an intention to destabilise the unity of the Union of India and to disrupt its law and order, more so, to create terror in the minds of the public, which are also factors that weigh in, the long period of incarceration would not, in itself, be ground enough to enlarge an accused on bail.""Khan, a member of Hurriyat Conference and chairman of J&K National Front, was arrested on July 24, 2017, under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and is currently in judicial custody.","Delhi high court denied bail to separatist Nayeem Ahmad Khan in terror funding case involving Lashkar-e-Taiba and 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed that some men and their relatives may have been harassed by fake dowry harassment cases filed in misuse of Section 498A of IPC (equivalent Sec 85 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita) by women but said that cannot be a ground to alter the law protecting women from cruelty in matrimonial homes.""Just because of certain instances of misuse of Section 498A of IPC and Section 85 of BNS, can a sweeping statement be made that women are harassing their husbands and in-laws? Nothing can be further from truth. In a vast majority of cases, it is the women who face harassment at matrimonial homes. Hence, the law and the courts will deal with each case according to the facts therein,"" said a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh.Petitioner NGO 'Janshruti' said it was approaching SC for judicial intervention to address ""critical concerns surrounding matrimonial laws, particularly the misuse and application of provisions relating to maintenance, domestic violence and cruelty.""The NGO's counsel said SC must make Section 498A of IPC and Section 85 of BNS gender neutral to ensure protection of the victim of cruelty, be it women or men, in matrimonial homes and insertion of safeguards to prevent misuse of matrimonial laws, including mandatory preliminary investigation and mediation prior to arrest. Giving instances of extreme cruelty by husbands towards wives, Justice Kant-led bench said, ""The allegations that the provisions have been misused cannot be a ground for forming an opinion by the court while exercising writ jurisdiction.

'TMC netas may've sparked violence with aid of Bangladeshis',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-netas-mayve-sparked-violence-with-aid-of-bangladeshis/articleshow/120325976.cms,"New Delhi: Preliminary reports reaching the home ministry on the communal outbreak in Murshidabad, West Bengal, during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, suggest that the local Trinamool Congress leaders had allegedly prompted the Bangladeshi miscreants known to them and part of their ""larger network"", to trigger minor law and order disturbances so as to create an impression of public ""outrage"" against the Waqf law amendments. However, these minor clashes soon turned into full-blown communal violence as the Bangladeshi elements went out of control; instead of restricting themselves to engineering minor incidents as ""asked by TMC leaders', they decided to escalate things on their own and resorted to bloody clashes that claimed three lives, Central govt sources told TOI, citing inputs from intelligence agencies and other sources.The violence in Murshidabad specifically targeted Hindus, said sources. With TMC leaders no longer in control of the 'rogue' Bangladeshi elements, many Hindu families were forced to flee to Malda. This, according to media reports endorsed by BJP leader Amit Malviya in a post on 'X' on Tuesday, raised fears of renewed infiltration and communal unrest.With around 900 BSF troops deployed in Murshidabad since Friday to assist the state police and nearly 300 miscreants arrested, the situation there is now under control and no fresh violence reported. The Centre, in a fresh development, has sought a detailed clarification from the West Bengal govt, explaining its alleged failure to protect lives and property and attacks on railway assets and not taking adequate action in the initial stages of the violence, causing things to spin out of control. Asked if a timeline has been indicated for furnishing this clarification, a senior official said the Centre expects the state authorities to reply ""as soon as possible"".Concerned at the communal outbreak in Murshidabad, the home ministry had intervened on Saturday and placed additional Central paramilitary forces — essentially BSF — at disposal of the state govt to curb the violence, following the high court's directions.BSF additional director general (ADG) in charge of Eastern Command Ravi Gandhi, who was in Murshidabad over the last couple of days, told TOI that while the situation there is largely normal, there is still a sense of insecurity in Hindu localities. ""BSF has been receiving distress calls from locals, particularly Hindus, about the suspected presence of miscreants in the area and also minor stone-pelting incidents,"" he said.According to Gandhi, BSF has been engaging with the civilian population as part of confidence building measures. “We have set up pickets and are conducting intensive patrolling in Hindu-dominated localities. BSF is working in close collaboration with the state police. At the same time, Murshidabad being a border district, the force continues to be alert and is ensuring that the border remains fully secure, with no illegal cross-border activity,” he said.","The violence in Murshidabad specifically targeted Hindus, said sources.

"As US-China ties crash and burn, eyes turn towards India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-us-china-ties-crash-and-burn-eyes-turn-towards-india-tariff-trade-war/articleshow/120316772.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.More signs of the US-China flame-out emerged on Tuesday after Beijing directed its airlines to stop taking delivery of Boeing aircraft. China is Boeing's biggest customer with projections by the company of delivering nearly 9,000 planes to China — about 20% of the total — over the next two decades. By contrast, India is expected to order around 2400 Boeing aircraft till 2043.Also read: China plays rare earth card as US, India dig deep The Chinese directive also included halting orders of aircraft-related equipment and parts, indicating it is ready to suffer pain and disruption to crank up domestic aircraft manufacturing by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which has been ramping up to take on Boeing and Airbus, the two global aircraft majors.Beijing's blow to Boeing in response to President Trump's tariff gambit came amid growing apprehension in the American commentariat that the MAGA supremo may have overplayed his hand in trying to paint China into a corner -- without rallying support from the rest of the world. There is dismay that on the contrary he has alienated almost the entire world, including European allies.A viral meme showing Trump saying ""I hold the cards"" and Xi responding with ""The cards are made in China"" provided an apt metaphor for the tariff fallout, with many experts saying although both countries will feel the pain from the spat that has inflamed the world, Beijing appears to have more leverage than the Trump White House anticipated, not to speak of greater resilience and endurance to ride out the punishment.US analysts are increasingly looking at India as a potential winner in the trade war expecting New Delhi to take advantage of the tariff differential. ""Is India ready to step in for China?"" the NYT asked in a front page story that said while Trump’s trade war with Beijing could be good for New Delhi, the country's dreams of becoming a new factory to the world is beset with familiar problems -- lack of skilled workers, supply chain issues, infrastructure shortcomings and red tape.But MAGA hardliners, despite being mocked for expecting low-end, assembly-line manufacturing to return to the US, bristle at the idea of depending on India for items like pharmaceuticals after extricating itself from China's dominance. The argument has caused the US President to go back and forth on taxing pharma imports, first holding back on tariffs and later indicating he will review it.In fact, the MAGA Supremo's back-and-forth on the tariff issue on some sectors, including automobiles in the latest instances, has led to allegations of crony capitalism and insider trading as the United States appears to be in far greater turmoil than China and rest of the world after igniting a global trade conflagration.A defensive President Trump pushed back on Monday, asserting that he does not change his mind but he is a ""very flexible person."" Following signs that he's carve out another tariff exception to help the US auto sector, the country's $ 42 billion toy industry, which is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and supplies, is also clamoring for a break arguing that toys are critical for child development.Many liberal pundits are now surmising that instead of running rings around China as the White House mandarins are suggesting the US President is doing, it is Trump who is running around in circles. Amid growing concerns about the Chinese President Xi's high-profile visits to Vietnam and Malaysia, US experts are wondering if Trump has unwittingly ceded global primacy to Beijing.""What if you get into a trade war with China and you lose? What if, after infuriating the rest of the world, putting tariffs on them, too, you make China look stronger, more reliable, more farsighted, more strategic in the eyes of all these other countries that are now looking for an exit from the unreliable consequences of US hegemony?"" the liberal podcaster Ezra Klein asked amid growing self-doubt across US business circles.But Trump made light of the Chinese leader's purported inroads in East Asia, saying he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam for engaging while seeming to hold out an olive branch to Xi. ""I like him. He likes me. I mean, you know, who knows?” Trump said as Chinese interlocutors continued to taunt the US with a flood of memes, cartoons, and videos. One meme showed Xi holding a pair of aces and Trump holding a two and a seven, about the weakest hand in cards.The distrust engendered by Trump's trade, tariff assault, and geo-political assault on the world, including on allies, is so great that the European Commission is reported to have issued burner phones and basic laptops to some US-bound staff to avoid the risk of espionage in Washington, where they are headed to for the World Bank/IMF meetings, according to the Financial Times. The caution is traditionally reserved for trips to China.","US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.

'There is a group which is inciting youths here'

NEW DELHI: Survivors of the violent clashes in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district have recounted harrowing tales of destruction and fear following protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act that spiralled out of control on April 11-12.Displaced families now sheltering in relief camps in neighbouring Malda say they were forced to flee after mobs attacked homes and businesses, leaving at least three dead and hundreds homeless.“We came here on Saturday. Everything in our house was set on fire,” Lalchand Mandal told ANI, speaking from a camp in Par Lalpur. “We came here for shelter. If this violence happens again, how will we be able to go back to our homes? We want peace, we request the government to bring back peace there.”His sentiments were echoed by Rupa Mandal, who described the moment chaos erupted during a family meal. “Our entire house was set on fire. We were having lunch and suddenly, some people entered inside and started looting and attacking us. BSF personnel took us here to the relief camp. We want compensation for our house” she said.Shopkeepers have also suffered enormous losses. One trader revealed how his entire building was destroyed and his shop looted. “They broke through that and entered inside. They caused complete destruction and even looted some of our belongings. Opposite my building, I have a shop. They broke the shutter of that shop too. Monday was a bank holiday, so I received all the payments on Tuesday. I had around Rs13.5 lakh in cash with me. The cash was meant to be deposited at the bank, but it was all stolen. Apart from that, my shop had furniture and equipment worth Rs7-8 lakh, including chairs, tables, CPUs, computers, and laptops. Altogether, I had nearly Rs20-25 lakh in losses.”Adhir Ravi Das, another shopkeeper, said nothing remained of his business. “My shop has been completely damaged. Materials worth Rs 6-7 lakhs were in the shop; everything has been burnt. We want peace. Since BSF is here, the situation is normal. We want a BSF camp here.”Hyder Ali, whose nephew Izaz Ahmed was killed in the violence, had earlier told TOI that the threat of clashes still remain in the region : “There is a group which is inciting youths here. They will try to do it again. For them, it's political gains, but we will have to pay with the blood of our kin. Today it was Izaz; I do not know whom death will claim next.”The deployment of BSF and CRPF has brought some measure of calm to affected areas such as Samserganj, Dhulian, Suti and Jangipur. Shopkeeper Habib-ur-Rehman confirmed, “The situation in Samserganj is normal now. The administration is asking us to open our shops and stay disciplined. The situation has changed after BSF and CRPF have been deployed.”In response to the unrest, the Calcutta high court has ordered the deployment of central forces in Murshidabad. The BSF’s Additional Director General (East), Ravi Gandhi, toured the worst-hit areas, assuring residents that restoring peace was the top priority. “We spoke to people and assured them of their safety. The situation is slowly returning to normal,” he said.So far, around 210 people have been arrested.

Maharashtra Reduces Ladki Bahin Yojana Stipend for 8 Lakh Women Citing Dual Benefits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-stipend-for-8l-ladki-beneficiaries-cut/articleshow/120290515.cms,"Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis

Poll Do you agree with the decision to reduce the stipend for beneficiaries of the Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana? No, it negatively impacts the beneficiaries. Yes, it's necessary to ensure eligibility.

MUMBAI: The state govt has reduced the stipend of eight lakh beneficiaries of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana because they were also receiving benefits under another govt scheme, the Namo Shetkari Mahasanman Nidhi (NSMN).The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month because they already receive Rs 1,000 under Namo Shetkari programme. The Ladki Bahin scheme stipulates that its beneficiaries can avail of other govt schemes only if the benefit is capped at Rs 1,500 per month.This is part of state's move to scrutinise beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme and to restrict the stipend only to those who fit the eligibility criteria.In Oct, state had around 2.63 crore applicants for the scheme. The scrutiny process reduced that figure by 11 lakh to 2.52 crore beneficiaries by Feb. The final stipend went to 2.46 lakh in Feb & March.""There has been an ongoing scrutiny. First to scan the applications that were sent by the districts to the state headquarters. And then to re-scrutinise the eligible cases,"" an official said.CM Devendra Fadnavis earlier said he expects the number of beneficiaries to reduce by 10-15 lakh after the scrutiny process. ""We're not changing criteria or funding, just ensuring only eligible ones get the stipend,"" he said.The state govt is scrutinising Ladki Bahin beneficiaries on the basis of five key criteria. The beneficiaries have to be within the age limit of 18-65 years, and they must be domiciled in the state. Their family income limit has to be within Rs 2.5 lakh per year. Those with a four-wheel vehicle and a member of the family in a govt job are excluded from the scheme. Those who receive benefits from other govt schemes can do so as long as the combined benefit is within Rs 1,500 per month.The state is under pressure to control its purse strings while keeping its key programmes going. The state's debt projection is 9.3 lakh crore for 2025-26. The outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme was reduced from 46,000 crore to 36,000 crore in the 2025-26 budget.","The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month.

Refuting the allegations, he said, ""Whenever I talk for the people, they will try to suppress me. It's a political vendetta. They misuse the power of the probing agencies. I do not have any fear, as I have nothing to hide.""""We told the ED we were organising our documents, I am always ready to be here. I hope there's a conclusion today. There is nothing in the case... When I speak in favor of the country, I am stopped, Rahul is stopped from speaking in the Parliament. BJP is doing it. This is a political vendetta. People love me and want me to join politics... When I express my willingness to join politics, they bring up old issues to bring me down and divert from the real issues... There is nothing in the case. I have been summoned 15 times and interrogated for more than 10 hours every time for the last 20 years. Organising 23000 documents is not easy,"" he added.Congress supporters who were there with Vadra were also chanting slogans, ""Jab jab Modi darta hai, ED ko aage karta hai,"" referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government allegedly using the probing agencies to create pressure on the opposition.Vadra's company Skylight Hospitality had purchased around three acres in Shikohpur village of Gurgaon for Rs 7.5 crore in 2008. After some time, Haryana's town planning department had issued a letter of intent to set up a commercial colony on 2.71 acres of this land.In 2008, Skylight and DLF had entered into an agreement to sell the three acres to DLF for Rs 58 crore. Sale deed of the land was registered in favour of DLF.Vadra, 56, was first summoned in this case on April 8 but he did not depose.Once he appears before the ED, the agency will record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), news agency PTI reported citing sources.Vadra was earlier questioned by the federal probe agency in a different money laundering case.","Vadra marched to the office of the probing agency with his supporters.

NEW DELHI: The conspicuous absence of affirmation from the BJP top brass on ally Nitish Kumar's chief ministership ahead of the upcoming Bihar assembly polls has led to out-of-sync statements from both the BJP and the JD(U).While Nitish's party has dug its heels on the CM post, Haryana counterpart Nayab Singh Saini's remark that NDA would win the Bihar poll under BJP's Samrat Choudhary raised eyebrows on Monday.As Saini's statement triggered flutter in the poll-bound Bihar, the JD(U) leaders rolled up their sleeves on Tuesday to assert Nitish as CM for the next five years.Blunting the opposition's charge of the BJP outsmarting the Nitish, national spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad dismissed the Haryana CM's comment and asserted that the ruling alliance faces no crisis over its chief ministerial face in Bihar.Prasad said, ""The Bihar assembly elections will be held under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, and he will be the face of the National Democratic Alliance. Chief minister Nitish Kumar will head the NDA government, which is certain to be formed after the elections for a full term till 2030.""Nitish Kumar's son Nishant Kumar also appealed to Bihar voters ""to give a majority (to JDU) more than what they gave in 2010...

Even if the entire UPA and the entire INDI alliance fight, Nitish Kumar will remain the chief minister of Bihar,"" Samrat Chaudhary told ANI in Patna.The BJP has made it clear on several occasions that the Bihar election will be fought under CM Nitish Kumar but has remained mum on whether he would be the CM for five years after the NDA victory.Meanwhile, as the uncertainty shrouds Nitish's chief ministership, Congress and the RJD huddled at Malikarjun Kharge's house to pan out an alliance in the state.The meeting was also attended by Congress' Rahul Gandhi, party's general secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal and others. On the RJD side, Tejashwi Yadav , MP Manoj Jha, MP Sanjay Yadav and other leaders were present.Following the meeting, Tejashwi said that another round of discussions would take place between the two parties in Patna.“Congress and RJD will sit in Patna to make the strategy. We are committed to taking Bihar on the path of progress,” Tejashwi said.“The government has been in place for 20 years in Bihar, with PM Modi at the helm for 11 years.

It is also crucial for the replenishing of reservoirs critical for drinking water, apart from power generation across the country.However, normal cumulative rainfall does not guarantee uniform temporal and spatial distribution of rain across the country, with climate change further increasing the variability of the rain-bearing system.Climate scientists say the number of rainy days is declining while heavy rain events (more rain over a short period) are increasing, leading to frequent droughts and floods.Monsoon in India usually arrives over the southern tip of Kerala around June 1 and retreats in mid-September.The India Meteorological Department defines average or normal rainfall as ranging between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the four-month season.","IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra also ruled out the possibility of El Nino conditions during the entire season.

NAGPUR: The Nagpur municipal commissioner offered Tuesday an unconditional apology to Bombay high court 's Nagpur bench for demolishing the home of riot accused Fahim Khan without adhering to Supreme Court-mandated procedures, reports Vaibhav Ganjapure.In an affidavit, municipal commissioner Abhijeet Chaudhari acknowledged that civic officials from the town planning and slum departments were unaware of SC's Nov 13, 2024 order that requires procedural safeguards before demolishing properties linked to suspects in communal violence.The court was hearing petitions from Fahim's mother, 69-year-old Mehrunissa, and 96-year-old Abdul Hafiz, whose relative was also named in the March 17 riots in the city's Mahal area. Fahim's house near Raza Masjid in Sanjay Bagh Colony had been razed by the time the high court took up the matter, while Hafiz's home was partially demolished.T he HC halted further demolition on March 25, ruling that the actions warranted judicial review. Petitioners argued that the demolitions were arbitrary and violated Supreme Court norms prohibiting punitive action without due process. Municipal commissioner Abhijeet Chaudhari said in court that neither competent authorities nor executive engineers were informed of SC’s ruling in writ petition no. 295/ 2022.“My inquiry revealed that no circular was issued under the Slum Act, 1971,” he said. Chaudhari said that Nagpur police had requested details of properties owned by riot accused and asked for verification of their building plans. The Mahal zone office inspected the properties and found them lacking sanctioned approvals. Show cause notices were issued under the Slum Act, and demolitions followed within 24 hours, without knowledge of SC’s requirements.“On March 21, the police commissioner reiterated his request to take action against the properties of rioters in accordance with law if these were illegal,” Chaudhari said. “Accordingly, the assistant commissioner of Mahal zone inspected properties and found that homes of both petitioners were prima facie built without sanctioned plans.” The division bench of judges Nitin Sambre and Vrushali Joshi granted Maharashtra govt a final opportunity to explain within two weeks why it failed to circulate SC’s order to municipal authorities","Nagpur municipal commissioner Abhijeet Chaudhari offered an unconditional apology to Bombay high court's Nagpur bench for demolishing the home of riot accused Fahim Khan.

NEW DELHI: ""Now, there's another order by another judge"" was how Supreme Court reacted while expressing its disappointment over the casual remarks made by judges of Allahabad high court in recent months.The court was referring to remarks made by a judge who, while granting bail to an accused, said the woman herself had invited trouble and was responsible for the alleged rape committed against her.The apex court has been expressing concern over the loose remarks and observations made by judges and taken suo motu cognisance in two cases. A bench of Justices B R Gavai and A G Masih was hearing suo motu a case which was initiated after the Allahabad HC had passed a controversial order that acts of grabbing a child victim's breasts, breaking the string of her pyjama and attempting to drag her beneath a culvert do not constitute the offence of rape or attempt to rape.Though the bench deferred the hearing, it, however, noted the latest controversial remarks made by an HC judge earlier this month. Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh, while granting bail to an accused in a rape case, seemed to blame the complainant for agreeing to go to the accused's house after getting drunk. ""One has to be careful when saying such things, especially from this side,"" the SC bench said.S olicitor General Tushar Mehta also shared the same concern and said such remarks (controversial remarks made by an HC judge earlier this month) send a very wrong signal about the judiciary. He said a judge must realise how his remarks would be perceived by a common person. “Justice should not only be done but also seen to be done,” Mehta said.In another case, SC had last year in Dec taken note of a speech by Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav, in which he had reportedly said the country would function as per the wishes of the bahusankhyak (majority) while using a derogatory term for Muslims and saying that they were harmful for the nation. Amid protests that his remarks were unconstitutional and were aimed against the minority community, the apex court had sought a report from HC.","Supreme Court expresses disappointment over casual remarks made by judges of Allahabad high court in recent months.

GURGAON: Enforcement Directorate (ED) Tuesday interrogated Robert Vadra , the businessman-husband of Congress general secretary and LS MP Priyanka Gandhi at its headquarters for six hours in connection with a controversial land deal his company Skylight Hospitality had made in 2008 for Rs 7.5 crore.Vadra, who had missed his first summons on April 8, walked into ED office at 11am and was quizzed over two sessions with a lunch break on his association with the land deal which gave him a handsome return of Rs 50 crore in a matter of a few months. His questioning will continue on Wednesday.This is a new case being investigated against Vadra with two other money laundering probes still in progress related to other land deals in Haryana and Rajasthan. In the present case, Vadra's firm, Skylight Hospitality, bought 3.5 acre in Shikohpur ( Haryana) for Rs 7.5 crore in 2008 from Onkareshwar Properties. The then Congress govt in state under the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda granted commercial licences for 2.7 acre shortly afterwards. Four months later, the land was sold to DLF for almost eight times the rate - Rs 58 crore - generating a profit of over Rs 50 crore. Vadra slammed ED's move as an 'attempt to thwart his entry into politics and stop him from raising people's issues'.Action against Vadra came soon after ED issued notices to take possession of over Rs 750 crore worth of land and buildings of Young Indian-controlled Associated Journals Ltd in the National Herald money laundering case. This was followed by the agency filing a chargesheet in the National Herald case where it has made seven individuals and entities as accused, including ex-Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The court has fixed April 25 as the date of next hearing in order to take cognisance of the chargesheet.On his way to ED office, Vadra said action against him was ""politically motivated"". ""I am not going to be intimidated by this. They can ask me as many questions. I will answer them all. I have nothing to hide,"" he said, adding, ""Whenever I try to raise people's voice or talk of entering politics, this govt uses these agencies to suppress me. I have appeared over 20 times before, submitted 23,000 documents, and sat for 15-hour sessions. Yet, they keep demanding more.""Vadra's land deal in Shikohpur gained national attention in 2012 when IAS officer Ashok Khemka, then director of land registration in Haryana, cancelled the land mutation, citing procedural irregularities. The state transferred Khemka within hours, raising eyebrows. But before relinquishing charge, Khemka submitted a report, setting aside the mutation and questioning the authority of the official who had sanctioned it. In 2013, a three-member IAS panel formed by the then Hooda govt gave a clean chit to both Vadra and DLF.Subsequent BJP govt, which assumed office in 2014, formed Justice Dhingra Commission, which submitted a confidential report. Hooda moved HC against formation of the commission in 2016. Two years later, Haryana police filed an FIR against Vadra, Hooda, DLF & Onkareshwar Properties, charging them with cheating, criminal conspiracy & forgery. ED initiated a probe under PMLA.",Robert Vadra is the businessman-husband of Congress general secretary and LS MP Priyanka Gandhi.

Pilgrims appeal to PM as 42k can't make it for Haj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pilgrims-appeal-to-pm-as-42k-cant-make-it-for-haj/articleshow/120323769.cms,"<p>Minority affairs ministry Tuesday said 1,22,518 will travel to Saudi for Haj this year<br></p>

MUMBAI: Several Muslim pilgrims and community leaders have sought PM Narendra Modi's intervention after the minority affairs ministry confirmed that 42,000 applicants won't be able to perform Haj in June this year.On Tuesday, the ministry informed on X that 1,22,518 pilgrims will travel to Saudi Arabia through Haj Committee of India. Earlier, Haj slots for 52,000 pilgrims who had booked through private tour operators (PTOs), officially called combined Haj group operators (CHGOs), were cancelled after Saudi govt shut its Haj portal - Nusuk. Saudi Arabia, following the ministry's intervention, has reopened the portal to allow only 10,000 of the 52,000 pilgrims.Congress MLA Amin Patel said several pilgrims have approached him with a request to do something about the cancellation. ""I spoke to many tour operators who said they had booked pilgrims three months ago and now they are helpless,"" he added.""I've appealed to PM Modi and others to speak to the highest authorities in Saudi as 42,000 is a huge number. If they are allowed to go for Haj in 2026, there will be a huge backlog,"" Patel added.The ministry of minority affairs has blamed PTOs for the situation, citing the alleged delay in uploading necessary documents and making payments on the Nusuk portal. However, one of the CHGOs said the delay was caused because IBAN (International Bank Account Number) linked to Nusuk portal was inactive. ""Since direct payment to Nusuk wallet was not happening, we were directed to pay through Haj Committee, which would send the money to the Consul General of India in Jeddah and they would send that money to the CHGOs' wallets,"" the operator explained.","Minority affairs ministry Tuesday said 1,22,518 will travel to Saudi for Haj this year.

Indo-US S&T ties likely to stay course under Trump 2.0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indo-us-st-ties-likely-to-stay-course-under-trump-2-0/articleshow/115036456.cms,"BENGALURU: As has been the case with any US Presidential election in the past few decades, the 47th also has stakes transcending national boundaries with both allies and rivals hedging future bets — anticipation, speculation, wishful thinking all rent the air.And as Donald Trump prepares to occupy the Oval Office for the second time, Indian science and technology sector anticipates bilateral partnership to remain robust, even as there’s speculation that leadership change may, albeit slightly, alter the trajectory of this cooperation.Trump takes office as India and the US are significantly expanding their technological cooperation across multiple critical and emerging sectors, with particular emphasis on space exploration, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and advanced telecommunications.For instance, Isro and Nasa have strengthened their space partnership, signing a joint statement in Jan 2024 to enhance collaboration, including International Space Station initiatives. Their key joint project remains the Nisar satellite for Earth observation. Indian astronaut-designates Shubhanshu Shukla and Prashanth Nair are training in the US — the former will go to ISS on an Axiom Space mission.The Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), launched in Jan 2023, has facilitated broader tech cooperation. The second iCET Summit in July 2024 reviewed progress in space, semiconductors, AI, quantum computing, and clean energy.The US National Science Foundation and Indian scientific departments have expanded research partnerships across multiple fields. The Sept 2023 MoU between the IIT Council and Association of American Universities established the India-US Global Challenges Institute, focusing on sustainable energy, health, semiconductors, AI, and quantum science.Principal Scientific Advisor to GoI, Prof AK Sood, told TOI: “I don’t see any major red flag or reason to expect drastic changes in S&T cooperation. These are long-standing, national priorities for both countries, and commitment to enhance technological cooperation will likely continue. The large, ongoing projects will proceed without significant disruption.”Terming Indo-US S&T cooperation “very mature” and “well-established”, particularly in emerging and critical technologies, former DST secretary Prof Ashutosh Sharma said there is a consensus direction that this cooperation is headed.“...Areas like quantum technologies, AI, biotech, and clean energy would likely remain on track regardless of the political change. Basic and translational research cooperation is well-established at this point,” he said.Nisha Mendiratta, executive director, Indo-US Science & Technology Forum (IUSSTF), said that by and large, the long-term collaborations and cooperations will continue. “There may be some shifts in priorities, but the fundamental cooperation in providing technological solutions to societal challenges is expected to remain a key focus area,” she added.Space is geopolitics, says Susmita Mohanty, director general of space think tank Spaceport SARABHAI, adding that in this geopolitical play that began in the 1960s, France (CNES) and Soviet Union/Russia (Roscosmos) have been India’s friends for over half a century.“The US will need several decades to catch-up to that level of cooperation and to heal the negative impact of their 1998 technology sanctions on India. Notwithstanding who the US President is, the 21st century cooperation between Isro and Nasa (e.g. Moon, Mars missions, Nisar) will stay the course. The US needs India for economic and strategic reasons, so there is no going back. However, ITAR and other regulatory hurdles will continue to limit the scope, scale and speed of the Indo-American alignment,” Mohanty said.She added that if the US was indeed serious about building trust and a long-term relationship with India in aerospace and defence, the US President should consider elevating India to the status of an “ally”.","India and the US are significantly expanding their technological cooperation across multiple critical and emerging sectors.

Monkey wrench in donkey route of Indians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monkey-wrench-in-donkey-route-of-indians/articleshow/115036228.cms,"The centrepiece of Trump’s reelection bid was a promise to deport record numbers of undocumented immigrants. If what he calls the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history” becomes reality, it would impact an estimated 11 million people who are in the US without authorisation.According to Pew Research Center, there were about 725,000 undocumented Indians in the US in 2021, making them the third-largest such group in the country. During FY2024, US Customs and Border Protection revealed that an average of 10 Indian nationals were arrested every hour while attempting to illegally cross US borders. Many of them are Gujaratis. Jimmy Patel (name changed on request) from Vijapur, in Mehsana, who is preparing to sneak into the US, said during his previous term, the “Trump Wall” had been unable to keep out illegal immigrants. “Trump had built the wall, but it was porous, with ways to get through. But under Biden, legal entry became nearly impossible due to complicated asylum procedures. Trump now may make the illegal path tougher, but if India and America work closely, the legal route could improve,” Patel said.“Trump administration might make it harder to cross into the US through Mexico or Canada, but we are hopeful Indians might not face the same scrutiny. Trump may not see us as a burden as many Indian immigrants come ready to work and earn our keep, unlike migrants from other countries who must be provided food and lodging till the legalities are worked out,” said Parikshit Patel, a visa consultant from Kalol.Some in Gujarat also cling to the belief that Trump’s strong rapport with PM Narendra Modi will somehow help them avoid scrutiny. According to media reports, Trump and his allies, including Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, have sketched out an expansive vision that dovetails with the plans laid out in Project 2025, a 900-plus-page presidential transition blueprint led by the rightwing Heritage Foundation.The strategy, as Trump has described it, may involve the extraordinary use of US troops for immigration enforcement and border security and the application of 18th-century wartime powers. Immigration advocates have warned that deportation plans could be costly, divisive, and inhumane.","According to Pew Research Center, there were about 725,000 undocumented Indians in the US in 2021.

By Harsh Vardhan Shringla Former Foreign Secretary of India, Ambassador to US

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi proclaimed ‘Ab ki baar, Trump Sarkar’ at the Howdy Modi event in 2019, he foreshadowed a future where India and the US, under Trump’s leadership, would drive forward a robust, dual-powered partnership. Now, with Trump’s return to the White House, that prediction stands to usher in a new chapter in India-US relations.Trump’s second term promises a refreshed approach to India-US trade and economic ties. Though India faced some friction over trade issues in his first term, his renowned deal-making instinct created significant opportunities, and his results-driven pragmatism is likely to open more doors for India. Notably, Trump was vocal about global economic rebalancing even before the pandemic, criticising the distortions caused by China’s policies—an area where India’s concerns strongly resonate.Trump’s regard for India and the Indian diaspora is well known. And where previous US administrations only issued threats to cut military assistance to Pakistan because of its support for terrorism, Trump acted—delivering a strategic shift in support of India’s security needs. His recent tweet on violence against Hindu communities in Bangladesh reflects his acute awareness of the subcontinent’s dynamics and adds to his established goodwill toward India.Trump’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with India was a landmark of his first term, especially given his scepticism toward traditional alliances like NATO. Under Trump’s presidency, in 2018 India was elevated to Strategic Trade Authorisation Tier 1 status which allows it to access military and dual use technologies license-free. Underpinning all of this is the personal bond Trump shares with Prime Minister Modi—a connect that helped steer our ties before and will continue to facilitate diplomatic alignment. Trump accompanied Modi to the Howdy Modi event, one of the most unique and significant events in the India-US relationship, and then he visited India for the ‘Namaste Trump’ event. With Trump’s return to power, the India-US relationship is poised to advance in ways that will benefit both nations, driven by a shared vision and mutual respect under leaders who understand the importance of action over words.India is pivotal to the world today as a powerhouse of economic growth, digital innovation, and democratic stability, shaping global progress and regional security and in the recent past, regardless of party lines, US presidents have treated the ‘India account’ with increasing care, placing the relationship on firmer ground. This was especially visible during Trump’s first term. Trump popularised the term Indo-Pacific and renamed the Hawaii-based US Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command, underscoring the increasing significance of the Indian Ocean in the US’ strategic considerations. Trump also revitalised an otherwise moribund Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) into an initiative promoting peace, collaboration, and stability in the Indo-Pacific.The institutionalisation of the India-US relationship reached new heights with the 2+2 Dialogue initiative. Launched in 2018, the 2+2 Dialogue has marked a shift from sporadic engagement to deep strategic cooperation.Factoring such milestones during Trump’s first term, India approaches Trump’s return with enthusiasm and confidence. The Modi-Trump partnership is expected to focus on significant deliverables in the near future. A potential Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aimed at deepening economic ties and reducing trade barriers between the two countries is a key goal. Both leaders can also focus on aligning their strategies on regional and global issues, particularly in terms of promoting peace and stability. With shared concerns over conflicts in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, both Modi and Trump are committed to fostering a rules-based international order. With Trump’s comeback to the oval office, the trajectory of India-US relations appears poised for a significant upward trajectory.",Trump’s second term promises a refreshed approach to India-US trade and economic ties.

While the cumulative seizure of inducements like cash, liquor, drugs, precious metals and freebies in Maharashtra have already touched Rs 280 crore, as compared to Rs 103.6 crore in the 2019 assembly polls, the value of seizures in Jharkhand is up at Rs 158 crore from Rs 18.8 crore in 2019.While the individual rise in seizures in Maharashtra stands at 170%, that for Jharkhand is a whopping 742%. Combined, the seizures in the two states so far are 3.5 times in value as compared to that in the last assembly elections. Among the Rs 588 crore seizures, freebies worth Rs 241 crore make up 40% of the value. The second highest seized item is precious metals (Rs 104.2 crore), followed by cash at Rs 92.5 crore, drugs at Rs 68.2 crore and liquor at Rs 52.8 crore.Precious metals, with a value of Rs 90.5 crore, account for the highest seizures in Maharashtra, followed by Rs 73.1 crore confiscated in cash, Rs 38 crore each in drugs and liquor, and Rs 42.5 crore in freebies.In Jharkhand, freebies accounted for the highest seizure at Rs 128 crore, followed by cash at Rs 10.5 crore, drugs at Rs 9 crore, liquor at Rs 7.1 crore, and precious metals at Rs 4.2 crore.Agencies, acting at the behest of EC, which has called for tight control on the use of money-power in polls, have also made Rs 118 crore worth of seizures in two parliamentary constituencies and 48 assembly constituencies where bypolls are underway. These include Rs 70.6 crore worth of freebies, Rs 21.5 crore worth of drugs, Rs 9.4 crore worth of precious metals, Rs 8.9 crore in cash and Rs 7.6 crore worth of liquor.During review meetings earlier with various law enforcement agencies and authorities in the poll-bound states, EC had directed officials to adhere to its 'zero-tolerance' approach towards any kind of inducements in elections. It had also asked agencies to form joint teams to clamp down on distribution and movement of illicit liquor, drugs, freebies, and cash while campaigning is underway.","Poll inducements worth over Rs 588 crore seized by agencies since announcement of assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, and bypolls in 14 states.

"BJP, RSS eroding core values of statute: Rahul Gandhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-rss-eroding-core-values-of-statute-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/115035516.cms,"NAGPUR: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi launched an attack on BJP and RSS on its own turf in Nagpur, accusing them of eroding core values enshrined in the Constitution. Speaking at the ' Samvidhan Samman Sammelan ' on Wednesday, Gandhi demanded a caste census and scrapping of the 50% reservation cap, asserting these steps were essential for social justice.Challenging the RSS-BJP, Rahul claimed the Sangh avoids direct attacks on the Constitution to avoid public backlash, instead it uses narratives of ""development, progress and economy"" to mask its intent. ""Their covert actions weakened the rights of marginalised communities. If RSS opposes Constitution's principles, they should confront us openly,"" he said, questioning BJP's transparency.Central to Gandhi's speech was his demand for a national caste census, which he argued would reveal inequalities in access of resources and power among different communities. According to him, lack of such a census keeps disparities hidden. ""Caste census keeps Modi up at night,"" he alleged, noting the demand for a detailed count of marginalised groups exposes BJP's reluctance to acknowledge inequalities.Targeting RSS-backed educational institutions, including Shishu Mandirs and Eklavya Schools, Gandhi questioned their intent and funding. He expressed concern that these schools, acquiring significant land and resources, serve a political agenda rather than educational goals. ""Are funds for these schools coming from BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, or from corporate giants like Adani and Ambani,"" he asked, alleging corporate and political motivations behind these expansions.In a rebuttal of Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis's remark that Gandhi had displayed a Constitution copy with a red cover rather than the traditional blue, Gandhi defended his choice, stating the colour symbolised dedication to the nation's foundational values.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi demanded a caste census and scrapping of the 50% reservation cap.

School Holiday November 24th: Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji's Martyrdom Day

November 2024 ushers in the heart of India’s festive season, as schools and colleges across the country remain in celebration mode. Following the vibrant Diwali festivities on October 31, students enjoy a series of significant religious holidays in early November.In many states, schools remain closed for Govardhan Puja and Bhai Dooj, extending the Diwali break into the first week of November. Schools in several states will reopen on November 4, but the festivities continue as holidays are observed for Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, and Karthik Purnima later in the month.While these holidays bring joy and cultural connection, they also indicate the end of the academic season. The pre-exam period for students begins in November, with the announcement of upcoming term-end tests and the first batch of dates for key entrance exams such as the JEE.The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students gradually transition from the festive season to exam season. Here’s a rundown of November’s key school holidays:Here's a closer look at the school holidays in November Govardhan Puja, celebrated the day after Diwali, marks Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. Devotees prepare traditional food offerings and worship the Govardhan Hill to express gratitude for nature’s abundance. This festival is celebrated in several regions, and schools in some states remain closed for students to participate in the rituals and celebrations.Bhai Dooj, celebrated just two days after Diwali, is a festival symbolizing the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being, and brothers offer gifts in return. This occasion fosters family unity, with schools closed for students to spend time with their families and partake in this cherished ritual.Chhat Puja, a deeply revered festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to worshipping the Sun God. The festival involves fasting and prayers for the well-being and prosperity of family members. Schools close in regions observing Chhat Puja, allowing students to participate in the early morning and evening rituals along the riverbanks.Guru Nanak Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is one of the most significant days in the Sikh calendar. Celebrated with grand processions and community services, it emphasizes values of equality, compassion, and humility. Schools in many states declare a holiday, enabling students to partake in the celebrations and observe the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Karthik Purnima, observed on the full moon day of the Karthik month, holds importance for both Hindu and Sikh communities. Celebrations often include holy baths and offerings at rivers, temples, and gurudwaras. The holiday allows students and families to engage in these spiritual practices.Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji’s Martyrdom Day honours the ninth Sikh Guru's sacrifice for the freedom of religion. His martyrdom is commemorated with solemn services, kirtans, and processions, emphasising the Guru’s courage and dedication to human rights. Schools observe a holiday in some states to let students remember and honour this legacy.","November 2024 ushers in the heart of India’s festive season, as schools and colleges across the country remain in celebration mode.

(AP)

NEW DELHI: In a heartfelt reflection, the grandaunt of Usha Vance , the wife of US vice-presidential candidate JD Vance , spoke candidly about her roots and her hopes for the nation. Speaking to news agency ANI, Professor C Santhamma expressed immense pride in Usha's achievements, noting that the Vance family’s connections to Andhra Pradesh run deep.""Naturally, I feel happy... She belongs to our family and it is the most important thing,"" Santhamma said, recalling Usha’s origins in West Godavari district, a region rich in cultural heritage. ""She was born somewhere in West Godavari district. My relationship is through my husband. My husband has 5 brothers. The eldest brother has 4 children. Usha is the daughter of one of his sons,"" she said.Santhamma, an academician herself, also shared two key pieces of advice for Usha, which she believes are crucial for India's future.""My advice is to concentrate on India if possible and see that Indians don't drift to various other countries,"" said Professor Santhamma. She emphasised the need for India to create opportunities that will encourage its brightest minds to stay in the country. ""You must protect them. You must help the country to such an extent that their intelligence is retained in India,"" she said.In addition to focusing on talent retention, Professor Santhamma stressed the importance of reviving ancient cultural knowledge, particularly Sanskrit. “The second thing is, that our Sanskrit is lost. Our Sanskrit should be brought back to India,” she remarked. For Santhamma, preserving and promoting India's rich linguistic and cultural heritage is as crucial as its economic development. Sanskrit, as one of the oldest languages in the world, holds key insights into ancient Indian wisdom, philosophy, and literature.While Usha Vance, who grew up in Ohio, may be far from her ancestral homeland, her family's connection to Andhra Pradesh and the advice from her grandaunt offer a reminder of the deep ties that still link the Indian diaspora to their roots.For Usha, whose journey has taken her from rural West Godavari to the heart of American politics, Santhamma’s words serve as both a personal reflection and a guiding principle. In a time of global interconnectedness, the future of India may hinge not just on economic policies but also on how the nation preserves its cultural identity and intellectual capital for generations to come.","Professor C Santhamma is the grandaunt of Usha Vance, the wife of US vice- presidential candidate JD Vance.

Trump triumph may add more muscle to India-US defence ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-triumph-may-add-more-muscle-to-india-us-def-ties/articleshow/115029403.cms,"NEW DELHI: Whether it was Bush, Obama, Trump or Biden in the past, or Trump once again now, the expansive bilateral defence cooperation has been and will continue to be the lynchpin of the larger strategic partnership between the US and India.The strategic convergence over China’s aggressive and expansionist behaviour in the crucial Indo-Pacific, which includes muscle-flexing along the land frontier with India as well as its expanding naval presence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), will not see any dilution despite differences on other fronts like trade and tariff barriers.The military interoperability between India and the US will also continue to deepen with a flurry of combat exercises, be it in bilateral, quadrilateral or multilateral formats, as will the security cooperation in the IOR, including in the new area of underwater domain awareness in the light of Chinese submarines prowling in the region.“Trump, in fact, may actually push for a stronger, overt military dimension to the `Quad’, which India has resisted so far. The US, Australia and Japan are all keen on this front,” a senior defence official told TOI.India, of course, will need to factor in Trump’s mercurial and transactional nature. On the eve of Trump’s visit to India as the US President in Feb 2020, incidentally, the Modi-led cabinet committee on security had quickly cleared two mega contracts worth $3.5 billion for 24 MH-60 `Romeo’ multi-mission naval helicopters and six AH-64E Apache attack choppers.At the ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Ahmedabad soon after, an exuberant Trump pointed to the chopper deals and said his country looked forward to providing India with “the best and most feared military equipment” on the planet. While strongly pitching for the US to become India’s “premier defence partner”, he had also referred to armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).That UAV deal finally came to fruition last month, with India inking the $3.3 billion contract with the US govt for 31 weaponized MQ-9B`Predator’ remotely-piloted aircraft, along with another $520 million contract with drone-manufacturer General Atomics to set up an MRO facility here.The US has now bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth well over $25 billion just since 2007, managing to displace even India’s long-standing military supplier Russia for a few years.India, however, now wants co-production and co-development of cutting-edge defence equipment and technologies instead of direct off-the-shelf purchases. Towards this, the Modi govt wants to conclude within this fiscal the ongoing techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the American GE-F414 aero-engines in India for Tejas Mark-II fighters, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion. “The Trump administration will not be an impediment for such projects, but may want to extract a higher price for high-end tech transfer,” another official said.To be sure, the US will also be deeply interested in the IAF’s long-standing quest for 114 new 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) to be manufactured in India with foreign collaboration, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore.Washington has also been hard-selling the co-production of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles, with the Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, and demonstrated them to India in Ladakh recently.These projects, however, constitute just a part of the ever-tightening bilateral strategic clinch. “There is bipartisan consensus in the US on further strengthening defence cooperation with India as a hedge against China in the Indo-Pacific. It suits India as well, especially due to the strengthening Russia-China nexus,” the official said.",Bilateral defence cooperation has been and will continue to be the lynchpin of the larger strategic partnership between the US and India. The strategic convergence over China’s aggressive and expansionist behaviour in the crucial Indo-Pacific will not see any dilution despite differences on other fronts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115029458,imgsize-2029298,width-400,resizemode-4/115029458.jpg"
J&K assembly passes resolution seeking dialogue with Centre on restoration of special status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-assembly-passes-resolution-seeking-dialogue-with-centre-on-restoration-of-special-status/articleshow/115028558.cms,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: ANI)

SRINAGAR: J&K assembly passed a resolution introduced by National Conference (NC) Wednesday that calls on the Union govt to initiate discussions on the restoration of the former state’s special status — revoked in 2019 with the abrogation of Article 370 .Though the resolution reaffirms the importance of J&K’s distinct identity, culture, and rights, it does not explicitly mention Article 370.Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary introduced the resolution amid protests from BJP’s 28-member bloc. The resolution states: “This assembly calls upon the govt of India to initiate dialogue with elected representatives of the people of J&K for the restoration of special status , constitutional guarantees , and to work out the constitutional mechanisms for restoring these provisions.”BJP legislators protested the timing of the resolution, claiming it broke legislative protocol. Leader of the opposition Sunil Sharma accused CM Omar Abdullah’s coalition govt of violating assembly procedures, as the day’s agenda was set to discuss the lieutenant governor’s address. Despite repeated adjournments due to BJP’s protests, speaker Abdur Rahim Rather put the resolution to vote and it passed with a majority.CM Abdullah defended the resolution, asserting it was now the Centre’s responsibility to respond to the assembly’s call. NC MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi stressed that the move was only a preliminary step: “The fight won’t stop here as only the doors have been opened today through the assembly.”The resolution found support from lawmakers outside the governing alliance, including three PDP members, three independents, and People’s Conference chief and party MLA Sajad Lone.However, independent legislator and imprisoned Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid’s brother Sheikh Khursheed of Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) expressed conditional support. “There is no mention of Article 370 or 35A, no reference to the J&K Reorganisation Act of 2019, and no commitment to reverse the measures imposed on August 5, 2019,” he said, calling the resolution an incomplete gesture that fell short of the election promises made by NC, PDP and Congress.The passage of the resolution followed a separate move by PDP legislator Waheed Para, who had introduced Monday a private member’s resolution calling for the restoration of Article 370. However, the proposal was disallowed amid protests by NC and BJP members.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti criticised the NC-backed resolution as “half-hearted” and “lacking conviction”, saying it should have forcefully condemned the abrogation of Article 370.“Today, PDP has shown that numbers don’t matter. A strong opposition can compel a majority govt to fulfil the people’s aspirations and honour its commitments to the public. This is the result of the PDP’s dedicated efforts,” Mehbooba said, claiming PDP’s persistent advocacy led to the resolution’s introduction.BJP was quick to condemn the move, accusing NC of pushing a divisive agenda. “This is a fake resolution and lacks legal validity,” said opposition leader Sunil Sharma, adding that “no one is above Parliament”.Parliament repealed Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, ending J&K’s special status and restructuring the region into two Union territories — including Ladakh. The Supreme Court later upheld the parliamentary decision.BJP’s J&K chief Sat Sharma rallied supporters during a protest outside the party office, burning effigies of CM Abdullah and his deputy. “NC-Congress has a history of fooling people, and BJP will continue to protest against these nefarious designs,” Sharma said.Responding to the intense debate on J&K’s autonomy and protests against the resolution, J&K Congress president Tariq Hameed Karra questioned why dialogue with the Centre on constitutional guarantees and statehood should be seen as problematic.","J&K assembly passes resolution calling on Union govt to initiate discussions on the restoration of the former state’s special status.

BATHINDA: Canada 's Khalistani-Hindu altercations, from Brampton to Malton and Surrey, have left many Indians and temporary visa holders, especially those from Punjab, fearing for their safety and their families back home worried.The conflict sparked by an attack on a Hindu Mahasabha temple in Brampton city of Canadian province Ontario's Greater Toronto Area underscores divisions around the demand for Khalistan and its impact on Canada's multicultural communities.Many in Brampton and Surrey feel these clashes could strain social cohesion among various Indian diaspora groups. Punjab's Rohit Kumar, who is on a work permit in Brampton, said: ""We are highly concerned. Incidents such as these only worsen the perception that we are creating unrest here, and that will cause more problems for us.""Kulwinder Singh, who has been involved in peaceful protests for extending work permits, emphasised the potential long-term consequences of the violence on community relations. Calling for unity among communities, Kulwinder said: ""While we focus on securing our future in Canada, incidents like these could affect our ability to integrate.""Back in Punjab, Amit Mittal, whose son lives in Surrey, requested the Canadian authorities to manage these recurring conflicts carefully. ""These events have ripple effects that impact the safety of our children staying abroad,"" Mittal said, also calling on the Indian govt to push for protection of Punjabis in Canada.The rising tensions highlight the delicate balance within Canada's diverse immigrant communities and the need for careful intervention to prevent further discord.These escalating tensions between pro-Khalistan supporters and opposition groups make migrants from Punjab anxious to save their reputation. For those struggling to extend their work permits, like Brampton store worker Jatinder Singh - whose permit expires next month - a dented image could be disastrous. ""These disruptive elements could fracture Canada's social harmony and create unrest back home, where longstanding regional disputes remain unresolved,"" Jatinder added.","Many in Brampton and Surrey feel these clashes could strain social cohesion among various Indian diaspora groups.

SRINAGAR: Two Pakistani terrorists were killed in separate security operations Wednesday in north Kashmir — one at Ketson in Bandipora and another in Kupwara’s Lolab area . An M4 carbine was found near the slain terrorist in Bandipora. “The forces found an AK-47 rifle, two hand grenades, and four magazines after shooting dead a terrorist in the Kupwara gunfight,” an official said.Both seek-and-kill operations were part of an intensified crackdown on terrorists following an uptick in attacks across Kashmir valley — including the murder of seven tunnel construction workers in Ganderbal on Oct 20 — since an elected govt took office in J&K after six years last month.The security sweep has led to seven fatalities among terrorists so far, including two in Bandipora on Nov 5, Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Usman from Pakistan in Srinagar on Nov 2, and another two in Anantnag the same day. However, terrorists retaliated with a grenade attack on Nov 3, wounding 12 people in a busy Srinagar market.Officials said security forces were on the hunt since a group of terrorists engaged a search party in a brief gunfight and escaped deep inside Panar forest in Bandipora on Nov 1.

"Govt welcomes Trump back, Modi reminds him of good times",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-welcomes-trump-back-modi-reminds-him-of-good-times/articleshow/115026935.cms,"PM Modi and Donald Trump (File photo)

Despite the likely mercurial nature of his second term in office, Donald Trump’s return to the White House is not just an acceptable but a desired outcome of the US presidential elections for India, given the previous Trump presidency’s perceived convergence of interests with India on strategic issues and his rapport with PM Narendra Modi. Unsurprisingly, Modi was among the first heads of government to congratulate ""friend"" Trump for his historic win, shortly after the latter’s victory speech in Florida.“As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership. Together, let’s work for the betterment of our people and to promote global peace, stability and prosperity,’’ said Modi in a post on X, which was embellished with photos from his engagements with the president-elect in the past including during his India visit in 2020.According to former foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who also served as India’s ambassador to the US during the previous Trump administration, his dramatic comeback is good news for India. “The Modi government has worked closely with him in the past and he also has a good relationship with the PM,’’ says Shringla, adding Trump’s focus on ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza also suits India.Trump’s previous term in office saw strong strategic convergence with India, especially on issues like counterterrorism and Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific. While there are concerns among some of US partners in the region about his contempt for multilateralism and his sceptical attitude towards alliances, India’s experience with Trump 1.0 inspires confidence among Indian officials that he will start from where he left off. It was under Trump that Quad was upgraded to the ministerial level and foundational military agreements like BECA and COMCASA signed with India. Significantly, it was also under Trump that the term Indo-Pacific, a euphemism for calling China out for its expansionism, gained traction. “You have to give credit to Trump for his strategic vision. He introduced the term Indo-Pacific to the global lexicon by renaming US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific Command,’’ says Shringla.While the Biden administration worked to take the relationship forward, most notably with the landmark Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) that envisages access to cutting-edge defence technology for India, its efforts to push India into the dock on murder-for-hire plots in both Canada and US, allegedly involving Indian officials, struck a sour note in the relationship.The Pannun case will continue to be pursued by the US but it’s unlikely it will get the kind of salience from Trump as it did from the Biden administration. The government will also expect Trump administration to be more responsive to its concerns related to anti-India activities of Khalistan separatists in both US and Canada.Trump’s victory also spares Indian officials the trouble of dealing with a relatively unknown quantity in Harris, who is unlikely to have been as forgiving as Trump of the alleged human rights violations and democratic backsliding in India. Harris riled the Indian government when she said in 2019 that there’s a need to intervene in Kashmir if the situation demands, although later, as vice president, she chose to have a more pragmatic approach to contentious international issues.India’s main concern with Trump, however, will remain his transactional approach to trade and likely restrictive immigration policies. Trump, who will look to find ways to cut down the $ 30 billion trade deficit with India, had terminated India’s preferential trade status under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) in 2019 accusing the Indian government of not providing equitable access to its markets. Shringla, however, is hopeful the 2 sides will look to address trade issues by restarting negotiations for a free trade agreement. “We were at an advanced stage of negotiations with the Trump administration to find a solution in the form of a free trade agreement. There’s no reason why we can’t use the same playbook now,’’ he says, adding that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports worth $ 360 billion also helped India ramp up its exports.With the Republicans flipping the Senate, and practically no opposition left to him within the GOP, Trump 2.0 will also likely be more assertive and uncompromising. How he chooses to exercise his executive powers on US immigration policies, particularly the H1B visa programme, will also be closely followed by India. While Shringla says Trump will look to plug illegal immigration and streamline legal immigration, which works to India’s advantage, another former ambassador to US Arun K Singh says clampdowns on H1B like in the past are unlikely to work. “Given the shortage of skilled professionals in the US, it’s in the interests of American companies to hire workers from India,’’ says Singh.","Trump’s previous term in office saw strong strategic convergence with India, especially on issues like counterterrorism and Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.

ASI has been in charge of the monument's upkeep even now.Once described as Asia's largest fort, it was declared a protected monument in the Gazette of India on Nov 29, 1951. However, a notification issued on Aug 17, 2005, claimed the fort area as waqf property.The areas claimed include Solah Kambh or 16-pillar monument, 14 of the 15 domes in Ashtur and multiple tombs, including that of Amir Barid in Barid Shahi Park.Though the CM issued back-to-back clarifications and an order to nullify any takeover notices in the past fortnight, farmers and citizens are still a frazzled lot.Anirudh Desai, assistant surveyor with the archaeology department, claimed he has no knowledge of the govt notification that classifies ""this protected site"" as wakf property since 2005. ""The relevant department records are in the head office in Hampi,"" he said, adding the Hampi office may shed more light on the issue.Deputy commissioner Shilpa Sharma, too, claimed she is unaware of Bidar Fort being designated as Waqf Board property and said she will obtain information from the department concerned.Similarly, Dharmapur and Chatnalli villages of Bidar taluk are claimed by Waqf Board.

Under Trump and Modi, the two nations had common stance on several issues

For India, Donald Trump 's return to White House isn't just an acceptable but a desired outcome of US presidential elections , given Trump 1.0's perceived strategic convergence of interests with India and his close rapport with Narendra Modi Unsurprisingly, the PM was among the first heads of states to congratulate ""my friend"" Trump, shortly after the latter's victory speech in Florida. Modi's post on X was embellished with photos from his engagement with the US President-elect in the past, including during his visit to India in 2020.According to former foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla who served as ambassador to US during Trump 1.0, his comeback is good news for India and inspires confidence that he will start from where he left off at the end of his first term. ""Modi govt has worked closely with Trump in the past and he also has a good relationship with Modi,"" Shringla said, adding Trump's pledge to bring peace in Gaza and Ukraine also aligns with Modi's ""this is not an era of war"" stand.Under Trump and Modi, the two nations had common stance on several issues, especially counterterrorism and Chinese assertiveness in Indo-Pacific.It was then that Quad was upgraded to the ministerial level, and foundational military agreements between India and US, notably Beca and Comcasa, were signed.Significantly, it was during this time that the term 'Indo-Pacific', a euphemism for calling China out over its expansionism, gained geopolitical traction.Trump's victory also spares Indian officials the trouble of dealing with a relatively unknown entity in Kamala Harris.","For India, Donald Trump's return to White House isn't just an acceptable but a desired outcome.

Tariffs and tension to trump trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tariffs-and-tension-to-trump-trade/articleshow/115030542.cms,"NEW DELHI: In March 2023, defence minister Rajnath Singh had some unusual guests for Holi as commerce secretary Gina Raimondo and her team attended the festivities at his Ashoka Road bungalow. The result was a series of announcements, which extended up to PM Narendra Modi's visit to the US in June 2023. It had taken two years to undo what Trump administration had done in its four years in office.And, just when the commerce department brass in New Delhi was cheering the smooth ties with Washington, they will have to brace for ensuring that the relations are not strained once Donald Trump walks into Oval Office next Jan. After all, just last month, he called India the ""biggest charger"" of tariffs. In Sept, he called India a ""very big (trade) abuser"", keeping it and Brazil just a notch below China.The rhetoric is no different from his first term when he called India ""tariff king"" and went on to increase import duty on steel and aluminum by 10-25%, invoking national security provisions. The duty impacted 2.3% of India's trade with the US, and govt responded with retaliatory tariffs on almonds, apples lentils and steel after preferences were also withdrawn by Trump administration. This time too, he has indicated his preference for ""tit-for-tat"" tariffs. ""So, we're going to do a reciprocal trade. If anybody charges us 10 cents, if they charge us $2, if they charge us 100%, we charge the same,"" Trump had said ahead of Modi's US trip.Trump doesn't believe in looking at the average tariff or if the levies are within permissible limits. His attacks are political. ""Trump may pressure India to cut tariffs and also impose higher tariffs on Indian goods, especially in sectors like automobiles, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and wines, which could make Indian exports less competitive in US market,"" said Ajay Srivastava of GTRI. India isn't unique, countries around the world keep high levies on products that are sensitive. With Trump's return, they are bracing for fresh trade tensions.Given that the president-elect sees China as the ""toughest"" and India as ""tough"", the prime focus of his actions is likely to be Beijing. In any case, in 2023, China's goods exports to the US were estimated at $427 billion - five times higher than India's $84 billion. ""He will come down heavily on China. If Trump increases tariffs for countries like India by a lower magnitude than China, then it stands to gain,"" said Jayant Dasgupta, India's former ambassador to WTO.This may potentially open the doors for some Indian businesses, provided they have the capacity to produce those goods. Biden administration's tariff hikes of EVs and semiconductors, for instance, will offer virtually no gain to India.Having put the dispute settlement mechanism at WTO in deep freeze by blocking all appointments to the appellate body, the multilateral agency is unlikely to see any action for at least four years. A carefully crafted partnership can, however, help India tap into America's hunt for critical minerals and technology. The fate of forums like Indo-Pacific Economic Cooperation, a post-Covid platform to counter China, remains unclear under Trump.But trade experts believe that Trump prefers bilateral deals over multilateral or plurilateral agreements. Which means he may be willing to negotiate deals that demonstrate gains to American businesses, at least to his constituency.","The rhetoric is no different from his first term when he called India ""tariff king"" He went on to increase import duty on steel and aluminum by 10-25%, invoking national security provisions.

No encroachment razing without due process: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bulldozer-demolition-only-with-due-process-says-sc/articleshow/115030170.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday barred state and Union govt authorities from using bulldozers to demolish encroachments or illegal constructions for road projects across India without following due process, which includes serving prior notice, conducting adjudication, and awaiting court decisions.The days of announcing the removal of encroachments or illegal structures with drumbeaters or loudspeakers are over, said a bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Mishra criticised the Uttar Pradesh govt for high-handedness after the Maharajganj collector demolished a house to widen NH-703. ""Private properties need some protection and there has to be some accountability fixed for those resorting to demolitions using state power,"" Supreme Court said.Awarding an interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the person whose house was demolished, the bench directed the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary to initiate inquiry into the illegal demolitions carried out by the collector, other officials and the contractor in 2019.The person had written to the Supreme Court on Oct 4, 2019, about incidents of illegal demolitions, which were taken up suo motu by the court. The last hearing took place on Jan 4, 2021.Dusting off the case file nearly four years later, the Supreme Court bench noted that no material had been provided by the Uttar Pradesh govt's counsel, Tulika Mukherjee, to justify the demolitions, which involved 123 houses, including that of the complainant, for a road-widening project.The Uttar Pradesh govt counsel had also simultaneously written to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which like the district commissioner, had given an adverse finding against the collector.Senior advocate Siddharth Bhatnagar told the court that the National Human Rights Commission's directions for initiation of proceedings against wrongdoers has not yet been complied with and no compensation has been paid to the petitioner Manoj Tibrewal Akash for illegal demolition of his ancestral house.Repeatedly referring to the Uttar Pradesh bureaucrat's actions as high-handed, the Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice laid down guidelines for authorities across India to follow when removing unauthorised and illegal constructions and encroachments for road projects.",Supreme Court bars state and Union govt authorities from using bulldozers to demolish encroachments or illegal constructions for road projects.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday sought responses of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand govts on a PIL which sought erasing of gender-discriminatory laws in the two states which disentitle a daughter from her share in parental property after marriage and a widow from her share in matrimonial property after her remarriage.A three-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud issued notice to the two states on the PIL filed by Shweta Gupta as her counsel K C Jain argued that SC had in 2019 entertained a petition seeking similar relief regarding gender-discriminatory provisions in Hindu Succession Act . The petitioner said under Section 109 of UP Revenue Code, 2006, when a female (who has inherited land from her father) dies, her land stands devolved upon the heirs of her husband, rather than her own heirs.Similarly, the provision disentitled a daughter's ownership right over land inherited from her father after marriage. The same provision also provided that if a widow remarries, she stands divested from land inherited from her deceased husband as it would go to the next surviving heir of the last male holder of the land.The petitioner sought to know ""whether the marital status of a female can be determinative of her identity to entitle or disentitle her to inherit an interest of a land, while marital status of a male has no significance for succession under UP Revenue Code"".",Supreme Court seeks responses of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand govts on a PIL.

Government nod must for PMLA case on public servant: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prior-sanction-needed-to-prosecute-public-servant-in-pmla-cases-sc/articleshow/115030094.cms,"New Delhi: In another verdict defanging the stringent law of Prevention of Money Laundering Act and to protect honest public servants in discharging official duty, Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that prior sanction of govt is needed to prosecute a govt employee in a money-laundering case and held that Section 197 of Criminal Procedure Code on sanction would be applicable in PMLA cases also. A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih rejected the submission of the Enforcement Directorate that PMLA provisions have an overriding effect over the provisions of the other statutes, including the CrPC on the issue of sanction.Extending the ambit of Section 197(1) to PMLA on money laundering cases, the bench said the object is to protect the public servants from prosecutions and to ensure that they are not prosecuted for anything they do in the discharge of their duties. ""This provision is for the protection of honest and sincere officers. However, the protection is not unqualified. They can be prosecuted with a previous sanction from the appropriate government."" the bench said while dismissing the plea of the agency.""Section 65 makes the provisions of the CrPC applicable to all proceedings under the PMLA, provided the same are not inconsistent with the provisions contained in the PMLA. The words 'All other proceedings' include a complaint under Section 44 (1)(b) of the PMLA. We have carefully perused the provisions of the PMLA. We do not find that there is any provision therein which is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 197(1) of CrPC. Considering the object of Section 197(1), its applicability cannot be excluded unless there is any provision in the PMLA which is inconsistent with the Section 197(1). No such provision has been pointed out to us. Therefore, we hold that the provisions of Section 197(1) of CrPC are applicable to a complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA,"" the bench said..Section 197(1) says that when any person who is or was a Judge or Magistrate or a public servant not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Government is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting in the discharge of his official duty, no Court shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction.The agency contended that Section 71 of PMLA has an overriding effect over the other statutes, including the CrPC and the requirement of obtaining a sanction under will be inconsistent with the provisions of the PMLA . It said the act of money laundering could not be considered to have been done in the discharge of official duties which needed protection. But the bench was not convinced and quashed prosecution of a senior bureaucrat for want of sanction.""Section 65 is a prior section which specifically makes the provisions of the CrPC applicable to PMLA, subject to the condition that only those provisions of the CrPC will apply which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the PMLA. Therefore, when a particular provision of CrPC applies to proceedings under the PMLA by virtue of Section 65 of the PMLA, Section 71 (1) cannot override the provision of CrPC which applies to the PMLA. Once we hold that in view of Section 65 of the PMLA, Section 197(1) will apply to the provisions of the PMLA, Section 71 cannot be invoked to say that the provision of Section 197(1) of CrPC will not apply to the PMLA,"" the bench said.",Supreme Court ruled that prior sanction of govt is needed to prosecute a govt employee in a money-laundering case.

SC: LMV licence can be used to drive transport vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-lmv-licence-can-be-used-to-drive-transport-vehicles/articleshow/115030054.cms,"NEW DELHI: In an important ruling that would ease payment of insurance compensation to road accident victims, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said a person holding a licence to drive light motor vehicles (LMVs) can drive all kinds of transport vehicles with a gross weight of less than 7,500 kg without the transport department's endorsement.In cases of deaths or injuries to others in accidents involving a transport vehicle driven by LMV licence holders, insurance companies were often denied compensation on the technicality that the licences were not suitably stamped by the transport department authorising them to drive transport vehicles.Solving a 25 year-old confusion over driving licence, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, P S Narasimha, Pankaj Mithal and Manoj Misra unanimously ruled that ""a driver holding a license for LMV class, under Section 10(2)(d) for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight under 7,500 kg, is permitted to operate a 'Transport Vehicle' without needing additional authorisation under Section 10(2)(e) of the MV Act specifically for the 'Transport Vehicle' class.""The additional endorsement by the transport department would be required if an LMV licence holder intends to drive a medium or heavy transport or passenger vehicle having a gross weight of over 7,500 kg, it said.Writing the 126-page judgment, Justice Roy said this authoritative pronouncement would ""prevent insurance companies from taking a technical plea to defeat a legitimate claim for compensation involving an insured vehicle weighing below 7,500 kgs driven by a person holding a driving license of a LMV class.""The bench said, ""In the era where autonomous or driverless vehicles are no longer tales of science fiction and app-based platforms are a modern reality, the licencing regime cannot remain static. The amendments that have been carried out by the Indian legislature may not have dealt with all possible concerns.""""As we were informed by the Learned Attorney General that a legislative exercise is underway, we hope that a comprehensive amendment to address the statutory lacunae will be made with necessary corrective measures,"" the bench said.AG R Venkataramani had informed the court that multiple amendments to classify LMVs into different classes is under consideration of the govt. Justice Roy said, ""Had Parliament acted sooner to amend the MV Act and clearly differentiated between classes, categories and types, much of the uncertainty surrounding driving licences could have been addressed, reducing the need for frequent litigation and an unclear legal terrain.","A person holding a licence to drive light motor vehicles (LMVs) can drive all kinds of transport vehicles with a gross weight of less than 7,500 kg without the transport department's endorsement. In cases of deaths or injuries to others in accidents involving a transport vehicle driven by LMV licence holders, insurance companies were often denied compensation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115030058,imgsize-1638046,width-400,resizemode-4/115030058.jpg"

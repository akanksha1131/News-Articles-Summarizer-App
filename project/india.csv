Global Buddhist Summit delegates to be honoured



NEW DELHI: India on Monday celebrates its 77th Republic Day with ceremonial events to begin early morning at Kartavya Path, where the national flag will be unfurled by the President and the annual parade will showcase the country’s military strength, cultural diversity and developmental journey.The celebrations will take place along the Kartavya Path stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial, carrying the themes ‘Swatantrata ka Mantra: Vande Mataram’ and ‘Samriddhi ka Mantra: Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. This year’s parade also commemorates 150 years of Vande Mataram, the national song.Adding diplomatic significance to the celebrations, president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and president of the European Council Antonio Luís Santos da Costa are attending the Republic Day celebrations as chief guests. The two leaders are on a state visit to India from January 25 to 27 at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The parade will also feature a European Union contingent comprising four flag bearers on three gypsies, carrying the flag of the European Union, the EU military staff flag, and the flags of EU naval force Atalanta and EU naval force Aspides.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, was born in 1958 and is a medical doctor by training.She has served in public office for over two decades and held several key ministerial portfolios in Germany between 2005 and 2019, including family and youth, labour and defence.She assumed office as president of the European Commission in 2019 and was re-elected for a second term in July 2024. In her current mandate, she is focused on strengthening Europe’s competitiveness, democratic institutions, and defence and security capabilities.Speaking recently, von der Leyen said, “Europe and India have chosen strategic partnership, dialogue and openness,” adding that the two sides are “building mutual resilience.”At the World Economic Forum in Davos, she said the European Union is close to finalising a free trade agreement with India. “There is still work to do. But we are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Some call it the mother of all deals. One that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP,” she said.EU commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic has said that negotiations on the FTA are nearing conclusion. Foreign affairs expert Robinder Sachdev noted that the agreement has been under discussion for over two decades.Antonio Luís Santos da Costa, President of the European Council, was born in Lisbon in 1961 and is a senior Portuguese political leader. He comes from a family with Portuguese, Indian and Mozambican roots and holds a law degree from the University of Lisbon.Costa joined the Portuguese Socialist Party early in his career and went on to serve in several key roles, including minister for parliamentary affairs, minister for justice, member and vice-president of the European parliament, minister of state and minister for the interior, and mayor of Lisbon.He served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 2015 for nine years, during which the country saw stable economic growth, reduced unemployment, sound public finances and increased investment in renewable energy. He assumed office as president of the European Council in December 2024.During the visit, India and the European Union are expected to unveil a security and defence strategic partnership, along with expected discussions on free trade agreement. The agreement is set to be signed by EU high representative and vice-president Kaja Kallas and defence minister Rajnath Singh, making it only the third such comprehensive defence partnership the EU has signed in Asia, after Japan and the Republic of Korea.An EU official described the current phase of ties as a “culmination of remarkable intensifying relations,” noting that both sides now recognise that their security and prosperity are closely linked in a changing global environment.A large group of monks and nuns from 40 countries who attended the two-day Global Buddhist Summit in New Delhi will be among the 'honoured guests,' according to the culture ministry.The summit, organised by the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC) in collaboration with the ministry on January 24 and 25, was held under the theme ‘Collective Wisdom, United Voice, and Mutual Coexistence’.According to the ministry, the gathering reflected India’s message from the land of the Buddha advocating peaceful resolution of conflicts, addressing global inequalities and responding to ecological challenges.Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, IBC secretary general Ven Shartse Khensur Rinpoche Jangchup Choeden said, “At the parade, India will be displaying its might, but it is also the land of Buddha Dhamma, spreading the message of peace, love, and kindness to many countries in the world.” He added, “We believe in the power of compassion and care. We need peace in the world today and friendly coexistence.”The summit brought together over 800 delegates from 40 countries, including more than 200 overseas participants and around 100 members of the Sangha, along with diplomats, academicians, scholars and lay practitioners from India.(With inputs from agencies)","The celebrations will take place along the Kartavya Path stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial.

As we turn 76 as a constitutional Republic, we should underline a lesserknown and unique facet of the Gita and the Bible of our governance. Most constitutions begin with black letter law; ours begins with art. If the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance, the best metaphor for the Indian Republic is a document that speaks to the soul before it speaks to the statute.India’s Constitution is widely celebrated as a legal masterpiece, a visionary consolidation of checks, balances, rights and responsibilities. But buried in the book is a quieter triumph: 22 handdrawn illustrations, each accompanying one of its first 22 Parts, and rendering a book of law into a living tapestry of our civilisational spirit.Nandalal Bose and his Shantiniketan associates were not decorating after the fact. They were intentionally and symbolically rendering the spirit of each constitutional Part. It is spirit, not text, that is reflected in the design. With each page we turn, we step into an art gallery of Indian being.This is where aesthetics meet authority. There are a handful of countries where the Constitution is also a work of art.Ours is one of them.Crafted in flowing calligraphy by Prem Raizada and illumined by Bose’s team, the Constitution is handwritten, hand-painted and heart-born. Every page radiates an aesthetic that marries legal form with cultural substance. The intricate patterns of the Preamble, the artistic flourish of the Ashokan Emblem, the quiet reverence of Himalayan magnificence: each stroke reminds us that beauty is not superficial, but constitutional.The artists, paid Rs 25 per page, made priceless manuscripts, which are today enshrined in helium-filled chambers in the Parliament Library, more revered than rare manuscripts, more sacred than statute books. As an illustrated ‘Gita of Governance’, the Constitution’s illustrated manuscript does not shout but whispers in ink. Its 22 illustrations serve as metaphors for the Parts they accompany, symbols that communicate through visual language the values, dilemmas and aspirations that laws alone cannot express.For instance, the pairing of Part III on Fundamental Rights with the conquest of Lanka by Lord Rama is no accident. It evokes the triumph of dharma over tyranny. The depiction of the Dandi March alongside Part XVII on official language is not a coincidence; it is a subtle nod to linguistic unity as an act of peaceful assertion. These aren’t annotations; they are visual philosophies.Such symbolic pairings do more than inform; they inspire. They transform the Constitution from a legal text into a national epic, in equal parts scripture, statute and story.The illustrated Constitution is a Republic in technicolor, where India is illustrated on every page: an India that is inclusive, plural, layered, and luminous. From the seals of Mohenjodaro to the Himalayas, from Nalanda’s scholarly calm to Noakhali’s pain, these illustrations span centuries, religions, regions and ideologies.This is not an India of slogans, but of symbols. Buddha and Mahavira stand alongside Netaji and Shivaji. It is a great way of conveying how the Indian philosophy consists of two binary elements — Yuddha (war) and Buddha (peace). Ashoka canvases along with Lakshmibai. Ram and Krishna converse with Guru Gobind Singh. These are not political choices; they are civilisational ones. The message is profound: India is not made by any one moment or man, but by the multitude.Each page tells a story — not just of governance, but of a people’s quest for meaning, dignity and justice. The illustrations don’t just depict India’s past; they foreshadow its constitutional future. They also reveal the imagination of our founding fathers — men and women who dreamt of a document that did not merely prescribe but evoked, that did not merely legislate but inspired. In doing so, they gave us a map of memory, a charter of culture and a mirror of our moral fibre.In an age of black-andwhite binaries, these lush illustrations are a reminder that Indian constitutionalism is not a single tone; it is a rainbow of responsibilities and rights, shades of heritage and hope. Such images comprise an unspoken preamble, another level of overture — a visual message of the part of the mind that believes, that preps the soul before the brain engages. This document is not just a blueprint for governance. It is a mirror of our moral inheritance.Where other constitutions speak in articles and amendments, ours breathes through allegory and art. This is not ornamental. It is transformative. The illustrated Constitution serves as a counter-narrative to the sterile image of law. It reveals that justice, too, can be beautiful. Democracy, too, can be drawn. Nationhood, too, can be painted.These illustrations also turn the Indian Constitution into an entity reflecting India’s unique constitutional identity. What other Constitution dares to blend Shiva’s cosmic dance with federal finance, or show Akbar while listing bureaucratic services? Where else do deserts, oceans and ancient sculptures frame legal architecture? The uniqueness of our illustrated Constitution lies in its fusion of text and texture, its legal gravitas softened by visual grace. It is India’s original ‘living document’, long before the courts used that phrase.The manuscript’s USP is its humanity, its ability to speak to citizens as much through sight as through statute. It underscores an oft-ignored truth: a Constitution is not just a legal contract; it is a cultural compact. It must speak to the head and the heart, to the reason and the rasa (aesthetic essence). The illustrated Constitution accomplishes this with quiet dignity.In an era of quick fixes and digital templates, the Indian Constitution’s illustrated version is a slow, deliberate and divine act of nation-building. It reflects the care with which India imagined herself. Not just legally, but visually, morally and spiritually.The 22 illustrations are India’s constitutional haiku — short, symbolic and stirring. They are not footnotes. In their silence, they speak. In their stillness, they move. And in their artistry, they awaken a nation’s conscience. They make the Indian Constitution a testament to timelessness.","As we turn 76 as a constitutional Republic, we should underline a lesserknown and unique facet of the Gita and the Bible of our governance. With each page we turn, we step into an art gallery of Indian being. The illustrations don’t just depict India’s past; they foreshadow its constitutional future.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127519851,imgsize-721797,width-400,resizemode-4/127519851.jpg"

From Planning Room to Precision Strike: The Vir Chakra Story of Wing Cdr Joy Chandra | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Kargil war hero Subedar Major and honorary Lieutenant Sanjay Kumar has been given the rank of honorary captain for his long, selfless service to the Army. The Param Vir Chakra recipient is among 2,241 JCOs of the Army who have been conferred honorary commissioned ranks on the eve of Republic Day.Kumar is a legendary officer (13 JAK Rifles) who was awarded India's highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 Kargil war. On July 4, 1999, he had single-handedly captured Flat Top, Point 4875, by neutralising enemy machine-gun posts despite severe injuries. Kumar's name resonates far beyond military circles for his courage and bravery during the India-Pakistan war.At least 437 JCOs have been elevated to honorary captain rank, while 1,804 JCOs have been conferred the rank of honorary lieutenant, recognising their decades of selfless military service, according to an official notification.Honorary ranks in the Army are conferred on JCOs with impeccable service records who have displayed professional excellence and sterling leadership qualities at unit level. While these ranks - honorary lieutenant and honorary captain- do not alter command structures, they carry deep symbolic value within the armed forces.The number of those given the honour this year highlights the oft-neglected contributions of subedars and subedar majors, who form the bedrock of the Army's functioning. They train young soldiers, preserve regimental traditions, enforce discipline and provide continuity in some of the most challenging operational environments in the world. In addition to the honour and protocol status, these ranks can result in a modest enhancement in pension benefits, depending on applicable rules.",Kumar is a legendary officer (13 JAK Rifles) who was awarded India's highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 Kargil war.

Old Vs New Income Tax Regime: How Much More Tax Are You Saving Over Years?

These charts by EY have been prepared on the following assumptions:

Section 80C deduction (maximum Rs 1.5 lakh) considered under the old tax regime. Other deductions/ exemptions such as medical insurance, home loan interest, house rent allowance are not considered. Standard deduction of Rs 50000 under the old regime and standard deduction as notified from time to time (Nil, Rs 50,000, Rs 75,000) under new regime is considered.

Each year the Budget speech is eagerly watched and listened to by the common man and middle class taxpayers, seeking answer to a simple query: will my tax burden reduce this year? Even finance ministers presenting the Budget are aware of the populist impact of their speech, in case tax relief measures are announced.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Will tax slab and tax rate changes be introduced? Sitharaman, who will present her ninth budget, is also the FM who introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020.The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one and every year, taxpayers carefully calculate the tax liability under each before deciding on which one to opt for.Over the years, the new income tax regime has seen several changes, and the tax liability under it has progressively come down at various salary levels, and it has become increasingly more attractive compared to the old regime.In her Budget speech in 2020, FM Nirmala Sitharaman explained the rationale for the introduction of a new income tax regime: the need for simpler compliance.“...The Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals,” she said.Hence, a new and simplified income tax regime was introduced to provide “significant relief” to individual taxpayers. The idea was for a tax regime that offers reduced rates for taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions.The biggest takeaway was that the 30% tax slab under the new regime kicked in at an income above Rs 15 lakh compared to Rs 10 lakh under the old tax regime.At that time individuals under both regimes earning income up to Rs 5 lakh did not have to pay tax with the benefit of Section 87A.FM Sitharaman explained the gains: In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue to a taxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by him. For example, a person earning Rs 15 lakh in a year and not availing any deductions etc. will pay only Rs 1,95,000 as compared to Rs 2,73,000 in the old regime. Thus his tax burden shall be reduced by 78,000 in the new regime. He would still be the gainer in the new regime even if he was taking deduction of Rs 1.5 Lakh under various sections of Chapter- VI-A of the Income Tax Act under the old regime.Over the years, the government has introduced substantial changes under the new income tax regime - introduction of standard deduction benefits, higher standard deduction limit of Rs 75,000, evolving tax slabs and tax rates.In the Union Budget 2023, tax slabs under the new regime were further tweaked to:Importantly the following big changes were introduced:In the interim budget of 2024, the standard deduction under the new regime was raised to Rs 75,000.Last year, FM Sitharaman’s Budget brought sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, making it even more attractive for taxpayers. With higher rebate, tax outgo on income up to Rs 12 lakh was reduced to ZERO!Explaining the journey, Sitharaman said, “Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax’ slab was raised to Rs 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to Rs 5 lakh in 2019 and to Rs 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our government's trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.”Income tax slabs under the new regime saw big changes, with the 30% tax slab now kicking in for incomes above Rs 24 lakh, as against Rs 15 lakh earlier.One noteworthy point is that in all these years since the introduction of the new income tax regime, the old tax regime with higher deductions and exemptions but also higher tax rates continues to function, though without any changes. The intent of the government is clear: with the new tax regime made the default regime, and all changes and benefits of lower taxes, taxpayers are being urged to shift to it.But, how much is the tax benefit under the new tax regime compared to the old regime? The tax outgo has changed in the last 5 years, and at various income levels, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down substantially compared to the old tax regime.For a better understanding, we take a look at how tax outgo has changed over the last five years at various income levels of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 20 lakh, and Rs 40 lakh.If for an income level of Rs 10 lakh, you had to pay Rs 75,400 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 78,000 in FY21 to Rs 54,600 in FY24, Rs 44,200 in FY25 to NIL in FY26! It continues to be Rs 75,400 under the old regime.Similarly, if for an income level of Rs 20 lakh, you had to pay Rs 366,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 351,000 in FY21 to Rs 296,400 in FY24, Rs 278,200 in FY25 to Rs 192,400 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 174,200!The impact is also visible at higher income levels. If for an income level of Rs 40 lakh, you had to pay Rs 990,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 975,000 in FY21 to Rs 920,400 in FY24, Rs 902,200 in FY25 to Rs 787,800 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 202,800!The above charts are broadly indicative, and the tax outgo will depend on your income level, the amount of deductions and exemptions you claim. For an income of over Rs 12 lakh, and above a certain amount of deductions and exemptions, the old regime may be more suitable at various salary levels.Hence, while the above examples offer a clear picture on how the tax benefits have increased over years under the new regime, it is important to calculate the total amount of deductions and exemptions you avail for a better understanding.As an example, at the current tax slabs in the old and new regime, if you have a gross income of more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then the old regime makes sense only if your total deductions and exemptions are over Rs 8 lakh.This level of deductions and exemptions is for the 30% tax slab. It will vary for incomes below Rs 24 lakh.Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India tells TOI, “Over the past few years, the new tax regime has clearly boosted the take‑home pay of most salaried taxpayers due to the rising basic exemption limits and reduced slab rates. In FY 2020-21, for an income of Rs 10 lakh, the tax liability under the new tax regime was slightly higher compared to the old tax regime. However, over the subsequent five years (FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26), the reforms have reversed this picture, resulting in savings of Rs 75,400 in FY 2025-26 under the new tax regime as compared to the old tax regime. ”""For an income of Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, the savings in FY 2025-26 are approximately Rs 1.74 lakh and Rs 2.02 lakh respectively as compared to the old tax regime. Now, if we compare savings under the new tax regime over the six-year period (FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26), savings have risen significantly — around Rs 78,000 at an income of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 1.58 lakh at Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1.87 lakh at Rs 40 lakh. With substantial taxpayers going ahead with the default/new tax regime, further slab adjustments in Budget 2026 could accelerate this trend,” he adds.While a certain percentage of taxpayers continue to benefit from the old tax regime, for example those who claim high levels of House Rent Allowance, or those who have a home loan, over 70% of tax returns filed for AY 2024-25 were under the new regime. Tax experts expect more taxpayers to switch to the new income tax regime in the ongoing financial year, with the Rs 12 lakh zero tax level prompting many to shift.However, experts note that the government may look to introduce some popular deductions and exemptions such as Section 80C and home loan interest benefits to incentivise savings and housing.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Will tax slab and tax rate changes be introduced? Will tax relief measures be announced? The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one and every year, taxpayers carefully calculate the tax liability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127475885,imgsize-113754,width-400,resizemode-4/old-vs-new-income-tax-regime.jpg"

NEW DELHI: With the Iran crisis simmering, IndiGo has cancelled its Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights till Jan 28. Air India, which had been overflying the safer eastern parts of Iran on its flights to and from North America, will now examine the situation once the same resume after the snowstorm on the east coast in a day or so.“In view of the prevailing situation and after careful assessment, IndiGo flights scheduled to operate on Jan 26, 27 and 28, 2026, to and from Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku have been cancelled,” IndiGo said on X Sunday.Air India flights to and from Europe had stopped overflying Iran after a Jan 16 advisory from European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). “Given the ongoing situation and the potential for US military action, which has placed Iranian air defence forces on a heightened state of alert, there is currently an increased likelihood of misidentification within (Iranian airspace). The presence and possible use of a wide range of weapons and air-defence systems, combined with unpredictable state responses and the potential activation of SAM systems, creates a high risk to civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels…. Air operators should not operate within the airspace of Iran at all altitudes and flight levels,” EASA advisory had said.AI has since then not been overflying Iran on flights to and from Europe as the advisory is for ""third country operators authorised by EASA, when conducting operations to, from and within the EU.” AI and many other airlines are overflying Iraq. Once East Coast flights resume, AI will take a call based on the situation that time regarding overflying the safer eastern part of Iran.The situation is dynamic and airlines are taking decisions in real time, very frequently changing course of their enroute flights in troubled West Asia","IndiGo has cancelled its Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights till Jan 28.

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

""A Game-Changer for Trade and Defense"" Expert on India-EU Free Trade Agreement

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi’s discussions with EU leaders this week will herald a new chapter in bilateral ties, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said as he welcomed European Council and Commission presidents, Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen respectively, in a meeting.The leaders, who were treated to a ceremonial welcome Sunday shortly after Costa’s arrival, will attend the January 26 Republic Day parade as chief guests, ahead of the 16th EU-India summit on Tuesday. The summit takes place at a time Europe’s transatlantic alliance is under strain and India too is in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s trade policies.Shortly after the welcome ceremony, von der Leyen said in a post on X India and Europe had made a clear choice – the choice of strategic partnership, dialogue and openness. “Leveraging our complementary strengths. And building mutual resilience.We are showing a fractured world that another way is possible,” said the president.The summit will see four major outcomes – successful conclusion of the FTA negotiations although the deal itself would be signed later, signing of a security and defence partnership that von der Leyen in an interview to TOI described as a likely game-changer, an agreement to promote mobility and adoption of a 2026-2030 joint comprehensive strategic agenda.Jaishankar later also met his counterpart Kaja Kallas and said the talks reflected growing comfort and strong convergences.According to senior EU officials accompanying the leaders, both sides were closing in on the conclusion of the trade talks that would result in the “mother of all deals”. Von der Leyen had told TOI ahead of her arrival EU was committed to finding workable, mutually beneficial solutions on issues such as CBAM (EU carbon border tax), automobiles, and steel.According to Brussels, the new strategic agenda will look to ramp up cooperation across 4 key pillars - prosperity and sustainability, technology and innovation, security and defence and connectivity and global issues.Under the new security and defence partnership, which the EU has so far signed with only 8 “trusted and like-minded countries, both sides will also announce the launch of negotiations for a Security of Information Agreement that would facilitate the exchange of classified information. Von der Leyen, however, also told TOI while the partnership will help diversify military supply chains and improve access to new capabilities, EU member-states will retain their authority on export of high-end technology. “The export of high-end defence technology is, and will remain, a national competence,” she had said. The partnership will allow both sides to eplore defence industrial collaboration and facilitate India’s participation in EU security and defence initiatives in line with EU Treaty-based frameworks.With the new mobility agreement, EU is also hoping to attract more highly skilled professionals, researchers and students to Europe, while blocking illegal migration. In all, 8-10 agreements are expected to be signed at the summit. The ministry of external affairs called India-EU relations a partnership of trust and reliability.The strategic agenda along with a joint statement will reaffirm both sides’ commitment to effective multilateralism and a free and open Indo-Pacific. The leaders will also discuss the need to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end and the situation in West Asia. EU leaders are likely to urge Modi to provide more humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.","PM Narendra Modi's discussions with EU leaders this week will herald a new chapter in bilateral ties, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Sunday awarded group captain Shubhanshu Shukla - who became the first Indian to set foot on the International Space Station - with Ashoka Chakra -- India's highest peacetime gallantry award.Shukla spent 18 days in space and became the second Indian to have gone to space and the first to visit the ISS as part of the historic Axion-4 mission. This came 41 years after Rakesh Sharma flew aboard the Russian Soyuz-11 space mission.Shukla served as the pilot for the Axiom Mission-4 (Ax-4) to the ISS and left an indelible mark on India's remarkable advancements in human space exploration.As a fighter pilot, Shukla has an impressive record of 2,000 hours of flight experience across various aircraft, including the Su-30 MKI, MiG-21, MiG-29, Jaguar, Hawk, Dornier and An-32.The Axiom-4 mission was executed by US-based private firm Axiom Space and it involved the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).Additionally, the President Droupadi Murmu approved awards and 301 military decorations and gallantry awards to 70 armed forces personnel, including six who would receive the honour posthumously.These include one Ashoka Chakra, three Kirti Chakra, 13 Shaurya Chakra, including one posthumous, one Bar to Sena Medal (gallantry), 44 Sena Medals (gallantry), six Nao Sena Medals (gallantry) and two Vayu Sena Medals.Two women officers of the Indian Navy -- Lieutenant Commander Dilna K and Lieutenant Commander Roopa A -- were honoured with the Shaurya Chakra award, months after they made history by completing an extraordinary expedition to circumnavigate the globe, covering 21,600 nautical miles (approx 40,000 km) over an eight-month period onboard Indian Naval Sailing Vessel (INSV) Tarini.The Shaurya Chakra is India's third-highest peacetime gallantry award after the Ashoka Chakra and the Kirti Chakra.The Kirti Chakra has been conferred on Major Arshdeep Singh from 1 Assam Rifles, Naib Subedar Doleshwar Subba from 2 Para (Special Forces) and Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair.Nair was one of the four astronauts who underwent training for India's first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan.The decision to confer the Ashoka Chakra on Shukla is seen as the government's recognition of the importance of the space sector as the coveted honour is generally bestowed on military personnel for showing ""most conspicuous bravery"".The President approved to armed forces and other personnel.",Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to set foot on the International Space Station.

Does it go against Article 14?

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026. The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff. The regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127388943,imgsize-100582,width-400,resizemode-4/ugc.jpg"

Throwback 25: Five Indian Weapons That Crushed Terror And Dominated Pakistan in Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India’s air superiority during its “88-hour Operation Sindoor coerced Pakistan into a ceasefire” during the May 7-10, 2025 conflict, according to a detailed European military analysis.The report, titled ‘Operation Sindoor: The India-Pakistan Air War (7–10 May 2025)’, has been authored by Adrien Fontanellaz and was published last week by the Centre d’Histoire et de Prospective Militaires (CHPM), an independent Swiss military history and strategic studies institution based in Switzerland. Founded in 1969, CHPM is not affiliated with any govt and positions itself as a neutral forum for professional military research.Referring to last year’s Indo-Pak conflict, the report said, “This (May 2025) clash between the Pakistan and Indian air force s initially saw the former achieve a clear tactical victory by shooting down several enemy fighters, then largely fail in its conduct of strikes over Indian territory, as those were countered by an integrated air defence system whose effectiveness was one of the surprises of the conflict. Conversely, the Indian Air Force managed to significantly degrade the enemy's air defence system, then concluded the conflict by carrying out a series of spectacular strikes against Pakistan’s principal Air Force stations.Thus, by achieving clear air superiority, India coerced Islamabad into requesting a ceasefire .”Though the Indian govt never admitted losing any fighter aircraft, including Rafale, in the conflict, the report said, “The loss of at least one Indian Rafale fighter jet on the night of 7 May 2025, can be seen as the tip of the iceberg as this event, above all, made a strong impression in the West and attracted significant media attention. However, this sequence saw a large-scale confrontation between two competent air forces, equipped with small fleets of state-of-the-art aircraft designs, such as the J10C and the Rafale, supported by substantial fleets of fourth-generation combat aircraft as well as sophisticated integrated air defence networks and force multipliers. ”On the escalation of war, the report stated, “On the strategic plane, Operation Sindoor has led to conventional military clashes of considerable magnitude between two de facto nuclear-weapon states with differing doctrines regarding the use of nuclear weapons, which made the situation very tricky to handle, with a high risk of escalation and potentially catastrophic consequences.”“This episode provides valuable lessons on the tactical and operational plans, particularly because it illustrates the strong interpenetration between the military and communication lines of operation, as well as a paradigm that has been consistently confirmed over the years, namely the crucial role of long-range strikes,” the report further added.","India’s air superiority during its “88-hour Operation Sindoor coerced Pakistan into a ceasefire” during the May 7-10, 2025 conflict, according to a detailed European military analysis.

The stage is decorated... there is lighting, music... there is all the pomp and show, and the atmosphere is no less than a concert.It feels like a huge concert, but what is being sung there is the resonance of bhajans sung with complete concentration, dedication, and rhythm. This trend is being called ‘bhajan-clubbing’ today, and it’s becoming increasingly popular, especially among Gen Z,” he added.Modi also praised the efforts of the Indian community in Malaysia towards language diversity in schools, highlighting that now there are more than 500 Tamil schools in Malaysia. In addition to teaching the Tamil language, other subjects are also taught in Tamil. In his address, PM also lauded the UAE’s initiative to declare 2026 as the ‘Year of the Family’, likening it to India’s family system which is part of the country’s traditions.Reiterating the govt’s thrust on manufacturing high quality products in India, PM urged industry and start-ups to focus on quality and resolve to make excellence a benchmark in manufacturing. “Let us resolve to improve the quality of whatever we manufacture. Be it our textiles, technology, electronics or even packaging; an Indian product should become synonymous with top quality,” he said. “The era of ‘it just happens” and “it will go through somehow’ (chalta hai) is over. Come, let us prioritise quality with all our might this year. Let our only mantra be quality, quality and only quality,” Modi said.","PM Narendra Modi praised the youth for embracing the emerging trend of ‘bhajan- clubbing’ He said it is a powerful blend of devotion, culture, spirituality and modernity that resonates strongly with Gen Z. ‘Bhajans’ have been the soul of Indian culture for centuries, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127507426,imgsize-605257,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ians.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Mark Tully, one of the most well-known journalists to report from India, died at a private hospital in Delhi on Sunday. He was 90. He had been unwell for some time and was admitted to Max Hospital in Saket last week.Born in 1935 in Tollygunge, Kolkata, to British parents, Tully spent his early childhood in India. In the late 1930s, he was not allowed to socialise with local people. Ironically, India later became the centre of his life’s work.He studied at a boarding school in Darjeeling before being sent to England for further education. In a 2001 interview with the BBC after being selected for knighthood, Tully described England as “a very miserable place… dark and drab, without the bright skies of India”.The BBC reintroduced Tully to India in 1964 when it appointed him its New Delhi correspondent. This marked the beginning of his long association with the broadcaster, which lasted nearly three decades.In 1969, Tully was sent back to London after the Indian government barred the BBC following the broadcast of Phantom India, a French documentary critical of the country. He returned to Delhi in 1971 and became the BBC’s South Asia bureau chief the next year.During his career, Tully covered several defining moments in the region, including the 1971 Bangladesh war, the Emergency, the execution of former Pakistan president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Operation Blue Star, the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, the killing of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, and the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.His first book, Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi’s Last Battle (1985), co-written with Satish Jacob, focused on Operation Blue Star and the Punjab crisis. In No Full Stops in India (1988), he wrote, “The stories I tell in this book will, I hope, serve to illustrate the way in which Western thinking has distorted and still distorts Indian life.”Tully went on to write 10 books, both fiction and non-fiction, including India in Slow Motion (2002), India’s Unending Journey (2008), and India: The Road Ahead.He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1992, knighted in 2002, and received the Padma Bhushan in 2005.Tully resigned from the BBC in 1994 after publicly criticising the organisation’s internal culture. However, he remained based in Delhi and continued writing as a freelance journalist.On his 90th birthday in October, his son Sam Tully wrote on LinkedIn: “I think my father’s achievements are particularly significant for UK-India ties because of his abiding ties and affection for both countries… ‘Dil hai Hindustani, magar thoda Angrezi bhi!’”","Mark Tully, one of the most well-known journalists to report from India, died at a private hospital in Delhi on Sunday.

.

AHMEDABAD: One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025, a stark measure of how the American dream continues to pull immigrants through illegal and increasingly dangerous routes despite an aggressive crackdown.US Customs and Border Protection caught 23,830 Indians in 2025, far below the staggering 85,119 caught in 2024, yet enough to keep India among the top source countries. Most of them were single adults but agencies flagged a darker trend: a small flow of unaccompanied kids.Four years after the Jan 2022 Dingucha tragedy, when four of a Gandhinagar family froze to death while crossing from Canada to the US, kids continue to be abandoned near borders.The 2025 figures underscore a central paradox: enforcement has reduced numbers, but not the urge to try. For thousands, the promise of USA still outweighs walls, patrols and peril.US border officials link the drop to stepped-up surveillance, policy shifts under President Donald Trump and a sweeping enforcement drive by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Smuggling corridors have narrowed, patrols intensified and penalties sharpened.Still, attempts continue.“Data shows deterrence, not elimination,” said experts tracking migration flows. They point to the enduring economic and social pull of US, paired with smuggling networks that quickly rewire routes when pressure mounts.Indian agencies monitoring illegal immigration, particularly from Gujarat, echo that assessment. “There is a huge decrease due to stricter US policies and a massive crackdown by agencies, including ICE,” said a senior officer, adding, “But the numbers are still there because the aspiration of settling in US, especially among Gujaratis, continues.”Mexico remains a key pathway, but 2025 marked a visible shift north. More Indians were intercepted along the Canada-US border, reflecting how smugglers are abandoning the heavily policed Latin American corridors for riskier alternatives.“Routes via Mexico and Canada through hubs like Dubai and Istanbul were the main illegal channels. These routes are now heavily hampered,” the officer said. “People who want to illegally enter US are still trying through newer, riskier paths.”","One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025.

Gridlock forces many tourists trek downhill from Manali



.

KULLU: A 10-hour traffic crawl for 15km. Sub-zero cold. Tourists ditch cars, walk on ice.Thousands of tourists remained stranded in Manali for a second straight day Sunday as icy roads and an unprecedented traffic surge brought the popular hill town in Himachal Pradesh's Kullu district to a standstill.Exit routes out of Manali were the worst hit. Slippery stretches and tailgating vehicles produced jams stretching more than 10km, all the way to the 15 Mile point near Patlikuhal, a small market town lower down the valley where snow had begun melting.A viral video allegedly shot around 2.30 am Sunday showed tourists hauling trolley bags across ice, some slipping and falling. ""This is the situation of people who rushed to Manali, ended up stranded,"" wrote an X user, @rose_k01. For hundreds, the ordeal stretched through the night. Buses, taxis and cars barely moved as mercury plunged below freezing. Many, including children, spent Saturday night shivering inside vehicles. ""It took us 12 hours just to reach Patlikuhal,"" said Kulwinder Singh from Ferozepur, Punjab. ""We spent the night shivering in the car. I have never seen such a nightmarish traffic jam.""This is the situation of people who rushed to Manali, ended up stranded,” wrote an X user, @rose_k01.For hundreds, the ordeal stretched through the night.

Many, including children, spent Saturday night shivering inside vehicles. “It took us 12 hours just to reach Patlikuhal,” said Kulwinder Singh from Ferozepur, Punjab. “We spent the night shivering in the car. I have never seen such a nightmarish traffic jam.”The distance from Manali to Patlikuhal is roughly 15km. For many, it took more than 10 hours.Despite snow-clearing efforts by NHAI, icy patches and sheer traffic volume rendered the two-lane Kullu-Manali highway nearly impassable. Weather stayed largely clear through Saturday and Sunday, but the road did not.Frustration boiled over. Desperate to escape, several tourists abandoned vehicles and trekked downhill on foot toward Patlikuhal. “This is easily the worst jam I’ve ever seen,” said Himanshu Sharma, a tourist from Noida. “I can reach Patlikuhal faster on foot than by car.”As thousands tried to get out, thousands more attempted to get in — chasing snowfall in Manali. Police blocked fresh inflow at Patlikuhal and Bhuntar, the valley town near Kullu airport. “We are only allowing 4x4 vehicles beyond Patlikuhal to prioritise evacuation of stranded tourists,” said Manali DSP K D Sharma. Kullu SP Madan Lal called the rush unprecedented. About 200 police personnel have been deployed round the clock, but the narrow mountain highway remains overwhelmed.More trouble may be coming. The Met office in Shimla has forecast another spell of heavy rain and snow from the night of Jan 26 through Jan 28. A severe cold wave continues across the Himalayan state. Tabo village in the remote Lahaul-Spiti district recorded the state’s lowest temperature Sunday at -10 degrees Celsius.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed grief over the death of veteran journalist and author Mark Tully. He remembered Tully as a “towering voice of journalism” whose work reflected a deep connection with India and its people.In a post on X, PM Modi wrote, “Saddened by the passing of Sir Mark Tully, a towering voice of journalism. His connect with India and the people of our nation was reflected in his works. His reporting and insights have left an enduring mark on public discourse. Condolences to his family, friends and many admirers.”Tully, 90, passed away at Max Hospital in Saket on Sunday afternoon. The news was confirmed by his close friend and fellow journalist Satish Jacob.Hospital said that Tully had been admitted on January 21 under the nephrology department.

.

NEW DELHI: In keeping with its practice of taking the Padma awards' focus away from big cities and well-known names and to recognise hinterland talents in a wide spectrum of fields, the Modi govt picked this year's awardees from 84 districts spread across 30 states and UTs. Ten districts figure on the list for the first time since Independence, officials noted.Among such ""unsung heroes"", as officials described them, are Taga Ram Bheel, recognised for reviving Rajasthan's fading folk instrument Algoza, and Meghalaya-based environmentalist Hally War.Former Indian tennis star Vijay Amritraj, based in the US, is among the six Padma Bhushan awardees under foreigners/NRI/PIO/OCI.A maximum 15 winners are officially from Maharashtra, including the likes of actors Dharmendra and R Madhavan - one of the key characters in 'Dhurandhar', said to have been inspired by NSA Ajit Doval - who found their calling in the state, followed by 13 from Tamil Nadu and 11 each from West Bengal and UP. Eight each are from Karnataka and Kerala, including Vellappally Natesan, a functionary of SNDP - an outfit that has positioned itself as the vehicle of Izhavas, the single most numerically preponderant caste in Kerala - and a BJP ally in Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala are heading to assembly polls, though official sources were quick to point out that govt has annually tried to give a diverse representation regionally, selecting the awardees from 84 districts across the country.Former IPS officer K Vijay Kumar, associated with the killing of notorious sandalwood smuggler Veerappan, Armind Fernandez, who established Asia's first human milk bank, and ex-Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati, hockey player Savita Punia are among the other Padma winners besides politicians Bhagat Singh Kosher and late V K Malhotra, both from BJP.Achuthanandhan, a vocal and popular former Kerala CM, and Soren join other veteran politicians from non-BJP backgrounds like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan who got Padma recognition from this govt.Padma Shri awardees include former MHA functionary R V Mani, who had protested against a change of affidavit in the Ishrat Jehan encounter case. In his book, 'Hindu Terror: Insider account of Ministry of Home Affairs 2006-2010', Mani alleged he was pressured by the UPA govt to sign a second affidavit that fabricated a narrative of ""Saffron Terror"".Officials said govt made extensive efforts to identify achievers from all corners, highlighting that over 39,000 nominations were received and evaluated through an exhaustive and rigorous process of multiple rounds of scrutiny and consultation with ministry, state administration and domain experts. Awardees included 48 super senior citizens (80 years and above) and many from traditionally deprived sections of society."," Modi govt picks awardees from 84 districts spread across 30 states and UTs.

ED attaches 37 properties of Pearl Agro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-attaches-37-properties-of-pearl-agro/articleshow/127515574.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: Pearl Agro Corp Ltd, a multi-level marketing firm that promised plot allotments to lakhs across the country and deceived investors and regulators for nearly two decades, raised more than Rs 60,000 crore and siphoned off most of it into personal assets in India and abroad, according to an ED probe report. On Sunday, ED said it has managed to locate 37 properties of the accused in Ludhiana and Jaipur worth Rs 2,000 crore and attached these.The total attachment in the case has reached Rs 7,600 crore, ED said. The fresh attachment includes a prime land close to Jaipur airport worth over Rs 1,500 crore, sources said. In less than two months, between Dec and now, the agency has attached assets of PACL and its promoter Nirmal Singh Bhangoo, worth over Rs 6,000 crore, in its ongoing money laundering investigation in the case.An estimate by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which is also probing the case, revealed that nearly six crore investors have been cheated by Bhangoo and his associates over the past two decades. The magnitude of the crime is such that Supreme Court constituted a committee headed by Justice RM Lodha to ensure smooth restitution of lost money through the sale of assets attached by ED.The main accused and promoter of PACL, Bhangoo, has died and his wife Prem Kaur, two daughters Barinder and Sukhwinder Kaur, son-in-law Gurpratap Singh and close associate Prateek Kumar are wanted by ED to establish the money trail.The accused are absconding - not joining the investigation - while non-bailable warrants have been issued against them, according to a senior official.Despite CBI and Punjab police having registered multiple FIRs, since as early as 2014, against Bhangoo and his associates, the probe did not achieve much as the ""proceeds of crime"" could not be traced. The initial money trail established by ED revealed the accused had siphoned off the money by depositing them in Kolkata-based shell companies, withdrawing cash and then laundering them to Dubai through hawala dealers to buy hotels and resorts overseas, including Australia.ED began its money laundering probe in 2016 and has filed three prosecution complaints (chargesheets) so far while investigation is still in progress to identify assets of the accused. In 2018, ED had attached two properties of the accused in Australia worth Rs 462 crore. Investors across Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra, Telengana, Karnataka, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand have lost their money to the collective investment, or ponzi scheme.The attached assets once confirmed by the PMLA adjudicating authority are confiscated by ED, and the details of these properties are then shared with Justice Lodha Committee, appointed by the SC for overseeing the process of disposing of properties and to refund the amount to investors, according to a senior ED official.","Pearl Agro Corp Ltd, a multi-level marketing firm, raised more than Rs 60,000 crore and siphoned off most of it into personal assets in India and abroad.

“Invitation To Nation Building”: PM Modi Hands Over 61,000 Appointment Letters At 18th Rozgar Mela

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Sunday described voters as the soul of democracy and called for celebrating the youth, who have come of age, as individuals who hold the power to transform the destiny of the country.School and college campuses can be hubs for movements that ensure every eligible youth is enrolled as a voter, the PM said, emphasising that the National Voters' Day is an ideal occasion for the movement and celebrations every year.Modi's emphasis on the importance of voters in a letter to volunteers of MY-Bharat, a govt-run youth empowerment initiative, appeared to be a pointed counter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's ""vote chori"" campaign against his govt and Election Commission.The Prime Minister said that to be a voter is the ""greatest privilege and responsibility in a democracy"". ""The voter is the Bhagya Vidhata of our development journey,"" he said. ""Our first-time voters should be welcomed into democracy as individuals who hold the power to transform the destiny of our country,"" he added.Modi said that he was connecting with them as a fellow citizen who takes great pride in Indian democracy.This year marks the 75th anniversary of the first general election which illustrated the inherent democratic spirit of Indians, he emphasised. That indelible ink on a finger is a badge of honour that ensures democracy remains vibrant and purposeful, Modi added.He said that ""at home and in our residential societies, we can celebrate the same (first-time voters) by sharing sweets. Our schools and colleges have a vital role to play as nurseries of democratic values."" It should be observed joyously like a birthday, the Prime Minister added.""People's commitment to voting is so deep that whether they live high in the Himalayas, in the islands of Andaman and Nicobar, in deserts or in dense forests, they turn up to ensure their voice is heard,""Modi said.He also touched on the issue in his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' broadcast, lauding voters as the soul of democracy.In his letter, Modi said the participation of women, especially young ones, is crucial for an inclusive democracy. The volunteers of the platform - MY-Bharat - belong to a generation that does not wait for things to happen, but actively participates in making things happen with a ""can do"" spirit, he said, asking them to spread awareness about the importance of becoming a voter.The Prime Minister said, ""Let us resolve to make every effort towards strengthening our democracy and creating a developed, inclusive and self-reliant Bharat.""","PM Narendra Modi Sunday described voters as the soul of democracy.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo cancelled Sunday its Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku services till Jan 28 and announced refuelling halts on several flights to the CIS region as rising tensions around Iran are rippling through Indian aviation, forcing flight cancellations, fuel stops and fresh route reviews.As airlines scrambled to keep aircraft out of potentially hostile airspace, IndiGo said on X: ""In view of the recent developments around Iran, we are making certain proactive changes to our flight schedules as part of our continued focus on safety.""Air India is reassessing its transcontinental operations as the situation evolves. The carrier had already stopped overflying Iran on Europe-bound routes after a Jan 16 advisory from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency warned of a heightened risk to civil aviation. ""Given the ongoing situation and the potential for US military action, which has placed Iranian air defence forces on a heightened state of alert, there is currently an increased likelihood of misidentification within Iranian airspace,"" the EASA advisory said.It warned that the possible use of surface-to-air missile systems created ""a high risk to civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels,"" urging operators to avoid Iranian airspace entirely. Air India complied on European routes, as the advisory applies to third-country operators authorised by EASA when flying to, from or within EU. Many airlines, including Air India, have instead been routing flights over Iraq. Flights to and from North America are now under review.Air India plans to reassess routing once services resume after a snowstorm disrupted operations along the US east coast.","IndiGo cancels Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku services till Jan 28.

UGC issues new rules to curb caste bias as plaints up 118%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ugc-issues-new-rules-to-curb-caste-bias-as-plaints-up-118/articleshow/127513368.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: A fresh regulatory push aims at making India's campuses safer and more inclusive, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) rolling out a strengthened framework to curb caste-based discrimination across universities and colleges.The move comes as complaints of caste-linked bias have more than doubled over five years - rising 118.4% from 173 in 2019-20 to 378 in 2023-24 - and amid sustained judicial scrutiny over student welfare in institutions.Crucially, the new framework shifts the burden of action squarely onto institutions, making campus leadership directly accountable for preventing discrimination and responding to complaints in a time-bound manner.Notified last week, the UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026 replace the 2012 rules and significantly widen their scope.For the first time, caste-based discrimination is explicitly defined to cover scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes, correcting a key gap in the draft framework. The regulations also broaden the meaning of discrimination to include unfair treatment on grounds of caste, religion, gender, disability and place of birth, and any act that undermines human dignity or equality in educationAt the institutional level, every higher education institution is now required to set up an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) to drive inclusion and support disadvantaged students, which will be backed by an Equity Committee headed by the institution chief.These committees must include representation from SCs, STs, OBCs, women and persons with disabilities, and are mandated to meet at least twice a year.EOCs will publish bi-annual reports detailing campus demographics, dropout rates, complaints received and their status, introducing a new layer of transparency.The rules also provide for round-the-clock equity helplines, mobile ""equity squads"" to monitor vulnerable campus spaces, and designated ""equity ambassadors"" across hostels, departments and facilities to flag violations early.Complaints must trigger a committee meeting within 24 hours, with institutions required to act within fixed timelines. Appeals can be taken to an ombudsperson.Crucially, UGC has armed itself with sharper enforcement tools. Institutions that fail to comply with teh regulations can be barred from UGC schemes, stopped from offering degree or online programmes, and in extreme cases removed from the UGC's recognised list - a step that effectively strips an institution of its academic standing.A national-level monitoring committee, with representatives from professional councils and civil society, will oversee implementation and review cases of discrimination at least twice a year.UGC data shows that Equal Opportunity Cells have already received over 1,500 complaints in recent years, even as audits point to uneven resolution and patchy documentation. Supreme Court has repeatedly sought caste-wise data from regulators, underlining the need for credible reporting on the issue.Vice-chancellors say the new framework marks a shift from advisory guidelines to enforceable obligations. Whether it delivers lasting change will depend on transparent data, independent oversight and consistent follow-through - measures that will now decide how far India's campuses move from policy intent to lived equity.",University Grants Commission rolls out strengthened framework to curb caste- based discrimination.

Marco Rubio Talks To Jaishankar On India-US Trade Deal Talks, Congratulates On Enacting Nuclear Bill

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar met a three-member US Congressional delegation along with US ambassador to India Sergio Gor.He later said in a post on X he had a good interaction with the delegation and discussed various aspects of India-US ties, along with the Indo-Pacific and Ukraine conflict.""Congressional interactions have always been an important facet of our relationship,"" said the minister.According to Gor, they had a productive meeting on ways to strengthen US-India partnership for stronger security, expanded trade and cooperation on critical technologies. The meeting came at a time both sides are looking to finally conclude negotiations for a bilateral trade deal that has remained elusive amidst general dissonance in bilateral ties.The delegation comprised two Republican Congressmen, Jimmy Patronis and Mike Rogers, and Democrat Adam Smith. The India-US ties witnessed a major downturn after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariff on Indian goods, including a 25% punitive levy over Russian oil purchases. Both sides have held multiple rounds of negotiations last year to firm up the proposed trade deal.

"Body found by cops not that of wife, man acquitted after 8 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/body-found-by-cops-not-that-of-wife-man-acquitted-after-8-years/articleshow/127510408.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: A man jailed for nearly eight years for allegedly murdering his wife and dumping her body in a drain was acquitted after the court found gaping holes in the prosecution story - starting with the most basic question that whether the body police recovered was even that of the missing woman.The additional sessions court also held that the prosecution failed to establish any motive for the alleged murder, and that the case, built entirely on circumstantial evidence, did not form an unbroken chain that pointed only to the accused.Rajiv Poddar, originally from Darbhanga in Bihar, was arrested on Aug 28, 2018, under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of IPC in connection with the disappearance of his wife, Sanjana. He had remained in jail since then, with even the Allahabad High Court rejecting his bail plea. On Thursday, the additional sessions court ordered his immediate release after acquitting him of all charges.The case began with an FIR being lodged at Vijaynagar police station on Aug 19, 2018, by Poddar himself, alleging that his wife was missing.On Aug 25 that year, when police recovered the body of a woman from a drain, Sanjana's brother, Rajesh, identified it as his sister's and alleged that Poddar must have killed her and disposed of the body.A case was registered on Aug 27 and Poddar was arrested the next day.During trial, the defence argued that the prosecution could never prove that the recovered body was Sanjana's. ""The body of the deceased unidentified woman was unidentifiable. The plaintiff's evidence does not clearly state the basis on which he identified the deceased as his sister, Sanjana, nor did the prosecution produce any witness to prove that the body of the deceased unidentified woman was actually that of Sanjana,"" defence counsel DK Mishra and Vikas Chaturvedi submitted.The case also involved a second body - that of a child - found along with the woman's body. Both bodies were mutilated, and the child's body was never identified - a gap that further complicated the prosecution's narrative about who the victims were and what exactly happened.The defence also argued that Poddar and Sanjana had three children, all of whom were with their father at home.A key discrepancy highlighted in court was between the complainant's claim of identification and the body's measurements recorded by investigators and medical evidence, which did not conclusively match Sanjana's description. The court noted that without reliable identification, the prosecution's central claim - that Sanjana was murdered and that the recovered body was hers - remained unproven.Police filed a chargesheet on Nov 6, 2018. A case under the Arms Act was registered over a knife that cops said was the murder weapon.But the court found the recovery doubtful. It recorded that prosecution witnesses admitted the recovery spot was a road frequented by people. ""Members of the public were also present at the time of the recovery, but the recovery report did not name any witnesses,"" the court noted.The judge said the prosecution's evidence did not establish a complete chain of circumstances, did not prove motive, and did not show that Poddar disposed of the body to destroy evidence.","Rajiv Poddar, originally from Darbhanga in Bihar, was arrested on Aug 28, 2018, in connection with the disappearance of his wife, Sanjana.

Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through ‘lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

SC order puts end to judiciary-rlys tussle over

manpower row

NEW DELHI: Citing the age-old proverb that 'No man shall be a judge in his own cause', Supreme Court has said the same is applicable to a judge also and they cannot pass an order in a case concerning themselves.A railway magistrate had initiated proceedings against railway administration and its officials, issuing a showcause notice for not providing him with requisite staff for checking tickets on rail premises and penalising offenders. But a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N K Singh reversed the Punjab and Haryana HC's order in the magistrate's favour. ""It is a case where the learned railway magistrate wants to become a judge of his own cause,"" SC said.The communication sent by him (the railway magistrate) to appellant no. 3 (senior divisional commercial manager of Northern Railways) cannot be termed as a judicial proceeding. In any case, the appellants have not acted beyond their official capacity,” the SC bench added.Supreme Court’s order brought to an end the tug-of-war between judiciary and railways administration arising out of criminal proceedings initiated against the commercial manager of Northern Railways for not providing sufficient manpower to the judicial officer.Special railway magistrate (SRM) at Ambala had passed the order and lodged a complaint against the officer, on grounds that he was being prevented from discharging his duties.The SRM conducts checks which are known as ‘magisterial checks’ to detect passengers travelling without tickets and also to punish persons guilty of other offences as provided under Railways Act. After not being provided with manpower to conduct ticket checks, the SRM had said it was a prima facie case of interference in his judicial functioning and issued a showcause notice to the railways official and a complaint was sent to chief judicial magistrate, Ambala, for trial.The railways administration and commercial manager of Northern Railways then moved Punjab and Haryana high court, which rejected their plea. The HC said the petitioner’s move to withdraw the checking staff was not only unfair but also reprimandable and directed the railways authorities to make available checking staff. “None of the railways authorities has any power to oust the jurisdiction of special railway magistrate in this regard,” HC said.But SC disagreed with the reasoning and quashed the proceedings in the case.",A railway magistrate had initiated proceedings against railway administration and its officials.

CHENNAI:

Rhinoceros, now found only in the swampy grasslands and riverine forests of Assam, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, roamed the foothills of the Western Ghats near Coimbatore some 3,500 years ago, archaeologists say.A team identified four bone fragments — two metacarpals and two carpals of the foot of an Indian rhino — at Molapalayam, a neolithic site. During the two seasons of excavations in 2021 and 2024 at the site, archaeologists unearthed a huge collection of bone fragments of 28 species of animals, including the Indian rhino.“The anatomical features of the bones match the rhino bones available in the reference collection,” said Abhayan G S, a faculty member at the department of archaeology, University of Kerala, who studied the samples with research scholar Ajith M.This is the third such find in south India after the bone fragments of a rhino were found in Payyampalli in Tirupattur district, and a fragmented skull of a fossilised rhino in Sathankulam in Tuticorin district. “This is a significant find as rhinos survived up to the middle of the second millennium BCE. According to the current zoogeography, the animal is restricted to Assam and north-eastern plains of India,” Abhayan said.The animal needs grasslands and marshes. “The foothills of the Western Ghats might have had grassland, as a single rhino requires many square kilometres of grassland for food,” said zooarchaeologist Pramod Joglekar, a retired professor of archaeology at Deccan College.“In Gujarat and Haryana, too, we found bone remains of the Indian rhino from the Harappan period. We also found bone remains in Odisha. It shows that rhinos were once spread across the Indian subcontinent,” he said.Archaeologist V Selvakumar of the department of maritime history and maritime archaeology at Tamil University, Thanjavur, who excavated the Molapalayam site, presented a paper on the finding at an international symposium on recent scientific studies in archaeology of Tamil Nadu in Madurai on Saturday.“A faunal analysis reveals that people who lived here constituted a pastoral community that reared cattle, sheep and goat. They also hunted animals such as deer and antelope. Their food also included a diverse range of small millets and pulses,” Selvakumar said.Researchers Sathish Naik and Aditya of Deccan College identified plants from the site. An analysis of bone fragments at the site found 28 species of animals, including cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, pig and dog, and wild animals such as nilgai, blackbuck, four-horned antelope, gazelle, chital and sambar deer, besides the Indian rhino.Radiocarbon dating has assigned 1,600 BCE to 1,400 BCE as the period of the site.","Rhinoceros roamed the foothills of the Western Ghats near Coimbatore some 3,500 years ago.

SRINAGAR:

From the snow-covered slopes of Gulmarg, J&K CM Omar Abdullah Sunday said Ladakh should be re-merged with the state and welcomed BJP’s official rejection of any further bifurcation of UT of J&K.“BJP legislators initially made statements about dividing Jammu and Kashmir . Now, if Tarun Chugh (BJP national general secretary) has clarified this is not the party’s stand. It is a good thing,” Omar told reporters after riding a snow scooter and skiing at the resort.“They (BJP) separated Ladakh from J&K and ruined it. We are saying Ladakh should be merged back with J&K,” he said.The CM also rejected any proposal to divide Jammu further. “We are not in favour of separating Jammu. Such theories are floated by BJP legislators and a few people in Kashmir who are close to the BJP,” he said.On August 5, 2019, the Union government abrogated Articles 370, 35A, which gave special status to J&K, and bifurcated and downgraded J&K into two Union Territories, UT of J&K and UT of Ladakh.A debate over the further bifurcation of J&K UT began early this month after BJP legislator Sham Lal Sharma pitched for a separate Jammu state, alleging discrimination against the region by “Kashmir-based rulers.”Several BJP legislators, including Vikram Randhawa, have since accused the CM of running the Kashmiri government and imposing “Kashmiri sentiment” on Jammu.Many in Kashmir, like Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone, in response advocated separation of two regions. “Maybe the time has come for an amicable divorce. This is not just about development. Jammu has become the proverbial stick to beat Kashmiris with,” Lone said.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti has rejected bifurcation of J&K, though she has sought two separate divisions in Jammu for Pir Panjal region of Rajouri Poonch and Chenab Valley comprising Kishtwar, Doda and Ramban.However, on Friday, leader of opposition in J&K Assembly, Sunil Sharma, and Chugh said under no circumstances will J&K ever be separated and the party’s top leadership is firmly committed to the unity and integrity of the Union Territory.After repeated statements by Sham Lal Sharma seeking a separate Jammu state, Javid Rana, minister for forests and environment in the state, was the first to call for the re-merger of Ladakh with J&K.National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah subsequently endorsed the demand. Omar reiterating the same position signals a clear shift in the NC’s stance on the UT of Ladakh. So far, the party was largely focused on the restoration of statehood to J&K.NC’s organisational footprint in Ladakh, particularly in Kargil, remains significant. Ladakh MP Mohmad Haneefa, a former Kargil district president of the NC, won the parliamentary election with the NC’s support and is close to the party. The Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC), Kargil, is currently run by the NC, with senior party leader Dr Mohd Jaffer Akhoo serving as its chief executive councillor.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah said Ladakh should be re-merged with the state.

'Only Miyas are evicted': Himanta Biswa Sarma dismisses charges of targeting indigenous Assamese,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-miyas-are-evicted-himanta-biswa-sarma-dismisses-charges-of-targeting-indigenous-assamese/articleshow/127477806.cms,"Himanta Biswa Sarma (ANI image)

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday claimed that eviction drives in the state have targeted only “Miyas”, a term used for Bengali-speaking Muslims and not indigenous Assamese people. He also accused opposition parties, particularly the Congress of appeasing the community ahead of the Assembly elections.Addressing reporters, Sarma rejected reports of a proposed eviction drive in the hills surrounding Guwahati. He asserted that no eviction would take place in the area till the elections, which are due in the first half of this year.Explaining his position, the chief minister said, “Only Miyas are evicted in Assam. How can Assamese people be evicted,” dismissing concerns over alleged anti-encroachment action in the Guwahati hills.The term ‘Miya’ has traditionally been used as a reference to Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam, who are often labelled by non-Bengali-speaking groups as Bangladeshi immigrants. In recent years, sections of the community have reclaimed the term as an assertion of identity.“Till election, when not a single eviction will happen, then people residing in the hills will understand that it was the media which gave them tension,” Sarma added.Highlighting the BJP-led government’s record, Sarma said that his party has been in power for nearly a decade and questioned claims of selective evictions.“The BJP has been in power in the state for 10 years now. Where has eviction been carried out in Guwahati hills?” he asked. The Assanm CM added that the government was instead working to grant land rights to people living in the hills without charging any premium.However, he maintained that eviction notices would be served to any Miya residing in the hills, but not to Assamese people.Launching a sharp attack on the Congress, Sarma accused the party of focusing solely on Bengali-speaking Muslims.Referring to applications for Assembly tickets, he said, “The Congress has said that it has received 750 applications from prospective candidates seeking party ticket. But what they didn't say is that 600 of these applicants are Miyas. Only about 120-130 applicants are Hindus.”Using sarcasm, he added, “There has been a ‘Miya ujan’ in Rajib Bhawan,” alleging that the Congress state headquarters was being swamped by people from the community.Sarma further claimed that the Congress posed a threat to Assam’s social fabric. “The Congress party has become a threat to our religion, culture, and the more convincingly we defeat them, the more we can save our state and ‘jati’,” he said. Sarma also alleged that the opposition parties would unite in the elections “for the sake of the Miyas”.The chief minister also said details of alleged Pakistan links involving Assam Congress president and Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi would be made public soon. “I want to reveal it by January 31. But since there is the Union Budget on February 1, there might be a delay by a day or two,” he said.The BJP and Sarma have been targeting Gogoi over allegations related to his wife’s purported links with Pakistan’s intelligence agency, the ISI.The Assam government had earlier constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe alleged interference by Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, who was claimed to have connections with Gogoi’s British wife, Elizabeth Colburn.The SIT submitted its report to Sarma, who also holds the Home portfolio, on September 10, the date which was initially set by the chief minister to present evidence backing his allegations against Gogoi.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma claims that eviction drives in the state have targeted only ‘Miyas’, a term used for Bengali-speaking Muslims.

NEW DELHI: Touching a raw nerve among the deprived communities and champions of social justice, a key parliamentary panel said the ""Not Found Suitable (NFS)"" tag should not be used to deny SC and ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions, acknowledging the prevalence of the controversial practice while urging ""better judgment"" in recruitment of faculty members in universities.The Parliamentary Committee on SC/ST Welfare, while making the observation in context of a review of appointments in Delhi University, weighed in on a subject that has become a matter of wider concern. ""While interacting with SC/ST teachers welfare association of DU, a glaring issue that came to fore was declaration of SC/ST teachers as 'NFS' for posts earmarked for them,"" it noted in a report tabled in the Parliament in its ongoing monsoon session.""The committee vehemently condemns the usage of the term 'NFS' to deny eligible SC/ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions. The committee opines that declaring SC/ST candidates 'NFS' is not only inappropriate and hurts the sentiments of deserving, eligible and well qualified SC/ST candidates,"" the panel, headed by BJP MP Faggan Singh Kulaste, noted.The NFS debate revolves around allegations that authorities in educational institutions are manipulating fair employment opportunities for Dalits and tribals by dismissing candidatures as lacking suitability for faculty positions.Claiming large-scale vacancies against SC/ST quota in central universities, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi recently blamed the governing BJP dispensation for 'NFS', which, he said, was being used to deny the marginalised communities leadership roles in education.""NFS is the new Manuvaad now. Eligible candidates from SC/ST/OBC communities are being deliberately declared 'unsuitable' so that they are kept away from education and leadership,"" he had posted on social media, triggering strong backlash from BJP that accused Congress for marginalising the backward classes.Now, the parliamentary panel has said ""in the present era there is no dearth of eligible SC/ST candidates holding impressive credentials in teaching fields. The committee recommend that SC/ST candidates applying for teaching posts should be judged solely on their academic prowess and that strict norms should not cloud the better judgement of selection panel.""The panel urged that SC/ST candidates should be given ample opportunities and should be helped in achieving their professional goals.","The NFS debate revolves around allegations that authorities in educational institutions are manipulating fair employment opportunities for Dalits and tribals.

Today is Janmashtami—a midnight memory that India has refused to forget for over two millennia. It marks the birth of Krishna , the eighth avatar of Vishnu , born not in a palace but in a prison, smuggled across the Yamuna in a storm while his uncle Kansa plotted murder in Mathura. The story is old, but not stale. Its blueprint lies in the Puranas—the Bhagavata and the Harivamsa—but its afterlife lives in every bhajan, Dahi Handi pyramid, classroom skit and sleepy-eyed midnight arati. Krishna isn’t just butter-thief and flute-player; he’s strategist, moral dissenter, and the only god who argues back. Janmashtami celebrates not just a divine birth but the idea that when injustice becomes law, God arrives as disruption. The festival teaches courage over convenience, joy over fear, and that sometimes, truth arrives dressed in mischief. If you think you know your Krishna—his, his teachings, his hidden footprints across temples and texts—here’s your chance to test it.

A positive change on the horizon

For many international students, getting a US student visa is the first big hurdle on the road to studying abroad. Yet, a significant number of applicants are refused, often leaving them puzzled and disappointed. One of the most common reasons cited for refusal is Section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs nonimmigrant visas such as the F-1 student visa.If your F-1 visa is denied under Section 214(b), it usually means the consular officer was not convinced either that you meet the visa requirements or that you intend to return to your home country after your studies. In short, the officer could not see enough evidence of your ties back home.It’s worth noting that certain work visas, like H-1B or L visas, do not require applicants to prove such ties.“Strong ties” refer to the personal, professional, or social connections that link you to your country. Examples include:Consular officers evaluate each application individually, considering these ties along with your travel plans and financial situation. The goal is to ensure you will leave the U.S. once your temporary stay ends.No. A Section 214(b) rejection applies only to the specific application that was denied. You are free to reapply at any time, especially if there have been meaningful changes in your circumstances or if you have new information to share.While there is no formal appeal, students can take steps to improve their chances on reapplication:In 2025, Congresswomen Veronica Escobar and María Elvira Salazar, along with 20 other lawmakers, introduced the DIGNITY Act, which aims to make F-1 visas allow dual intent. If approved, this would help students pursue studies without being automatically presumed to have immigrant intent, potentially reducing 214(b) refusals.A 214(b) refusal is not the end of the road. By understanding the reasons behind it and strengthening ties to your home country, you can improve your chances in the next visa application. With careful preparation, many students are still able to realise their dream of studying in the United States.","Section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act governs nonimmigrant visas such as the F-1 student visa.

Born on October 20, 1957, in Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, Chandrapuram Ponnusamy Radhakrishnan began his public life as an RSS swayamsevak and rose to become a State Executive Committee member of the Bharatiya Janasangh in 1974.

A two-time Lok Sabha MP from Coimbatore (1998 and 1999), Radhakrishnan held key parliamentary roles, including Chairman of the Standing Committee on Textiles and member of committees on PSUs and Finance.

He was also part of a parliamentary delegation to the UN General Assembly (2004) and the first Indian delegation to Taiwan.

In Tamil Nadu, he rose to prominence as the state BJP president (2004–2007), during which he undertook a massive 19,000 km, 93-day ‘Ratha Yatra’.

Radhakrishnan also made a mark in public administration. As Chairman of the Coir Board (2016–2020), he oversaw record exports worth Rs 2,532 crore.

He later served as the BJP’s All India in-charge for Kerala (2020–2022).

In 2023, he was appointed Governor of Jharkhand, where within his first four months, he travelled to all the 24 districts, interacting with citizens and district officials.

In July 2024, he took charge as Governor of Maharashtra, and had earlier been given additional responsibilities as Governor of Telangana and Lt. Governor of Puducherry.

Delhi Rain Chaos: Waterlogged Streets, Massive Traffic Jams Hit City After Sudden Change in Weather

YAMUNANAGAR: The Yamuna River, which had remained calm for nearly six weeks, surged into spate on Saturday following heavy rainfall in the hilly regions of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. As a precaution, all 18 gates of the Hathnikund Barrage in Yamunanagar district were opened for the first time this monsoon season, releasing a massive discharge of 1,78,896 cusecs of water downstream.The released water is expected to reach national capital Delhi within the next 30-48 hours, raising the river’s water level and posing a potential flood risk to low-lying areas.Officials of the Haryana irrigation and water resources department (IWRD) sounded alert sirens before opening the barrage gates and issued warnings to residents and farmers to stay away from the riverbanks and keep their livestock at a safe distance. The district administration, as well as the Delhi government, has been informed of the situation.Haryana IWRD superintendent engineer at Yamunanagar, R S Mittal stated that due to heavy rainfall in the hilly catchment areas, water levels rose sharply, necessitating the release. “This is the first time this season that all 18 gates of the Hathnikund Barrage have been opened. Supply to canals has been stopped to manage the increased flow,” Mittal said.As per official categorisation, a discharge of over one lakh cusecs is considered low flood, 1.5 lakh cusecs is termed medium flood, and anything above 2.5 lakh cusecs is classified as high flood. With the current release already exceeding the low flood mark, officials are keeping a close watch on the situation.Water levels in the Yamuna rose steadily since morning on Sunday. At 10 am, the flow was recorded at 74,304 cusecs, which rose to 81,353 cusecs at 11 am; 91,985 cusecs at noon, and 1.16 lakh cusecs by 1 pm. By 3 pm, the discharge peaked at 1.78 lakh cusecs, said the state IWRD officer.Meanwhile, several other rivers and streams in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh are also in spate. The Somb River, a tributary to Yamuna River, which has a capacity of 10,000 cusecs, is currently carrying over 23,000 cusecs of water, threatening villages in its catchment areas. In Dhanaura village and nearby Haripur Khol, local streams have also overflowed, raising fears of inundation. At Ranjitpur, the bridge connecting Haryana to Himachal Pradesh was under pressure as river water flowed over it, causing concern among residents.With monsoon rains continuing in the hills, authorities are on high alert. Residents in vulnerable areas along the Yamuna have been cautioned about possible flooding as Delhi braces for a rise in river levels over the next two days.","All 18 gates of the Hathnikund Barrage in Yamunanagar district were opened for the first time this monsoon season.

She then completed a Master’s degree and recently cleared the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE), formally entering the record books.Speaking about her journey, Krishangi said, “Studying with flexibility not only gave me academic freedom but also taught me discipline, focus, and organisation. These skills helped me secure a role at an international law firm, where I am now gaining practical experience.”She added that distance learning allowed her to balance studies with family commitments and travel. “I adopted strict routines, removed distractions, and approached my work with professional discipline from the start,” she said.Her parents Tapan and Indira Meshram expressed pride at the news of their daughter becoming one of the youngest solicitors in England, Wales but said that they did not see it coming. “We are very proud of Krishangi’s achievement. When she started on this journey, we encouraged her to give it her best shot, but we couldn’t have anticipated such a remarkable outcome,” they said.Krishangi’s interest in law began early. “After completing a short course on law from Harvard University, she developed an affinity for legal practice because it resonated deeply with her core values of justice and fairness. Discovering that law touches the lives of all in diverse ways, she was inspired to begin her journey as soon as possible,” her father told TOI.Her upbringing in Iskcon Mayapur played a pivotal role. “Growing up in a serene and nurturing environment, away from toxic academic competition, Krishangi developed self-discipline, focus, and introspection from an early age,” he said.","Krishangi Meshram is the youngest solicitor in England and Wales in recent times.

MUMBAI: India, said Fields medallist Manjul Bhargava, must fall in love with mathematics again. Not as a ""drudgery of formulae"" but as an act of ""exploration"".Bhargava, Canadian by nationality but of Indian origin, believes classrooms need an overhaul-""experimental, playful,"" he said, with teachers ""trained"" to spark curiosity.

BJP Hits Out at Congress for Spreading Lies, Creating Anarchy Over EC Row

Articles 200 and 201 envisage that the President will apply his/her own mind to decide whether to assent or withhold assent, and these provisions do not mention any role of Supreme Court under Article 143.

Such a proposition presupposes that only the judiciary can decide questions related to the Constitution, whereas the Constitution contemplates that the legislature, the executive and the judiciary each is competent and authorised to interpret the Constitution within their own domain. The legislature considers the constitutionality of a bill during debate, the President or governor applies their mind while deciding whether to withhold, assent or refer a bill and the judiciary decides the legality of an Act in appropriate proceedings.

Such a proposition converts a constitutional prerogative into a judicial mandate in the nature of a continuing mandamus, which is impermissible.

NEW DELHI: Objecting to the judgment mandating the President to seek Supreme Court's opinion on constitutionality of bills, Union govt has said the judiciary cannot dictate to the President how and when to exercise her unfettered discretion to seek the apex court's opinion and on which issues.Faulting the April 8 judgment of a bench of justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, the Centre, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, said a plain reading of the President's powers under Article 143 ""shows that an absolute discretion lies with the President to seek advice. The term 'consult' means the act of asking for advice and indicates that the President is not bound to do so"".The judgment had advised the President that whenever a governor reserves a bill for her consideration on the ground that it is patently unconstitutional, the President ought to make a reference to SC under Article 143 ""as a measure of prudence"", given that it is for the apex court to determine the constitutionality and legality of orders and laws.Ahead of Tuesday's hearing on the Presidential Reference before a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai, the Centre said, ""Any constitutional proposition of law that there exists a constitutional expectation for the President to refer every reserved bill to the Supreme Court is contrary to the constitutional scheme"". It gave three reasons to repudiate the SC bench's proposition to this effect:Union govt said the Constitution does not empower the judiciary to examine the contents of a bill that is yet to become a legislation, sans assent granted by a governor or the President.""The constitutional courts cannot undertake judicial adjudication over the contents of a pending bill. It is not possible for the constitutional courts to look behind the contents of the bill at a stage wherein it is a pending decision before the governor and adjudicate whether it requires a reference to the President or not,"" it said.It further said a state is barred from filing petitions under Article 32, which is a preserve of citizens to seek redress of violations of their fundamental rights by directly approaching the SC. For any dispute between the state and the Centre, the parties concerned need to approach the SC through a suit under Article 131.The Centre held, ""A state govt cannot file a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution against essentially the governor of the state...""","Union govt says the judiciary cannot dictate to the President how and when to exercise her unfettered discretion to seek the apex court's opinion.

Our govt has consistently worked towards protecting the constitutional rights of minority communities and providing equal opportunities in education. It will not only enhance transparency but also ensure the quality and excellence of education. Communities such as Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis will benefit from it. State govt's goal is to promote social harmony and inclusive development through education.""","Uttarakhand cabinet on Sunday approved Uttarakhand Minority Educational Institutions Bill, 2025. Bill will pave way for educational institutions of Sikhs, Jains, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis to get minority status benefits. Previously, minority educational status under state law applied only to Muslim institutions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123351688,imgsize-16590,width-400,resizemode-4/123351688.jpg"

How do we even think of fighting them? This is like harming ourselves. And, if they are aggressive, they will harm themselves. This is a strange relationship between India and Pakistan. Strange relationship where there is sorrow and anger but ultimately that relationship is so close and for thousands of years that laws can't eradicate it. And, if something harms India, it will definitely harm Pakistan as well,"" Jawaharlal Nehru told the nation from the Red Fort in 1957 on Independence Day.Nearly seven decades later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday struck a markedly different note.Signalling no rethink on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) under present circumstances, he declared that India will not distinguish between terrorists and their sponsors, pointing directly at Pakistan's leadership.Prime Minister Modi underlined that the country would not succumb to ""any sort of nuclear blackmail.""""The Indus Waters Treaty was an injustice to the people of India. The rivers of India were irrigating the enemy country while our own farmers were deprived of water.Now, the right over India's share of water belongs only to India and its farmers. A compromise on farmers' interests and national interests is not acceptable to us. Not anymore,"" he said. Modi added, ""India will no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail. If the enemy dares to commit any more misadventure, the armed forces will give them a befitting reply. India has decided that blood and water will not flow together.""Recalling last month's strikes, Modi said, ""Operation Sindoor was the expression of that outrage... Penetrating hundreds of kilometres into enemy territory, they reduced terrorist headquarters to dust... Pakistan is still sleepless.""This stark contrast captures the transformation in India's attitude towards Pakistan. PM Modi's language of deterrence and retaliation has replaced the earlier vocabulary of kinship and restraint. From invoking Balochistan, Gilgit and PoK in his 2016 speech to citing deep-penetration strikes in 2025, his addresses reflect a conscious break from decades of what he has called misplaced sentimentality.By comparison, the Nehruvian era was shaped by reconciliation despite provocations. Nehru's framing of Pakistan as inseparable from India's ""heart and arms"" translated into policies like the IWT and territorial concessions under the Noon-Nehru Pact. Even in the face of aggression, he sought to preserve ties.Indira Gandhi's decisive 1971 victory did not fundamentally alter that mindset. Returning 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war, according to experts, without securing a settlement on Kashmir reflected a continued view of Pakistan as a ""brother"". Rajiv Gandhi's Independence Day speeches largely bypassed Pakistan, centring instead on domestic modernisation.Even after terror struck deep, restraint prevailed. In 2009, less than a year after the 26/11 attacks, Manmohan Singh's address spoke only of honouring ""special assurances and concessions provided to J&K"" - a line that avoided naming Pakistan directly. From Nehru's fraternity to Modi's firepower, the arc of Independence Day speeches reveals how India's strategic outlook on Pakistan - and China - has hardened from conciliatory sentiment to hard-nosed realism.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday struck a markedly different note.

CHASOTI: A teacher’s hesitation spared 80 children from certain death. Minutes before a wall of water and boulders tore through Chasoti village in J&K’s Kishtwar district, Hukum Chand kept his students back from a langar lunch. At 11.40am, the mountain barrelled down. The school stood. The children lived.Chand teaches at the village’s lone primary school. He recalled how volunteers from the langar had invited the children to eat early on Aug 14. “They were insisting on going around 11am. But since we were busy with Independence Day preparations, we held them back,” he said Sunday.When the roar grew louder and the ground shook, Chand saw the mountain collapsing into Rajai Nalla, the local stream. “We directed older students to run toward higher ground. I held the younger ones back,” he said. Once the flood subsided, every child was safe. Chand then ran to the langar site. “I saw bodies floating. I pulled out at least 30 injured from the debris.” His relief was cut with grief — his brother was among the dead.The deluge left no family untouched in Chasoti. Three priests — Budh Raj, Dina Nath, and Thakur Chand — perished along with villagers.The bodies of Nath and Chand were found, but Raj is still missing. “We cremated 10 bodies together on Aug 15,” said Joginder Singh, 28, who lost his mother Gayatri Devi that day. “There are 13 family trees in this village and every single one has been affected.”Singh’s memory of his final words to his mother haunts him. He had gone with her to grind barley at a watermill, a routine task. “She looked at me and said ‘ok’,” he said. “That was my last conversation. Moments later, everything was gone. The temples — Kali Mata Mandir, Meynnag Mandir, Thein Mandir — the sacred tree near them too.” Later that day, he and other villagers found her body under the rubble.The devastation has shaken the community’s faith. Some villagers said the gods are “not happy”. Yet Singh believes divine forces spared them. “A boulder was stopped by Ma Kali temple that pushed the water toward the stream and saved the village,” he said.At priest Raj’s home, women wept inconsolably. The respected priest had warned for days something was coming. “For the past 10 days, he had been saying something big was going to happen,” said Ram Krishan Khajuria, president of Sanathan Mandal Paddar Tehsil. “On the very day, he stopped a woman from going to the fields.”Now, Chasoti’s lanes echo with mourning. Relief camps shelter survivors. Chand’s school houses Army and NDRF teams combing through debris. Amid loss and ruin, his choice — a delay over lunch — stands as the line that kept 80 children alive.",Hukum Chand kept his students back from a langar lunch.

KURUKSHETRA: Congress member of parliament Deepender Singh Hooda launched an attack on the Haryana government on Sunday, alleging a complete breakdown of law and order in the state. Participating in several social programmes in Kurukshetra district, Hooda said the ruling dispensation has lost all control over governance, while criminals continue to operate fearlessly.“The law-and-order situation in Haryana has collapsed, and this government has completely failed,” Hooda asserted. “Even the officers in administration no longer take the chief minister seriously because they know the real control lies elsewhere. While the chief minister talks about crushing criminals, the reality is that criminals have crushed the law-and-order machinery instead. The state today needs a strong government, not a helpless one. ”The Congress leader alleged that police stations have become hostile for victims, who are turned away instead of being helped. He claimed that the government has virtually surrendered before criminals, allowing Haryana to become a safe haven for organized crime.Citing a February meeting of directors general of police (DGPs) from seven states, Hooda revealed that the special task force (STF) had disclosed the presence of more than 80 active organised crime syndicates in Haryana.“Several gangs have international links, and many operate freely from local jails,” he said. “These groups are engaged in contract killings, drug trafficking, illegal arms trade, kidnappings, extortion, and online frauds. The fact that gangs continue to function even from within prisons proves that they enjoy the protection of those in power. This is not just a challenge to Haryana’s law and order, but also a serious threat to internal national security.”Hooda drew a contrast with the earlier Congress government led by former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, saying, “When the Congress assumed power in 2005, within just two months, the law-and-order situation was brought under control. The people of Haryana once again need such a decisive and strong government.”On the issue of alleged electoral malpractice, Hooda echoed the concerns raised by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. He claimed that the BJP has manipulated democratic institutions to retain power. “The BJP’s only objective is to cling to power by using every possible means—fair or foul. The Election Commission has failed to remain impartial, raising serious questions about its credibility and the very faith of the people in democracy. Vote theft has also occurred in Haryana, and the truth will soon be revealed,” he said.Several prominent Congress leaders, including Shahabad MLA Ramkaran Kala and Pehowa MLA Mandeep Singh Chatha, former MLA Mewa Singh, former MP Kailasho Saini, and party functionary Himanshu Arora, were also present at the events.","Congress member of parliament Deepender Singh Hooda launched an attack on the Haryana government on Sunday, alleging a complete breakdown of law and order in the state.

Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Singh Chautala on Saturday launched an attack on the Congress , calling it the “B-Team of the BJP ,” and claimed that the 2019 Haryana Assembly elections had already exposed this reality.Speaking at the residence of INLD’s national spokesperson Ashwini Dutta in Yamunanagar, Abhay Chautala alleged that Congress leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda had succumbed to pressure from the BJP and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). “Despite knowing from survey reports that nearly 30 of his sitting MLAs were bound to lose, Hooda still gave them tickets. This helped the BJP form its government in Haryana,” Chautala said.Chautala also dismissed allegations of large-scale rigging in Haryana elections, questioning, “If there was vote theft, then how did Bhupinder Singh Hooda himself manage to win?” He added that while instances of bogus voting in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the past were well-known, it was the responsibility of the Election Commission to conduct inquiries and take action against those found guilty.Turning his focus to the INLD’s upcoming show of strength, Chautala announced that a massive rally will be organized in Rohtak on September 25 to mark the birth anniversary of former deputy Prime Minister Chaudhary Devi Lal. “This rally will break all previous records. Our workers are highly enthusiastic, and I am personally visiting all 90 constituencies to invite them to join,” he said.On the occasion, INLD state president Rampal Majra was also present.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip.

Former ESPN personality Jason Whitlock sides with Dave Portnoy in brutal critique of Hailee Steinfeld’s Sinners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/former-espn-personality-jason-whitlock-sides-with-dave-portnoy-in-brutal-critique-of-hailee-steinfelds-sinners/articleshow/123303532.cms,"Hailee Steinfeld's movie 'Sinners' faces criticism despite its financial success. Dave Portnoy's remarks ignited debate, with Jason Whitlock agreeing. Some praise the film's style, performances, and world-building. Others find it overrated. Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld were seen shopping. Allen prepares for the Buffalo Bills' season opener against the Baltimore Ravens. 'Sinners' continues to spark discussion.

Dave Portnoy’s viral critique and Whitlock’s blunt agreement spark fan arguments

Box-office success versus cultural reception and why the discourse won’t die

One of Hailee Steinfeld ’s biggest releases, the Ryan Coogler–directed horror hit Sinners, keeps pulling headlines for everything except its box-office clout. Despite crossing $350 million worldwide, the film drew fresh heat when Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy blasted it on social media, prompting Jason Whitlock to pile on with a curt, three-word takedown.Dave Portnoy didn’t mince words while criticizing Josh Allen's wife Hailee Steinfeld's recent movie Sinners. “I may be like 6 months late with this critique, but that was one of the most overhyped, overrated movies of all time. If you say that movie was great you have no movie credibility with me.” Within moments, former ESPN and Fox Sports personality Jason Whitlock co-signed the sentiment with a minimalist dunk: “Fact check: true. ”The exchange instantly split timelines. Supporters echoed Portnoy’s view that Sinners leaned on style over substance; others argued the film’s mood, performances, and world-building were precisely what made it resonate with audiences. The numbers and accolades, back that up: in June 2025, IndieWire ranked Sinners No. 65 on its “The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far)” list, and Steinfeld took home Best Supporting Actress at the 2025 Astra Midseason Movie Awards.Sinners is a classic case of a movie living two lives—one at the ticket window and another in the court of public opinion. Ryan Coogler’s signature craft and star power (with Michael B. Jordan featuring) helped the film travel, but its grim tone and genre-bending choices clearly aren’t for everyone. That friction, critical lists versus contrarian pundits, keeps the conversation hotter than most horror titles enjoy months after release.Sinners premiered on April 3, 2025, at AMC Lincoln Square in New York City, and was theatrically released in United States on April 18, 2025, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received critical acclaim and grossed $365.9 million worldwide.Steinfeld gained wider recognition for her roles in the Pitch Perfect film series (2015–2017) and The Edge of Seventeen (2016), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination.Also Read: “Overhyped and overrated”: Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld faces harsh criticism from Dave Portnoy Away from the noise, newlyweds Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld, married in May, were recently spotted shopping in California as Buffalo eyes a deep run. Allen sat out the Bills’ preseason opener, a 34–25 loss to the New York Giants, and he’s unlikely to log heavy preseason snaps with Super Bowl expectations looming. The real countdown is on for Sept. 7, when Buffalo opens against the Baltimore Ravens, while Sinners remains the conversation piece that won’t stay in the dark.Recently Allen used his August 9 night off from playing the game against the New York Giants to have dinner with Hailee Steinfeld.","'Sinners' grossed $365.9 million worldwide.

Army wants anti-drone systems integrated on its Russian tank fleets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-wants-anti-drone-systems-integrated-on-its-russian-tank-fleets/articleshow/120297070.cms,"Army is seeking advanced counter-drone systems for its T-90S and T-72 tanks

NEW DELHI: With Ukrainian drones destroying thousands of Russian tanks in the ongoing war, the Indian Army now wants new advanced counter-drone systems with both “soft and hard kill options” to be integrated on their Russian-origin T-90S and T-72 main-battle tanks.In just the last one year, Russia is estimated to have lost around 3,000 tanks and 9,000 armoured vehicles to drones, artillery and anti-tank guided missiles fielded by Ukraine, some its own and others provided by western countries.Ukraine, of course, has also suffered huge military losses in the debilitating war underway since Feb 2022, which has led a few experts to even sound the death knell for the lumbering tanks in modern-day warfare.The over 11.5-lakh strong Indian Army is obviously worried about its fleets of the old 2,400 T-72 `Ajeya’ tanks and the relatively newer T-90S `Bhishma’ tanks (around 1,300 inducted of 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia), which are primarily meant for swift multiple thrusts into Pakistan during a conflict.Consequently, the force is looking for “platform-based” counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS), which can detect and neutralize FPV (first-person view) drones, swarm drones, loitering UAVs and kamikaze drones.Towards this end, a RFI (request for information) was recently issued for the preliminary acquisition of 75 C-UAS, with active and passive detection measures, and soft kill options like the capability to jam satellite-based navigational systems and RF (radio frequency) communication links of the hostile drones.For the hard kill, the C-UAS should provide requisite inputs to the anti-aircraft machine guns already mounted on T-90S and T-72 tanks. “The modular C-UAS will have to be integrated with the tanks without affecting their mobility. The sealing of tanks for deep fording and NBC (nuclear, chemical, biological) warfare protection should also not be affected,” an officer said.The design of tanks is based on the “equilateral triangle” of lethality, mobility and survivability, which leaves little scope for adding more armour protection. “Therefore, the need for integration of light-weight C-UAS,” he added.On the China front, the Army had managed to deploy some of the heavy T-90S and T-72 tanks (40 to 50 tonne each) in eastern Ladakh after the confrontation erupted in April 2020. The plan now is to induct 354 indigenous light tanks (25-tonne each) for high-altitude warfare under Project Zorawar for around Rs 17,500 crore.“The light tanks will come with integral counter-drone systems. All our future tank projects are being planned with enhanced survivability, especially against aerial threats, as well as connectivity. Requisite anti-drone safeguards will ensure both individual tank protection as well as area protection for force survivability,” another officer said.","Army is seeking advanced counter-drone systems for its T-90S and T-72 tanks.

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi has not paid maintenance charges of about Rs 63 lakh for his flat at Gokul Apartments in Malabar Hill, Mumbai, news agency ANI reported, quoting a society member on Monday.The member told ANI that Choksi owns three units in the building – on the 9th, 10th, and 11th floors – and has not paid maintenance for more than seven years.""He has seven years of maintenance due. He has three units– 9th, 10th, and 11th floors. The 11th floor is a terrace, he has illegally occupied it. There are maintenance dues of around Rs 63 lakh without interest.

Addressing AllIndia Forensic Science Summit 2025, Shah said PM Modi was farsighted to visualise the growing importance of forensic sciences four years before the enactment of three new criminal laws, as he had set up NFSU in 2020.

KOLKATA: A physical relationship between two married adults, if consensual since beginning, does not amount to luring somebody with a false promise of marriage and is not a criminal offence, Calcutta HC's Jalpaiguri circuit bench recently held.Justice Bibhas Ranjan De on Friday said: ""Both parties are married and aware of each other's marital status. Then, the consent given under such circumstances shall be deemed consensual rather than coerced or misled by a false promise, as the initial consent for a physical relationship will be perceived to be based on mutual attraction. It is expected that both parties be aware of their respective marital obligations.""Holding that the ""culpable mentality and clandestine motives"" of the accused are not made out in a complaint where a married woman accused a married man of luring her into an intimate relationship by a false promise of marriage, the judge quashed the proceedings against the man.The complaint was lodged on Sept 8, 2024, by the woman. The brief of the case is that the two married people were in an "" extramarital affair "" for two years. After the woman's husband came to know of it and refused to live with her, she asked to marry the man with whom she was having the affair.When the man refused, woman filed a case against him under Sections 69 (sexual intercourse by employing deceitful means) & 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of BNS at Maynaguri police station.","A physical relationship between two married adults, if consensual since beginning, does not amount to luring somebody with a false promise of marriage.

Ahead of the special cabinet meeting scheduled on Thursday to discuss the report in detail, senior netas from the influential Vokkaliga and Lingayat caste groups have called meetings of their respective communities. Both communities maintain that their respective proportions in total population is much more than what the report has estimated.Deputy CM and PCC chief DK Shivakumar called a special meeting of Congress MLAs from Vokkaliga community Tuesday to address their concerns. ""We will have a discussion with them (Vokkaliga legislators) and suggest ways to ensure everyone is respected without hurting anyone's sentiments,"" Shivakumar said, adding govt will not take any 'hasty decision'.Forest minister Eshwar Khandre, who is a Lingayat, said: ""The opinion of the community's leadership and individuals will be collated so that it can be conveyed at the meeting."" CM Siddaramaiah has maintained silence on the issue, stating, ""I will talk about it in special cabinet meeting.""The caste census report was submitted to the cabinet on April 10, but its contents have not been officially released to the public. According to the leaked findings, the Vokkaliga population stands at 61.6 lakh, or 10.3% of the state's population, with a proposed reservation of 7%. Lingayats are placed at 11% (66.3 lakh), with a recommendation of 8% reservation. However, internal community divisions - Veerashaiva Lingayats at 10.4 lakh, Panchamasalis at 10.7 lakh, and others - have led to disputes over accurate representation.The leaked report estimates the Muslim population at 75.2 lakh - or 12.6% of the state's total - and suggests doubling their reservation from 4% to 8%. ""This is higher than Vokkaliga community, which is currently considered the second-largest population group in the state,"" the report says.Expelled BJP member and Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal questioned the report's credibility and challenged the continued categorisation of Muslims as a minority. ""If Muslims are the largest community, then strip the community of 'minority community' status.

Karnataka bid to breach 50% quota cap awaits tough judicial test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-bid-to-breach-50-quota-cap-awaits-tough-judicial-test/articleshow/120293178.cms,"Karnataka CM siddaramaiah

NEW DELHI: Any decision taken by the Karnataka government on increasing reservation on the basis of its caste census for socially and educationally backward communities and those who are inadequately represented will have a tough time passing judicial muster, as many such laws framed by other states have failed.Though Supreme Court, while upholding Centre's decision to provide 10% quota for economically weaker sections (EWS) by a 3-2 majority, had said ""50% cap on quota is not inflexible and inviolable for all times to come"", the controversial issue cannot be said to have been authoritatively adjudicated with the majority verdict adding a rider that the cap applied only to SC/ST/OBC reservation and the dissent verdict of two judges refusing to go into the issue of the cap as the matter was pending in court for adjudication in case of Tamil Nadu.""Reservation for EWS of citizens up to 10%, in addition to the existing reservations, does not result in violation of any essential feature of the Constitution and does not cause any damage to the basic structure of the Constitution on account of breach of the ceiling limit of 50% because that ceiling limit itself is not inflexible and in any case, applies only to the reservations envisaged by Articles 15(4), 15(5) and 16(4) of the Constitution,"" the majority verdict penned by Justice Dinesh Maheshwari had said.In a dissent note, Justice Ravindra Bhat had said he was not going into the question of violation of 50% rule as it was the principal ground of challenge on the validity of Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 1993, which was pending in court. ""The view of the members of this bench constituting the majority - that creation of another class which can be a recipient of up to 10% of reservation, over and above 50%, which is permitted under Articles 15(4) or 16(4), in my considered opinion, therefore, has a direct bearing on the likely outcome in the challenge in that proceeding,"" he had said.In a note of caution, Justice Bhat said if the ambit of reservation kept increasing, then the right to equality would be reduced to right to reservation and the observations of B R Ambedkar had to to be kept in mind that reservations were to be seen as temporary and exceptional or else they would ""eat up the rule of equality"".In a landmark judgment in Indra Sawhney case in 1992, SC had held that 50% quota shall be the rule and can be increased only in case of extraordinary situations ""inherent in the great diversity of this country and the people"".In recent years, many state govts attempted to breach the cap but they failed to pass judicial muster. On the basis of a caste census's findings, Bihar govt increased quota for reserved classes from 50% to 65%. However, Patna high court last year declared the law unconstitutional and the appeal against the HC ruling is pending in the SC which refused to stay the order.Chhattisgarh govt had also amended reservation rules, slashing the quota for Scheduled Castes by 4% (16% to 12%) and raising reservation for Scheduled Tribes by 12% - from 20% to 32%. OBC reservation was kept unchanged at 14%, taking the total reservation to 58%.

So we will first hold the Shariat and then the Constituion,” he said while speaking to a local news channel.He labelled the Waqf Act a “political stunt” by BJP, warning that within the next six months, the Centre would introduce laws targeting Christians and tribal communities. Hassan's comments come as the country is witnessing widespread protests with the agitation in West Bengal leading to over 150 arrests.“Muslims sabr mein hai kabr mein nahi (muslims are patient, but not dead),” Hassan said, adding, “If they push us too far, it will lead to massive unrest both in the country and globally.”Reacting to Jharkhand Minister Hafizul Hassan, BJP MP Manish Jaiswal hit out, saying such comments undermine India’s secular foundation. Jaiswal said Hassan should have taken office swearing on Shariat if he didn’t intend to uphold the Constitution, adding that India is a nation where people of all faiths coexist. He warned that allowing leaders to prioritise religious law over the Constitution could lead to anarchy.""I would also like to advise people who elect such people that this country runs on the Constitution. People with different faiths live here. If a Hindu or Christian says that this individual works as per Shariat and we won't listen to him, then there would be anarchy in the country. This is a secular nation which runs as per the Constitution,"" he said.Responding to criticism over his remark Hassan clarified that his words were being misrepresented. Hassan stressed that as a minister, he believes in and functions according to the Constitution, while also recognising the place of Shariat.""I did not say 'main' (I), I said 'hum' (we). Watch the full statement. I am a minister, 'hum' includes everyone. A minister believes in the Constitution and functions in accordance. Shariat too has its own place,"" the minister said.""People keep Lord Hanuman in their heart...it's a way of saying. I said something similar. Everyone is distorting it and presenting it. You will find out, when you watch the entire 5-6 minutes of what I said,"" he added.On 5 April, President Droupadi Murmu approved the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, and the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, both passed during the budget session.The amendment bill aims to modernise waqf property management, streamline surveys, registrations, and dispute resolution, and empower stakeholders. However, it has triggered backlash, with parties like Congress, AIMIM, and AAP challenging it in the Supreme Court. They argue the bill could adversely affect waqf oversight.","Jharkhand minister Hafizul Hassan ignited a massive political firestorm on Monday. He said he prioritises Shariat over Constitution, and claimed that a Muslim ""keeps the Quran in his heart and the Constitution in his hand"" Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lashed out at Hassan calling his comments ""a blatant insult"" to Indian democracy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120278219,imgsize-1467892,width-400,resizemode-4/Hafizul-Hassan-left-protesting-against-the-Waqf-act.jpg"

'Mamata Banerjee has turned Bengal into another Bangladesh': BJP

NEW DELHI: Fresh violence erupted in West Bengal on Monday when supporters of the Indian Secular Front (ISF) and police in South 24 Parganas clashed during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.Violence erupted when police stopped ISF workers from marching to a rally at Kolkata’s Ramlila Maidan, where ISF leader and Bhangar MLA Naushad Siddique was due to speak.The protestors, many from Bhangar, Minakhan, and Sandeshkhali, were blocked at Bhojerhat on the Basanti Highway. Tensions rose when they tried to break through barricades, sparking violent clashes. Several police vehicles were torched and officers injured. Police used batons to disperse the crowd, leaving at least one ISF supporter with a head injury.""Some police vehicles were set on fire by the protesters and a few police personnel were injured when the agitators attacked the law enforcers,"" a senior police officer said.The violence brought traffic to a standstill, prompting a heavy police deployment. Protesters were eventually cleared from the area.This comes days after three people were killed in Murshidabad during violent protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act. West Bengal Police arrested 150 individuals and deployed forces in Samserganj, Dhuliyan, Suti, and nearby areas.BJP MP Jyotirmay Singh Mahato urged Union home minister Amit Shah to impose AFSPA in several districts, citing deteriorating security and alleged targeted violence against Hindus. A special Calcutta high court bench ordered immediate deployment of central forces in Murshidabad following the unrest.Earlier today, West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar visited a relief camp in Malda district, where hundreds of displaced families from Murshidabad have sought refuge after fleeing violence during protests over the Wakf Amendment Act. Majumdar, also the Union minister of state for education, visited the makeshift camp at Paralalpur High School in Kaliachak Block 3, where he interacted with the displaced families, many of whom were women and children. Local officials reported that 640 people have taken refuge in Malda, with 550 staying in the school and others in nearby villages.Majumdar shared that many women were deeply emotional, recounting how their homes were torched, property destroyed, and they received life threats. He alleged that ""fundamentalist forces"" disguised as protesters were behind the attacks in Dhulian, Murshidabad, which claimed three lives and left several injured.""Initially, 200-250 families had taken shelter here. Now, due to police pressure to shut down the camp and cover up Mamata Banerjee's failure, only 70-75 families remain. They are still living in fear,"" Majumdar alleged.""The situation in Murshidabad could be a precursor to similar unrest elsewhere in the state. Minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury has already issued a warning. Mamata Banerjee has turned Bengal into another Bangladesh,"" he added.Majumdar criticised the state government for bias, accusing them of restraining central forces.

NEW DELHI: A petition was filed on Monday in the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the Murshidabad violence that broke out during the anti-Waqf law protests, reported LiveLaw.The plea, filed by advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha, also sought the top court's directions to protect the lives and properties vulnerable to the riots. Tension flared up in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district on Saturday morning after fresh protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act turned violent in Jangipur, with demonstrators torching multiple vehicles.Visuals from the area showed flames and smoke billowing from burning vehicles as security forces were deployed to restore order.Jawed Shamim, Additional Director General ( Law and Order ), said on Monday that both the Malda and Murshidabad administrations are working in coordination to ensure peace and facilitate the safe return of those who had fled their homes.“So far, 19 families have returned. Shops are opening and people are slowly resuming their normal routine,” Shamim said, adding that law enforcement agencies are focused on restoring calm in the affected regions.Emphasising the need to curb misinformation, Shamim warned residents against spreading or acting on unverified news. “We’ve arrested 210 individuals so far. Rumours can reignite tensions — I urge everyone to stay calm and check facts before reacting,” he said.Referring to the brutal killing of a father and son, Shamim said a separate case would be filed and all persons involved - both perpetrators and bystanders - would be held accountable.""It will take time to identify them precisely, but no one will be spared,"" he asserted. Police made loudspeaker announcements across the district on Monday morning, appealing to shopkeepers to reopen and urging people to return to their regular lives.“Our top priority is restoring complete normalcy, and we are confident that Murshidabad will soon be back to peace,” Shamim added.On Saturday, the Calcutta high court ordered the immediate deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) in the Murshidabad district, following deadly violence allegedly linked to protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.

'Choksi's arrest is a

very big

achievement': India

'Choksi's human rights will be affected if extradited,' says his lawyer

NEW DELHI: The Belgian federal public service of justice on Monday confirmed that India has filed an extradition request for fugitive Mehul Choksi , who has been arrested in Belgium for his involvement in the Rs 13,000 crore PNB bank loan ""fraud"" case.The Belgian federal public service of justice said, ""Mehul Choksi was arrested on Saturday, April 12, 2025. He is being detained in anticipation of further judicial proceedings. Access to his legal counsel has been assured. The Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice can confirm that the Indian authorities have introduced an extradition request for Choksi.""Choksi, 65, was taken into custody by Belgian authorities on Saturday (April 12) after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) requested his extradition. He had been living in Antigua since fleeing India in 2018, and was recently traced to Belgium, where he had reportedly gone for medical treatment.Choksi is the second main accused in the PNB scam after his nephew, Nirav Modi, who is currently in a London prison and is also fighting extradition to India.Sources said that although the Interpol Red Notice against Choksi was deleted some time ago, Indian agencies have been actively pursuing his extradition. Two arrest warrants issued by a Mumbai special court in 2018 and 2021 were shared with Belgian authorities as part of the request.Formal extradition procedures are currently underway, and Choksi may seek bail on health grounds. His lawyer, Vijay Agarwal, confirmed the arrest and said that Choksi is currently in a Belgian prison.""At the moment, he is in prison and there (Belgium), the procedure is not to apply for bail but file an appeal. During that appeal, request is made that he should not be kept in detention and he should be permitted to defend himself and oppose the extradition request while not being in custody,"" Agarwal said, adding that their legal defense will also highlight concerns about prison conditions in India and claim the case is politically motivated.Choksi, his company Gitanjali Gems, Nirav Modi, their associates, and some PNB officials were booked by the CBI and ED in 2018 for allegedly cheating the bank. The scam involved the fraudulent issuance of Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) and Foreign Letters of Credit (FLCs), causing massive financial losses.The CBI has filed two charge sheets against Choksi, while the ED has submitted three prosecution complaints in connection with the case.Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal on Monday called the arrest of Choksi a ""success"" for India's diplomatic efforts.""Look, our external affairs minister has said clearly, and I will also repeat it. The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had successful diplomacy, which is part of the foreign policy. Because of successful diplomacy only we can do this work (extradition). This is a proud moment for India,"" Meghwal said during a program paying tribute to BR Ambedkar.Following Choksi's arrest, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary lauded the move, calling it a ""very big achievement.""""Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already said that those who have looted the money of the poor will have to return it. And action is being taken against such people in the country. Mehul Choksi has been arrested; it is definitely a very big achievement,"" Chaudhrary said.Meanwhile, Choksi's lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, said that his ""human rights"" will be ""greatly affected"" if he is extradited back to the country.""His human rights will be greatly affected,"" Aggarwal said. ""That's a procedure. Basically, we will be defending it on two grounds. It is a political case and, secondly, because of the human condition in India,"" he added.","Fugitive Mehul Choksi has been arrested in Belgium for his involvement in the Rs 13,000 crore PNB bank loan ""fraud"" case.

Details of the alleged plot



NEW DELHI: Fugitive jeweller Mehul Choksi made arrested in Belgium had made headlines four years ago when he had claimed abduction from the Caribbean island in May 2021. Later a detailed police report from Antigua supported his statement, identifying Hungarian national Barbara Jarabik and Gurdip Bath as prime conspirators in the plot. The report, accessed by TOI, provided a chilling account of the events that led to Choksi’s sudden appearance in Dominica .According to the report, Choksi was lured to a rented villa in Jolly Harbour by Barbara Jarabik under the pretense of a dinner invitation on May 23, 2021. Upon arrival, he was ambushed by a group of around 10 men, believed to be of Indian and local origin. He was reportedly gagged, bound to a wheelchair, and assaulted before being transported by boat to a yacht named Calliope of Arne and later taken to Dominica.Gurdip Bath, traveling on a Kittitian diplomatic passport, checked into Cocobay Hotel on May 19, 2021. Hotel staff later reported seeing him with a woman resembling Barbara Jarabik. Bath reportedly visited Jolly Harbour multiple times and was picked up by a man in a white Hyundai Creta shortly before Choksi’s alleged abduction.That same evening, Bath, Jarabik, and British national Leslie Farrow-Guy boarded a private flight to Dominica. Notably, the aircraft had arrived in Antigua with only its pilots and was scheduled to leave earlier but delayed its departure — a fact flagged by investigators.Bath had previously traveled to Antigua in April 2021, along with Jarabik, allegedly on a reconnaissance trip. They checked into the Blue Waters Hotel together.Barbara Jarabik, whose travel records show frequent visits to Antigua since 2019, had reportedly grown close to Choksi during her stays. She rented the villa in question a few days before the incident and had requested access to a private dock — which was used during the escape.Leslie Farrow-Guy, identified as a British national, had rented the same white Hyundai Creta used during the operation and had arrived in Antigua around the same time as the other suspects."," jeweller Mehul Choksi made headlines four years ago when he had claimed abduction from the Caribbean island in May 2021.

No, stick with lasers for now Yes, diversify technologies

India has successfully demonstrated its capability to neutralise fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system, marking a significant milestone in the nation's defense technology.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) developed this directed-energy weapon (DEW), which is now ready for production and deployment across various military platforms.With this achievement, India joins an elite group of countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, that possess advanced laser weapon capabilities.DRDO chairman Dr Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies.""""As far as I know, it is the United States, Russia and China that have demonstrated this capability. Israel is also working on similar capabilities, I would say we are the fourth or fifth country in the world to demonstrate this system,"" he added.The 30-kilowatt laser weapon system is designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and helicopters within a range of 5 kilometers.It features advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including jamming communication and satellite signals.Its versatility allows it to be adapted for both ground-based and shipborne applications, enhancing India's defense readiness across multiple domains. The system is equipped with a 360-degree Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor for precise targeting and can be rapidly deployed via air, rail, road, or sea.Dr BK Das, Director General (Electronics & Communication System) DRDO, said: ""For the first time, we are showing a technology in use and its devastation. This shows how far we are going in our technology maturity... What you saw is a completely indigenous product of many DRDO laboratories working in synergy with startups, academic institutions and industries. We are confident that we are going to reach high power very soon... We are planning to deploy similar systems with slight modifications on ships to prove the capability.""Dr Jagannath Nayak, director of the Centre for High Energy System, and Sciences (CHESS), DRDO said: ""Whatever we have achieved today is a great success, and we have seen that we have neutralised fixed-wing aircraft at long range and then we have also seen that we have neutralised swarm drone... with the laser weapon, we can neutralise multiple targets. So, this is one of the new and emerging weapon systems. It is a massless weapon and the concentration of laser light falls on the target and neutralises it. So this is an achievement for our country and DRDO.""India's efforts in directed-energy weapons extend beyond the 30-kilowatt system.The DRDO is also developing more powerful systems, such as the 300-kilowatt "" Surya "" laser weapon, which boasts an operational range of 20 kilometers.This system is designed to target high-speed aerial threats like missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), further strengthening India's position in modern warfare. These advancements align with global trends emphasizing high-power lasers for missile defense and counter-drone operations.","India has successfully demonstrated its capability to neutralise fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system.

Perspectives from the Muslim community

The political kerfuffle

What’s at stake

""People I know are getting divided into Hindu-Muslim right in front of my eyes,"" lamented Debangshu Bhattacharya , the young TMC leader who popularized the iconicslogan. When the youth gets disheartened, it is obvious that the situation is dire. Debangshu's Facebook post came on the backdrop of three deaths in violent protests in West Bengal’s Murshidabad over the Waqf Amendment Act. The violence that erupted on Friday, 11th April continued well into Saturday, prompting the Calcutta High Court to order central forces to be stationed in sensitive areas. With conspiracy theories swirling and familiar script of blame game playing out, an emotive issue has once again engulfed sensitive Indo-Bangladesh border districts. The assembly elections are just a year away, and the government is already battling high-profile scams—including the teacher recruitment controversy— in such a situation the political ramifications of such a livewire issue cannot be ignored.The Union Government’s decision to amend the Waqf Act of 1995 has ruffled feathers of sections of the minority community. Waqf refers to properties donated for charitable purposes. These properties, which cannot be sold, are overseen by a(custodian). Several clauses in the new Waqf Amendment Act—renamed the UMEED Act—haven't gone down well. These include the abolition of “Waqf by user,” inclusion of non-Muslims on Waqf Boards , a new requirement that donors must be practicing Muslims for at least five years and must own the property, provision to appeal tribunal orders in the High Court, and the formation of separate boards for different sects.West Bengal, which has over 80,480 Waqf properties—second only to Uttar Pradesh’s 2.2 lakh—has witnessed widespread protests. Nationally, Waqf Boards control 39 lakh acres of land, with 21 lakh acres added between 2013 and 2025, a figure the Union Home Minister claimed reflects past misuse. According to Amit Shah, speaking in the Parliament, the 2013 amendments were politically motivated, and the current changes aim to rectify that.The protests began sporadically but escalated violently on 11th April. Prior to that, a viral video showing a Kolkata bus driver being forced to remove a saffron flag under pressure from Waqf protesters had already sparked controversy.Additionally BJP had shared a clip where State Minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury, also the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hindi leader, was heard allegedly claiming that his supporters can easily choke Kolkata if required.Preempting unrest, Mamata Banerjee had made her stance clear on April 9, just a day after mobs attacked a police van in Jangipur, Murshidabad. “You have been hurt. Have faith. Nothing in Bengal will divide us. We must live and let live,” Mamata said in an outreach to the minority community. Outlining the historical significance of the Muslim community in the state, she pledged to give them steadfast support. However, it failed to soothe frayed nerves. Just a couple of days later, violence erupted in Samsherganj, Dhulian, and Suti of Murshidabad, leading to the deaths of three people, including a father and son.On the 12th, West Bengal CM gave out a measured message amidst news of violence. Without mentioning the Waqf Act or the Muslim community, she asked for calm and claimed that the legislation wouldn't be implemented in the state. She wondered why riots were being instigated. Mamata claimed that some political parties were trying to use this issue to further their agenda and requested people not to fall into their trap.While Mamata may have promised that the Waqf Act won't be implemented in the state, experts are divided over the constitutional validity of such a claim. Former Supreme Court Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly, when contacted by TOI Online, said that what Mamata Banerjee is saying is 'unconstitutional.' According to the former justice, the CM has the right to move the Supreme Court but, until the court gives an order, the state has to obey the law passed by the Union Government. He cited Article 256 of the Constitution, which mandates,Hence, Mamata Banerjee has limited scope to not cooperate with the Union government, he argued. This view is also seconded by eminent lawyer and Rajya Sabha member from CPIM, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. Bikash, who has just had a major legal victory over the state government in the SSC case—which led to 26,000 teachers losing their jobs—virtually laughed off CM's claim. He believes it was an irresponsible statement and didn't help cool tempers. According to Bikash, this was an issue that required community protest and not state government intervention.Practising Advocate in the Supreme Court, Nikhil Mehra had a more nuanced take. He told TOI Online that Mamata Banerjee may choose not to operationalise the Waqf Amendment Act. However, he laid out certain conditions—such as in cases where Waqf has acquired properties belonging to the central government, the state would have no authority if those properties are reclaimed. He emphasised that the law remains in force even if the state chooses not to operationalise it, and in the event of a change in regime, the incoming government would be in a position to enforce all its provisions effectively from the day it was signed by the President.In cases of land disputes, if the state is made a party, it raises the question of whether it can legally oppose the matter in court on the ground that the state will not enforce the Act, Advocate Mehra noted. He added that for Acts falling under the Concurrent List, a state can pass a contrary amendment—but only if it receives the President’s assent. West Bengal hasn't even attempted this because the President is unlikely to accept such an amendment.Beyond legalities, Banga Bhushan winner author Abul Bashar offered a cultural explanation, noting that donating to Waqf often serves as a workaround to the complexities of inheritance law. He defended Waqf Boards as essential support systems for widows, orphans, and the economically disadvantaged. While he endorsed peaceful protests, he warned against violence and urged Hindus to stand in solidarity. Bashar maintained that the protest is genuine and grounded in Islamic tenetsEducationist Miratun Nahar, when contacted, minced no words and said those who want to change the secular nature of the country have brought this act in a well-crafted and well-planned manner. For members of the Waqf Board, her appeal is to look for the welfare of the Board, the community, and the nation overall and not to fall into the trap of those who want to provoke. However, the veteran educationist reposed little faith in the politics of Mamata Banerjee and said that trusting her would be even more detrimental for the community.Trust, though, as a product, seems to be in short supply in West Bengal's politics. Days after the state government took BSF's help to get the situation under control, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh made an outlandish claim in a press conference that some people may well have used BSF and other central agencies to bring 'outsiders' to foment communal tension in Murshidabad. Claiming to have received reports, Kunal Ghosh demanded a high-level probe to verify them. Despite over 150 arrests, the identity of the mastermind behind the riots remains unclear. The BSF has gone on record saying that petrol bombs were hurled towards them.According to BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari 's post on X, the elected lawmakers of TMC—who have won by ‘rigging’—have no agency, and hence the entire hardline forces in Murshidabad and Malda have shifted allegiance to PFI, SIMI, and ABT. The Leader of Opposition also gleefully shared an undated video on X where a Muslim individual is claiming that the community is not dependent on Mamata, but Didi (Mamata) is dependent on them for her political survival!Adhikari, who believes that CM should resign and elections should be held under President's Rule, has claimed that people from riot-affected Dhulian have crossed over to Baishnabnagar, Malda, fearing what he claims is ‘religious persecution.’Incidentally, TMC MP from Jangipur, Khalilur Rahaman, and Manirul Islam, MLA from Farakka, both have failed to pinpoint groups who were behind the attacks. Islam's house was attacked and ransacked in this violence. His family members had to take refuge elsewhere. Claiming that the police couldn't provide him security, Islam, like his colleague Khalilur, said that young boys were at the forefront of the attack. “If elected representatives are not safe, how can the common man be provided protection?” he told local media personnels.Union Minister Sukanta Majumdar has upped the ante, claiming on X that what is being witnessed is “Noakhali part 2,” a reference to pre-partition horrors. TMC, on its part, has gone into overdrive on social media, claiming that BJP is using fake images and videos to discredit the Mamata government and also to further divide society along communal lines.It is also highlighting the fact that violence has also erupted in Tripura over the Waqf protest, where BJP is in power. The saffron party in its part has cited the example of Assam with 40% minority where things have remained calm.What’s getting lost in this political mudslinging is the fact that Murshidabad is a district with 66.67% Muslim population according to the 2011 Census. The nearby district of Malda too has a Muslim population of over 50%. Both are districts bordering Bangladesh already witnessing political upheaval. Thus, discontent regarding the Waqf Act, if not tempered quickly, may continue to fester for long in these communally sensitive districts. The fact that TMC has not been traditionally strong here, only grabbing political power in recent years, makes Mamata’s job even more tricky. TMC organisation isn't particularly robust with many of the leaders' turncoats from other parties. The party will look to ensure that Muslims, who have been their dedicated voter base for over a decade in the state, don’t look for other options while also assuaging the sentiments of the majority Hindu community. That's the delicate balancing act Mamata led government has to do in the run up to the elections. The BJP will be itching to use incidents like Waqf riots to earn the confidence of the Hindu community, who so far have partially reposed faith in the Mamata government mainly due to its welfare schemes.All eyes are currently on April 16, when the CM is set to meet Muslim clerics to figure out a roadmap. On the same day, the Supreme Court will take up the Waqf case for hearing. A possible breakthrough on either front can cool down the temperature. Else, people of Bengal may have to brace for a heated political summer!","West Bengal has over 80,480 Waqf properties, second only to Uttar Pradesh’s 2.2 lakh. Nationally, WaqF Boards control 39 lakh acres of land, with 21 lakh acres added between 2013 and 2025, a figure the Union Home Minister claimed reflects past misuse.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120282921,imgsize-1822815,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
When will India get its first 5th-generation stealth fighter?

No, it will take longer Yes, definitely

NEW DELHI: India is set to receive its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), by 2035, DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said on Sunday.Acknowledging the long timelines typically associated with developing cutting-edge fighter jet programs, Kamat said, ""If you look at any programme anywhere in the world, it takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new platform. So we have started this journey only in 2024, when the CCS sanctioned the project. So it will take ten years and we have committed to deliver the platform by 2035…""""We want to start an AERO engine programme and we want to collaborate with a foreign OEM to cut down the risks of development. AERO engine technology is a very complex technology, however we have learnt a lot from Kaveri. Kaveri was a fourth generation engine and the current engine technology has moved to sixth generation, so we want to work with foreign OEM to reduce the risks as well as cut down the time for development. Hopefully, we will have some good news on this in the next few months..,"" he added.Talking about other crucial projects that are set to be completed in year, Kamat said, ""There are many projects which are now moving towards maturity. In the next six months to one year, you will see many of our systems getting inducted. VSHORAD, MPATGM, we have LCA Mark II, which will have its first flight, so there are many systems which are now moving towards maturity and in the next six months to one year you will see many of them getting inducted.""The comments came after the defence organisation, for the first time, demonstrated its ability to neutralize fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system.""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies...,"" Kamat said.With this breakthrough, India has joined a select group of nations—such as the US, China, and Russia—that have successfully showcased similar advanced directed-energy capabilities.","India is set to receive its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), by 2035, DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said on Sunday.

2008 Mumbai Terror Attacks Plotter Tahawwur Rana Extradited To India To Face Trial | Watch

NEW DELHI: 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana is currently being interrogated daily for up to ten hours by National Investigation Agency (NIA) over his alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks , news agency PTI reported citing sources. Rana arrived in New Delhi on Thursday following his extradition from the United States.The NIA aims to uncover a wider conspiracy behind the attacks, which killed 166 people and injured over 230.Rana is being held in a high-security cell at the NIA headquarters in Delhi's CGO Complex. According to PTI sources, he has been cooperating with investigators led by Chief Investigating Officer Jaya Roy. So far, Rana has requested a pen, some paper or a notepad, and a Quran—all of which have been provided.He has raised no special food demands and is being given standard meals as per protocol.As per PTI sources, the 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman, is being held in a high-security cell at the anti-terror agency’s CGO Complex office. He is under constant guard and is being interrogated based on evidence collected during the agency's investigation, including a large number of phone calls with co-conspirator David Coleman Headley.The Delhi court granted the NIA 18 days of custody, stressing the gravity of the charges and the national security threat they pose. The court also directed medical check-ups every 48 hours and permitted Rana to meet his lawyer, following due legal process and the conditions outlined in the extradition agreement.Rana faces multiple charges including conspiracy to commit murder, waging war against India, and planning terrorist acts under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). These charges stem from his alleged involvement with David Coleman Headley, a key figure in the Mumbai attacks who is currently imprisoned in the US.The NIA believes Rana may provide crucial information about reconnaissance visits to various Indian cities before the 2008 attacks and about his communication with operatives of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group. Investigators are also examining potential links between Rana and senior figures in terror outfits such as LeT and Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (HuJI), along with suspected involvement of Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI officers.The court said that the case has international dimensions, with multiple Indian cities identified as potential targets. It also pointed out the need to confront Rana with key witnesses, documents, and forensic evidence.","Tahawwur Rana arrived in New Delhi on Thursday following his extradition from the United States.

KOLKATA: Violence linked to the new waqf law escalated in Bengal on Monday, enveloping Bhangar on the outskirts of Kolkata as mobs took over the streets and unleashed a barrage of bricks that left at least 16 police officers wounded.The trigger for the street anarchy in Bhangar, a volatile pocket with a history of political violence, was police preventing Indian Secular Front (ISF) rallyists from heading to Kolkata's Ramlila ground for a rally against the waqf law, report Dwaipayan Ghosh & Sukumar Mahato.The sight of cops being outnumbered in Bhangar contrasted with a crackdown in flashpoint Murshidabad, where 11 FIRs were registered and the number of arrests exceeded 200.Police rounded up over 50 of the suspects in Murshidabad overnight, based on accounts of how mobs barged into homes since Friday night and targeted people. Suspension of internet was extended to pockets of Malda and Birbhum districts, contiguous to the strife-torn belts.One of the 11 FIRs was based on a complaint by Pompa Das, whose husband Chandan and septuagenarian father-in-law Hargodindo were among the three casualties in the communal violence. She described how a mob dragged the duo out of their home in Jatrapara and lynched them while the helpless family watched in horror from their rooftop.DGP Rajeev Kumar said the situation at Dhulian and other violence-ravaged parts of Murshidabad, which also reported 2 suspected abductions and injuries to many, was now ""fully under control"".CM Mamata Banerjee appealed ""with folded hands"" to all communities not to get provoked. ""Today, on the eve of Poila Baisakh, I urge everyone to peacefully exercise their democratic rights (to protest) with prior permission,"" the CM said.""But remember, whoever you are, A, B, C or D, do not take law in your own hands. Some people may instigate you but do not be provoked... They (her detractors) vilify me, going to the extent of even changing my surname. Which type of people would do this? Religion should not be used for playing irreligious games.""In Bhangar, the latest flashpoint of waqf protests on the outskirts of Kolkata, vehicles ferrying ISF supporters had been first stopped near Bairampur on Basanti highway. The stand-off escalated into violence as police allegedly used batons against the protesters. A similar attempt by cops from Bhangar division and Kolkata police reserve battalion at Shonpur in Bhangar fuelled the mob fury. Around 2,000-odd protesters later blocked Basanti highway for four hours. Lalbazar, Kolkata police headquarters, cited intelligence on ""ISF mobilising crowds"" as the reason for restricting gatherings in the city centre.At the Sealdah rally, ISF legislator Naushad Siddiqui questioned the police intervention. ""The CM has said the new waqf law won't be implemented in this state. We also don't want it to be implemented. That's why we organised the rally in Sealdah. Why did the police obstruct our workers from going there?""Mayor Firhad Hakim advised protesters to direct their actions towards Delhi. ""Why are they staging a drama here and inconveniencing people? When we take to the streets and block roads, it causes trouble for everyone. If you want to protest, the best thing to do is to organise a collective call to go to Delhi. Protests should be held where the waqf law has been implemented or will be implemented in those states,"" he further added.Violence was also reported Monday in Siliguri city of north Bengal, with a couple of RAF battalions being deployed in the Jyoti Nagar area after two groups clashed during the Charak festival.

NEW DELHI: The political class rushed to embrace and celebrate BR Ambedkar with generous tributes on his 135th birth anniversary, adding to the unprecedented celebrations by his followers across cities, and cementing the iconic leader’s status as the sole bipartisan figure on the contemporary socio-political firmament.Political biggies PM Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi among others gathered for annual garlanding and floral tributes at the Ambedkar statue in the Parliament complex, while regional leaders like Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav, and CMs Siddaramaiah, MK Stalin, Mohan Yadav among others attended public programmes to laud the framer of the Constitution. Telangana CM Revanth Reddy implemented the policy of “sub categorization of SCs” on the “auspicious occasion” of Ambedkar Jayanti, calling it a “great act of social justice”.The celebrations from the politicians merged seamlessly with the many roadshows and bus trips to Ambedkar parks taken out by Ambedkar’s common supporters, that turned towns and cities into a sea of blue.If Ambedkar is enjoying a pan-political popularity which appears unprecedented in post-independent India, it is largely owing to the emancipator having emerged as the bridge to the sprawling dalit populace that forms a critical vote base for the parties. The success of the anti-BJP opposition’s “Constitution in danger” campaign during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections appears to be egging the political organisations to make full-throttled attempts to appropriate Ambedkar.Evidently, the celebration presented an opportunity to undermine the claim of rivals on Ambedkar. At a rally in Haryana, Modi took potshots at Congress for “insulting” the late mascot during his lifetime with his election defeat in 1952 elections, and blamed the arch opponent for the condition of the deprived classes in the country. Congress chief Kharge retaliated by quoting Ambedkar to accuse RSS mascot VD Savarkar of plotting his poll defeat, and by calling RSS-BJP as the “enemies of Ambedkar”.","PM Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi among others gathered for annual garlanding and floral tributes.

NEW DELHI: It is the Constitution which kept India united, strong and stable in the last 75 years despite facing turbulent times during external aggressions and internal disturbances, senior-most judge of Supreme Court Justice B R Gavai said on Monday while showering praise on B R Ambedkar , the architect of the Constitution, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.Justice Gavai, who will take over as CJI next month, said the Constitution paved the way for upliftment of women and oppressed sections of society and brought them into the national mainstream which was manifested in Droupadi Murmu, a Scheduled Tribe woman, becoming President, and Narendra Modi, despite coming from a humble background and belonging to the backward classes, assuming the office of PM.Justice Gavai said many neighbouring countries failed but India stood the test of time because of the Constitution and landmark SC verdicts upholding the vision of its makers in changing times. ""When we celebrate the 134th birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar, whose initial entry in the Constituent Assembly was only to protect interests of the Scheduled Castes, the oppressed and downtrodden, we, as a country, have recognised his invaluable contribution in presenting to this country a Constitution which has not just stood the test of time for the last 75 years, but it is this Constitution that has kept India strong, stable and united,"" Justice Gavai said.

HISAR: PM Narendra Modi accused Congress of humiliating Dr B R Ambedkar during his lifetime and attempting to erase his legacy after his death. ""Congress humiliated Baba Saheb Ambedkar while he was alive, ensuring his electoral defeats and conspiring to keep him out of the system,"" he said, speaking at an event in Hisar marking Ambedkar's birth anniversary Monday.""And when he was no longer among us, they tried to eliminate even his ideas. Congress has become the predator of the Constitution,"" Modi said.He accused the opposition party of distorting Ambedkar's vision of a just and equal society for political gain. ""Ambedkar wanted every poor and deprived person to live with dignity and realise their dreams. But Congress reduced SC, ST, and OBC communities to second-class citizens,"" he said.Modi highlighted development schemes under BJP-led govt, saying Har Ghar Jal Yojana provided tap water to 80% of rural households, up from 16% in 70 years when Congress was in office. He cited Swachh Bharat Mission, under which 11 crore toilets were built, as a measure that restored dignity to the marginalised. ""During Congress era, banks were a dream for SC, ST and OBCs. Today, they proudly hold Jan Dhan cards.""He contrasted BJP-governed states with opposition-led govts in Himachal, Karnataka and Telangana, accusing them of delaying projects and driving up living costs. ""While some govts stall projects or break promises, our model is one of delivery and development.""Modi criticised Congress for opposing the uniform civil code, recently enacted by BJP-led Uttarakhand govt. ""It's unfortunate those carrying the Constitution in their pockets oppose it in practice,"" he said. He accused the party of undermining Ambedkar's principles by introducing religion-based reservations in Karnataka.""If Congress truly cares for Muslims, let it make a Muslim party president and give 50% election tickets to the community,"" Modi said. He claimed new BJP-backed laws would protect tribal lands and secure the rights of Pasmanda Muslims.

Maharashtra stipend for 8L Ladki beneficiaries cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-stipend-for-8l-ladki-beneficiaries-cut/articleshow/120290515.cms,"Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis

MUMBAI: The state govt has reduced the stipend of eight lakh beneficiaries of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana because they were also receiving benefits under another govt scheme, the Namo Shetkari Mahasanman Nidhi (NSMN).The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month because they already receive Rs 1,000 under Namo Shetkari programme. The Ladki Bahin scheme stipulates that its beneficiaries can avail of other govt schemes only if the benefit is capped at Rs 1,500 per month.This is part of state's move to scrutinise beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme and to restrict the stipend only to those who fit the eligibility criteria.In Oct, state had around 2.63 crore applicants for the scheme. The scrutiny process reduced that figure by 11 lakh to 2.52 crore beneficiaries by Feb. The final stipend went to 2.46 lakh in Feb & March.""There has been an ongoing scrutiny. First to scan the applications that were sent by the districts to the state headquarters. And then to re-scrutinise the eligible cases,"" an official said.CM Devendra Fadnavis earlier said he expects the number of beneficiaries to reduce by 10-15 lakh after the scrutiny process. ""We're not changing criteria or funding, just ensuring only eligible ones get the stipend,"" he said.The state govt is scrutinising Ladki Bahin beneficiaries on the basis of five key criteria. The beneficiaries have to be within the age limit of 18-65 years, and they must be domiciled in the state. Their family income limit has to be within Rs 2.5 lakh per year. Those with a four-wheel vehicle and a member of the family in a govt job are excluded from the scheme. Those who receive benefits from other govt schemes can do so as long as the combined benefit is within Rs 1,500 per month.The state is under pressure to control its purse strings while keeping its key programmes going. The state's debt projection is 9.3 lakh crore for 2025-26. The outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme was reduced from 46,000 crore to 36,000 crore in the 2025-26 budget.","The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month.

Not disclosing criminal case 'moral turpitude': High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-disclosing-criminal-case-moral-turpitude-hc/articleshow/120290444.cms,"Representative Image

BHOPAL: If a candidate hides information about a criminal case against him while applying for a job, it amounts to "" moral turpitude "", regardless of whether he is acquitted later, Madhya Pradesh HC ruled, while upholding the cancellation of a job offer to an applicant at the Itarsi ordnance factory .The petitioner, Ram Bhuvan Yadav from Azamgarh in UP, applied for the post of turner (semi-skilled) in response to advertised vacancies in the factory. He appeared in a written test in May 2016 and then a trade aptitude test. He cleared both and made it to the merit list.After the results were declared, he submitted documents and a self-attestation form. During scrutiny, the office of Azamgarh collector notified the ordnance factory that a criminal case under Sections 254 (delivering an altered coin as genuine), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of IPC was pending against him in the UP district. Yadav was acquitted on Sept 23, 2016, but he had not mentioned the case and trial at the time of application. Also, when asked if he faced any criminal charges in the past, he had replied ""no"".Yadav appealed in Central Administrative Tribunal against the cancellation, but his petition was rejected. Then, he filed a petition in MP HC.","Ram Bhuvan Yadav from Azamgarh in UP applied for the post of turner (semi- skilled) Yadav was acquitted on Sept 23, 2016, but he had not mentioned the case and trial at the time of application.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120290467,imgsize-21068,width-400,resizemode-4/Court.jpg"
Can President be forced to seek Supreme Court opinion on a bill?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-president-be-forced-to-seek-supreme-court-opinion-on-a-bill/articleshow/120290271.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: Can Supreme Court force the President to approach SC under Article 143 of the Constitution seeking its opinion on constitutionality of a bill ? This is one of the key questions that has emerged on a closer study of the SC's recent judgment on the President's powers regarding bills passed by state legislatures.Article 201 of the Constitution does not prescribe a time limit or warrant the President to provide a reason for withholding assent to a bill reserved for her by governors. But a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan asked the President to do what is not mandated by the Constitution - to specify elaborate reasons for withholding assent to a bill or returning it to the state legislature.SC also appeared to have stepped into the legislative process, that includes assent of the President, when it said, ""We are also of the view that a bill appearing to be unconstitutional must be assessed by a judicial mind. The President is not just precluded but constitutionally expected to refer the question of vires of a bill to this court as the apex judicial institution to ascertain the constitutionality thereof and accordingly enable President to act in respect of the said bill under Article 201."" This has raised eyebrows as there is no concept of 'advance ruling' in constitutional litigation, as is available under the GST and income tax laws. ""We are of the considered view that constitutional courts are not precluded from making suggestions or giving opinion about constitutional validity of a bill before the same becomes a law,"" the court said, inserting itself into a process that is hardly its domain.Teaching prudence to the President, SC said she ought to ""seek an opinion under the said provision in respect of bills that have been reserved for consideration of the President on grounds of perceived unconstitutionality...President's recourse to Art 143 also palliates any apprehensions of bias or mala fides in the central govt's approach to bills reserved under Article 200"".Article 143 makes no mention of bills or the question of constitutionality. It provides: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law or fact has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of SC upon it, he may refer the question to that court for consideration and the court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon."" SC judgment said ""where the bill upon becoming law would be a peril to democracy, the decision of the President must be guided by the fact that it is the constitutional courts that have been conferred with the ultimate authority of interpretation of the Constitution and the laws"", its remarks seemingly reflecting the assumption that the Union, its law ministry and top law officers lacked understanding of the intricacies of the Constitution and were incompetent to tender proper advice in a matter involving intricate play of constitutional provisions.""It is expected that the Union executive should not assume the role of the courts in determining the vires of a bill and should, as a matter of practice, refer such a question to the Supreme Court under Article 143. We have no qualms in stating that the hands of the executive are tied when engaging with purely legal issues in a bill and only the constitutional courts have the prerogative to study and provide recommendations as regards the constitutionality of a bill,"" the bench said, knowing full well that the SC's opinion under Article 143 is not binding on the govt.There are 28 states and if five bills passed every year by each state legislature are reserved for the President by the governor on grounds of its constitutionality, then going by the court's reasoning, President ought to seek the opinion of SC on all 140 bills, a law ministry source said.For the record, the President had sought SC's opinion in 2004 on the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act which annulled water sharing agreements with neighbouring states. SC gave its opinion 12 years later in 2016.","Supreme Court asked President to specify elaborate reasons for withholding assent to a bill or returning it to the state legislature.

NAVI MUMBAI/ PUNE: An Olive Ridley turtle tagged in 2021 has become the first recorded instance of the endangered species traveling over 3,500km from Odisha's eastern coast to Maharashtra's Konkan coast. Tagged with ID number '03233' at Gahirmatha beach in Odisha, the turtle crossed two ocean basins to reach Guhagar in Ratnagiri, where it laid 120 eggs in 2025, of which 107 hatched.Dr Basudev Tripathy, scientist at Zoological Survey of India, explained that in 2021, ZSI researchers tagged over 12,000 Olive Ridley turtles at Gahirmatha. While these turtles typically return south to Sri Lanka after nesting, turtle '03233' made a rare journey to Arabian Sea, nesting in Maharashtra. This discovery challenges previous theories that turtles on east and west coasts were distinct populations, showing that their nesting sites might be interconnected. Tripathy emphasised the importance of conserving nesting grounds on both coasts.Dr Suresh Kumar of Wildlife Institute of India suggested that the turtle might have exhibited a dual reproductive strategy, nesting in Odisha and then traveling to Maharashtra for additional nesting. The turtle's migration has reshaped researchers' understanding of Olive Ridley migration patterns.Researchers continue to monitor turtle '03233', aiming to gather more insights into Olive Ridley turtle populations and migration patterns.","Turtle '03233' was tagged in 2021 at Gahirmatha beach in Odisha.

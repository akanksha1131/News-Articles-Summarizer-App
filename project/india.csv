Last year, he had threatened & announced Rs 11 lakh for anyone who cuts off Shri Rahul Gandhi’s tongue. Now the man is seen beating up a poor, helpless canteen worker.

The quality of food should be good here as it is a government canteen. I don't have any regret over what I did. I am a public representative,"" Gaikwad told news agency PTI.""When someone fails to understand democratic language then I have to use this language only.

The protest followed rising political tensions after a shopkeeper was attacked for refusing to speak in Marathi.The protest march witnessed detention of several activists by police, and saw participation from leaders and workers of the opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP). The march was organised by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and other pro-Marathi groups under the banner of the Marathi Ekikaran Samiti, in response to a recent protest by traders.","Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi shared the video.

‘May have implications on India's stability’: CDS warns of China-Pakistan-Bangladesh axis; watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/may-have-implications-on-indias-stability-cds-warns-of-china-pakistan-bangladesh-axis-watch/articleshow/122331946.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan on Tuesday warned that a growing alignment of interests among China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh could pose serious challenges to India's internal stability and security environment.Speaking at an event hosted by the Observer Research Foundation, Gen Chauhan said, ""There is a possible convergence of interest we can talk about between China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh that may have implications for India's stability and security dynamics.""His remarks come amid deteriorating ties between India and Bangladesh following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who sought refuge in India in August last year.The CDS highlighted how economic challenges in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) have opened doors for external actors to expand their influence. ""The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has allowed outside powers to leverage their influence through debt diplomacy, creating vulnerabilities for India. Similarly, frequent shifts in government in South Asia, with changing geopolitical equations and ideological views, pose another major challenge,"" he said.During his address, Gen Chauhan also reflected on the May 7–10 military conflict between India and Pakistan, describing it as potentially the first time two nuclear-armed nations directly engaged in combat.""India has also said that it will not be deterred by nuclear blackmail. I think Operation Sindoor is the only example of a conflict between two nuclear weapon states,"" he stated.He also pointed out the uniqueness of Operation Sindoor, suggesting it could offer lessons not just for South Asia, but globally.“So Operation Sindoor, in that manner, is slightly unique in itself, and it may hold lessons not only for the subcontinent, but for the entire world,” he said.Explaining India’s strategic space for conventional military response, Gen Chauhan pointed to India’s nuclear posture. ""First is India's nuclear doctrine, that there's no first use. I think that gives us strength and that contributes to creating this particular space between us and Pakistan,"" he said.He added, ""Second is the way they responded actually. When India went to respond, we destroyed terrorist camps in response to the terror attack as part of a prevention strategy. You may call it revenge, you may call it retribution, but that ought to prevent further attacks.""He further noted that it was Pakistan that escalated the situation. ""The escalation to a conventional domain was in the hands of Pakistan. Thus, it reduces his option to raise the threshold of this nuclear conflict,"" he said.Looking ahead, Gen Chauhan underscored the importance of expanding conventional capabilities, particularly into new domains of warfare such as cyber and electromagnetic operations. ""The fourth evolving military challenge is increasing vulnerabilities to long-range vectors and long-range precision flights. There is currently no foolproof defense mechanism against ballistic missiles, hypersonics, cruise missiles, and large-scale attack by drones or loitering ammunition,"" he said.He also added that conventional military space can still be expanded, and India must be prepared to operate in emerging domains of conflict.","Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan warned of growing alignment of interests among China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

Train halted, tyres Burnt

'SIR a normal exercise'

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan alliance on Wednesday kicked off a ""Bihar Bandh"" protesting against the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by the Election Commission Opposition leaders, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RJD's Tejashwi Yadav, will lead a protest rally in Patna and plan to encircle the Chief Electoral Office in the state capital.Earlier, the former deputy chief minister said that the opposition had called for the Bihar Bandh to vent their ire against the ongoing voter list revision ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.“We will enforce a ‘chakka jam’ on July 9. Both the Election Commission and the government will be targeted by the Opposition. It is quite surprising that the EC is changing its orders every hour. As a result, BLOs and other officials engaged in the verification exercise are confused,” Tejashwi said.The Opposition has alleged that the Election Commission, through its special intensive revision of electoral rolls, is snatching voting rights from migrants, Dalits, Mahadalits, and poor voters, calling the campaign a “conspiracy to block votes” ahead of the Bihar Assembly Elections , which are due in three months.Workers from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and CPM burnt tyres and blocked roads in support of the Bihar Bandh on NH-30 in Patna's Maner.Party workers were seen raising banners and shouting slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Election Commission.Meanwhile, RJD's student wing blocked train tracks and NH-82 in Jehanabad.RJD workers also stopped the Namo Bharat train in Darbhanga.“We have called this Bandh against the Election Commission, which is working as per someone’s agenda… The public is tired of the government. RJD and the entire INDIA alliance have called for the Bandh,” an RJD worker said.Supporters of Independent MP Pappu Yadav also stopped an express train in Narpatganj, Araria.Also read | Bharat Bandh today: Public services likely to be hit; 10 things to know about nationwide strike The poll body has claimed that the exercise is a standard procedure to update the voter list before every election as mandated by law.

Bharat Bandh : Here are 10 things to know -



The organisers expect more than 25 crore people across various sectors to take part in the bandh. This includes workers from both organised and unorganised sectors, with strong participation expected from farmers and rural workers as well.

The unions leading the strike include INTUC, AITUC, CITU, HMS, SEWA, AIUTUC, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC, and TUCC. These unions have come together to raise concerns about the government's labour and economic policies.

In defiance of police presence, members of Left party unions entered West Bengal's Jadavpur railway station and blocked railway tracks as part of their protest against the central government's ""pro-corporate"" policies. The unions also organised a foot march through the area.

A large police deployment was seen near the Jadavpur 8B bus stand, where both private and state-run buses continued to operate despite the 'Bharat Bandh'. Many bus drivers were spotted wearing helmets as a safety precaution.

They are especially critical of the new labour codes, which they claim will weaken workers' rights, extend working hours, and make it harder to form unions or go on strike.

They are also demanding more government jobs, an increase in MGNREGA wages and workdays, and similar employment schemes for urban areas. The unions have submitted a 17-point demand list to the Labour Minister, but they say there has been no serious response from the government.

Banks are expected to remain open, as July 9 is not a holiday listed by the Reserve Bank of India. However, banking services could still be disrupted if bank workers join the strike.

On the other hand, stock markets will function as usual, and there is no scheduled trading holiday.

Schools, colleges, and government offices are expected to remain open as well. No official closure has been announced.

However, public transport services may be affected in many regions, which could lead to delays for commuters, students, and office-goers. In past strikes, participation levels varied by location, and some areas saw last-minute announcements affecting school operations.

This is not the first time the trade unions have organised such a protest. Similar strikes were held on November 26, 2020, March 28–29, 2022, and February 16, 2024, focusing on issues like privatisation of public sector units, job insecurity, and the casualisation of the workforce.

NEW DELHI: The central trade unions have announced a nationwide strike for Wednesday, with over 25 crore workers from various sectors expected to participate.The strike is also supported by several rural and agricultural labour organisations. The unions say they are protesting against government policies that help big businesses but hurt workers, farmers, and the poor.The unions also claimed that government departments were increasingly hiring retired personnel instead of young professionals, citing examples from the Railways, NMDC Ltd, the steel sector, and education services. They argue this trend is harmful in a country where 65 percent of the population is under 35, and unemployment is highest among those aged 20 to 25.Also read | Bharat Bandh 2025: Will schools, colleges & govt offices be closed on July 9?","The central trade unions have announced a nationwide strike for Wednesday, with over 25 crore workers from various sectors expected to participate.

Bihar form collection nears halfway mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-form-collection-nears-halfway-mark/articleshow/122329893.cms,"NEW DELHI: On a day the collection of signed enumeration forms under the special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar just about touched the half-way mark, chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar defended the exercise, saying that “a pure electoral roll is inevitable for strengthening democracy”.Kumar’s statement came amid a flurry of legal challenges filed against SIR in the Supreme Court by 11 opposition parties, seeking a stay on the exercise that they claim shall “disenfranchise lakhs of voters in Bihar”. Incidentally, these very parties have been questioning the health of electoral rolls based on which Maharashtra elections were held last year, alleging arbitrary inclusions.“During the past four months, all 4,123 electoral registration officers (EROs), 775 district election officers (DEOs) and 36 chief electoral officers (CEOs) have held nearly 5,000 meetings with 28,000 political party representatives. ECI has also invited all recognised political parties for interaction. No one was satisfied with the current status of electoral rolls for one reason or the other,” according to Kumar. EC on Tuesday said 18.2% enumeration forms received in Bihar were now uploaded on ECINET. As of 6 pm on Tuesday around 47% forms had been collected, with 10.5% in the last 24 hours. “Maintaining the same momentum, with 50% forms remaining to be collected, the exercise would be completed well in time,” EC said.“The final roll will be published as scheduled on Sept 30, 2025,” an officer told TOI.EC officials on Tuesday underlined that SIR order dated 2406.2025 stands on four pillars — being all-inclusive in terms of coverage of electors; inclusion of all those who submit their signed enumeration forms by July 25, in the draft roll to be published on August 1, while allowing eligibility documents to be submitted till Sept 1; deciding eligibility of the elector as per Article 326 of the Constitution and Section 16 and 19 of Representation of the People Act, 1950; and exclusion only after inquiry by the ERO, who can rely on field inquiry and documents beyond the 11 listed by EC.Commission officials said pre-filled enumeration forms have been distributed to 7.7 crore of the 7.9 crore electors, with the remaining likely dead, shifted or migrated. Booth level officers are currently making the second of three visits to households to collect the filled-up forms. Volunteers are facilitating the old, sick, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and the poor to complete the forms.The draft roll to be out on August 1 will list all those who submit enumeration forms by July 25.

The ERO/AERO shall pass a ‘speaking order’ on any exclusion, with due notice to such elector.Though the final roll will be published on September 30, two-stage appeals may be filed against the ERO’s decision, first with the district magistrate and then the CEO, as per Section 24 of the R P Act, 1950.","The draft roll to be out on August 1 will list all those who submit enumeration forms by July 25.

PATNA: A senior govt doctor was allegedly administered the wrong treatment by a technical staff member, not a qualified physician, during her journey on the New Delhi-Patna Tejas Rajdhani Express, raising fresh concerns over the quality and oversight of medical assistance provided to passengers on trains.Dr Divya, head of the eye department at Bulandshahr District Hospital in Uttar Pradesh, was travelling to Patna on Saturday. Midway through the journey, she began experiencing gastric discomfort and dialled the railway helpline 139, requesting urgent medical assistance.According to Dr Divya, she received a call back from an official of the Prayagraj division under North Central Railway (NCR), who informed her that a fee would apply if she wanted medical attention.However, at Kanpur Central station that night, she was shocked when a technical staff member, not a qualified doctor, arrived to attend to her.""He administered an antibiotic, despite my symptoms being clearly related to gastric discomfort. When I identified myself as a senior medical professional and questioned the treatment, he remained silent but still insisted I pay Rs 350 for the visit and an additional Rs 32 for the medicines.""She added that while no receipt was given for the consultation fee, she was sent a medicine bill via an instant messaging platform. ""Even after repeated persuasion, I was not given a bill for the so-called doctor's visit,"" she said.Responding to the allegation, NCR's chief public relations officer Shashi Kant Tripathi said on Sunday, ""The Railway Board has fixed Rs 100 as a nominal fee in some cases for a doctor's visit to attend to a patient on board. There is no such fee like Rs 350 for a doctor's visit. The railways will inquire into the matter.""Dr Divya has lodged an online complaint with the Railway Board and NCR authorities. ""I have demanded fair treatment for patients on trains and a complete check on this kind of extortion in the name of medical aid,"" she said.","Dr Divya, head of the eye department at Bulandshahr District Hospital in Uttar Pradesh, was travelling to Patna.

"UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/uae-rolls-out-new-golden-visa-lifetime-residency-at-rs-23-lakh-india-among-first-to-benefit/articleshow/122280940.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major shift from its traditional investment-based residency model, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced a new nomination-based Golden Visa, offering eligible Indians lifetime residency in the country by paying a one-time fee of AED 1,00,000 (approximately Rs 23.3 lakh), without the need to invest in property or business.Until now, Indian nationals were eligible for the UAE's coveted Golden Visa programme primarily through high-value investments, including a minimum AED 2 million (Rs 4.66 crore) in property. But under this new system, applicants can be nominated and approved based on their professional background, societal contributions, or potential benefits to UAE’s sectors such as culture, trade, science, startups, or finance.The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applicants expected in the first three months, according to officials involved in the process.Rayad Group, the consultancy firm selected to pilot the nomination-based Golden Visa in India, is leading the process in partnership with VFS and One Vasco centres across India and Bangladesh. Applications can also be submitted through the group’s online portal and call centre.""This is a golden opportunity for Indians,"" said Rayad Kamal Ayub, Managing Director of Rayad Group. He explained that the vetting process includes anti-money laundering checks, criminal background verification, and social media screening. The final nomination decision rests with UAE government authorities.Approved visa holders can bring family members, employ staff, and engage in business or professional activities. Unlike property-based visas, which lapse upon property sale, the nomination-based Golden Visa is permanent.This initiative reflects the UAE’s growing economic and strategic ties with India following the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2022. The program is expected to expand to other CEPA partner countries, including China, in later phases.Commenting on the move, Akash Puri, Director International, India Sotheby's International Realty said, “The recent overhaul of the UAE’s Golden Visa marks a significant shift in the country’s residency landscape. The new framework is more inclusive and strategically aligned with the UAE’s long-term vision. For Indian real estate investors, this change brings a two-pronged impact: Historically, property investment was one of the few avenues to secure long-term residency, prompting a surge of interest from Indian investors seeking both capital preservation and immigration benefits. With the visa now accessible through broader channels, the urgency to invest solely for residency purposes is likely to ease—particularly in the mid-market and entry-level segments. This could cool speculative buying and encourage more grounded investment behaviour.”“Investors who remain committed to the UAE property market—driven by rental yields, lifestyle advantages, or diversification—will now place greater emphasis on fundamentals like location, developer credibility, and long-term value. Luxury and trophy assets will continue to appeal to ultra-HNWIs, who are largely unaffected by the new professional-centric criteria. For Indian investors, this is a cue to recalibrate: from residency-led transactions to value-led strategies. Over time, this evolution could establish a more stable, resilient real estate market—one that rewards strategic, long-term participation over short-term speculation.” Akash Puri said.","The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh.

Bharat Bandh 2025:

Core reasons behind the protest

Will schools, colleges and government offices remain open?

Essential services and public transport may face disruption

Political support in Bihar adds another layer

A joint coalition of 10 central trade unions, along with several farmers' and rural workers' organisations, has announced a nationwide general strike. The protest, scheduled for July 9, targets the central government’s policies, which the groups claim are hostile to workers and farmers while favoring corporate interests. Over 250 million workers across multiple sectors are anticipated to join, potentially disrupting public life on a large scale.The strike has gained widespread support from trade unions representing banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, highways, construction, and state transport. Additionally, farmer groups such as the Samyukta Kisan Morcha have backed the movement, further broadening its reach. While the railway unions have not formally joined the protest, several essential services may still face operational hurdles.The trade unions have listed 17 long-standing demands, which they claim the government has failed to address. One of the primary points of contention is the delay in holding the Indian Labour Conference, which has not taken place in a decade. Unions have also raised strong objections to the four labour codes passed by Parliament, arguing that these weaken workers’ rights, dilute trade union power, extend working hours, and decriminalise employer violations.In addition, the protesters have criticised the ongoing privatisation of public assets and services. A major issue is the planned privatisation of power distribution companies in Uttar Pradesh, prompting over 27 lakh power sector employees to join the strike. According to the organisers, the government’s policies are increasingly aligned with corporate interests, at the cost of public welfare.Despite the scale of the strike, no official notification has been issued regarding the closure of schools, colleges, or government offices. These institutions are expected to remain open. However, with public transport disruptions likely, students, teachers, and office-goers may experience delays. In past strikes of a similar nature, participation levels varied by region, and last-minute local announcements sometimes affected the status of schools.Private offices and businesses are also expected to operate as usual unless impacted by transport issues or local circumstances. Parents and students are advised to monitor local updates and plan their travel accordingly.Banking operations may be affected, particularly in public sector and cooperative banks where union participation is high. Postal services, coal mining operations, and state transport networks are also likely to be impacted. Metro services and air travel are expected to remain largely unaffected, though road-based travel could see delays due to rallies and roadblocks.Hospitals, emergency services, internet, and mobile networks will continue to function normally.In Bihar, the INDIA Bloc has declared a separate bandh on the same day, opposing a controversial voter list revision that they allege could disenfranchise nearly 20% of the electorate, particularly those from marginalised communities. This additional protest could intensify disruptions in the state.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now. Follow us here","A joint coalition of 10 central trade unions, along with several farmers' and rural workers' organisations, has announced a nationwide general strike. The protest, scheduled for July 9, targets the central government’s policies.

*HRA exemption is calculated for non-metropolitan cities

At a gross income of Rs 7.50 lakh, the new income tax regime results in zero tax, while the old regime leads to a liability of Rs 16,640. Your total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 2.00 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 18 lakh, the new regime offers savings of over Rs 29,432, despite the old regime having a significant amount of deductions. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 5.59 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 25 lakh, even with more than Rs 5.25 lakh in deductions, the old regime tax is Rs 26,000 higher than the tax outgo under the new regime. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 6.08 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 75 lakh, even with significant deductions/exemptions under the old regime, the new regime still proves better by Rs 45,760. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 9.58 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

The above examples take into account individuals contributing to NPS (employer’ contribution). However, if one does not contribute to such NPS, for an individual having gross income of more than Rs 15.75 lakh, he/she is better off taking new regime only if the eligible tax saving investments under the old tax regime are less than Rs 4,33,333/-

(Please note that the above calculations are specific to the numerical examples captured in the above table and may change depending on your specific scenario)

ITR filing FY 2024-25: The choice of the income tax regime while filing Income Tax Return (ITR) is an extremely important one. Your final tax outgo is dependent on the tax regime you opt for, hence the choice between the new and old income tax regime should be an informed decision.Salaried taxpayers have the option to choose between the new and old income tax regime every year. As your financial journey evolves, and changes are made in both the new and old income tax regime, it’s crucial for you to do a final check on which regime suits you best before filing ITR for FY 2024-25.“The Government has over the years brought significant revisions, in the New Regime, making the choice more compelling—and more consequential—than ever,” says Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted? Explained If you are confused about the new versus old income tax regime and are still wondering which works out better for you, we have you covered.Before understanding the math to decide between the new and old regimes, here’s a look at the tax slabs in the respective regimes.The above tax slabs are applicable for resident individuals up to the age of 60 years. For senior citizens between the age of 60-80 years, the basic exemption limit is Rs 3 lakh.For super senior citizens the basic exemption limit is Rs 5 lakh.The tax slabs under the new regime are very different from those in the old regime, with new tax brackets and lower tax rates. However, there is no separate basic exemption limit for senior and super senior citizens.The table below by EY, gives a side-by-side comparison of the new and old Tax regimes, highlighting key differences in structure, eligibility, and suitability to help taxpayers make an informed choice.To illustrate how tax liabilities vary under each regime (for the Financial Year 2024-25), here’s a comparative snapshot across income levels for a Resident individual:Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI that an income-wise comparison of tax liability under the new and old Regimes reveals a clear trend: the new tax regime offers lower tax outgo across all income brackets, from middle to high-income groups—even when taxpayers under the old regime claim substantial deductions like HRA, Section 80C, NPS, and standard deductions. He explains:“These findings suggest that the new regime is not only simpler but often more tax-efficient, especially for individuals who may not fully utilize all deductions or prefer a hassle-free filing process. While the old Regime still holds value for some with structured investments, the broader appeal of the new Regime continues to grow, making it a compelling default choice for many taxpayers,” Amarpal Chadha tells TOI.Yet another detail that you should not miss is that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime. While filing ITR, you can choose between the old and new regime. But, if the return is filed after the due date (this year it is September 15, 2025), then you will have to by default file ITR under the new tax regime, the option of old regime would not be available.Also Read | ITR filing: Why are ITR-2 and ITR-3 forms still not available on Income Tax e-filing portal?

"Bharat Bandh on July 9: Over 25 crore workers to join nationwide strike, key services may be hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bharat-bandh-on-july-9-over-25-crore-workers-to-join-nationwide-strike-key-services-may-be-hit/articleshow/122312826.cms,"Poll Do you support the nationwide general strike called by trade unions in India? Yes, I fully support it. No, I do not support it.

NEW DELHI: More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike on Wednesday, potentially disrupting key services across India, according to a joint forum of central trade unions.The strike, described as a ‘ Bharat Bandh ’, has been called by a forum of 10 central trade unions and their associates to protest against what they term “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the government”.“Preparations have been taken up in earnest by unions in all sectors of the formal and informal/unorganised economy” and urged supporters to make the strike a “grand success"", said the forum in a statement.“All India Trade Union Congress’s Amarjeet Kaur said, “More than 25 crore workers are expected to take part in the strike. Farmers and rural workers will also join the protest across the country.” Harbhajan Singh Sidhu of Hind Mazdoor Sabha added, “Banking, postal, coal mining, factories, state transport services will be affected due to the strike.”The forum said it had earlier submitted a 17-point charter of demands to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya but received no concrete response.It also alleged that the government had not conducted the annual labour conference for the past decade and was instead pushing through four labour codes that would weaken collective bargaining, cripple union activity, and favour employers in the name of “ease of doing business”.It further claimed that economic policies were deepening unemployment, raising prices of essential commodities, suppressing wages, and reducing expenditure on education, health, and civic amenities, thereby widening inequality and burdening the poor, lower-income groups, and the middle class.The statement added, “The government has abandoned the welfare state status of the country and is working in the interest of foreign and Indian corporates, and it is so evident from its policies being pursued vigorously.”The unions are also protesting against the privatisation of public sector enterprises, outsourcing, contractual employment, and casualisation of the workforce. They claim that the four labour codes passed in Parliament were designed to “suppress and cripple the trade union movement, increase working hours, snatch workers’ right to collective bargaining, right to strike, and decriminalise violation of labour laws by employers. ”“We are demanding from the government to address unemployment, recruitments against sanctioned posts, creation of more jobs, increase in days and remuneration of MGNREGA workers and enactment of similar legislation for urban areas. But the government is busy imposing ELI (Employment Linked Incentive) scheme to incentivise employers instead,” the statement said.It also alleged that instead of hiring young professionals, government departments were increasingly recruiting retired personnel, as seen in Railways, NMDC Ltd, steel sector, and education services — a move the unions say is harmful to a country where 65 percent of the population is below the age of 35 and unemployment is highest among those aged 20 to 25.Unions from NMDC Ltd, non-coal minerals, steel, state government departments, and other public sector enterprises have also served notices for participation in the strike.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha and a joint front of agricultural workers’ unions have also extended support to the strike and announced large-scale mobilisation in rural areas.Similar nationwide strikes were observed by trade unions on November 26, 2020; March 28-29, 2022; and February 16, 2023.(With inputs from news agency PTI)","More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike on Wednesday.

Finding herself buried in a landslide at Sharan village in Seraj valley of Himachal's Mandi district, a 20-year-old woman clawed out a breathing nook for herself and kept digging with her bare hands for five hours until she was found and rescued.Every second, the mound of mud, stones and debris pressed down on Tuneja Thakur. Every second, she clawed back. Even as she gasped for air, Tuneja realised she would be dead in seconds if she didn't fight back. ""I removed enough mud to be able to breathe,"" she said.Outside, her family and villagers desperately searched for her for five hours. Inside the crushing trap, it seemed like a lifetime. ""I just knew one thing - I had to come out alive,"" she said. Eventually, Tuneja was pulled out by her parents.Amid the death and destruction wreaked by flash floods in Mandi , Tuneja’s battle for survival stands out for sheer tenacity in one of the villages worst affected by the June 30-July 1 cloudburst. The flash flood struck at around 11.30pm on June 30.“Everybody ran out. It was pouring and floodwater was entering houses. People were screaming in panic. I stepped out looking for a safe place when a land mass suddenly slid down and fell on me just around the corner of my house,” said Tuneja.Himachal deputy CM Mukesh Agnihotri and leader of opposition Jai Ram Thakur met her last week and praised her death-defying courage.","Tuneja Thakur, 20, was buried in a landslide at Sharan village in Seraj valley of Himachal's Mandi district.

MUMBAI: As the 30-day limit to submit the report of the preliminary investigation into the June 12 Air India accident in Ahmedabad to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) ends this week, there is anticipation India will release it to the public.The ICAO places no obligation on the investigating country to make the report public and India had not released the preliminary report of the last major accident at Calicut in 2020. But the AI 171 probe is being followed by the global airline industry with keen interest as it was the first major one involving a Boeing 787.""Apart from the roles and responsibilities of Air India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, and others, the investigation will crucially be a Boeing 787 systems-level case study. It's the first such global investigation of the 'more electric' B787 aircraft. The preliminary findings, if substantial and critical, could reshape B787 operations,"" said a senior commander, requesting anonymity. ""What we hear is that India will make the preliminary report public this time,"" he added.Prior to the June 12 accident, the last major fatal accident India investigated was the August 2020 Calicut Air India Express accident involving a Boeing 737 and 21 deaths.Back then, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not release its preliminary report to the public.Since an aircraft accident investigation is solely carried out to learn lessons and prevent a repeat — unlike a murder investigation, it does not apportion blame or trace culprits — most countries release their preliminary findings to the public.The last time the global aviation industry tracked an accident investigation closely was in 2018 after the Oct 29 Indonesian Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX crash. Keeping with the 30-day deadline, on Nov 28, Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee sent a preliminary report to ICAO and also publicly released it. In fact, it announced in advance that the preliminary report would be uploaded on its website at 10 am on November 28.“The preliminary investigation following Lion Air Flight 610 revealed that prior to the crash, a system called Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS engaged without the Lion Air pilots’ knowledge. Back then, Boeing hadn’t disclosed MCAS to any airlines or pilots. The MCAS lowers the nose automatically to prevent a stall, or the loss of lift, if it detects that the angle of the plane’s nose is too high relative to the ground. What we learnt from the preliminary report is that a malfunctioning sensor may have led the MCAS to engage repeatedly, countering the pilots’ manoeuvres,” said a B737 examiner. “When Ethiopian Airlines B737 MAX crashed five months later, it was the Lion Air preliminary report that came back into focus. The final report into the Lion Air crash came a year later; by then, the B737 MAX was already grounded globally,” he added.“If Air India accident preliminary report points to any possible warning or technical fault in the B787, you can imagine the impact it would have on Dreamliner operations globally,” the examiner said. Of all the accident investigations carried out by India in the past decades, this one is arguably the most followed investigation globally. The AAIB can submit the preliminary report to the ministry of civil aviation if it chooses. Under Annex 13 of ICAO, which lays down the guidelines for carrying out an accident investigation, the preliminary report has to be submitted by the state (India, in this case) to ICAO within 30 days of the occurrence.",The 30-day limit to submit the report of the preliminary investigation into the June 12 Air India accident in Ahmedabad ends this week.

NEW DELHI: An average child under the age of 5 years in India spends close to 2.2 hours daily in front of screens, double the recommended limit, according to a new study.The mean screen time for children under two years of age is 1.2 hours when most guidelines stipulate that it should be completely avoided, the study, published in a journal, Cureus, by Ashish Khobragade and M Swathi Shenoy from AIIMS Raipur, says.The two carried out a meta-analysis of 10 studies comprising 2,857 children.Increased screen time has been linked to slowed language development, decreased cognitive function and hampered social skill development, in addition to an increased risk of obesity, disturbed sleep habits and concentration issues, according to the study.To mitigate the negative impacts of excessive screen time, the study says it is crucial to create tech-free zones in a house, set clear and consistent screen time limits, and actively participate in offline play and interactions.Dr D K Gupta, a child specialist and chairman of Felix hospitals, said, ""Nearly 60-70% children under 5 years are spending more time on screen - be it mobile phone, laptop or TV - than recommended. This is a reason for some serious physical and behavioural problems among them,"" he said, adding parents should limit their children's exposure to screens while feeding them or when they are crying.""Parents should become role models for their children.They should, first, themselves reduce screen time at home,"" he added.Recently, the chief medical officer of Ghaziabad in a unique exercise issued an advisory for parents to explain the physical, mental and behavioural health issues being seen among children who are addicted to mobile phones and suggested steps such as engaging children in outdoor and social activities to wean them off the devices.Furthermore, promoting responsible digital citizenship from a young age can be achieved by setting a good example of screen habits and offering guidance on appropriate content.""I get children as young as 10- to 12-year-olds who come with their parents complaining about restlessness if the parents try to monitor their use of the internet. They get irritated and often display aggressive behaviour,"" said a doctor.","An average child under the age of 5 years in India spends close to 2.2 hours daily in front of screens.

NEW DELHI: The central panel on air quality in Delhi-NCR has decided to delay the implementation of the fuel ban on end-of-life (EOL) or overage vehicles in Delhi till November 1, news agency PTI reported.EOL vehicles include diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years.""Direction 89 to be amended. Drive against End-of-Life vehicles in Delhi will now come into force from November 1, along with 5 NCR districts,"" CAQM (Commission for Air Quality Management) official was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.Earlier, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) had directed that such vehicles would not be allowed to get fuel in Delhi from July 1, regardless of where they were registered.Last week, Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa wrote to the CAQM requesting it to hold off on the action. He called the move ""premature and potentially counterproductive"", pointing to ""operational and infrastructural challenges"".The CAQM reviewed the issue and decided to delay the enforcement of the directions, news agency PTI quoted sources.The drive will now be launched on November 1 across Delhi and five adjoining high-vehicle-density districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Sonipat.Fuel stations in Delhi have installed Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to identify EOL vehicles. The camera scans the number plate and checks the vehicle details, such as fuel type, age, and registration, through the VAHAN database.If the system finds a vehicle to be EOL, it alerts the fuel station staff not to refuel it. The violation is recorded and sent to enforcement agencies, who may then take action like impounding or scrapping the vehicle.The decision to postpone the ban followed public discontent and opposition, prompting the Delhi government to request CAQM to delay the rollout.The installation of ANPR cameras in the five neighbouring districts is expected to be completed by October 31, as per PTI report.",The central panel on air quality in Delhi-NCR has decided to delay the implementation of the fuel ban on end-of-life (EOL) or overage vehicles in Delhi till November 1.

The law requires a motion for removal to be endorsed by 100 LS MPs. The required number is 50 in the case of Rajya Sabha.Govt has been holding consultations with the Opposition parties. The process for removal of a judge of the Supreme Court, or a high court, is provided under Article 124(4) of the Constitution, which says that ""a Judge of the SC, or the high court, shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. ""To initiate a removal proceeding, Constitution has laid down very stringent conditions under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, which requires Parliament to set up a three-member committee comprising the Chief Justice of India or a judge of the Supreme Court, a chief justice of a high court and a noted jurist, to probe with evidence if the judge was indeed guilty of ""misbehaviour or incapacity"".The committee is constituted only after a motion is moved in Parliament for removal, addressed to the President 'praying for the removal of a judge'.Once the motion is moved, Speaker of Lok Sabha or the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, as the case may be, may consider admitting the motion and constitute an inquiry committee under Section 3(2) of Judges (Inquiry) Act.In this case, the Supreme Court has already constituted a three-member in-house inquiry committee comprising chief justices of Punjab and Haryana high court and Himachal Pradesh high court, and a judge of Karnataka high court. Based on their findings and examination and recording of statements of more than 50 witnesses, the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna recommended Justice Varma's removal to the President and the Prime Minister.The govt is likely to share the findings of the in-house report with the inquiry committee, which is mandated to be set up by Parliament after a motion for removal is adopted, under Judges (Inquiry) Act: something which may help the panel and enable it to submit its report soon.As reported by TOI earlier, Justice Soumitra Sen of Calcutta high court was the first judge against whom the Rajya Sabha had voted with the required majority on a removal motion in 2011. But the judge finally resigned to avoid his removal. The first case of a removal motion in Parliament was against Justice V Ramaswami, a judge of SC, in 1991. But he escaped being removed as the motion failed to secure the required two-thirds majority in Lok Sabha.Justice PD Dinakaran, the then chief justice of Sikkim high court, resigned in 2011 before the removal proceedings were initiated in Rajya Sabha. In 2015, a similar motion was moved in Rajya Sabha against Justice JB Pardiwala of Gujarat high court. However, the judge later removed a controversial statement from a judgment of his that had stoked the controversy. The latest case was against Justice SK Gangele of Madhya Pradesh high court when 58 MPs of Rajya Sabha moved the motion.However, an inquiry committee absolved the judge of sexual harassment charges against him.",Govt has been holding consultations with the Opposition parties. The law requires a motion for removal to be endorsed by 100 LS MPs. The first case of a removal motion in Parliament was against Justice V Ramaswami in 1991.

Brics rejects EU's unilateral carbon border tax proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brics-rejects-eus-unilateral-carbon-border-tax-proposal/articleshow/122327999.cms,"Brics Summit

NEW DELHI: The Brics nations have rejected the European Union's proposed carbon border tax, or the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), calling it ""unilateral, punitive and discriminatory protectionist measures"", and said the move, being made ""under the pretext of environmental concerns"", would undermine their capacities to invest in just energy transitions and development priorities.India has long been opposed to such measures and even flagged its concerns during the recent free trade agreement talks with the EU.The concerns of the group of 11 nations, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, over such trade barriers got reflected prominently in the 'Leaders' Framework Declaration on Climate Finance' adopted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Monday. The CBAM, to be implemented from next year, is a tool to impose border tax on carbon-intensive goods, such as iron & steel, aluminium and cement, that enter the 27 EU nations.Since it will impose a tariff burden on developing countries and impact their trade prospects, large exporters of such goods, including India and China, have consistently been opposing it.Condemning CBAM, the Brics nations declared that such measures are ""not in line with international law"", and said they oppose ""unilateral protectionist measures which deliberately disrupt the global supply and production chains and distort competition"".Besides flagging the EU's trade barrier, the Brics nations expressed ""serious concern"" over pre-2020 mitigation gaps for developed countries and urged them to urgently bridge the gaps between what they promised and what they have achieved in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The group asked the rich nations to increase their 2030 climate action targets and achieve net-zero emissions significantly ahead of 2050, preferably by 2030.Referring to the critical issue of finance that is going to dominate the climate talks (CO) in Belem, Brazil, later this year, the Brics nations called upon developed countries to meet their earlier goal of jointly mobilising $100 billion per year through 2025 to address the needs of developing countries, and achieve the finance goal of $300 billion per year by 2035.""We note that substantial gaps remain in fulfilling the financing needs identified by developing countries,"" the declaration said. The developed countries were also urged to increase their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation, doubling the amount from 2019 levels by 2025 at the least.","The Brics nations have rejected the European Union's proposed carbon border tax.

DMK MP Kanimozhi’s Reply To Question On India's National Language Wins Applause In Spain

Poll Do you believe language barriers contribute to accidents at railway crossings? Yes No

NEW DELHI: In the tragic school van collision in Tamil Nadu that claimed the lives of three students on Tuesday, a fresh political angle has emerged. The ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has alleged that a language barrier contributed to the incident, claiming the railway gateman posted at the crossing did not understand Tamil.According to the DMK, the lack of familiarity with the local language may have led to a critical communication lapse, ultimately resulting in the fatal crash.DMK Spokesperson TKS Elangovan said, ""Already there was an accident here and the Railway authority themselves stated that it was because the person did not know Tamil language. He could not understand what was told to him. The same thing has happened now. So, it is always better in such important positions that the people who know the local language should be posted so that it will be helpful. That will at least save the people. ""The incident occurred at approximately 7:45 am when a school van carrying students attempted to cross railway level crossing Gate No. 170 between Cuddalore and Alappakkam. The van was struck by Train No. 56813 Villupuram-Mayiladuthurai passenger.The collision caused the van to be thrown away from the crossing. The train's loco pilot managed to halt the train after some distance.Television footage revealed the severely damaged yellow school vehicle.Conflicting accounts emerged regarding the gate's status. Southern Railway maintained the crossing was closed, whilst the van driver requested opening to avoid delay. However, both the driver and an injured student assert the gate was open.The incident resulted in four fatalities, including three students initially and one who later died in hospital. The driver and another student were admitted to Government Hospital, Cuddalore/JIPMER Pondicherry. The incident occurred approximately 190 km from Chennai.Southern Railway's preliminary investigation indicated the gate was closed when the van arrived. They stated the gatekeeper improperly permitted the van's crossing, violating protocols. Legal proceedings have commenced against the gatekeeper.Southern Railway noted that an underpass project awaits District Collector's approval for the past year. The injured student, Vishwesh, and driver Shankar maintain the gate was open and no train signal was heard.A bystander who assisted the victims suffered electric shock from damaged wiring and was hospitalised. Southern Railway expressed regret and announced compensation: Rs 5 Lakh for deceased families, Rs 2.5 lakh for seriously injured, and Rs 50,000 for minor injuries.Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin announced additional compensation: Rs 5 lakh for victims' families, Rs 1 lakh for serious injuries, and Rs 50,000 for minor injuries.Railway authorities deployed a relief train with medical facilities. Senior officials, including the General Manager and Divisional Railway Manager, supervised rescue operations. The incident also damaged an overhead electrical mast.Various state officials, including Governor R N Ravi, Deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin, Opposition Leader Edappadi K Palaniswami, and AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran, expressed condolences.","DMK says lack of familiarity with local language may have led to a critical communication lapse, ultimately resulting in the fatal crash.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday attacked Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, accusing him of insulting President Droupadi Murmu and former President Ram Nath Kovind with ""derogatory and casteist"" remarks, and demanded an unconditional apology.Kharge allegedly made the derogatory remarks while speaking at an event in Chhattisgarh, where he referred to President Murmu as ""Murma ji"" and then went on to mispronounce the name of her predecessor Ram Nath Kovind before correcting himself. BJP said Kharge had deliberately sighted the President and Kovind. BJP also demanded that Congress remove Kharge.Congress, however, rubbished the charge with party member Pawan Khera alleging that the attack on Kharge was reflective of ""BJP's mentality"".Addressing a public rally in Raipur on Monday, Kharge also said BJP always talks big saying that it made Droupadi Murmu and Ram Nath Kovind presidents of the country, ""but did the party do all this to snatch our assets, forests, water and land?""BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia charged Congress of having an ""anti-tribal and anti-Dalit mindset"".Bhatia also alleged that Kharge mocked Kovind. He cited a reference to Kovind to allege that Kharge called the former President ""Covid"".""You call her 'Murma ji' and then call her a land mafia, alleging that she has become President to snatch away assets, forests,"" he charged.Talking to PTI, Khera dismissed BJP's charge, saying, ""This is rubbish. This is the kind of mentality that BJP has. You appoint a tribal leader as President of India but you do uncountable injustice to tribals of Chhattisgarh, Odisha and everywhere, you are literally exploiting their resources. You are cutting their trees. You are robbing their 'jal, jungle and zamin', their identity, but when we ask them a question, they'll say the President of India is a tribal.

'Stop Funding Terror': Priyanka Chaturvedi Calls Out European Nations on 'Sweet' Trade Deals for Pak

NEW DELHI: Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack , which resulted in 40 CRPF casualties, and the 2022 Gorakhnath Temple, the FATF on Tuesday said e-commerce and online payment platforms are being utilised for terrorist funding.The FATF's 'Comprehensive Update on Terrorist Financing Risks', a Global terror financing watchdog, highlighted state-sponsored terrorism, noting that various public sources and delegation inputs indicate ongoing financial and other support from several national governments to specific terrorist organisations.The FATF noted that delegations reported state sponsorship of terror financing as both a fundraising method and financial management strategy for certain terrorist organisations. Support manifested in various forms, including direct financial assistance, logistical aid, material resources, and training provisions, PTI reported.Following the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives, the FATF announced in June its intention to produce a detailed analysis of terrorist financing, incorporating cases from its global network of 200 jurisdictions.In an Indian case study, the FATF detailed how aluminum powder, a crucial component for an improvised explosive device, was acquired through EPOM Amazon to amplify the explosion's impact.""In February 2019, a suicide bombing targeted a convoy of Indian Security forces in Pulwama in Jammu & Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of 40 soldiers. India's authorities concluded that the attack was orchestrated by Jaish-I-Mohammed (JiM).""The investigation led to charges against 19 individuals under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, including terror financing provisions. Seven foreign nationals, including the suicide bomber, were among those charged. Law enforcement recovered related assets, including vehicles and terrorist hideouts.Indian officials have consistently highlighted Pakistan's ongoing support for terrorism and its diversion of multilateral funds for weapons procurement. Sources indicate India believes Pakistan's actions warrant its placement on the FATF's ""grey list"".The report identified terrorists' misuse of e-commerce platforms and online marketplaces for operational procurement of equipment, weapons, chemicals, and 3D-printing materials.These platforms enable terrorists to generate funds by selling items, including previously low-demand products.The FATF explained that EPOMs facilitate fund transfers through trade-based money laundering schemes. This involves purchasing items and sending them to accomplices via EPOMs for resale in different jurisdictions, using profits for terrorist financing.The report outlined methods for raising, moving, and managing terrorist funds, noting that online payment services offer greater anonymity than wire transfers, making it difficult to identify transaction participants.The report cited the April 3, 2022, Gorakhnath Temple incident where an ISIL-influenced individual attacked security personnel. The suspect transferred Rs 669,841 via PayPal internationally using VPNs and received Rs 10,323.35 from abroad.Financial investigations revealed the accused's VPN service payments and approximately 44 international third-party PayPal transactions totalling Rs 669,841 to foreign accounts. The suspect also received foreign funds through PayPal.The probe uncovered payments to multiple ISIL followers abroad supporting terrorist activities.""Due to the suspicious nature of these transactions and the potential for TF, PayPal suspended the accused's account, thereby preventing further illicit fund transfers,"" stated the FATF, citing India's finance ministry.The report noted the significant growth in Fintech payment services over the past decade, with terrorists increasingly utilising these services for their low cost, speed, and ability to obscure participants through pseudonyms or fake accounts.Europol's assessment indicates widespread use across terrorist organisations. Small cells, FTFs, and individual terrorists use P2P payment services for procuring military equipment, chemicals, and propaganda materials.The report noted EoRMT groups' use of peer-to-peer payments for selling merchandise promoting extremist ideologies, forming a key revenue source.Online payment services facilitate donations to larger organisations, particularly when integrated with social networks and content hosting services, enabling recruitment, crowdfunding, and fund transfers through a single platform.The report concluded that online payment services provide less transparency than wire transfers, complicating the identification of transaction participants.","The FATF said e-commerce and online payment platforms are being utilised for terrorist funding.

But as the crowd grew after 10 am and voices of protest were raised, police allowed the march to proceed. CM Devendra Fadnavis said there was no objection to holding a march and police had suggested the usual route sanctioned for it, but MNS insisted on a particular route and hence nod was denied. ""The police chief informed me that police had inputs some of them were likely to do something,"" the CM said.Many MNS functionaries, including Avinash Jadhav, MNS Thane and Palghar district chief, were detained early morning. Jadhav was taken into preventive custody. Around 10am, people started gathering for the morcha, and as numbers swelled, cops began detaining people there as well. Jadhav was released by noon, and in the afternoon, after protests, the morcha was allowed.Two MNS functionaries from Mumbai, Nitin Sardesai and Sandeep Deshpande, also joined. The Marathi Ekikaran Samiti was also part of the morcha.Minister of state for home Yogesh Kadam said there is no difference in treatment of Marathi and non-Marathi groups over rally permissions, but court guidelines must be followed. BJP MLA Narendra Mehta questioned the motive behind MNS's rally, calling it ""karna kuch aur, dikhava kuch aur"" (showing one thing, doing another).","Hundreds of MNS workers, supporters and locals took part in a march at Mira Road on Tuesday.

Goods train halts for 2 hours in Jharkhand as elephant gives birth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goods-train-halts-for-2-hours-in-jharkhand-as-elephant-gives-birth/articleshow/122328782.cms,"RAMGARH: A goods train carrying coal was stopped for over two hours so that a pregnant elephant, who was in labour on the track, could give birth to a calf undisturbed.The incident took place on a forest stretch between Barkakana and Hazaribag railway stations in Jharkhand. Since the particular track is primarily used for goods transportation, no passenger train was affected.Two weeks ago, around 3am, the forest officials contacted railway officials to halt the goods trains for a few hours. The loco pilot was immediately alerted to ensure that both the jumbo and the calf were safe.Divisional forest officer, Ramgarh, Nitish Kumar, said: ""A forest guard informed me that a pregnant elephant is lying on the tracks in labour pain. He warned that it might get run over, and requested to stop all train movement along the route. I immediately contacted railway control room in Barkakana and requested them to stop all trains.""Videos of the incident, recorded by a forest guard and some locals, was widely circulated on social media Tuesday.The heart-warming incident marks a sharp contrast to rising incidents of human-elephant conflict in the state. Jharkhand has reported a staggering loss of 474 human lives in past five years due to such conflicts, making the state's fatality figure second only to Odisha in the country, former junior Union minister for environment, forest and climate change, Kriti Vardhan Singh, had said in a written response in Lok Sabha.Besides, 30 elephants had died in the state because of electrocution and various other reasons from 2019 till July 2024, Parliament was told.","The incident took place on a forest stretch between Barkakana and Hazaribag railway stations in Jharkhand.

NEW DELHI: Global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has raised concerns about the exploitation of e-commerce platforms and online payment services to fund terrorist activities, citing cases from India, including the 2019 Pulwama attack , in which the Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) bought on Amazon a chemical that was added to the RDX used to kill CRPF troopers.In a report, FATF also said the lone accused in the 2022 attack on security personnel at UP's Gorakhnath temple had transferred funds to the Islamic State using PayPal.These cases, it said, illustrated the growing trend of terrorists leveraging online platforms to facilitate their activities. On the Pulwama attack in J&K, the report said, ""Investigations revealed the cross-border movement of a large quantity of explosives into India. Notably, a key component of the improvised explosive device used in the attack - aluminium powder-was procured through EPOM Amazon, an ad network. This material was used to enhance the impact of the blast.""During its investigation, NIA had probed an accused named Waiz-ul-Islam and found that he had used his Amazon account to procure chemicals for making IEDs, batteries and other accessories on the directions of Pakistani JeM terrorists.""He personally delivered the items to JeM terrorists after procuring the incriminating material online as a part of the conspiracy to carry out the Pulwama attack,"" NIA had said in its chargesheet. ""Accused Sajjad Bhat had purchased a Maruti Eeco car for the purpose of carrying out the IED attack,"" it added.This chargesheet, filed in a special court in Jammu, named JeM chief Moulana Masood Azhar, his two brothers Rouf Asgar and Ammar Alvi, suicide bomber Adil Ahmed Dar and 15 others as accused.On the temple attack, the FATF report said, ""On April 3, 2022, the accused individual attacked security personnel at Gorakhnath Temple, influenced by the Islamic State's ideology,"" the report said.As per FATF, the accused had been using a VPN for calling, chatting and downloading to evade detection, and had made 44 payments while using third-party transactions.",FATF has raised concerns about the exploitation of e-commerce platforms and online payment services to fund terrorist activities.

India abstains as UN votes for end to ‘repressive’ Taliban policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-abstains-as-un-votes-for-end-to-repressive-taliban-policies/articleshow/122328111.cms,"P Harish, India's permanent representative to the UN

NEW DELHI: India and China were among 12 countries that abstained in UN General Assembly from voting on a resolution on Afghanistan, seeking political inclusion and urging Taliban to reverse its repressive policies resulting in the ""grave, worsening, widespread and systematic oppression"" of all women and girls. The 193-member UNGA adopted the draft resolution introduced by Germany with 116 votes in favour, two against (US and Israel) and 12 abstentions.Explaining its abstention, India cited Kabul's strong condemnation of the Pahalgam attack, and said a coherent policy to address a post-conflict situation must be a mix of policy instruments: incentivising positive behaviour and disincentivising harmful actions.Pakistan, which has had a turbulent relationship with Taliban in recent times, voted in favour. On the contrary, India's ties with the Taliban have improved dramatically even in the absence of a formal recognition by New Delhi of the regime in Kabul, as evident from foreign minister S Jaishankar's recent contact over phone with Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. ""An approach focused only on punitive measures, in our view, is unlikely to succeed. The United Nations and the broader international community have adopted more balanced and nuanced approaches in other post-conflict contexts.However, no new policy instruments have been introduced to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan since Aug 2021,"" said P Harish, India's permanent representative to the UN. ""A 'business as usual' approach, without new and targeted initiatives, is unlikely to deliver the outcomes the international community envisions for the Afghan people,"" he added.""While we remain committed to continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders and broadly support the international community's efforts towards a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan, India has decided to abstain on this resolution,"" said Harish in his statement, while calling upon the international community to work together for an Afghanistan free of terrorist activities.""The international community must direct its coordinated efforts towards ensuring that entities and individuals designated by the UN Security Council, the Al Qaeda and their affiliates, ISIL and their affiliates, including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, along with their regional sponsors who facilitate their operations, no longer exploit the Afghan territory for terrorist activities,"" said the ambassador.According to a UN News report, the UNGA resolution called on Taliban to swiftly reverse policies that exclude women from education, employment and public life. It also demanded that Afghanistan not be used as a safe haven for terrorist activity.","India and China were among 12 countries that abstained in UN General Assembly from voting on a resolution on Afghanistan.

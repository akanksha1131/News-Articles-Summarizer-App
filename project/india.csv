This is not the intended purpose of the SIR,"" he added.He further claimed that more than three crore voters in Uttar Pradesh were at risk of being removed from the rolls. “This is not SIR. This is NRC in the guise of SIR. They could not implement NRC directly, so they have brought it in another form,” Yadav saidHe alleged that large-scale deletions were being planned in constituencies where the BJP had lost elections. ""If votes are deleted selectively with the connivance of the Election Commission, it amounts to a conspiracy against democracy,"" the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.Yadav said the Election Commission should focus on increasing voter participation instead of creating hurdles for voters. Comparing the SIR exercise to demonetisation, the Covid-19 lockdown and the rollout of GST, he said ordinary citizens were once again being inconvenienced.""If NRC is implemented, people are asked to show certain documents.

Goa nightclub fire: Luthra brothers' deportation process from Thailand under way - top developments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goa-nightclub-fire-luthra-brothers-deportation-process-from-thailand-under-way-top-developments/articleshow/125944078.cms,"ANI file photo

What happened at Birch by Romeo Lane



Luthra brothers nabbed



Goa police extend custody of accused Bharat Kohli



Fireworks banned in North Goa



NEW DELHI: Deportation proceedings have begun against Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, owners of the Birch By Romeo Lane Club in Goa, with Thai authorities coordinating with Indian law enforcement for their return, officials told ANI.Late on December 6, a devastating fire broke out at the nightclub, claiming 25 lives, including five tourists and 20 staff members.The brothers are currently being held at a detention centre in Bangkok after being moved from Phuket, where they were detained following India’s move to suspend their passports in connection with the fire in Arpora.The Indian Embassy in Bangkok is also actively coordinating with Thai authorities, and sources said the brothers were detained in Phuket following the embassy’s intervention. Thai officials are processing the case under local law, including steps for their deportation to India.They said due process would be followed as cooperation continues between the two countries, with authorities working closely with their Indian counterparts to ensure a prompt and lawful handover, as cited by ANI.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant reiterated that strict action would be taken against the accused, saying the state government remains committed to securing justice for those who lost their lives in the tragedy.""Our government will work to give justice to the 25 people who lost their lives...We will put them (the club owners, Luthra brothers) behind bars,"" Sawant said on Thursday, as cited by ANI.Twenty-five people, including five tourists, were killed after the fire broke out, while more than 50 others were injured and hospitalised. Officials said most of the victims were staff members working inside the premises.Preliminary findings indicate the blaze was triggered by a cylinder explosion, with three people dying of burn injuries and the rest succumbing to suffocation as thick smoke filled the enclosed space. At least 100 people were on the dance floor when the fire broke out, and in a bid to escape, some ran downstairs to the kitchen area, where they became trapped along with staff, an eyewitness told news agency PTI. Most of the victims were reportedly in the basement area, including three women and several tourists.The brothers were detained by Thai authorities in Phuket earlier this week and are set to be deported to India to face investigation over the deadly fire. Ticket records show the brothers left for Phuket at around 5.30 am on December 7, hours after the fire broke out, while rescue operations were still underway.Goa Police quickly extended the probe internationally, issuing a lookout circular and securing an Interpol blue corner notice on December 9. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) suspended their passports on December 11 and alerted Thai authorities. The brothers’ plea for bail, claiming they had travelled to Thailand “for work,” was rejected by the court.Police told the court the tickets were booked after the fire, contradicting the brothers’ claim they had left on December 6 for business, an act officials called “incriminating.” Thai immigration authorities arrested the brothers on December 11, releasing images showing them in handcuffs at a Phuket resort following requests from Indian agencies.The brothers are also expected to face corporate scrutiny after investigators found that their North Delhi office at 2590, Ground Floor, Hudson Lane, served as the registered address for multiple companies and Limited Liability Partnerships.Goa Police have extended the custody of another accused in the Birch Club fire, Bharat Kohli, by six days for further investigation, officials said. The Mapusa Sessions Court has also issued notices regarding anticipatory bail applications filed by Arpora Panchayat Sarpanch Roshan Redkar and Secretary Raghuvir Bagkar.The court has granted police time until December 16 at 2.30 pm to file a detailed reply and present arguments, according to a press note. So far, over 50 statements have been recorded from individuals connected to the incident, including officials, workers, and victims.In the aftermath of the tragedy, the North Goa district administration on Thursday banned fireworks inside nightclubs, hotels, and other tourist establishments. On Wednesday, BJP’s coalition partner, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state to promote “good tourism.”","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, owners of the Birch By Romeo Lane Club in Goa, are set to be deported.

Assam CM Calls Zubeen Garg’s Death ‘Plain Murder’, Drops Explosive Revelation

Four of the seven arrested suspects linked to cultural icon Zubeen Garg 's death, including the lone woman in the group, have been charged with murder and another with culpable homicide not amounting to murder in a 12,000-page chargesheet filed Friday by the special investigation team (SIT) probing what happened off Singapore's St John's Island on Sept 19.North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, at whose invitation Zubeen travelled to Singapore, the singer-composer-actor's manager Siddharth Sharma, band member Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and female singer Amritprava Mahanta will face trial for murder (BNS Sec 103), common intention (Sec 3), and criminal conspiracy (Sec 61).Zubeen's cousin and suspended Assam Police Service officer Sandipan Garg has been charged with culpable homcide not amounting to murder (Sec 105), while PSOs Nandeswar Bora and Paresh Baishya will be tried for criminal breach of trust (Sec 316) and criminal conspiracy.While other details of the chargesheet received by the Kamrup district CJM's court weren't immediately available, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said its submission within the stipulated timeframe of three months reflected the state govt's commitment to ensuring justice for Zubeen.""We gave the people of Assam our word.

Sarma said a special public prosecutor would be appointed once the case moves from the CJM's court to a sessions judge. ""These are legal steps that we have to meticulously follow,"" he told reporters.The chargesheet includes the SIT's reconstruction of events leading to Zubeen's death, available evidence, statements of the suspects and the testimonies of 300-odd witnesses.Sarma said the SIT, led by special DGP MP Gupta, had put in ""hard labour"" to build what he said was a watertight case against the suspects. ""Although we have received documents from Singapore, we have built the case with independent findings.

NEW DELHI: After ascertaining repatriation of a pregnant Sunali Khatun along with her eight-year-old son to India, Supreme Court on Friday asked the Union govt to consider on humanitarian grounds the pleas for bringing back four others, including her husband, who were deported to Bangladesh in June this year.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi was informed by West Bengal's counsel Kapil Sibal and counsel Sanjay Hegde, who appeared for Sunali's father Bhodu Sekh, that she is back in India and residing with her father. When the bench asked whether adequate healthcare facilities are being extended to her, the state govt said it is providing her with required medical facilities given her advanced stage of pregnancy.Both Sibal & Hegde requested the court & solicitor general Tushar Mehta to consider bringing back the four others, who were deported along with Sunali to Bangladesh, and claimed that they have every document to prove that they were Indian citizens.Mehta said govt will need time to verify documents. The bench said, ""If govt thinks on humanitarian grounds they can be brought back, it can do so. That will be without prejudice to govt's legal arguments in the case.""The SG drew attention to a report on Friday on Sunali and said publication of such reports was meant to create a narrative, which amounts to influencing public opinion. The CJI-led bench said criticising orders of the court & publishing court proceedings in a case is perfectly fine, but attempting to peddle a narrative through a newspaper publication timed to the date of hearing is avoidable.""There should be no running commentary when a matter is sub-judice. Healthy criticism of a judgment is welcome. But publishing opinions on a sub-judice matter... the author and publisher need to be responsible. We judges are totally immune to what is published in newspapers which we go through only in the evening,"" the CJI said.Sibal said, ""Globally, comments are made on sub-judice matters in newspapers. It is not a sacrilege if motive is not attributed to the judge."" The CJI said, ""Problem arises when distorted and half-baked truth is published. It creates a misapprehension in the minds of people."" Hegde said, ""We need to develop thick skin for all these things."" The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 6, when it would consider the plea for repatriation of the other four.","Pregnant Sunali Khatun along with her eight-year-old son were deported to Bangladesh in June this year.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

n moments of catastrophe, it is always the front line that steps forward, even when they have the least power and the most to lose

Kural 667

Judge not by stature; It is the small

Linchpin that keeps the great chariot moving.

“They also serve who only stand and wait.”

India has never witnessed a travel crisis like the one that engulfed IndiGo recently. Lakhs of passengers were stranded. Airports became impatient seas of distress.A newlywed couple, still radiant from their vows, begged for a way to reach their own reception while guests waited elsewhere. A grieving wife stood by her husband’s coffin. Transit passengers wandered aimlessly, their connecting flights cancelled, their luggage lost somewhere in the airport’s labyrinth.I was at an airport on Dec 5. I was fortunate — I hadn’t checked in my luggage and returned home. But even leaving the airport was an ordeal. For more than two hours, I walked through a suffocating tide of fear, anger and confusion. Rage rose in me too — at those responsible for this collapse, none of whom were present.Passengers have every right to expect reliability and accountability. But amidst the justified outrage,- counter agents, duty managers, ground staff, cabin crews — stood for hours absorbing wave after wave of human ire. Some passengers grew abusive, shouting obscenities even at women staff. Videos showed people climbing over counters to scream at employees who had no authority to fix what had broken.Crises always expose the invisible backbone of organisations. During the 2008 Taj attack, some employees protected guests with extraordinary courage. IThat is why what I saw on the 5th was both heartbreaking and humbling. These employees were not just performing tasks; they were holding the emotional weight of thousands. Their leaders had failed them, but they still tried to do the next best thing, remaining calm in the middle of the storm.Thiruvalluvar knew the worth of such unseen strength.In, he writes:Uruvukandu Ellamai Vendum UlrulperumtherkkuAchchani Annaar Udaiththu.While this couplet emphasises that looks do not matter, it also talks about one’s stature in any hierarchy. Valluvar reminds us that greatness often rests on the smallest, quietest contributions. The lynchpin is not ornate, not celebrated, not even noticed. But remove it — and the entire chariot collapses.Is that not what we witnessed?Every time I walk through an airport, I see one lone staff member posted near each escalator. Their job is simply to stand there — not sit — through the entire shift, just in case someone needs help. They go unnoticed, but they are the first to respond when something goes wrong.I think of the watchmen in our buildings, who keep vigil while we sleep. The lineman who climbs an electric pole in the rain, so our homes stay lit. The ‘akka’ who clears tables in a crowded restaurant, unseen by those she serves.Their work is not glamorous. Their names may never be known. But they are the ones who keep life moving in quiet continuity. The grand chariots of our modern world do not move because of the one seated on the throne but because of the humble linchpins.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

Woman Claims Brutal Assault At Goa's Romeo Lane As Owner Luthra Brothers Face Heat Over Fire Tragedy

GOA: Authorities in Goa are revisiting safety concerns at Romeo Lane, a Vagator nightclub linked to the Luthra brothers, after a tourist’s months-old account of the venue’s unsafe layout resurfaced.Vaibhavi, who visited the club in November, described the nightclub as “suffocating” due to its single elevated entry and exit.She said that staff behaved rudely and that security personnel had physically assaulted her group during the visit.""I visited Romeo Lane in Vagator on 1st November with my cousins. We were 13 people in total. The club is built in such a way that it is very suffocating. It has only one entry and one exit and that too at a height. So it is tough to enter and exit from that club. The staff spoke to us rudely and behaved inappropriately. When we were leaving the club around 3 am, a heavy chair was in our way,"" she said.""My cousin shifted it aside with his foot. The manager came to us and said, 'You are damaging the furniture; we should have thrown you out earlier. You don't have the status to be here.' He grabbed my cousin's collar and started speaking to us rudely.When we tried to apologise and leave, he called all the security personnel, the bouncers. They started chasing us and raised their hands at us. Since it was tough to leave that club, they chased us down and hit people in groups. They hit my sister on the chest, pushed her so badly that she fell down the stairs,"" she added further.""They put up a barricade at the entry gate so we couldn't leave... When my brother removed it, a bouncer ran towards him with a rod and started hitting him badly. When I pushed the bouncer to stop him, he hit me too. They were using such bad language towards us that I had never heard before. Since everyone was badly hurt, we decided to go to the Police station in the morning and not right away. I informed the Police, and they told us to come to the Anjuna Police Station the next day,"" Vaibhavi told news agency ANI.Somehow, an FIR was filed after a lot of effort. I had included the names of both owners in my complaint, but the Police later removed them, saying they were not physically present when this incident occurred, so they are not at fault. f you don't take women's safety and tourist safety seriously, such incidents will keep happening in Goa,"" she added further.Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of the fire-ravaged Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, were recently picked up by Thai police from Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, days after fleeing India on an IndiGo flight as 25 people died in a blaze at their club.The brothers became 'persona non grata' in Thailand after their passports were suspended by the regional passport office in Delhi.

What AI can do: a short practical guide



The ethical and regulatory fault lines



The strategist is no longer human

NEW DELHI: For a decade, Prashant Kishor has been India’s undisputed master craftsman of elections, the strategist who could bend narratives, stitch coalitions and turn sentiment into seats to deliver wins for major politicians. The 2025 Bihar assembly polls, however, delivered a jolt: Kishor, despite months of padyatras, booth-level outreach and the full weight of Jan Suraaj, failed to win a single seat.The upset was more than a personal setback. It signalled a shift already unfolding beneath the surface: the old era of political strategy, built on instinct, experience and human networks, is being steadily eclipsed by a new actor that never tires, never forgets and never stops optimising.The 2020s have introduced a political strategist unlike any before: Artificial Intelligence (AI).Always awake, endlessly scalable and capable of producing personalised persuasion at a fraction of the cost of a conventional campaign team. By 2025, influence is no longer crafted by professionals in war rooms; it is engineered by algorithms fine-tuned to voters’ moods in real-time.The story is no longer only about deepfakes. This is no longer simply about mimicking politicians or reviving long-deceased icons of a political past.The larger threat and opportunity lie in AI’s capacity for persuasion.Studies published this year show that AI chatbots can shift voting attitudes at rates far higher than traditional advertising. Politicians once needed speeches, rallies and media placements to move the needle. In 2024, a ten-message exchange with a chatbot has been shown to deliver greater impact than a multimillion-dollar television campaign.Artificial intelligence has crept into election campaigns around the world, not as a novelty but as a tool for influence. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, political parties harnessed generative AI to navigate the country’s linguistic diversity, translating speeches into regional languages and producing personalised outreach that addressed local audiences.AI tools also created images, videos and voice clips that were widely shared on social media and messaging apps, blurring the line between genuine and fake political content.In the United States, AI was used less for resurrecting figures than for shaping narratives. Advanced models generated millions of messages, memes and automated responses designed to appeal to specific voter groups, turning broad campaigning into hyper-targeted persuasion.MIT researchers have documented how AI can produce and test myriad versions of political content, learning over time which messages resonate most.What makes the current wave of AI so powerful isn’t just its reach, but its precision. Campaign tech can tailor content not just for broad demographics, but for specific segments — and increasingly, for individuals.Using voter data and language models, parties can now generate personalised videos, voice messages or WhatsApp clips that address voters by name or reference hyper-local issues. In India’s 2024 elections, some campaigns reportedly used AI to send personalised campaign messages to local volunteers or voters with voice-cloned content that sounded like a regional leader speaking directly to them.Here’s an example: below are two images placed side by side — one is real, and the other has been altered using AI. Can you tell which is which?If you’re comfortable with tech, the “obvious” choice might be the right-hand image as the AI-generated one. But in a world already overwhelmed with information and shrinking attention spans, it’s easy for many people to be misled.Not long ago, creating such an edit with traditional software would have taken hours of careful work. Now, AI can produce it in minutes with nothing more than a simple prompt.India’s size, linguistic diversity and enormous WhatsApp economy made it a live laboratory for election-grade AI. During the 2024 Lok Sabha campaign, parties experimented with voice clones, personalised videos and hyper-local ads that would once have required expensive local teams. Media reporting found that synthetic videos and voice cloning were deployed to reach voters in their own languages and dialects, sometimes resurrecting familiar faces to prompt nostalgia or loyalty. Deepfakes of late leaders such as M Karunanidhi and audio clones of Jayalalithaa circulated in campaign pockets and on WhatsApp.The 2025 Delhi election cycle illustrated the same duality of benefit and risk. Parties used AI to create slick creatives and chatbots that answered voters’ queries about municipal schemes and polling logistics.Rival campaigns, meanwhile, weaponised visuals and memes that many AI produced to caricature opponents and to amplify outrage on social platforms.Bihar showed how regulators and institutions had to catch up. Ahead of state polls, authorities moved to require labels and disclosures for AI content and warned parties about misuse. The Election Commission issued advisories asking parties to identify AI-created or digitally enhanced material and to remove misleading content promptly. That reflected mounting official concern that unlabelled synthetic media could distort voters’ understanding of where, when and how to vote.In Tamil Nadu politics, AI influence crossed into theatrical territory. Actor-politician Vijay’s party, Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK), released an AI-generated video showing CN Annadurai the iconic founder of rival DMK , appearing to endorse Vijay’s leadership over MK Stalin . The synthetic content drew widespread attention for its audacity and emotional appeal, using the late leader’s likeness and voice patterns in a campaign context.AI platforms can be combined into simple, high-impact campaign stacks.Real-time translation and localisation: Tools such as the Indian government’s Bhashini are already being used to translate speeches in real time and reach multilingual audiences in a single event. That makes national figures intelligible across linguistic divides.Personalised media: AI can insert a person’s name into a video or voice message, speak in a local dialect, and reference a local scheme to create the feel of a one-to-one conversation.Chatbots and P2P messaging: Campaign chatbots on messaging apps can answer voter queries, persuade undecided voters and provide step-by-step voting information. Early field trials suggest conversational bots can move turnout modestly when used responsibly.Synthetic resurrection: Voice cloning and face generation can create speeches and visuals of public figures, living or deceased. This can be used for commemorations or to amplify nostalgia, but it also creates a potent vector for deception.Micro-testing at scale: AI enables the automated generation of hundreds of message permutations and near-instant A/B testing to identify what language or framing works for which segment.The promise of AI for civic inclusion is real. Translation and simplification can make policy accessible. Chatbots can help elderly or remote voters get polling details. Yet the same features that improve outreach also enable deception at scale. The question facing democracies is not whether to use AI but how to shape rules and infrastructure so the technology empowers voters and not predators.Regulatory responses are emerging. The EC has moved to require prominent labelling of synthetic material and to instruct parties to maintain records of AI-created campaign content. Platforms have experimented with provenance labels and ad disclosure rules. At the technical level, researchers and agencies push watermarking, provenance metadata and detection tools.The lesson from recent elections is clear: AI hasn’t stolen votes, but it has quietly entered the game, learning fast and growing harder to contain with every cycle. Its impact depends on public awareness, transparency, and ethical use.Campaigns have always combined messaging, persuasion, and spectacle. AI doesn’t change politics; it accelerates it, sharpens it, and scales it beyond human limits. Just as TV reshaped image and social media reshaped attention, AI is reshaping trust.The strategist is no longer only human. That voice in your phone, that video in your feed, even that argument that swayed you, it may never have come from a person at all.","Artificial intelligence has crept into election campaigns around the world, not as a novelty but as a tool for influence.

Does it fit Trump's plan?



NEW DELHI: Only a few months back, Donald Trump had said that the US had lost India and Russia to the ""deepest darkest China"". Now, reports indicate he wants the States to join a new grouping with those very countries, and even bring Japan into it. However, no official confirmation has been made regarding this so far.An idea circulating in Washington this week proposed forming a “Core-5” bloc that would include China and Russia, bringing long-time rivals into the same framework and offering a clear contrast to the G7, Politico reported.""Nothing around a C5 or C7 was discussed, but there were certainly conversations that the existing bodies like the G-structures or the UN Security Council weren’t fit for purpose given today’s new players,"" the news outlet quoted a White House official who worked in the previous Trump administration saying.The report suggested the proposal for this group appeared in a longer, unpublished version of the National Security Strategy, referenced by Defense One, though this version couldn’t be independently confirmed by NatSec Daily. The White House firmly rejected the claim, with spokesperson Anna Kelly stating that no alternate, private, or classified version of the 33-page official strategy exists.Though such a plan once seemed unlikely, some observers say it fits Trump’s style.As the US president, he has often sought deals with rival nations, approving the sale of Nvidia’s H200 AI chips to China and sending envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Moscow for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.""This aligns with how we know President Trump to view the world, which is non ideologically, through an affinity for strongmen, and through a propensity of working with other great powers that maintain spheres of influence in their region,"" Politico quoted former director for European affairs on the National Security Council Torrey Taussig saying.The buzz comes at after Trump raised the tariff tensions, especially with the three nations — India, China and Russia, over trade disagreements and Ukraine war.It's not long back when he had posted a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping saying: ""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!""The tensions seem to be easing out, but with a deadlock, as India and US are making efforts to finalise a bilateral trade deal.Moreover, PM Modi had a telephonic conversation with Trump on Thursday and the two reviewed ""bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments.""""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" PM Modi posted on X.","An idea circulating in Washington this week proposed forming a “Core-5’ bloc that would include China and Russia.

So immediately we stepped in, released an order and, this time, we made categories based on distance and clearly communicated to the airlines that there has to be a capping in airfares,"" he added.This comes days after the government imposed airfare caps, for the first time after Covid pandemic, as the IndiGo crisis had led to airfares surging exponentially.The aviation ministry said that it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and that it has “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes” to “protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing.”These caps will remain in force until IndiGo operations are back to pre-crisis levels.Under the new cap, airlines cannot charge more than:The ministry clarified that these limits exclude applicable UDF, PSF and taxes, and will not apply to Business Class or RCS-UDAN flights.","The aviation minister Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu said that the prices of flight tickets are on par with the rest of the world.

Karur Stampede Tragedy: TVK blames DMK For Conspiracy As 40 Die, Nearly 100 Left Injured

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday observed, ""there is something wrong going on in the high court,"" as it rejected the Tamil Nadu government’s plea to modify its earlier order suspending a one-man inquiry commission and the SIT probe into the Karur stampede, which claimed 41 lives. The bench of Justices JK Maheswari and Vijay Bishnoi emphasised, ""We want everything to be fair and impartial.""During the hearing, senior advocate P Wilson, representing the government, said that the state commission would not interfere with the CBI investigation and would only make recommendations to prevent such incidents. The bench then asked Wilson to read the notification appointing the commission and reiterated, ""We want everything to be fair and impartial.""The court reviewed a report filed by the registrar general of the Madras High Court , which highlighted how a writ petition seeking SOPs for rallies was registered as a criminal writ petition. ""There is something wrong going on in the high court. This is not a right thing that is happening in the high court,"" said the bench.Wilson and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra requested a copy of the report, stating they wished to file a reply.The Karur stampede occurred on September 27 during a rally of actor-politician Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK).Police had earlier stated that the rally saw a turnout of 27,000 people, nearly three times the expected 10,000, and attributed the tragedy to a seven-hour delay by Vijay in reaching the venue.On October 13, the Supreme Court had ordered a CBI investigation into the incident, noting that the tragedy ""has shaken the national conscience and deserves a fair and impartial investigation."" In the same order, the court had suspended the state’s directions for appointing a SIT and a one-man inquiry commission and set up a three-member supervisory committee, headed by former apex court judge Ajay Rastogi, to monitor the CBI probe.The top court had also criticised Justice N Senthilkumar of the Madras High Court for entertaining petitions related to the incident, ordering an SIT probe, and making observations against TVK and its members without making them parties to the case.Earlier, on October 30, the court had advised a victim’s family to approach the CBI with allegations that they had been threatened by officials, stating, ""Except to say the same, at present, no further orders are required to be passed on the interlocutory applications.""Noting the political undertone of the case, the court said that comments made to the media by top police officers, ""without having regard to the gravity of the incident,"" could create doubts about impartiality and the fairness of the investigation.","Justices JK Maheswari and Vijay Bishnoi emphasised, ""We want everything to be fair and impartial"" The Karur stampede occurred on September 27 during a rally of actor-politician Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125932868,imgsize-921122,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-1.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Karnataka Congress MLA Iqbal Hussain on Friday claimed that deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar will become chief minister after the ongoing winter session of the state legislature, adding fuel to speculation over a possible leadership change within the ruling party.Speaking to reporters, the Ramanagara MLA confirmed that he attended a late-night dinner with Shivakumar and several ministers and legislators. He dismissed suggestions that the meeting was a show of strength. ""MLAs from various constituencies have come for the session; it is a rare opportunity for all of us to meet. During the session, we meet each other. We had dinner together. What's there in that? Can having food together be called a show of strength?"" he said.Asked whether Shivakumar shared any political developments during the gathering, Hussain responded, ""I'm giving the good news. He will become (CM) after the session, he will become. What's wrong with it?"" He added, ""....Shivakumar will get a chance, he will become the chief minister now.""Hussain said 50 to 55 Congress legislators attended the dinner. While party leaders described it as a casual meeting, it took place amid heightened speculation over a power tussle between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, particularly after the government crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20.Reacting to remarks that Shivakumar's elevation would depend on destiny, Hussain said, ""Everything will happen if the god has written in one's fate.... We are all confident that Shivakumar has a chance for his efforts, struggle, and organising the party. We have told the same to the high command, the high command will decide.""The MLA reiterated that the Congress remains disciplined and that the final decision on the chief ministership rests with the central leadership. ""Numbers are not important here. We should be committed to the decision they make. They have said that everyone should abide by the party discipline and abide by their decision. This is the party culture, too. We will abide by their decision,"" he said.The Congress high command has recently attempted to contain the leadership friction, with both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar holding breakfast meetings at each other's residences. The gesture was seen as a signal that Siddaramaiah would continue as chief minister for now, particularly with the Belagavi legislature session underway. The session, which began on December 8, will continue until December 19.Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar and over 30 Congress legislators, including some ministers, met for a dinner late on Thursday night, party sources told PTI.Ministers K H Muniyappa, Mankal Vaidya, Dr M C Sudhakar, MLAs N A Haris, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda, H C Balakrishna, Ganesh Hukkeri, Darshan Dhruvanarayana, Ashok Kumar Rai, K Y Nanjegowda were among those present in the meeting, the sources added.Expelled BJP MLAs ST Somashekhar and Shivaram Hebbar also attended the dinner, they said.The dinner meeting came a day after CM Siddaramaiah, along with ministers and a few legislators considered close to him, met for a dinner hosted by former Belagavi North MLA Feroz Sait.Though leaders term it a casual dinner meeting, speculation is rife as it had taken place amid a power tussle in the ruling party, over the CM post.There were speculations about a change in chief minister when the Congress government reached the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, as it was believed that there was a powersharing agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar after the grand old party won the Assembly election in 2023.As the government crossed this crucial date, activities intensified in Congress, and both the CM and the Deputy CM met over breakfast at each other's residences, on the instructions of the high command. This was seen as a move to pause the leadership tussle between the two and to signal Siddaramaiah's continuation as the CM for the time being, especially ahead of the Belagavi legislature session.","Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar and over 30 Congress legislators, including some ministers, met for a dinner late on Thursday night, party sources told PTI.

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other. India and Thailand had signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force in 2015.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said. The brothers have turned 'wanted' after fleeing the country following last week's blaze at their club in Goa that claimed 25 lives. They had fled to Phuket, Thailand and were staying at a hotel.Goa police had requested Interpol, through MEA and CBI, for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by Interpol.The regional passport office in Delhi had issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days. Their passports were subsequently declared invalid, easing the execution of Indian request for their detention.According to Goa police, the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on Dec 7, even as firefighting operations were under way. By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073.By morning, a Goa police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. ""Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa police,"" a police officer said.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday (Dec 6) during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Friday appointed an external aviation specialist to investigate the ""root cause analysis of the recent operational disruption,"" the airline’s Board said in a statement.The decision follows the recommendation of the Crisis Management Group (CMG) set up by the IndiGo Board shortly after the operational disruptions began in the first week of December.""Captain Illson brings over four decades of aviation experience spanning the FAA, ICAO, IATA, and major global carriers. With an illustrious career in international air transport, he offers deep expertise in aviation strategy, customised consulting, safety leadership, setting global standards, and new aircraft technologies,"" the statement said. The expert is expected to begin work immediately and submit a comprehensive report to the Board.""The objective is to conduct an independent root cause analysis of the recent operational disruption, besides opportunities for improvement,"" the airline added.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is further examining whether IndiGo violated competition norms, reported PTI, citing a senior official.The decision comes after IndiGo’s operations nearly collapsed last week due to non-compliance with new crew duty norms.Earlier today, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) also dismissed four flight operations inspectors who were responsible for monitoring the airline.The issues for the airline stemmed from the airline’s failure to hire additional pilots despite knowing that new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules, affecting crew rostering, were due to take effect on July 1, later revised to November 1. The revised norms would have required more pilots, but IndiGo did not expand its pilot pool. As a result, the DGCA had to put the new FDTL on hold for Airbus A320 aircraft until February 10, 2026, to avoid widespread cancellations like those seen earlier this month.“IndiGo was in discussion with the DGCA on the new FDTL and was aware of the increased pilot requirement. Yet they did not hire pilots. What has happened is inevitable,” said people in the know. Even after the operational crisis, IndiGo has maintained that there is no shortage of pilots. The DGCA has now directed the airline to step up its pilot hiring.The situation has also highlighted internal strains within the airline. “There is a complete disconnect and mistrust between the pilots and the management. The operations control centre (OCC) of the airline is severely disliked by IndiGo pilots. An extra payment was made for night landings which was stopped for a while and so pilots started refusing the same. New contract capped flying. A number of things happened that only widened the gulf between pilots and management,” said sources.Meanwhile, IndiGo said earlier that refunds for most cancelled flights have already been processed, with remaining transactions expected to reflect soon.","IndiGo appoints an external aviation specialist to investigate the ""root cause analysis of the recent operational disruption"" The decision comes after IndiGo’s operations nearly collapsed last week due to non-compliance with new crew duty norms.

'PM Modi Hacks Hearts, Not EVM': Kangana Ranaut Lambasts Rahul Gandhi During SIR Debate In Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said SIR of electoral rolls, being carried out after more than two decades, cannot be a copy-paste of earlier voter lists and, logically, the voter enumeration by the Election Commission would include an inquisitorial process to ascertain, not determine, citizenship.Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for a petitioner challenging the validity of SIR process, said voter enumeration exercise cannot begin with distrust on part of EC to test citizenship of every voter, especially when the statutory task to determine citizenship, upon receipt of a complaint about a foreigner, is vested with other authorities.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, ""EC is constitutionally vested with the power of superintendence of elections, which would include ensuring that only Indian citizens are registered as voters. Would it mean that EC must await a complaint, or undertake an inquisitorial exercise to determine who are doubtful voters? It is better to conduct a summary inquiry rather than await a complaint.""Ramachandran said the SIR for Bihar, according to EC, was necessitated for two reasons - mass migration and rapid urbanisation. ""Reason for Bihar SIR cannot be reason for conducting pan-India SIR as different states have different demography and ground situation relating to electoral rolls,"" he said, adding EC failed to provide detailed reasons for conducting such an exercise.This was the second time when SC had justified updation of poll rolls through SIR. The bench said in the June 24 notification, giving the two reasons for conducting SIR, gives out an intention to carry out pan-India SIR with Bihar as the starting point. ""Migration encompasses both inter-state and cross-border movement of population mainly for economic reasons. For some people across the border, Indian cities are economically more viable. While from India, talented people are migrating to other countries. For citing migration as a reason for SIR, no statistics or research is required,"" it said.Ramachandran said that states like Chhattisgarh and MP, which are going to polls in 2028, are included in SIR exercise, while other states where elections are due in future have been excluded. ""Whole process is arbitrary,"" he added. The arguments would continue on Tuesday.","Supreme Court says SIR of electoral rolls cannot be a copy-paste of earlier voter lists.

Mass visa chaos: H-1B families stranded in India for months after US consulates cancel interviews,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mass-visa-chaos-h-1b-families-stranded-in-india-for-months-after-us-consulates-cancel-interviews/articleshow/125910898.cms,"Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated, with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who travelled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: ""Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.""Rajiv S. Khanna, lmanaging attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labelling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India.

‘Anti-Sanatan’: Anurag Thakur attacks Tamil Nadu govt over Karthigai Deepam controversy; asks 'why are Hindus lathi charged'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-sanatan-anurag-thakur-attacks-tamil-nadu-govt-over-karthigai-deepam-controversy-asks-why-are-hindus-lathi-charged/articleshow/125930243.cms,"'Hindus Are Lathi-Charged': Anurag Thakur Attacks Tamil Nadu Govt Over Karthigai Deepam Row

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur on Friday criticised the Tamil Nadu government over the Karthigai Deepam dispute, alleging that it has adopted what he called an ""anti Sanatan"" stance.Raising the issue in the Lok Sabha, the BJP MP said, ""I want to raise a very important issue where one state in India has become a symbol of anti-Sanatan Dharma. Their ministers are making statements against Sanatan Dharma. "" He added that devotees had been compelled to seek judicial intervention to access the temple.Thakur referred to the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, which recently pulled up the state government, accusing officials of ignoring its order on lighting the Karthigai Deepam lamp at Madurai's Thiruparankundram temple. He said, ""People were forced to approach the court to reach the temple. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court came down strongly on the Tamil Nadu government, accusing officials of deliberately ignoring its order on lighting the Karthigai Deepam lamp at Madurai's Thiruparankundram temple. ""The minister further alleged that devotees faced police action during the episode. ""Hindus are lathi-charged... Why are Hindus stopped?..."" he asked, pressing the government over the treatment of worshippers at the temple.The Karthigai Deepam row escalated sharply lastweek as the Tamil Nadu government again declined to comply with a Madras High Court order permitting the lighting of the ceremonial lamp at the Deepathoon stone pillar atop Thiruparankundram hills. This marked the second consecutive day of defiance, even as a division bench rejected the state’s appeal against contempt proceedings initiated for non-compliance.Tensions rose on the ground, with BJP state chief Nainar Nagendran and several party workers detained in Madurai during protests against the state government. Over 1,000 police personnel were deployed as security forces stopped petitioners and supporters from reaching the hilltop despite the court’s direction.Earlier, a bench of Justices G Jayachandran and K K Ramakrishnan dismissed the state government’s appeal, calling it an attempt to pre-empt contempt action. The bench upheld single-judge Justice G R Swaminathan’s order allowing petitioners to light the lamp at Deepathoon under CISF protection. The single bench had initiated contempt proceedings after officials facilitated lighting the lamp at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple instead of at Deepathoon as directed on December 1.Following the dismissal of the appeal, Justice Swaminathan resumed contempt hearings, set aside the prohibitory orders issued by the Madurai district administration, and again permitted the lighting of the lamp at the hilltop, this time under the protection of Madurai city police. The judge warned that if officials continued to ignore the order, “harsh consequences will ensue.” Officials again blocked access, citing public order concerns.Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government approached the Supreme Court seeking an urgent hearing on its appeal against the High Court’s orders. When mentioned before a bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant, the court declined to provide an immediate listing, saying it would consider the request as soon as possible. The state argued that it had exclusive authority over temple rituals and customs under the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of 1959, and said the High Court could not use contempt jurisdiction to intervene in matters of religious practice.Appearing for a caveator, advocate P V Yogeswaran criticised the state’s approach. He said the government was “repeatedly defying the HC’s orders” and “creating a drama” by filing an appeal to stall contempt proceedings. The High Court has maintained that its directions do not affect the rights of the adjacent dargah and has upheld the petitioners’ right to perform the ritual at the designated Deepathoon site.The state’s appeal in the Supreme Court describes the issue as raising broader questions about the limits of contempt jurisdiction, the autonomy of temple management, and the interplay between judicial orders and executive enforcement powers. It pointed to the district administration’s prohibitory orders issued around 6pm on December 3, at the same time Justice Swaminathan had directed that the petitioner be allowed access to the hilltop. The High Court division bench earlier observed that executive orders under Section 162 of the BNSS cannot override judicial directions and described the timing of the prohibitory orders as indicative of a “well-designed act” to avoid compliance.The division bench will hear related appeals from the Madurai district collector and temple authorities on December 5. Justice Swaminathan had earlier permitted petitioners, including Rama Ravikumar, to light the lamp at Deepathoon after dismissing the state government’s objections about the site’s proximity to a dargah and claims that the ritual had long been conducted at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple.","BJP MP Anurag Thakur criticises Tamil Nadu government over the Karthigai Deepam dispute.

Single higher education regulator closer as Cabinet okays Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-higher-education-regulator-closer-as-cabinet-okays-viksit-bharat-shiksha-adhikshan-bill/articleshow/125935312.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Friday cleared the proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill, paving the way for a major overhaul of higher education regulation and giving legislative shape to a key commitment of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The proposed law seeks to establish a single overarching authority for higher education, replacing legacy regulators such as the University Grants Commission (UGC), the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE). Medical and legal education will remain outside its ambit, it is learnt. The Bill is likely to be placed before the Parliament in the current session.The proposed legislation, earlier referred to as the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill, has now been given Viksit Bharat branding, aligning it with the government’s broader reform narrative. Officials said the new framework ""is aimed at simplifying governance, reducing regulatory overlap and shifting the focus of oversight away from compliance-driven controls towards academic quality and learning outcomes across public and private institutions.Under the proposed law, higher education governance will be reorganised through a clear separation of functions. Regulation, accreditation, academic standard-setting and funding will be handled through distinct verticals, ending the long-standing concentration of multiple powers within a single body.While the new authority will frame norms, quality benchmarks and institutional oversight mechanisms, the disbursal of public funds will continue to rest with the administrative ministry. ""The separation is intended to prevent conflicts of interest, reduce micromanagement and create a more transparent regulatory architecture,"" said an official with the ministry of education.The idea of a unified higher education regulator predates NEP 2020. In 2018, a draft bill proposing the repeal of the UGC Act and the creation of the HECI was placed in the public domain for stakeholder consultation. That proposal, however, triggered concerns within the academic community over excessive centralisation and the possible erosion of university autonomy, and it did not move forward. The NEP 2020 revived the concept in a more calibrated form, arguing that India’s higher education regulatory structure had become fragmented, inconsistent and overly prescriptive. The policy document called for a “complete overhaul” of the system and stressed that regulation, accreditation, funding and academic standard-setting should be performed by independent and empowered bodies. Renewed efforts to translate this vision into legislation gathered pace after Dharmendra Pradhan took charge as education minister in 2021.Supporters of the new bill argue that it addresses long-standing governance distortions in the sector. Multiple regulators with overlapping jurisdictions have often resulted in contradictory rules, delayed approvals and compliance-heavy institutional behaviour. ""A unified regulator could bring coherence to academic standards, ensure uniform quality benchmarks and allow universities greater freedom to innovate in curricula, pedagogy and research, while remaining accountable for outcomes,"" said professor Vinay Pathak, vice chancellor, Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University, formerly Kanpur University.The emphasis on accreditation and learning outcomes, rather than inspections and permissions, is seen as a structural shift aligned with global best practices. By ring-fencing funding from regulatory decision-making, the government aims to create a system where quality assurance is insulated from financial considerations, encouraging institutions to compete on academic merit rather than procedural compliance.At the same time, policy analysts note that the effectiveness of the reform will depend heavily on implementation. ""The composition, independence and transparency of the new authority, and the manner in which its verticals interact with state governments and universities, will be closely watched. Issues related to institutional autonomy, federal balance and the transition from existing regulators are expected to figure prominently when the bill is taken up in Parliament.The proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill could mark a decisive shift in how higher education is governed in India, moving from a fragmented, rule-bound system to one that places governance reform and education quality at the centre.",The proposed law seeks to establish a single overarching authority for higher education. Medical and legal education will remain outside its ambit. The Bill is likely to be placed before the Parliament in the current session. The idea of a unified higher education regulator predates NEP 2020.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125935386,imgsize-1027019,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-3.jpg"

Can check airfares but deregulation must for growth: Naidu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-check-airfares-but-deregulation-must-for-growth-naidu/articleshow/125942594.cms,"'Real-Term Rise In Air Ticket Prices Negative'

NEW DELHI: Amid demands to regulate airfare, civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said in Lok Sabha on Friday that the govt retains the power to intervene in extraordinary circumstances - as seen during the recent spike in ticket prices due to mass-cancellation of IndiGo flights -to protect passengers against opportunistic pricing but emphasised the importance of deregulation and viability of airlines for the sector to grow.Rejecting criticism of soaring air prices, he said in real terms the growth in airfare is actually negative if consumer price index is factored in. In India, it has fallen by 43% compared to 23% in the US and 34% in China, he said, insisting that it is obvious that a certain pricing level has been maintained to keep it affordable for people.""We all feel these are companies which are charging a lot of money. But none of them are making good money. Most of them are in losses. We have to keep this in mind,"" he said, replying to a debate on a private member's resolution on ""appropriate measures to regulate airfare in the country"".Hitting back at opposition members who targeted the govt over instances of exorbitant airfares and the alleged duopoly in the sector, he said no matter how much politics they resort to, the governing alliance is committed to people and ensuring that more and more places are brought on the aviation map.If this was not the case, PM Narendra Modi would not have been elected to office three times in a row, Naidu asserted. He emphasised that deregulation in the sector since 1994 had led to its growth as more airlines joined in and competition rose to the benefits of passengers. Competition Commission of India and courts have also advocated deregulation, he said.Congress MP Shafi Parambil, who had moved the resolution, cited the airfare of over Rs 60,000 in a Srinagar to Delhi flight following the Pahalgam terror attack to bat for regulation but withdrew his resolution as per the standard convention in cases of private members' business.Naidu noted that the govt has a tariff monitoring unit, which is being made more powerful by its inclusion in aircraft rules to lend it statutory provisions. He said the govt had intervened to cap prices for air tickets to Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh this year, and it had taken similar measures after the Pahalgam terror attack.It is not that price surge occurs every day but mostly during festive seasons, he said, stressing that the govt has sat with airlines to augment capacities in specific routes during such occurrences.Aircraft availability is one of the constraints for the sector, and the govt is working at a programme so that aircraft are manufactured in India and the country grows as a leasing hub like Ireland and Singapore, he added.","Civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said in Lok Sabha on Friday that the govt retains the power to intervene in extraordinary circumstances.

Around 100 pilots have written to management, questioning external hiring when internal utilization is low. They worry this will further impact their ability to meet contracted flying hours and affect their overall compensation.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

NEW DELHI: IndiGo troubles are having a ripple effect on India's big airlines. Air India group's attempt to fish in the budget carrier's troubled waters by coming out with an ad for experienced Airbus A320 captains has created anxiety within the former's ranks, especially of Air India Express. The reason: AI Express' under-utilised A320 pilots fear a swelling of their ranks will lead to further decline in their flying hours and adversely affect pay. Close to 100 pilots have so far written to the management of Tata Group's low-cost carrier (LCC) so far to oppose the proposed induction. IndiGo is the world's largest operator of the A320 family of planes.Air India Express currently has a fleet of 110 aircraft, of which 76 are Boeing 737s and the remaining 34 are A320 family planes of Air India and AirAsia India. At least 10 of these A320s will be returned to lessors early next year. While the airline will induct more A320s, the time lag in doing so will mean fewer flying hours - or getting the bare minimum 40 hours' flying allowance.During Covid, erstwhile AirAsia India had reduced fixed hour payment contract of pilots from 70 to 40 hours. Subsequently, Air India also reduced the fixed hours. Only erstwhile Vistara did not do that while going in for a pay cut.IndiGo recently shifted to 50-hour fixed contracts for new junior first officers (JFOs), a reduction from the previous 70-hour standard. Fixed-hour contracts ensure pilots will get paid for a minimum of certain hours in case actual flying is less.AI Express, which has about 1,600 pilots, has its A320 aviators up in arms. ""We've consistently been informed over the past year that the group is surplus on A320 captains, which has also been the basis for maintaining the 40-hour contract and declining the requested 70-hour contract... please clarify the reason for initiating recruitment now,"" the letters say.""Why proceed with external recruitment when internal utilisation remains low?... With multiple recent resignations across the A320 fleet... is there a plan to prioritise retention or re-engagement before hiring externally? Won't any additional recruitment at this stage further impact existing captains' ability to achieve the contractually assumed cost to company based on 70 hours of flying?"" they said.","Air India group's attempt to fish in the budget carrier's troubled waters has created anxiety within the former's ranks.

DGCA removes 4 officials overseeing IndiGo ops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-removes-4-officials-overseeing-indigo-ops/articleshow/125942505.cms,"'Failed To Flag Crew Shortfall Under New Rules'

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

Management faced growing rift with IndiGo pilots: Official

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has removed from their positions four flight operations inspectors (FOIs) who were the principal operations inspectors (POI) for oversight on IndiGo Designated specifically for an airline, these FOIs (senior pilots) are supposed to keep a close watch on the airline's requirements and also see if they have the required resources in terms of crew for their operations. Airline pilots go as FOIs to the short-staffed DGCA for some years. In this case, the four have been sent back to their airline before their term got over.In IndiGo's case, officials said, despite new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) or crew rostering rules scheduled to come into effect from July 1, 2025, and then Nov 1, which would have increased pilot requirement, the airline did not hire for the same. The FOIs failed to flag the issue, they said.This led to a shortage, with IndiGo unable to operate as per new FDTL, which was then put on hold for Airbus A320 aircraft till Feb 10, 2026, to avoid the sort of mass cancellations seen earlier this month.""IndiGo was in discussion with DGCA on the new FDTL and was aware of the increased pilot requirement. Yet they did not hire pilots,"" said an official in the know.Even after the fiasco, IndiGo maintains there is no pilot shortage.DGCA has directed the airline to step up its pilot hiring. Meanwhile, IndiGo's operations are nearly back to normal, with over 2,050 flights Friday across 138 destinations.There is a complete disconnect and mistrust between the pilots and the management. The operations control centre (OCC) of the airline is severely disliked by IndiGo pilots. An extra payment was made for night landings which was stopped for a while and so pilots started refusing night flights. New contract had capped flying. A number of things happened that only widened the gulf between pilots and management,"" an official said.The discontent in IndiGo pilots has arisen not merely for deferring FDTL implementation, but also on other fronts like tweaking salary components, medically unfit and sick report policy. Things got worse recently when some Indian carriers wanted restriction on their pilots going abroad to work for foreign airlines, mainly in the Gulf.""It is okay for Indian carriers to hire expat top management people like CEOs and COOs but they have a problem with us going abroad to work. If you want to retain us, then have better relations with employees, better work environment and pay package. Instead, airlines only want to arm-twist us. Maybe things will change now after the IndiGo fiasco,"" added a pilot.",The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has removed from their positions four flight operations inspectors (FOIs) The FOIs are supposed to keep a close watch on the airline's requirements and also see if they have the required resources in terms of crew for their operations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125942505,imgsize-738043,width-400,resizemode-4/125942505.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Expressing solidarity with Madras high court judge Justice G R Swaminathan, 56 former judges Friday issued an open letter urging members of Parliament to withdraw the impeachment notice against him. They warned that the move undermines judicial independence and seeks to pressure judges who do not align with certain political or ideological expectations.Signatories include former SC judges Adarsh Goel and Hemant Gupta, Justice Anil Deo Singh (ex-CJ Rajasthan HC), Justice Narsimha Reddy (ex-CJ Patna HC), Justice P B Bajanthri (ex-CJ Patna HC) and Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee (ex-CJ Karnataka HC).The notice was filed after Justice Swaminathan, acting on a petition by a right-wing activist, directed state authorities to ensure that a sacred lamp be lit at a hilltop temple. Govt officials said this went against the longstanding practice of lighting the lamp at the nearby Deepa Mandapam, where the ritual had been observed for years.In their letter, the former judges sharply criticised the attempt to remove him. ""We, the former Judges of SC and former CJs and Judges of HCs, take serious exception to the attempt being made by certain MPs and other senior advocates to impeach Justice G R Swaminathan of Madras HC.This is a brazen attempt to browbeat judges who do not fall in line with the ideological and political expectations of a particular section of society. If such an attempt is permitted to proceed, it would cut at the very roots of our democracy and independence of judiciary.""They stressed that the reasons cited by the MPs do not justify such a drastic step. ""Even if the reasons mentioned by the signatory MPs are taken at face value, they are wholly inadequate to justify resorting to such a rare, exceptional & serious constitutional measure as impeachment,"" the statement said.The former judges further warned that using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions poses a grave threat to the rule of law.""The very purpose of the impeachment mechanism is to uphold the integrity of the judiciary, not to convert it into a tool of arm-twisting, signalling and retaliation. To wield the threat of removal as a means of compelling judges to conform to political expectations is to turn a constitutional safeguard into an instrument of intimidation.Such an approach is ""anti-democratic, anti-constitutional, and an anathema"" to the rule of law. The present attempt to impeach a sitting high court judge for discharging his judicial duty is, therefore, not an isolated episode but part of a continuing assault on dignity and independence of the judicial institution itself. Today, the target may be one judge; tomorrow, it will be the institution as a whole,"" they said.They also noted that this reflects a wider pattern of pressure on the judiciary. According to them, recent years have seen similar attempts to attack or discredit former chief justices Dipak Misra, Ranjan Gogoi, S A Bobde and D Y Chandrachud, as well as current CJI Justice Surya Kant, whenever their decisions upset political groups.

The team is made up of former Maoists and victims of insurgency, who have either surrendered or lost limbs and loved ones to violence. ""The moment I say 'Hidma', people look scared. So I have to clarify,"" he says.Over 700 surrendered Maoists and victims of their violence are expected to take the field on Saturday across disciplines - athletics, kabaddi, kho-kho, archery and traditional games.Hidma says he grew up in a large family where farming was never enough to provide for them. ""We could not expand the farming land due to the forest around. Our family was big and we had meagre resources. When the Naxals came and said, 'Come with us', I went. They gave me a gun.

Barbaric actions can't be excused, says SC

NEW DELHI: Carving out an exception to 'bail not jail' principle, Supreme Court has ruled that the right of an accused person to life and liberty should be protected, but it cannot be the sole ground to grant him bail when he is facing trial in a UAPA case for endangering national security and integrity.Dealing with CBI's challenge to bail granted by Calcutta HC to the accused who removed railway tracks, leading to derailment of Jnaneshwari Express and collision with a goods train resulting in the death of 148 people and injuries to 170 on June 9, 2010, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said ""individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to just exceptions, that is, the paramount considerations of national interest, sovereignty and integrity of the nation. ""The scales of Lady Justice must balance on the one hand the constitutionally consecrated and jealously guarded right under Article 21""and the just exceptions, it said.Writing the judgment, Justice Karol said, ""Certain cases such as the instant one demand, by their very nature and effect, that the issue presented is looked at from a much wider point of view - national security.""The derailment was caused by Maoist cadres to pressurise govt to withdraw deployment of a joint force of state police and central paramilitary force in Jhargram to combat and capture Rasua village by the Maoists.Apart from loss of lives and injuries to persons, the govt lost approximately Rs 25 crore in the damage caused to public property.The bench said every citizen, irrespective of the grouping or section in society, has a constitutional right to protest within the limits of law against govt's policy decisions. But barbaric actions, like the sabotage on train tracks resulting in deaths of nearly 150 unsuspecting citizens undertaking a train journey, cannot be excused, it said.Also read: Supreme Court asks government to consider bringing back Sunali’s husband, 3 others from Bangladesh It also rejected the argument that since the accused have undergone more than 12 years of imprisonment, they are entitled to bail under provision 436A of IPC, which mandates release of an undertrial accused on bail once he served more than half the maximum sentence for the offence. SC said for terror acts like the one in hand, one of the possible punishments is death, and hence 12-year incarceration cannot be a ground for release on bail under 436A.The bench noted the reverse burden cast under UAPA on accused to prove their innocence and said the trial courts must ensure that the persons incarcerated in such offences are given every document cited against them to prepare their defence and give them a chance to prove their innocence.

Higher education upgrade: Bill on single regulator gets nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/higher-education-upgrade-bill-on-single-regulator-gets-nod/articleshow/125940452.cms,"The Union Cabinet has approved the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill, aiming to consolidate higher education regulation under a single authority, excluding medical and legal fields. This move seeks to simplify governance and enhance academic quality. Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee will question IndiGo, DGCA, and ministry officials regarding recent flight cancellations and pilot rest rule implementation.

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Friday cleared the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill, paving the way for a major overhaul of higher education regulation and giving legislative shape to a key commitment of NE.The proposed law seeks to establish a single overarching authority for higher education, replacing legacy regulators such as UGC, AICTE and NCTE. Medical and legal education will remain outside its ambit, it is learned.The proposed legislation, earlier referred to as Higher Education Commission of India Bill, has now been given Viksit Bharat branding. Officials said the new framework ""is aimed at simplifying governance, reducing regulatory overlap and shifting focus of oversight away from compliance-driven controls towards academic quality and learning outcomes across public and private institutions"".Under the proposed law, regulation, accreditation, academic standard-setting and funding will be handled through distinct verticals. While the new authority will frame norms, quality benchmarks and institutional oversight mechanisms, disbursal of public funds will continue to rest with the administrative ministry. ""The separation is intended to prevent co-nflict of interest, reduce micromanagement and create a more transparent regulatory architecture,"" said an official.""A unified regulator could bring coherence to academic standards and allow universities greater freedom to innovate in pedagogy and research, while remaining accountable for outcomes,"" said Vinay Pathak, vice-chancellor, Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University.Emphasis on accreditation and learning outcomes is seen as aligned with global best practices. By ring-fencing funding from regulatory decision-making, govt aims to create a system where quality assurance is insulated from financial considerations.Policy analysts note the effectiveness of the reform will depend heavily on implementation. Issues related to institutional autonomy, federal balance and transition from regulators are expected to figure prominently when the bill is taken up in Parliament.","The proposed law seeks to establish a single overarching authority for higher education.

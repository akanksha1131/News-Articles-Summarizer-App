Jimmy Carter's India connection: Haryana village was named 'Carterpuri' in his honour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jimmy-carters-india-connection-haryana-village-was-named-carterpuri-in-his-honor/articleshow/116782324.cms,"The 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter , who passed away at the age of 100, shared a unique connection with India—one that extended beyond diplomacy. Known as ' Carterpuri ,' a small village in Haryana was renamed in his honor following his historic visit to India in 1978.Carter was the first American leader to visit India after the Emergency era and the victory of the Janata Party in 1977. His address to the Indian Parliament on January 2, 1978, championed democracy and freedom, rejecting authoritarianism.“India’s successes decisively refute the theory that a developing country must accept authoritarian or totalitarian rule to achieve economic and social progress,” Carter had said.He praised India’s electoral democracy, saying, “The largest electorate on earth freely and wisely chose its leaders at the polls. Democracy itself was the victor.”The following day, Carter and then-Prime Minister Morarji Desai signed the Delhi Declaration , solidifying ties between the two nations. Speaking at Rashtrapati Bhawan, Carter highlighted the shared values of democracy and human rights, noting that India and the US exemplified governance rooted in serving the citizen, not the other way around.Carter’s connection to India deepened during a visit to the village of Daulatpur Nasirabad, near Delhi. Accompanied by his wife, Rosalynn, he was welcomed warmly by villagers who later renamed their home ""Carterpuri."" The bond between Carter and the village endured, with residents celebrating his Nobel Peace Prize win in 2002 and commemorating January 3 as a local holiday.This visit was significant beyond its symbolism. Carter’s mother, Lillian Carter, had worked in India as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s, making his ties to the country deeply personal. The Carter Centre later remarked that the visit laid the groundwork for a lasting partnership between India and the US, rooted in mutual respect and shared ideals.Carter’s presidency (1977–1981) coincided with Cold War tensions, volatile oil markets, and domestic struggles over civil rights and gender equality. His most notable achievement was brokering the 1978 Camp David Accords , a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. Despite challenges like the Iranian hostage crisis and economic turmoil, Carter’s post-presidential legacy flourished through humanitarian efforts, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize.","Carter was the first American leader to visit India after the Emergency era and the victory of the Janata Party in 1977.

Students are sitting there, we are going to meet them. Gandhi Maidan is a public place, people go there every day. If the students do not have any place, they will go to a public place. I don't know why the government has made it a question of its prestige, somewhere they are harming themselves.""He further added: ""Bihar is the mother of democracy and if the students here do not have the right to speak their minds, then this is becoming a 'lathi-tantra'... that's why we are with the students.""Kishor, also addressing the crowd, announced that a five-member student delegation would meet with the chief secretary to discuss their demands.""Officials confirmed their willingness to engage in discussions.

Firstly, people were protesting against normalisation,"" the former Bihar deputy chief minister said in a video statement.The leader further said: ""On 15-16 December, BPSC announced the cancellation of the exam at one centre. If the paper had been leaked, then why is the exam being cancelled only at one centre? It is a kind of normalisation... That's why students are protesting for a re-examination.

Contemplating terrorist act for years is also an act of terrorism: Delhi HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/contemplating-terrorist-act-for-years-is-also-an-act-of-terrorism-delhi-hc/articleshow/116780669.cms,"HC: Bids to brainwash youth, recruit them can't be ignored



NEW DELHI: Contemplating a terrorist act for years, even without executing it, constitutes a terrorist act, the Delhi high court has said.""The definition of 'terrorist act' under Section 15 of UAPA clearly includes the expressions 'with intent to strike terror', by any other means of whatever nature to cause or likely to cause. Such an expression would not be linked only to an immediate terrorist act but would even include acts, which could be under contemplation for years together and may be given effect to after several years,"" the court said in its Dec 23 order.A division bench was hearing an appeal against the conviction of a member of Al-Qaida in Indian Subcontinent ( AQIS ) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The prosecution alleged that the AQIS member was responsible for sending people to Pakistan for arms training. During his visit to Pakistan, the appellant met the chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba and chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawah, who is wanted for involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the prosecution alleged. In 2015, the appellant visited Bengaluru and met a co-convict, and they discussed the planning and objectives of AQIS. The appellant also gave inflammatory speeches against the nation and propagated 'jihad' in his speeches, the prosecution said.The witnesses stated before the court that he delivered provocative speeches to the effect that RSS, BJP, and VHP conspired against Muslims and that Muslims should also unite.The division bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Amit Sharma observed that Section 18 of UAPA punishes preparation for terrorist acts, even when a specific terrorist act has not been identified. ""The planning to give effect to terrorist acts could also extend over years and under Section 18 of UAPA, the law aims to address such preparation for terrorist acts, even in cases where a specific terrorist act has not been identified,"" it said.The bench added, ""Moreover, speeches which are given to brainwash innocent youth, coupled with attempts to recruit them for committing unlawful and illegal acts against the country, cannot be completely washed away on the ground that no specific terrorist act has been committed.""The court noted that there was sufficient evidence to show and link the appellant with the main accused who obtained passports and visited Pakistan, stating that the appellant, along with co-accused, is part of a larger network involved in giving inflammatory speeches, disseminating material, having links with Pakistan-based organisations, recruiting persons for terrorist acts, and instigating hatred against India and its political leaders.The court further remarked that a terrorist act includes indulging in conspiracy with terrorist organisations and associated persons. ""A perusal of the definition of 'terrorist act' under UAPA shows that...(it) includes any acts which intend to threaten or are likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security, or sovereignty of India. The definition is wide enough to include indulging in conspiracy with terrorist organisations and associated with persons who are rendering support to terrorist organisations,"" said high court.Stating that for conspiracy, specific covert acts are not necessary, even secretive and clandestine support to declared terrorist organisations would also suffice, the court noted that the evidence and the testimonies clearly disclosed the appellant's association with terrorist organisations for the commission of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.","Delhi high court: Contemplating a terrorist act for years, even without executing it, constitutes a terrorist acts.

Remaining three were reported from China, Brazil and south-east Asian countries.“Most of these estimates are based only on insured losses, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be even higher, while the human costs are often uncounted,” said the report, released by the Christian Aid, a global NGO, on Monday.It also noted that the impacts and costs of climate events fall disproportionately on those living in poverty in lower income countries. “This is because they will have fewer assets, less insurance and generally poorer access to comprehensive public services,” said the report.Since the estimates are mainly based on insured losses, the report doesn't include landslides in Wayanad, Kerala in its list of costliest disasters despite the events, linked to extremely heavy rainfall, witnessed killing of over 200 people in July.In terms of events which caused the biggest financial cost in 2024, the US bore the brunt with Hurricane Milton in October topping the list as the single biggest one-off event at $60 billion in damage and killing 25 people. Hurricane Helene which struck the US, Cuba and Mexico in September was next at $55 billion and killed 232 people.“In fact, the US was hit by so many costly storms throughout the year that even when hurricanes were removed, the other convective storms cost more than $60 billion in damage and killed 88 people,” the report said.In terms of human casualties, Typhoon Yagi battered south-east Asia, killing more than 800 people in September. The Typhoon made landfall on September 2 in the Philippines, before moving on to Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand, where it triggered landslides, flash flooding and damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and agricultural land worth $12.6 billion. Floods in China, costing $15.6 billion, killed 315 people during June-July.On the other hand, European countries accounted for three of the top 10 costliest disasters with Storm Boris in central Europe and floods in Spain and Germany costing a combined $13.87 billion, and killing 258 people, 226 of which were in Valencia’s floods in October. In Brazil, floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul killed 183 people and caused $5 billion in damage.“These terrible climate disasters are a warning sign of what is to come if we do not accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. They also show the urgent need for adaptation measures, especially in the global South, where resources are especially stretched, and people are most vulnerable to extreme weather events,” said Patrick Watt, Christian Aid CEO.","North America (4) and Europe (3) reported seven of the 10 costliest disasters.

'When baba passed away ...

The comments came after she raised doubts as to why no Congress Working Committee (CWC) meet was held to condole her father's demise.""The whole Congress ecosystem, as in, its social media was relentlessly trolling me and my father over this and some other issues. The kind of language that was used on me and one of the tallest leaders like my father shows that there is a real rot in the Congress,"" she told PTI.""The Congress, rather than unleashing trolls on social media, should do serious introspection that why a person like me who believed in the hardcore Congress ideology, today feels alienated by the party,"" she added.Sharmistha made headlines recently after she criticised the grand old party for raising doubts over the funeral venue of former PM Manmohan Singh, who passed away on Friday.""When baba passed away, Congress didnt even bother 2 call CWC 4 condolence meeting. A senior leader told me it’s not done 4 Presidents. Thats utter rubbish as I learned later from baba’s diaries that on KR Narayanan’s death, CWC was called & condolence msg was drafted by baba only,"" she said in a post on X.Amid the controversy surrounding the proposal to set up a memorial for former Singh, Sharmistha said that she would not engage in the debate, as she was no longer part of the Congress and has retired from politics.However, she advocated for a memorial in Singh's honor and recommended that the Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award, be posthumously conferred upon the former prime minister.""I would not like to say anything about this, I am not associated with the Congress anymore, I have quit politics. The Congress needs to clarify what Rahul Gandhi has said,"" she said.""I think the demand to have a memorial for Manmohan Singh is absolutely justified. He was the architect of economic reforms in India, he was the father of India's growth story, he was a two-time prime minister. So the demand for a memorial in his honour is absolutely justified. Also, on behalf of the ordinary citizens of India, I demand Bharat Ratna for him, he thoroughly deserves it,"" she added.Meanwhile, reacting to the controversy BJP member NV Subhash, the grandson of former PM PV Narasimha Rao, accused the Congress of disrespecting Rao after his death.He pointed out that despite Rao spending much of his life in Delhi, Congress had promised to build a memorial for him in Hyderabad. Subhash criticized the party, claiming that its hypocrisy had been exposed and that Congress was playing petty politics driven by the whims of its dynastic leadership.",Former President Pranab Mukherjee's daughter Sharmistha accused the party of orchestrating a relentless trolling campaign against her and her father across social media platforms.

Smart cities staring at financial crisis: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smart-cities-staring-at-financial-crisis-study/articleshow/116779043.cms,"NEW DELHI: A study by IIT-Kharagpur has flagged how Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs), which are the nerve centres of 100 smart cities , are staring at a financial sustainability crisis as states and municipalities are not allocating them enough funds.ICCCs are integrated and centralised control-cum-monitoring centres for different services and systems of a city. The key features integrated under these centres are city infrastructure management, civic services monitoring, traffic and transportation management, safety and surveillance, and disaster risk simulation and prediction.In its study on ICCCs' role on effective disaster management , the premier technical institute concluded that the financial sustainability of these centres remain the ""biggest challenge"" to be addressed by the Smart City Mission. It has strongly recommended a mechanism for revenue sharing, which is generated from the core functions of an ICCC such as traffic management and surveillance.""At present, the revenue generated goes to the state exchequer with no basis for sharing with ICCCs which have to install, maintain, operate and periodically upgrade infrastructure. There are huge recurring costs required for the operation and maintenance of such infrastructure. A mechanism for cost sharing is mandatory for supporting the allied functions of the ICCC,"" the report said. It has recommended monetisation of ICCC infrastructure like optical fibre cable, and making a mobile application mandatory for ICCC and monetisation of such an application to bridge the cash crunch faced by these facilities.""Mobile application and call centres should be made mandatory for all ICCCs apart from web-based services. This becomes the direct point of contact for citizens with urban local bodies (ULBs) and Smart City Mission via ICCC for availing varied urban services or lodging complaints related to the same,"" the report said.Taking note of high dependence on private players in managing ICCCs, the study has recommended that there is a need to focus on in-house capacity building of staff and lesser reliance on the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). It has said OEMs must be supervised and managed by managerial staff either from the Smart City Mission unit or ULBs.This study has lauded the role of ICCCs in disaster management in Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatnam and Agartala. It noted the role of these centres and smart city infrastructure in disease control and management particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.It has recommended the need to protect hardware deployed on the field for real-time information, which are prone to vandalism and theft.","ICCCs are integrated and centralised control-cum-monitoring centres for different services and systems of a city.

We have faith that the Shivling is there. We should all prepare for its excavation. The media should go first we will join after that,"" said Yadav during a press conference at the party office in Lucknow, drawing a round of laughter.The SP chief's comment came on Sunday as it marked the ninth day of excavation work underway in Sambhal district of Uttar Pradesh.During the press conference, Akhilesh Yadav said that the current government has brought deterioration rather than progress. The former chief minister highlighted that under BJP's governance, Uttar Pradesh is number one in borrowing and debt.He further said that the treasury has been emptied.He also criticised the government and accused it of cheating the farmers. ""Has the income of farmers doubled?"" he asked.Yadav added ""houses of innocent people are being demolished illegally by bulldozers"".""This is not development but destruction. There is no line of development in the hands of the chief minister, there is a line of destruction ('mukhyamantree jee ke haath mein vikaas kee rekha nahin hai, vinaash kee rekha hai'),"" he said, according to a statement issued by the Samajwadi Party.The SP leader asserted that the BJP administration has failed to implement any developmental initiatives. He pointed out that prices, joblessness and dishonest practices have reached unprecedented levels, causing widespread discontent among farmers and youth.Earlier on Saturday, an official of the Chandausi municipality in Sambhal district said that nearby encroachments would be cleared to trace out an ancient stepwell . The stepwell was discovered after the reopening of a Shiv-Hanuman temple in the district, which had been closed for 46 years.""Till Friday, we kept on digging the stairs and the sides, but a well has been found on the road premises, exactly at the centre. It seems that the structure is all around this well,"" the official said.The official said that structures constructed nearby, which have encroached upon the structure, shall be cleared. He emphasised that as a protected historical monument, no individual has been given the right to encroach upon an archaeological relic or carry out construction activities over it.""After finding such a structure that has archaeological importance, it will be cleared from all sides. If the excavation is done using a tractor or JCB machine, it might get damaged. Therefore, by employing manual labour, the debris is being taken out using shovels and spades, which is why it is taking time. The Archaeological Survey of India is constantly studying the area and the excavation is being done under its guidance,"" he said.The Samajwadi Party is vocal against the excavation work underway in Sambhal district.

Access to the public will begin four weeks later, in the second half of May, when airlines commence domestic flights, along with cargo operations. By the end of July, international flights will start, said Arun Bansal, CEO, Adani Airport Holdings Ltd on Sunday.Given that the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is a greenfield airport - built on undeveloped land - and built in 2024-25, it will have ""all the modern amenities from day one like biometrics, connectivity between terminals,"" said Bansal.On Sunday, around 12.30pm, an IndiGo A320 aircraft took off from Mumbai airport and spent an hour circling over Karjat, Pen, carrying out technical assessment and missed approach manoeuvres as part of the ""validation flight"" process.At 1.32pm, the aircraft did a touchdown on runway 08-26, becoming the first airline jet to land at NMIA. The data collected from the validation flight will be submitted to the aviation regulator for grant of the mandatory aerodrome licence.On Oct 11, an Indian Air Force C-295, a large multi-role tactical airlifter, carried out an inaugural landing on the NMIA runway.The phase-1 terminal building has a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum (ppa). To put that in perspective, last fiscal, airports like Chennai and Kolkata handled about 20 million ppa. Mumbai airport handled 52.8 million ppa, while Delhi, the busiest airport in the country, handled 73.6 million ppa. ""Navi Mumbai airport will start with 10-12 million ppa, with 8-9 million domestic and about 2-3 million international passengers,"" said Bansal. By mid-2026, it will reach 20 million capacity. ""NMIA's terminal 2 will have 30 million ppa capacity and will go live by the end of 2028,"" Bansal said.When commissioned, the much-awaited NMIA will share the burden of the congested Mumbai airport, which is served by a single runway. ""About 15 million passengers from the Mumbai region are travelling to nearby states or other airports,"" Bansal said. ""Airlines are very keen to move to Navi Mumbai to capture that additional passenger growth from Mumbai,"" he said, adding that all domestic airlines are big enough, and so they won't move their entire operations to NMIA.""But certain international airlines with only a few flights per day might decide to have all their operations either out of Mumbai or Navi Mumbai,"" he added.Speaking about connectivity, Bansal said, ""We're very hopeful that the last-mile connectivity will continue to improve. There is a proposal for a new Metro line from Navi Mumbai to the existing Mumbai airport. A lot of highway connectivity has happened, and last mile connectivity will also be ready in time for commercial operations,"" he said.","The Navi Mumbai airport missed its much-touted March-end deadline, but not by much.

The volunteers check every vehicle coming to the protest site, note down the registration number, and check identity of those in the vehicle. The tractor-trailers around Dallewal's chamber have been welded together to prevent any vehicles from approaching it.SC had Saturday asked Punjab government to file an affidavit outlining the compliance on providing medical aid to Dallewal. The court will take up the matter on December 31. Farmers maintain that the court has taken a strict view on medical aid to Dallewal, but the letters written by Dallewal to the President, PM, and CJI have been ignored.Farmer Abhimanyu Kohad said their protest is based on non-violent principles, and going by it, Dallewal is facing hardships on his body. He urged SC not to give such hard directions and pointed out that in the event of something government untoward happening, Centre and constitutional institutions will also be held responsible.In a bid to prevail upon Dallewal to accept medical aid and to assess the situation, retired ADGP Jaskaran Singh, retired DIG Narinder Bhargav, Patiala Range DIG Mandeep Singh Sidhu, and Patiala SSP Nanak Singh held a meeting with farmers at Khanauri.Amid this, the farmers Sunday readied for December 30 Punjab bandh.

NEW DELHI: The sites being considered for former PM Manmohan Singh's memorial include the area near Kisan Ghat , the memorial of former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh, and Rashtriya Smriti Sthal which is the designated spot for the last rites of presidents, vice-presidents and PMs. Both sites are close to the Yamuna and a decision is expected in the next few days.On Saturday, BJP chief J P Nadda said govt has ""given the space for Singh's memorial and has also informed his family about it"". Though the location or land parcel has not been revealed, sources said details will be out soon. ""Usually, space for a memorial is allotted to a society for development and maintenance. The procedure will take some time,"" a govt source said.In an interview to a private TV channel, Union minister Hardeep Puri said Rashtriya Smriti Sthal, the final resting place of four ex-presidents and three former PMs, has space for two more. ""But the request from Congress suggested they wanted more, and that request was accepted,"" he said. This indicated that govt may be considering allocating a bigger space for the former PM's memorial.At present, there are 18 memorials in and around the Raj Ghat complex, which includes those of former presidents, PMs and deputy PMs. The two exceptions are Sanjay Gandhi and Lalita Shastri, late wife of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri.Sources said going by the norms, Manmohan Singh's memorial could be built at Rashtriya Smriti Sthal, though allocation of space will be a political decision.The earmarked area near Ekta Sthal was developed as the designated spot for last rites and memorials of presidents, vice-presidents and PMs. This was done following concerns over shrinking land resources in the capital.Though govt had decided not to create more memorials in 2000, it took 13 years to earmark a single place for such personalities. Before that, separate memorials were created for national representatives including Raj Ghat, Shanti Van, Shakti Sthal, Veer Bhumi, Ekta Sthal, Samta Sthal and Kisan Ghat which occupied over 245 acres of prime land. Construction of Smriti Sthal was completed in 2015 and former PM P V Narasimha Rao was the first to get a 'samadhi' here, even though his family had to wait for 10 years.The Rs 40-crore project was designed for streamlining the maintenance of samadhis and cut down expenses.","The sites being considered for former PM Manmohan Singh's memorial include the area near Kisan Ghat.

ITANAGAR: Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu said the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project (SUMP), estimated to cost Rs 1.13 lakh crore, was being planned by the Centre not just for generating electricity but to maintain the natural flow of the river all year round and mitigate risks of flooding if China released excess water.Khandu's remarks came in the wake of China approving the construction of the world's largest dam, at a cost of $137 billion, on the Brahmaputra river in Tibet close to the Indian border.The dam is to be built at a gorge in the Himalayan reaches where the Brahmaputra makes a huge U-turn to flow into Arunachal and then to Bangladesh.""The SUMP, with an estimated installed capacity of 11,000 mw, is not just about generating power, but also about maintaining the natural flow of the Siang river and mitigating potential flood risks from water releases by China,"" Khandu said. ""The real objective of the project is to save the Siang river and the communities that have depended on it for generations,"" he said. The survey for preparing the pre-feasibility report of the projects is yet to be done amid opposition from locals concerned about displacement, loss of livelihoods, and environmental impact.Warning of severe consequences if China's project moves ahead ""without safeguards"", Khandu said plans to divert water from the Brahmaputra into its arid regions could drastically reduce the flow of the Siang river during winters.Acknowledging the ongoing bilateral discussions between India and China, the chief minister cautioned against ""complacency"" and underscored the need for India to remain vigilant.","The Siang Upper Multipurpose Project (SUMP), estimated to cost Rs 1.13 lakh crore, is being planned by the Centre.

Will Dalai Lama name successor on birthday?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-dalai-lama-name-successor-on-birthday/articleshow/116777055.cms,"DHARAMSHALA: With Dalai Lama's 90th birthday approaching, excitement is growing over whether he will mark the occasion by announcing his successor as the leader of his people and a symbol of their challenge to China's determination to erase their identity as a community.Dalai Lama will turn 90 on July 6, a milestone which many consider to be the right time for the anointment of a new leader of the institution which is now seen as the sole source of resistance, if only symbolic, to China's annexation of Tibet. As preparations are in full swing at McLeodganj, the headquarters of the Tibetan govt in exile - Central Tibetan Administration as it has styled itself - to make it a grand affair with dignitaries and celebrities from across the world likely to witness the ceremony, the question uppermost on many minds is will Dalai Lama mark the occasion by declaring whom he considers to be his reincarnation. What has invested the event with significance is the Tibetan leader's declared wish to break the suspense from the soil of a ""free country"".Fulfilling it will only inflame China's annoyance given the stand of the Communist brass in Beijing that the announcement ought to be made from Chinese territory and with their concurrence.With the Panchen Lama, the second-highest ranking spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama, being in Chinese confinement, the task to validate a successor seems to have become even more complicated.As per past practice, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama put their final seal of approval after identifying each other's reincarnation. There is also a possibility the Dalai Lama may declare there will be no reincarnation after him, as some officials of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) believe. Norzin Dolma, minister in the Tibetan govt (CTA), said, ""His Holiness had written that at 90 years, he will consult Buddhist groups whether this institution should be continued. We have also come out with a paper reiterating 2011 documents. And that China has no role in it."" She, however, said there is no urgency for the announcement as the Dalai Lama has repeatedly said he will live till 110 years of age.The disquiet in the Tibetan administration is obvious given the recent resumption of India-China talks on border issues. Another CTA minister said, ""India has to assess its long-term security situation while engaging in talks with Beijing. China cannot be trusted for what it says and actually does.""","Dalai Lama will turn 90 on July 6, a milestone which many consider to be the right time for the anointment of a new leader of the institution.

Underwater Krishna-Godavari basin landslide can trigger tsunami: Scientists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/underwater-krishna-godavari-basin-landslide-can-trigger-tsunami-scientists/articleshow/116774892.cms,"PANAJI: A recently discovered landslide in Krishna-Godavari basin, reaching between 950m and 1.1km below the ocean surface, could pose a serious risk to underwater structures, Goa-based National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) said. ""The huge landslide can displace a large amount of water and bottom sediments, potentially causing a tsunami,"" NIO director Sunil Kumar Singh told TOI.NIO scientists said the landslide in Bay of Bengal could have occurred anytime between 2009 and 2015. ""It poses a significant risk to underwater communication cables and oil rigs, as well as to people living on the coast,"" NIO said.The scientists believe that when the landslide occurred, it caused a massive section of the seabed to collapse, moving around 11 cubic km of sediments - enough to fill about 44 lakh Olympic-size swimming pools. At some places, the landslide deposits are up to 60m thick, NIO said. This giant underwater landslide , known as a mass transport deposit (MTD), has created a large fan-shaped deposit on the ocean floor, they said. The area the MTD covers is about 70sqkm - roughly the size of 10,000 football fields.The landslide was uncovered using special equipment that tracks changes in the ocean floor over time and was one of the largest underwater slope failures ever found in this part of the ocean, NIO said. The scientists believe several factors might have caused the landslide. One important factor could be Cyclone Helen, a category-1 storm that hit the region in Nov 2013.The cyclone's powerful winds and strong waves may have triggered the collapse. Other possible causes include extreme flooding events in 2010 and 2013, and a powerful 6 magnitude earthquake that shook Bay of Bengal in May 2014. They said even events like cyclones, heavy rain, and earthquakes that seem small on their own can trigger massive underwater landslides, especially if the ocean floor sediments are already weakened.Scientists are now urging more research and monitoring of areas like KG basin to better understand and predict underwater hazards.","A landslide in Krishna-Godavari basin could pose a serious risk to underwater structures.

Sources said the govt would have to address the concerns of hundreds of people as they face a risk of losing their livelihood once ropeways become operational.The govt has announced a 9.7-km Gaurikund-Kedarnath ropeway project and a 12.4-km project to link Govind Ghat, Ghangaria and Hemkund Sahib.The ropeway to Kedarnath will reduce the time taken by pilgrims to reach the shrine to barely 30-40 minutes from around six to seven hours. Similarly, the ropeway to Hemkund Sahib will reduce the travel time to about 45 minutes. The route from Govindghat to Hemkund Sahib is a 19-km steep and tough foot track, and it takes about 12 hours to reach the shrine.Though in Oct 2022, just before the Uttarakhand assembly polls, PM Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stones for these two projects, there has been hardly any progress. TOI has learnt that an inter-ministerial panel is likely to review these projects soon. “Learning from the recent protest against Vaishno Devi ropeway project, we may have to address the concerns of people who would be affected,” a source said.Protesters under the banner of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti have been demanding the cancellation of the proposed ropeway project in the Trikuta hills in J&K.

He recalled: ""During the years of my incarceration , he extended a kindness that he didn't have to - one that was neither politically expedient nor, as one can imagine, appreciated by the Malaysian govt at that time.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft founder Bill Gates on Thursday pulled out of AI Impact Summit and not be delvering his keynote address.Originally, Gates was supposed to be one of the primary speakers at the event. However, Gates faced flak after his name appeared in portions of Epstein files released by the US justice department.In a post on X, the Gates Foundation said the organisation will be represented by Ankur Vora, who is president of the Africa and India offices.“After careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities, Mr. Gates will not be delivering his keynote address.

In an interview with Nine News, he described them as “absolutely absurd and completely false.”In a separate NPR interview, Melinda French Gates said her former husband’s meetings with Epstein were among the factors that contributed to the end of their 27-year marriage.Earlier, government sources had said that Gates would attend the meeting. However, a spokesperson for his foundation contradicted this, saying, “Bill Gates is attending the AI Impact Summit. He will be delivering his keynote as scheduled.”The summit website on Tuesday, however, did not show his name among the key speakers.","Microsoft founder Bill Gates pulls out of AI Impact Summit and not be delvering his keynote address.

Mumbai: Eleven years after the BJP-Sena govt led by Devendra Fadnavis scrapped the 5% Muslim quota in govt jobs and education, the Mahayuti govt has cancelled a circular outlining the process of issuing caste validity certificates for the quota. Officials said the long-delayed process was completed after a query was raised in the last state assembly session.The 5% minority quota had been introduced by the Congress-NCP govt led in June 2014. However, the ordinance lapsed by Dec 2014 since it had not been converted into an Act under the subsequent BJP-Sena govt led by Fadnavis. A high court petition also led to a stay on the quota for jobs.In March 2015, the Fadnavis govt issued an order officially cancelling the ordinance. However, a related circular on caste validity certificates for minorities issued by the social justice department was overlooked. It is this circular which has now been cancelled.

New Delhi: Supreme Court has put an interim stay on the exhumation of bodies of tribal Christians in certain Chhattisgarh villages for their relocation to the religious community's designated graveyards, as an NGO said this act violates the fundamental rights of local Christians to be buried in their villages.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta agreed on Wednesday to hear a petition by the NGO - Chhattisgarh Association for Justice and Equality - after senior advocate Colin Gonsalves cited SC's split verdict on a plea seeking burial of a pastor's body in his village or his agricultural field.While one judge had permitted the petitioner to bury his father's body in his private land, the other judge had said no citizen had an unqualified right to choose the place of burial. After the split decision in Jan last year, the bench had directed burial of the body at a designated burial ground 25-30 km from the village in Chhattisgarh.After hearing Gonsalves, Justices Nath and Mehta sought response from the Chhattisgarh govt to the PIL and ordered that no further exhumation of bodies would be permitted.Gonsalves accused the state govt of misusing the split verdict to stop burial of tribal Christians at places within a village's precincts.The senior advocate said the court must intervene to direct that irrespective of religion, caste or status, every dead person has a right to burial at demarcated places in his/her village.The petitioner said the authorities should be directed to demarcate such land for burial in those villages which do not have designated burial grounds.Interestingly, the bench of Justices Nath and Mehta on Monday had refused to entertain a petition challenging the Oct 28, 2025 order of the Chhattisgarh high court asking the petitioners to approach statutory authority on their grievances against gram sabhas which have put up hoardings barring entry of Christian pastors and priests purportedly to prevent conversion through allurement.",Supreme Court has put an interim stay on the exhumation of bodies of tribal Christians in certain Chhattisgarh villages.

New Delhi: Given the proliferation of financial scams through ponzi schemes, Supreme Court has ruled that conning people of their hard-earned money falls in the category of heinous crimes and that the accused in such offences cannot claim benefit of the liberty-leaning principle of 'bail is the rule and jail the exception'.A bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran set aside an order of Allahabad HC that had granted bail to the main accused in a cheating-cum-forgery case - who absconded for a long period - on the grounds that his co-accused have been granted bail and it is a cheating case triable by a magistrate, thus categorising it as a non-heinous offence. ""We may note that the value of life and liberty of members of society is not limited only to their 'person', but would also extend to the quality of their life, including their economic well-being,"" said Justice Kumar.Justice Kumar wrote the judgment in the financial fraud case that raises the threshhold for economic offenders to get bail by putting them on a par with those charged with heinous crimes. ""In offences of a pecuniary nature, where innocent people are cheated of their hard-earned money by conmen, who make it their life's pursuit to exploit and feast upon the gullibility of others, the aforestated factors must necessarily be weighed while dealing with the alleged offenders' pleas for grant of bail,"" he said in the judgment.Referring to the accused person's activities of forging names and identity cards, and his intention to dupe and cheat people, the bench said this demonstrates that he is a career criminal and a menace to society.

'Mother Of All Deals': PM Modi Signals New Global Trade Order As India And EU Seal Historic Pact

India working closely with European nations to expand AI-led growth: Official

New Delhi: After hosting French President Emmanuel Macron in Mumbai, PM Modi held bilateral meetings on Wednesday with leaders of Spain, Finland, Estonia, Croatia and Serbia, looking to further deepen cooperation in technology, innovation, security and defence with Europe, which is participating in strength in the ongoing AI Impact Summit . With 26 countries officially represented, this is the largest-ever presence of European countries at a technology-based event in India, according to official sources.In the official talks, EU leaders/members conveyed their unanimous support for early implementation of the India-EU FTA. They are also learned to have pledged support for its early ratification in the European Council and European Parliament.""They are all keen to enhance trading ties with India taking advantage of the FTA, creating new opportunities and jobs for people,"" said a govt source.At Modi's meeting with Spainish PM Pedro Sanchez, the two endorsed ongoing defence cooperation, welcoming progress in Tata-Airbus collaboration for C-295 transport aircraft final assembly line in Vadodara and stressing the importance of defence industrial collaboration based on co-development and co-production. Sanchez highlighted the importance of the AI Summit and expressed confidence that its outcomes would contribute meaningfully to shaping global AI governance, while backing closer India-Spain cooperation to leverage AI's potential for inclusive development and societal benefit.""They reiterated their strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and emphasised the need for strengthened international cooperation to combat terrorism,"" said a govt readout, adding that both PMs hailed the India-EU FTA as a major milestone that would help unlock immense trade and investment potential.Modiis expected to meet leaders from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Greece, Slovak Republic and Liechtenstein over the next two days.For India, a solid European presence was the essential ingredient for a successful AI summit, as Europe remains a hub of cutting-edge AI innovation, digital governance and responsible AI frameworks.Govt officials pointed out that EU plays a prominent role in setting global norms, including for AI, and is also the first bloc globally to enact comprehensive AI legislation. While France is playing a key role in AI governance and applications and UK had organised the first AI summit in 2023, the Netherlands and Belgium host critical companies in the semiconductor supply chain like ASML and IMEC, respectively.India working closely with European nations to expand AI-led growth: Official | page 14While Germany is Europe's leading semiconductor hub, the sources said Estonia, too, is a global leader in artificial intelligence, ranking sixth worldwide for AI startups.

Competency-Based Questions Test Conceptual Clarity

Challenging Areas: Circles and Lengthy MCQs

What Lies Ahead

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted the Class 10 Mathematics examination today, February 17, 2026, in both Standard and Basic formats. Early reactions from students and teachers indicate a noticeable difference in difficulty levels between the two papers. While the Standard paper was largely balanced and manageable, the Basic paper drew criticism for being lengthy and challenging.Principal Dr. Alka Kapur of Modern Public School shared with TOI, “The Standard paper was balanced, well-structured, and manageable within the allotted time, while the Basic paper was relatively tough and lengthy, with graph-based questions proving particularly challenging.”Several teachers across India also shared their analyses. Manpreet Kaur, TGT Mathematics at Global Indian International School, noted, “The Grade 10 Mathematics board exam paper was balanced and prepared according to the prescribed board pattern. Overall difficulty was easy to moderate. Most questions were concept-based and straightforward, though a Triangles question and a Probability question were tricky. Time management was important, but well-prepared students could attempt most questions confidently.”Similarly, Suneeti Sharma, TGT Mathematics at Global Indian International School, said, “The paper was moderate in difficulty, with some sections leaning toward easy. Case-study and application-based questions, particularly from Trigonometry, required careful thinking. Students who had practised NCERT examples thoroughly found the paper manageable.”From JAIN International Residential School, Bengaluru, Vamanrao S Patil and Benasir P A described the paper as “moderate and largely NCERT-focused. While MCQs and two-mark questions were accessible, Section D and the case-based Section E required deeper analysis, careful reading, and effective time management.”Shaifali Bhatt, HOD Mathematics at DPS Sector 45, shared her expert view on the exam: “The Class X Mathematics examination, both Standard and Basic, was well-structured and strictly aligned with the NCERT curriculum. The paper was balanced in difficulty, covering all key concepts fairly. Importantly, no questions were outside the prescribed syllabus, and both papers maintained consistency in structure and conceptual clarity, effectively assessing students’ understanding and application skills without being unpredictable. ”Students also expressed their views. Abhhisek Sen, a Class 10 student, said, “The paper set 430/2/2 was extremely lengthy and also difficult, especially when it is a Basic paper. CBSE should shed its ego and reconduct the exam and this time must set the difficulty level equivalent to basic level.”Teacher Sanjay Sharma from Yamuna Vihar added, “The Basic paper demanded extensive calculations, whereas the Standard paper tested conceptual clarity without being overly lengthy.”One of the key highlights of this year’s paper was the presence of competency-based questions. Teachers noted that these questions required students to apply concepts rather than rely solely on memorisation.“The competency-based questions were thoughtfully framed. They tested students’ understanding of concepts in real-life contexts,” said Mr. Abhishek Mehra, PGT Mathematics. “CBSE is clearly moving towards assessing application skills.”In particular, some word problems and case-study based questions required step-by-step reasoning. Students who had practised exemplar problems reportedly found these manageable.While the overall paper was accessible, early reviews of the Mathematics Basic paper highlighted that a few questions from the ‘Circles’ chapter posed challenges. Some students felt that these questions required deeper conceptual understanding.“I was slightly confused in one of the questions from Circles, but after re-reading it, I could attempt it,” said another student from Yamuna Vihar.Additionally, a section of Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) was described as lengthy. Though not necessarily difficult, these questions required time and careful calculation. Time management, therefore, played an important role. Another student from Mumbai told TOI, “Section E was difficult while the rest of the paper was moderate. Many students looked tense, and some were even crying after coming out of the exam hall. ”With Mathematics marking the beginning of the board exams, students seem relieved and hopeful about the upcoming subjects. As the board exams progress, expert analyses and actual question papers are expected to be out soon.On the whole, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 Maths Paper 2026 has been termed as moderately difficult, with a mix of direct and application-based questions. Although some students found the paper manageable with proper preparation, certain parts of the paper demanded a better understanding of concepts and time management. Despite its difficulties, the paper was found to be fair and in line with the syllabus, marking a steady start to this year’s board exams.In conclusion, while the Standard paper was largely fair and student-friendly, the Basic paper challenged many learners. Competency-based and application-driven questions tested conceptual understanding and time management. Students and educators alike are now analysing both papers to gauge performance and prepare for upcoming subjects.","CBSE Class 10 Maths exam 2026 moderately difficult, competency-based questions challenge students.

INDORE: Displaying striking indifference during a crime scene reconstruction, the accused in the murder of a 24-year-old MBA student reacted casually when questioned by reporters, brushing aside queries about the killing.Surrounded by media personnel on Tuesday, Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder. “Kuch nai hua hai, chhodo, ho gaya jo hogaya yaar… chhod do na… kya karoge jaan ke,” he said in Hindi, refusing to explain his actions. When asked whether he regretted the crime, he responded with a faint smirk and said he would reveal the reason “when the time comes”.Police officials present at the reconstruction described his demeanour as unusually calm. Officers said his behaviour during interrogation and subsequent proceedings appeared erratic and detached.According to investigators, the accused allegedly muttered apologies in the hours following the crime and claimed he wanted to “communicate with the victim’s spirit”. He also told police he had contemplated suicide by jumping in front of a train but did not act on it.During questioning at the Dwarkapuri police station, Dhamnodiya reportedly asked for a blank sheet of paper and wrote that he had committed a “grave wrong” and wanted to die.He repeatedly requested officers to let him meet the victim, claiming he loved her.DCP Krishna Lalchandani said the accused had been consuming occult-related online content and searching for suicide methods, though he never attempted self-harm. Investigators also learned that Dhamnodiya suspected the victim of speaking to other men.Police said the woman’s body was recovered on Feb 13 from a rented room in Indore, three days after she was reported missing. Dhamnodiya, identified as her boyfriend and classmate, was traced to Mumbai and arrested from Andheri on Feb 14.During interrogation, police alleged that Dhamnodiya tied the victim’s hands and legs, gagged her and strangled her. Officers further claimed he later purchased beer, returned to the room and consumed alcohol beside the body. Investigators accused him of sexually assaulting the corpse and engaging in acts of necrophilia before fleeing.Police said the accused travelled by train after leaving Indore, changing routes before reaching Mumbai. Investigators stated he later went to a deserted location near Panvel, where he allegedly lit incense sticks and watched online videos about summoning spirits.Dwarkapuri police seized items linked to the crime and recreated the scene. The accused is scheduled to be produced before a court on Wednesday.","Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder.

Gurgaon: Shocking Murder, School Chaos, Delivery Scam Bust & More





ROHTAK: The murder of a 27-year-old bank employee, found with her throat slit near Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district, was solved within 18 hours, with police arresting her husband — a chartered accountant from Hisar — as the prime accused.Investigators said the accused killed his wife over repeated suspicions about her character and then attempted to pass it off as a robbery-cum-murder.The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.She was married to Anshul Dhawan, a chartered accountant and resident of Hisar’s Sector 14, on September 25, 2025, in an arranged marriage. The couple had been married for barely five months.On Valentine’s Day (February 14), the couple visited Hisar and stayed with family.The next evening, around 7 pm on February 15, they left Mahak’s parental home in Hansi for Gurugram. About four hours later, Anshul called the police, claiming unidentified attackers had intercepted their car near Pahsaur village in the Badli area of Jhajjar district, killed his wife, and fled.Police found Mahak’s body lying outside the car on a dirt track about 100 metres off the Jhajjar-Badli road. Her throat had been slit.However, Anshul’s version soon fell apart during questioning.

Police said the couple frequently argued over his suspicions about Mahak’s character. The dispute escalated during the drive, leading him to first strangle her and then slit her throat with a pair of scissors, allegedly while wearing gloves to avoid leaving evidence. He later staged the scene to resemble a robbery.Mahak’s father, Krishna Kathuria, had expressed suspicion against his son-in-law from the outset. Family members also stated that Mahak was pregnant at the time of her death.Police have arrested the accused and are proceeding with further investigation.","The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.

‘Targeting People Like Terrorists’: Mamata Banerjee Attacks EC Over SIR, Cites Bangladesh Polls

Mayapur/Kolkata: Politics surrounding SIR took a back seat to spiritual reflection as home minister Amit Shah travelled Wednesday to Mayapur in Bengal's Nadia, the cradle of Bhakti movement, for a pre-poll Matua outreach focused on highlighting the community's contribution towards what he called ""unification of Hindu society"".Shah lavished praise on social reformers like Matua Mahasangha founder Harichand Thakur and his son Guruchand Thakur and the Vaishnavite saint Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati, whom he described as the bridge between the Bhakti movement and ""modernity"". ""Harichand and Guruchand Thakur, and Matua society as a whole, took the idea of social welfare forward,"" he told a gathering, highlighting their campaign against untouchability and promotion of education and gender equality within the community.Shah, a guest at the 152nd birth anniversary of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati, said he was in Mayapur not as the home minister but as a devotee of the founder of 64 Gaudiya maths (monasteries) in India and abroad.Conveying PM Modi's ""Hare Krishna"" greeting to those attending the event, Shah said, ""Whenever foreign guests visit Modiji, he presents them a copy of the Bhagavad Gita. The epicentre of Bhakti movement was in Nadia and will spread in the days to come.I am sure we will be able to send the message of Viksit Bharat and Sanatan (dharma) to the world.""Sources said Shah's visit was crucial to BJP's relationship with Matua Mahasangha, an influential community in large parts of southern WB, ahead of polls later this year. But party functionaries in Bengal insisted that the HM didn't want politics to creep into his message of solidarity with the community.","Home minister Amit Shah travelled to Mayapur in Bengal's Nadia, the cradle of Bhakti movement.

NEW DELHI: The governing NDA is set to further strengthen its tally in the Upper House after biennial polls for 37 seats in Rajya Sabha on March 16, but the fate of prominent retiring members such as Sharad Pawar (NCP-SP), Abhishek Manu Singhvi (Congress), Ramdas Athawale (RPI-A), Tiruchi Siva (DMK) and Priyanka Chaturvedi (Sena UBT) will depend on how their respective parties coordinate with their alliance partners.BJP-led NDA's tally is expected to cross 130 with the advantage of at least four additional members in Rajya Sabha, whose current strength is 243 with one vacancy each in Jharkhand and West Bengal.The states where seats will be vacant in April are Maharashtra (7 seats), Tamil Nadu (6 ), West Bengal (5), Bihar (5 ), Odisha (4), Assam (3), Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Haryana (2 each), and Himachal Pradesh (1).NDA has govts in six - Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Assam - of the 10 states where seats will be vacant due to members retiring, giving it a clear advantage. The opposition alliance has govts in Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal.In Maharashtra, since the governing coalition, Mahayuti, is expected to secure six seats as against one by opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, it's advantage NDA in the state.On the other hand, MVA will see a lot of political maneuvering as the alliance will have to choose between the candidates of Sena UBT and NCP(SP). In case NCP(SP) sticks with Pawar, it is to be seen whether NCP extends his support to him amid talks of a merger of the factions.Despite not having the numbers, NCP (SP) working president Supriya Sule didn't rule out the possibility of nominating her father, claiming that a MVA meeting would be held soon to finalise a name.The seven Rajya Sabha members from Maharashtra whose terms are set to expire on April 2 are Pawar, Fauzia Khan (NCP-SP), Bhagwat Kishanrao Karad (BJP), Dhairyasheel Patil (BJP), Athawale, Chaturvedi and Rajani Patil (Congress).In Bihar, polls will be held for five seats, three of which are held by governing NDA, including two by JDU.RJD, the principal opposition party in the state, has only 25 MLAs, leaving the combined strength of the alliance (Congress and the Left) at 35 - five less than the number it would require to retain an RS berth. In this scenario, it would be extremely difficult for RJD to repeat MP and former Union minister Prem Ch-and Gupta in the Upper House.In West Bengal, the governing Trinamool Congress is expected to win four of the five RS seats while the opposition BJP may secure one.","BJP-led NDA's tally is expected to cross 130 with the advantage of at least four additional members in Rajya Sabha.

New Army Video Highlights Operation Sindoor Strikes On Terror Camps And Airbases

NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack in J&K, CRPF has set up 43 temporary operating bases across the UT, each housing 16-25 personnel who will track and eliminate terrorists holed up in the higher reaches, security officials said on Wednesday.The temporary bases, 26 of which are located in the Kashmir division and 17 in the Jammu division, sit at a height of 6,000 feet and above. CRPF troops, accompanied by a few J&K Police personnel, use these bases for a few days at a time to launch search and assault operations against terrorists who usually use 'dhoks' (mud and stone huts) as temporary hideouts, awaiting instructions from their Pakistan-based handlers to execute terror attacks.CRPF has procured special equipment for these temporary bases, like tactical boots, winter jackets, sleeping bags and satellite phones.There are about two local terrorists and around 100 foreign terrorists active at present, according to data.The first set of such temporary bases were established by CRPF in April 2025 along the Pahalgam-Tral-Harwan axis, immediately after the April 2025 terrorist attack in Pahalgam.CRPF and other security forces had used one such base to zero in on the hideout of the three Pahalgam attackers, all Pakistanis, near the Dachigam area in Srinagar. All three terrorists were eliminated in Operation Mahadev in July 2025.Prior to the Pahalgam terror attack, the Pakistani terrorists had taken shelter in a dhok near the tourist site in Baisaran where they would gun down 25 tourists. The terrorists escaped into the surrounding forest soon after the attack. The security forces had to scour the forests for months before they could track their location.","The temporary bases, 26 of which are located in the Kashmir division and 17 in the Jammu division, sit at a height of 6,000 feet and above.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu on Wednesday pitched for greater federalism, with the state assembly tabling the Justice Kurian Joseph Committee report on Centre-state relations that recommended diminished powers for the governor and a greater role for states in constitutional amendments.In Part-1 of the report, which runs into 387 pages, the three-member panel said for the appointment of state governors, Article 155 of the Constitution should be amended ""to bind the President to appoint one of the three names approved by a majority of the state assembly"". It recommended a non-renewable five-year term for governors and proposed they be barred from holding any further constitutional office except that of the President and the vice-president.CM MK Stalin called for constitutional amendments and structural reforms to decentralise powers and provide greater autonomy to states. ""How long should we remain the receiver and the Union the provider?"" he said.Governors should not hold office in a political party or any office of the executive, legislature or judiciary in the five years preceding appointment, the report said. It also sought amendments to impose timelines for gubernatorial and presidential action on bills, with deemed assent on expiry, citing the framework laid down by Supreme Court in April 2025.The committee recommended doing away with the governor's address at the start of an assembly session and divesting the governor of the statutory role of chancellor of state universities. ""Dissolution (of the legislative assembly) shall be ordered solely on ministerial advice,"" it suggested.The panel sought a larger say for states in elections, education, health, delimitation and GST. The report slammed the three-language formula and suggested the country shift from ""weak trilingualism to high-proficiency bilingualism"". It said India must abandon the ""one nation one language"" policy and urged Union govt to correct Census distortions by ending misclassification of 53 languages as dialects of Hindi.On territorial integrity, the panel said the consent of the affected state legislature should be obtained before the President recommends introducing a bill to create a new state, and that the same principle should apply to altering the area, boundaries or name of a state.The report said the ""one nation, one election"" proposal should be withdrawn as it violates the basic structure of the Constitution.

AI Impact Summit: Facing Backlash Over China-made Robo Dog, Galgotias University Told To Leave Event

NEW DELHI: IT secretary S Krishnan on Wednesday said that exhibitors at the AI Impact Summit must not display items that do not belong to them, as a controversy continued over a Chinese-made robotic dog showcased by Galgotias University.“Exhibitors must not display items that are not their,” Krishnan said, amid questions over the display of the robot at the summit venue in New Delhi, news agency PTI reported.The IT secretary said that the government wants only genuine work to be showcased at such platforms and stressed the need to avoid disputes over exhibits.“We want genuine and actual work to be reflected in the way that people exhibit in expos. The idea is not to sort of use this as an opportunity in any other fashion. We don't want the controversy surrounding the exhibits presented here. So I think it's essential that a code is followed there. Misinformation cannot be encouraged. So we don't want the controversy around this. I'm not getting into whether they are right or wrong. We just don't want the controversy.”The controversy erupted during the AI Impact Summit 2026 , held at Bharat Mandapam after a robotic dog exhibited by the university under the name “Orion” was identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped robot manufactured by Chinese firm Unitree Robotics and sold in India for around Rs 2–3 lakh.The summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is positioned as a flagship event to showcase India’s advancements in artificial intelligence. The display drew criticism as the machine was alleged to have been presented as an in-house innovation at an event focused on promoting domestic AI capabilities.Government sources earlier said that the university was asked to vacate its stall following the row, and its pavilion’s power supply was reportedly cut off after it was directed to leave the expo.In a press statement issued after being asked to vacate the premises, the university expressed regret over the confusion and said it arose because Professor Neha Singh, who was managing the stall, was unaware of the product’s technical origins.“We at Galgotias University wish to apologise profusely for the confusion created at the recent AI Summit. One of our representatives, manning the pavilion, was ill-informed. She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm of being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorised to speak to the press... Understanding the organisers’ sentiment we have vacated the premises,” the statement read.The issue escalated after Professor Singh, while presenting the robot to DD News, said, “We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence… So Orion has been developed by the Center of Excellences and as you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes.” She also described the robot as capable of surveillance and monitoring tasks.Her remarks triggered scrutiny after observers recognised the machine as an off-the-shelf product sold globally by Unitree Robotics.In an earlier clarification, the university said it had neither built nor claimed to have built the robotic dog, and that its objective was to help students learn using globally available technologies.“Let us be clear - Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat,” it said.Professor Singh later said the controversy stemmed from a lack of clarity in communication and that the university had introduced the robot to inspire students, not to claim manufacturing credit.",IT secretary S Krishnan said exhibitors at the AI Impact Summit must not display items that do not belong to them.

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India as he is legally barred from leaving the United Kingdom.In a statement submitted through his counsel Amit Desai, Mallya said that he does not have an active Indian passport and is also restrained by court orders in England and Wales from travelling outside the UK.The submission came after a bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad last week made it clear that it would not hear his plea challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender unless he returns to India.The court had asked Mallya to clarify whether he intended to come back to the country.Mallya, who has been based in the UK since leaving India in March 2016, has filed two petitions before the high court, one challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender and another questioning the constitutional validity of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act.In his statement read out in court, Mallya said that he cannot give a definite date for his return as his passport was revoked by the Indian government in 2016 and because courts in England and Wales have prohibited him from leaving the country.“Mallya is not permitted to leave or attempt to leave England and Wales or apply for or be in possession of any international travel document. In any event, the petitioner is unable to precisely state when he will return to India,” Desai read out from the statement.The senior counsel further argued that Mallya’s physical presence in India was not necessary for the court to hear his pleas against the fugitive tag and the provisions of the Act.“If he (Mallya) were to appear in India, then all these proceedings would be rendered irrelevant as the statute says that once the offender appears in the concerned court of law, then all these orders would be set aside,” Desai told the court.Mallya, 70, faces multiple cases of alleged fraud and money laundering linked to the default of loans amounting to several thousand crores. He was declared a Fugitive Economic Offender in January 2019 by a special court hearing cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The high court has directed the Union government to file its reply to Mallya’s statement and posted the matter for further hearing next month.","Vijay Mallya tells Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India.

We will continue to source the best technologies from across the world so our students can study them, challenge them, improve upon them—and ultimately create world-class solutions from India for the world. ”In a subsequent statement, the university said concerns about “propaganda” against it were misplaced.“We at Galgotias, faculty and students, are deeply pained by the propaganda campaign against our university. We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop & deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of an hour.”Professor Neha Singh also addressed the controversy, saying, “The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly. I take accountability that perhaps I did not communicate it properly, as it was done with a lot of energy and enthusiasm and very quickly, so I may not have come across as eloquently as I usually do. Also, the intent may not have been properly understood. One important point is regarding the robot dog—we cannot claim that we manufactured it. I have told everyone that we introduced it to our students to inspire them to create something better on their own. Our university contributes to building future leaders by providing cutting-edge technologies in the field of AI, and it will continue to do so.”The issue also drew sharp reactions from the Opposition.The Congress party said on X: “The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own. The Chinese media has mocked us. This is truly embarrassing for India. What is even more shameful is the fact that Modi’s minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is indulging in the same falsehood, promoting China's robots at the Indian summit.”“The Modi Government has caused irreparable damage to the image of the country - they have reduced AI to a joke - a field in which we could be world leaders given our data power,” it added.Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi described the summit as a “disorganised PR spectacle.” In a post on X, he said, “Instead of leveraging India's talent and data, the AI summit is a disorganised PR spectacle - Indian data up for sale, Chinese products showcased.”","Galgotias University apologises after controversy over display of Chinese-made robotic dog at its stall during the AI Impact Summit expo at Bharat Mandapam. The university issued a press statement after it was asked to vacate its pavilion at the summit. In the statement, it expressed regret over the confusion and said it arose because Professor Neha Singh was unaware of the product’s technical origins.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128506903,imgsize-641735,width-400,resizemode-4/128506903.jpg"
'Switzerland actively contributing to development of technical standards',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/switzerland-actively-contributing-to-development-of-technical-standards/articleshow/128533580.cms,"Swiss President Guy Parmelin

How should countries deal with

AI regulation

? Is there a need to have a new agency? Will a regulatory set up stifle innovation and development of AI but how do you deal with challenges such as deep fake?

Switzerland is chairing the OSCE for the third time this year. In that capacity, what are you proposing to do to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Also, what do you make of India’s efforts to reach out to both sides for a ceasefire and return to dialogue and diplomacy?

Last one year has been turbulent for trade? How much cushion have trade deals such as those with India provided?

Given unilateral tariff actions over the last 10 months, what is the way forward ad WTO’s powers are completely undermined and there is a rush of bilateral trade agreements around the globe?

The global order is changing, whether it is trade, arms reduction or countries threatening or attacking others. Where are things headed, is this a transition phase?

Some believe that migration concerns are hyped up and there is a need get people to help at a time when European population is declining. But migrants come with their own challenges, especially problems with adjustment and backlash. How do you balance the two at a time when you are seeing a backlash against certain migrant groups?

Swiss President Guy Parmelin backs a governance framework for AI that does not rely on a single instrument and calls for societal norms that guide users. Excerpts from an interview with TOI:Over the past 200 years, mankind has established thousands of legal, technical and societal norms to “regulate” the development and use of engines in a vast number of different machines and vehicles, with different levels of harmonization, based on the specific context of use. Like engines, we think that also AI cannot be “regulated” by a single instrument, but we will need to develop a governance framework consisting of many instruments to cover different aspects of the development and use of AI. Switzerland is therefore actively contributing to the development of technical standards for AI, of binding and nonbinding legal instruments, like the recommendations of UNESCO or the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) and the Council of Europe framework convention on AI, which has been elaborated among 55 countries from all around the world and is the first binding international treaty on AI. But we also need societal and cultural norms that guide us when using AI in our specific contexts.Under the first priority of its OSCE Chairpersonship (“Helsinki Principles – for lasting peace”), Switzerland is committed to a just peace in Ukraine, based on international law and the Helsinki Principles. In his capacity as OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Federal Councillor Ignazio Cassis visited Kyiv (Feb 2) and Moscow (Feb 5-6) together with the OSCE secretary general to offer dialogue and to make sure all relevant actors know what the OSCE could contribute in the context of a negotiated settlement.Ultimately, it is up to the States to decide whether to make use of it.Free trade agreements such as the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) are an important tool, especially in challenging times for trade policy. They enable the Swiss export industry to tap into new markets and diversify. This strengthens Switzerland’s standing as a business location and boosts its ability to generate added value, create new jobs and preserve existing ones.The WTO has long been under severe stress, but despite institutional paralysis, around 74% of global trade still takes place on MFN terms, underscoring the system’s continued relevance. It remains the only global institution that monitors members’ trade measures and offers a permanent forum for dialogue among 166 economies. In a context of rising tensions and challenges to established rules, Switzerland will continue to champion multilateralism and support WTO reform to preserve rules-based trade. WTO members broadly share this view: they have repeatedly signalled strong willingness to engage in meaningful reform, especially in view of the 14th WTO Ministerial Conference.The international order is undergoing a deep and far-reaching transformation. Democracy is under pressure worldwide. Tariffs are being raised, trade agreements dismantled, international rules ignored. It is not the rule of law that prevails, but the rule of might. Joint solutions are pushed aside by unilateral action. Great powers assert their interests, some wage wars to restore old empires. So, today, we are at a turning point. A turning point between progress and regression, between global cooperation and geopolitical rivalry. Between democratic renewal and authoritarian relapse. We have to actively shape this transformation. In this context, Switzerland is keen to diversify and deepen its relations with democratic partners like India that are proponents of international law and the rules-based international order and have considerable global influence and reach.Switzerland recognizes that human mobility is a global phenomenon. People have always moved in response to economic, social, political, security and environmental challenges, in search of opportunities and/or safety. Fair, regular and safe migration can be a driver of sustainable development and of economic resilience, growth and prosperity for both countries of origin and destination. However, unsafe and irregular migration come with risks and challenges, even more so for young people and women. Switzerland – as a small but highly globalized country - has a strong interest in an international system of migration governance that addresses the risks associated with unsafe migration and forced displacement while leveraging the benefit of migration for the economy and the people. To address challenges but also build on opportunities, Switzerland’s foreign policy on migration is characterized by a partnership approach with countries of origin, transit and destination.",Switzerland is chairing the OSCE for the third time this year.

What can Estonia offer to the world and India in terms of AI and tech?

AI is still developing so fast. We don't know what's going on, let's say in three months or even two weeks.

Could you give us a sense of the digitalisation that has happened in Estonia?

How are you ensuring privacy of data?

What has been the increase in productivity as a result of digitalisation?

What are the areas of cooperation you see with India?

What are your views on regulation of AI?

Estonia is widely using AI in edu and wants to collaborate with India. In an interview with TOI’s Surojit Gupta, Estonia’s President Alar Karis talks about how they’ve built trust while rolling out citizen-centric e-services. Excerpts:n We can provide to India and the rest of the world our experience and how we digitalised our society. One important thing we should share with the rest of our world is how we are building trust when we go for digitisation or using AI. You should build trust not only between technologies, but also between govts and societies as a whole.But we are prepared and we try to use this new technology smartly. This is what we can tell India. India is also a digitalised country, so we learn from each other.In Estonia, everything is online. That means you can even get married online. I mentioned tax, I mentioned prescriptions, basically everything. One startup, instead of using lawyers, is using AI. It doesn't mean we don't need lawyers anymore, but we can focus on things which are more important as there are queues in Estonia to get to the court.Privacy is getting more and more important with AI technology. Data may belong to citizens, but data privacy, especially medical care, is a concern. We see in Europe, in some countries, how difficult it is to introduce ID cards as people are concerned about the data.Someone has calculated that it has raised GDP by 5%. That is a calculation that's just done by officials. It makes your life very comfortable. In some countries, it's very difficult to fill up the tax forms. For us, it's pre-filled. It takes maybe a couple of minutes if you don't have anything to add. It makes the whole thing transparent. For medical prescriptions, you don't have to go to a doctor. He knows what your illnesses are and they give you a prescription, you see it right away and you go to a pharmacy.Like India, Estonia values education. We can collaborate on this. We started AI Leap. We provided computer access to schools 30 years ago. Now, we are doing the same with AI. We teach teachers and students how to use AI smartly. We've collaboration with OpenAI and Google and asked them to provide a platform that suits students' needs in Estonia. AI Leap is in every school and we are learning how to use it and how to actually change the whole system of how we teach students.Regulations are needed. We try to ensure there are worldwide regulations, at least on a certain level. But every country is different. There are limits with technology and there are rules and regulations.","Estonia is widely using AI in edu and wants to collaborate with India.

People must be careful of risks while developing technologies: AI expert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-must-be-careful-of-risks-while-developing-technologies-ai-expert/articleshow/128533187.cms,"Visitors explore cutting-edge AI gizmos at the summit on Wednesday

New Delhi: Current frontier models of AI are developed by a handful of companies and in countries such as the US and China, while most other countries are ""passive victims of things they built"", Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science at University of Montreal, said at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Wednesday.Emphasising that only a handful of countries leading this domain is ""unacceptable"", Bengio, who is widely considered as an AI pioneer said nations must take this up at the highest diplomatic level. Frontier models in AI are the most advanced, large-scale, general-purpose machine learning models that currently push the boundaries of capability, multimodality (text, image, audio, video), and performance.Yoshua said it's not just a question of morality, but also sovereignty. He added this is also related to concentration of power. ""If AI capability continues to grow, there's a real possibility that there'll be a huge discrepancy, even more than there is now, between the models, let's say, in the US and China and the models that are being developed in other countries. And that could give those two countries or whoever is leading huge economic power. .."", noting that ""...the stability, the geopolitical stability that we've known since the Second World War could just go up in flames.I'm not saying it's going to happen, but when you introduce so much power and when it is concentrated in such a way, there's a real danger that you're going to break the house.""These observations are significant at a time when India is spearheading the campaign for democratising AI.On what India should be careful with regard to AI, Bengio said people should be mindful of the effects or the risks that are being taken that are going to affect society while developing the technologies. ""We need to understand it scientifically. We need to understand it socially because there's a social component psychologically in the case of AI because we're talking about systems that interact with people and language. So, a country like India could contribute to that understanding,"" he said.He also said there is a dire need to carry out independent risk assessment before deploying open AI models. ""If the risks are not too large compared to the benefits, because clearly there are benefits to sharing, in particular in developing countries like here in India, then sure, you should absolutely go open. But if you see that the risks cross a threshold of social accessibility, then you should not. So this way we might be able to get the benefits of open source when it makes sense and we could prevent catastrophic uses otherwise,"" Bengio said.The professor also drew a parallel to how thorough risk assessment is carried out before allowing the sale of medicines and the same should be followed when using Artificial Intelligence in the public.""You can't do whatever you want that's going to make you money. You need to first show to an independent party, like representing the govt, that your product is not going to be harmful. But there's no such thing right now. It's a scandal,"" he said.","Current frontier models of AI are developed by a handful of companies and in countries such as the US and China.

Why GenAI appeals to kids

New Delhi: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is fast becoming part of children's learning routines in India, but a deep misconception about what the technology actually does is spreading just as quickly. Bharat Survey for EdTech 2025, released by Central Square Foundation on Wednesday, showed 35% of children who already use edtech are using GenAI tools for learning, even as nearly three-fourths of GenAI-aware children wrongly believe these tools are simply internet search engines.The survey, conducted between July 2025 and Jan 2026 covering 12,500 households and 2,500 teachers across 10 states, showed that for children from low-income households, GenAI adoption is no more experimental: 96% use it multiple times a week, and 69% operate it daily.Yet, understanding lags sharply behind usage. While 85% of GenAI-aware children said they understood how it works, 72% equated it with a search application, blurring the line between probabilistic AI-generated responses and verified online information.This gap is critical as 46% of respondents flagged ""wrong information"" as a key risk associated with edtech and GenAI use, alongside concerns about overuse.The report showed that children were primarily using GenAI for school-linked activities, with 73% relying on it for doubt-solving and practice, 48% for learning new skills or language translation, and 32% for test preparation.The main attractions are easy-to-understand explanations (45%), quick responses that save time (41%), and interactive formats (40%) - features that make GenAI especially appealing in homes where adult academic support may be limited.However, experts warned that high-frequency use without foundational AI literacy could amplify risks.The New Delhi-based NGO said the findings highlighted an urgent need to move beyond access and adoption metrics.","35% of children who already use edtech are using GenAI tools for learning.

‘Social Media Curbs For Children Only After Careful Consideration’

New Delhi: Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Wednesday underlined the need to strike a balance between development of artificial intelligence and regulation, and asserted that govt will use a mix of technical regulations and laws going forward.""India's approach has been a techno-legal approach, a combination of using technical solutions, and legal structures. That approach is now appreciated by the global community. Some geographies have in the past used only regulation or a legal approach. That has not really delivered the kind of results which are needed,"" the minister told TOI in an interview.Given that innovations have a long runway, heavy regulation may not be required at this stage. ""This is probably the first innings of the first match of a test series,"" he quipped.The minister said Big Tech ""is pretty much working in sync"" with society and policymakers.Asked about restricting access of children to social media, Vaishnaw said that currently discussions are underway. ""There is a discussion going on about the impact of social media on children and how it should be dealt with. Several countries have imposed restrictions and prohibitions and in India too, industry and public other stakeholders are discussing the issue.The right solution will emerge only through thoughtful deliberation. ""He also said that AI offered a lot of opportunities for Indian IT companies.""The IT industry is also very cognizant of the challenges and they are pivoting very rapidly away from the old model to create a new model of providing services, from software as a service to AI-based services. There are thousands and thousands of legacy systems in the world. Those legacy systems will have to be modernised, and our IT services companies are best placed to modernise them, using the new AI-based solutions,"" Vaishnaw said, adding that the govt, academia and industry are harmonised.Asked about the PM's comments asking IT companies to diversify beyond services to products and platforms, the minister said industry is calibrating these changes. ""They were trying to measure what this change would bring to their sector... Lots and lots of very focused, small models is what the IT industry is putting their emphasis on, which can be placed in an enterprise where trust is the most important factor,"" he said.Vaishnaw added that the IT industry has devised a bouquet of small models, and our sovereign models are complementing that.","Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw underlined the need to strike a balance between development of artificial intelligence and regulation.

Indore: A video of a woman being beaten in Indore has exposed a disturbing surge in mob violence fuelled by rumours of child-lifting, with innocent people being attacked in multiple districts of Madhya Pradesh without any evidence.The woman in the video, who was assaulted in Bhanwarkuan area here, was identified as Rekha Devi, a 45-year-old woman with mental health issues who has been missing from Meerut for over a year. After her daughter traced her through the clip, police confirmed that Rekha had been questioned and released as she was not involved in any crime. She has since gone missing again.Rekha's case is part of a wider pattern of panic-driven attacks in Indore and its neighbouring districts where strangers are being confronted and beaten on the mere suspicion of being child-lifters.

MUMBAI: A child raised exclusively by her mother cannot be compelled to carry her father's surname and caste merely because the format once demanded it, Bombay HC said recently.The order was in response to a petition filed by a 12-year-old girl seeking correction of her name in school records and also of the caste entry from 'Maratha' to 'Scheduled Caste'.The child's request was rejected by school authorities last year, citing Secondary School Code.The HC ruling, made available on Wednesday, stated: ""Recognition of a single mother as a complete parent for purposes of a child's civic identity is not an act of charity; it is constitutional fidelity. It reflects the movement from patriarchal compulsion to constitutional choice, from lineage as fate to dignity as right.""The court further said, ""A society that claims to be developing cannot insist that a child's public identity must be anchored to a father who is absent from the child's life, while the mother, who bears the entire burden of upbringing, remains administratively secondary. The state's formats must not become moral judgments; they must become accurate instruments of welfare.""A school record was not a private note but ""a public document that follows a child across years, institutions, and sometimes into the professional domain"", observed Justices Vibha Kankanwadi and H S Venegaonkar in a Feb 2 judgment from Bombay HC's Aurangabad bench.""If lived guardianship is maternal, the record cannot insist on paternal visibility as a matter of routine, and then call it administrative neutrality. ''The child's mother was a single parent and her natural guardian, HC said. The mother had accused the child's father of sexual assault. Later, they reached a settlement, and it was agreed that the daughter would remain in the permanent custody of the mother.The minor and her mother, both petitioners, asserted that continuation of the father's surname in the school record did not merely create an inaccuracy but also ""an avoidable social vulnerability for a child who must grow up, learn, and form her identity in society that often treat names as identity for family history"".","A child raised exclusively by her mother cannot be compelled to carry her father's surname and caste, Bombay HC says.

New Delhi: In the single biggest attachment of properties, ED on Wednesday said it has attached assets worth over Rs 10,000 crore of Pearl Agro Corp Ltd (PACL) in a money laundering case. These properties are located in Punjab's SAS Nagar, Rupnagar, Zirakpur and Mohali.With this, the value of total attachments against PACL and its promoter Nirmal Singh Bhangoo and his family exceeds Rs 17,600 crore. The last biggest attachment was also against this group when the agency, in Jan this year, attached 37 properties worth over Rs 2,000 crore, including a prime plot worth over Rs 1,500 crore near Jaipur airport and others in Ludhiana.The PACL, a multi-level marketing company that promised allotment of plots to lakhs of people across the country, tricked investors and regulators alike for close to two decades and managed to collect more than Rs 48,000 crore, siphoning most of this money to purchase assets in India and overseas, according to an assessment by the ED.""In most cases, land was never delivered, and approximately Rs 48,000 crore remains unpaid to investors,"" ED said. The scheme involved use of multiple front entities and reverse sale transactions to conceal fraud and generate wrongful gains, it added.The case is based on a probe ordered by the Supreme Court and a directive issued to SEBI to constitute a panel to dispose of the land bought by PACL and distribute the sale proceeds to the investors.","The properties are located in Punjab's SAS Nagar, Rupnagar, Zirakpur and Mohali.

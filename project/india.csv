NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday targeted Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta over her remarks on air pollution, sharing a video of her comments and questioning the scientific basis of her claims.Posting in Hindi on X, Kejriwal wrote: “AQI monitors are installed, water is being sprayed there so that the truth about pollution doesn’t reach the people of Delhi. In other words, there’s a game afoot to hide the figures and make it look like the ‘air is clean’. Second thing – when did this new science come about that AQI has now become temperature?”The video shared by Kejriwal showed Gupta defending water spraying at pollution hotspots. In the clip, she said: “So you will spray (water) at a hotspot. Does spraying water on a monitor bring down the AQI, she questioned.""AQI ek aisa temperature hai, jo kisi bhi instrument se pata chalta hai. Toh usme watering is the only solution. Jo hum kar rahe hai, jo pichli sarkare bhi karti thi, aur wo hotspot pe hi hota hai jahan sabse zyada pollution hoga, wahi toh aap safai karenge (AQI is a kind of measurement that can be detected using any instrument.So watering is the only solution for it. That’s what we are doing — just as previous governments did — and it is done only at the hotspots, where pollution is highest. That’s exactly where you would carry out cleaning.),” she said at a media event.The exchange comes at a time when Delhi continues to battle hazardous air. On Tuesday morning, the city woke up to a layer of smog that reduced visibility across several areas. The AQI stood at 292 at 8 am, falling into the ‘poor’ category. Key locations also recorded worrying readings: 265 around India Gate, 294 at ITO, 282 at Alipur, 253 at Aya Nagar, and 291 at Burari. In Akshardham, Ghazipur and Anand Vihar, the AQI touched 319, categorised as ‘very poor’.The worsening air comes despite ongoing government measures. The Delhi government has formed an Expert Group on Air Pollution Mitigation to advise on long-term strategies and emerging technologies. Headed by retired IAS officer Leena Nandan, the panel includes senior scientists, former CPCB officials, IIT professors and representatives from CAQM and IMD. It will meet monthly and offer sector-specific recommendations, covering transport, industry, waste burning and construction.Rekha Gupta has separately emphasised mist spray technology as a key intervention, saying trials at ITO and other NDMC areas have “shown positive results”. She said 305 mist sprayers are being installed at nine hotspots, alongside measures such as filling potholes, improving road surfaces and encouraging residents to report civic issues to prevent dust and waste-related pollution.",Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal targeted Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta over her remarks on air pollution.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday extended greetings to former Congress president Sonia Gandhi on her 79th birthday.“Birthday greetings to Smt. Sonia Gandhi Ji. May she be blessed with a long life and good health,” PM Modi wrote on X.The Congress hailed her “visionary” leadership, crediting her with “transforming” the country through several landmark rights-based laws — a reference to her tenure as chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), the Congress-led coalition that governed India from 2004 to 2014.""Laws like MGNREGA, Right to Education, Right to Information, and the National Food Security Act gave millions jobs, hope, education, voice, and dignity. Her lifelong commitment to women’s empowerment, social justice, and inclusive growth continues to uplift millions all across the country. Her grit and dedication inspire us every day,"" the party said.Sonia Gandhi led the Congress from 1998 to 2017, making her the longest-serving president in the party’s history. She later returned as interim chief from 2019 to 2022. In June 2024, she was re-elected as president of the Congress Parliamentary Party.Her son, Rahul Gandhi — also a former Congress president — is the current Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, where he represents Uttar Pradesh’s Raebareli constituency, a seat she held from 2004 to 2024 before moving to the Rajya Sabha.Her daughter, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, is a Congress general secretary and the MP from Kerala’s Wayanad seat.","PM Narendra Modi extended greetings to former Congress president Sonia Gandhi on her 79th birthday.

The Truth Behind Curtailed Vande Mataram : Politics, Unity And A Century Of Cultural Tension

Modi: Nehru compromised instead of taking on Jinnah

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Monday accused Congress of betraying ‘ Vande Mataram ’ and bowing to pressure from Mohammed Ali Jinnah to “divide” it despite Mahatma Gandhi’s praise that the patriotic song had become like a national anthem , saying the party meted out the “grave injustice” due to its appeasement politics.Initiating a discussion in Lok Sabha on the national song’s 150th anniversary, Modi traced its evolution to becoming a rallying cry for patriots and unifying spirit against the British rule, including in the popular agitation against Bengal’s division in 1905.He said Gandhi, who then practised law in South Africa, had recognised its immense appeal in Bengal. Quoting Gandhi’s statements on the song in a weekly, Indian Opinion, in 1905, Modi said: “it is so popular that (it is almost) as if it has become our national anthem. Its sentiments are great, and it is sweeter than anthems of other nations. Its sole motive is to ignite the patriotic spirit in us. It sees India as mother and worships her”.If it was such a great song, then why was it betrayed in the last century?” asked PM Narendra Modi before taking aim at first PM Jawaharlal Nehru. “Which were the forces whose wishes prevailed on the sentiments of revered Bapu? A sacred song like ‘Vande Mataram’ was dragged into controversy,” he said, in reference to Congress’s decision in 1937 to confine its recital to the first two paras.The current generation must know the reasons behind the betrayal of a song which had frightened the British so much that they banned it and repressed those who chanted it as a nationalist slogan. He also took a swipe at Trinamool Congress, saying parties having Congress in their name keep raising controversy around the song, which often draws criticism from a section of Muslims for its vivid Hindu themes, including invocation of deities. Modi appeared to be responding to critics, who have found the song’s imagery of nation as agoddess objectionable, with a strong articulation of cultural nationalism, a foundational guide to the Sangh Parivar, as he noted that even the Vedas have visualised India as a mother.Modi’s over 55-minute speech was heard without any serious disruption, and he made a concession to TMC MP Saugata Roy when the latter rose to object to his use of ‘da’ and not the more respectful ‘babu’ after the songwriter Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s first name, thanking him for the suggestion. Modi used the suffix “babu” for Bankim from that point onwards.With the song’s association with Bengali icons like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and Rabindra Nath Tagore, who set it to music, BJP hopes to deepen its connect with the people of West Bengal, which goes to the polls in a few months, as it takes on CM Mamata Banerjee-headed Trinamool which has often championed its regional identity to corner its main rival.Modi said when Jinnah protested on Oct 15, 1937, against the song, which was sung in Congress sessions, Nehru, as the president of his party, felt insecure and “agreed” with the Muslim League leader’s criticism by writing to Subhas Chandra Bose that its Anandmath background may irritate and provoke Muslims. Nehru compromised instead of taking on Jinnah and the Congress, at its Kolkata session on Oct 26 pruned the song to its first two paras, he said, hammering home the irony of that conclave being organised in Chatterjee’s state.He added, “History is witness that Congress bowed down to Muslim League. Due to its appeasement politics, Congress bent to divide Vande Mataram, and that is why it had to bow down to the division of India later.”With the national song a fixture at BJP events, Modi said his party owed a debt to Vande Mataram that it needed to repay by ensuring it got its due.",PM Narendra Modi accused Congress of betraying ‘ Vande Mataram ’ and bowing to pressure from Mohammed Ali Jinnah to “divide” it.

"Can't hear out holders before declaring a/cs fraud: RBI, SBI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-hear-out-holders-before-declaring-a/cs-fraud-rbi-sbi/articleshow/125855230.cms,"RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

NEW DELHI: Banking regulator RBI and the country's largest PSU bank SBI Monday told Supreme Court it was not possible to give personal hearings to account holders before declaring an account fraud in view of the massive number of banking frauds.The country witnessed 60,000 cases of bank fraud in the last two financial years involving Rs 48,244 crore, the financial institutions said.Responding to query of a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan on why personal hearings cannot be given before declaring an account fraud which is part of natural justice, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for SBI, said the number of bank frauds had been alarming in recent years and any personal or oral hearing would derail the entire process of declaring an account fraud.He said the number of bank frauds was 23,953 in FY 2024-25 and 36,060 in FY 2023-24. The amount involved was Rs 36,014 crore in 2024-25, which was a 194% jump from Rs 12,230 crore in the previous year. Mehta said no bank gives personal hearings as it may defeat the very purpose of declaring the account to be a fraud. He argued that banks may have to encounter situations by which it would not be possible to afford oral hearing or personal hearing to the parties concerned.RBI also told the bench it had not issued any circular for making personal hearings mandatory in declaring an account fraud. The lawyer appearing for RBI said operationally it would not be feasible to do so, and if it is made mandatory, then bankers would have to spend more time on granting personal hearings than doing banking operations. He said RBI left it to the wisdom of banks to take a call, and everything cannot be micromanaged by the regulator. The bench, however, said there may be situations where personal hearing should be given for which there are no guidelines.In 2023, SC held that the principles of natural justice demand that borrowers must be served a notice and given an opportunity to explain the conclusions of the forensic audit report before their account is classified as fraud under the Master Directions on Frauds. In addition, the decision classifying the borrower's account as fraudulent must be made by a reasoned order. After the verdict, the controversy arose whether personal hearings needed to be given or written response filed by account holder was enough before declaring an fraudulent account.","The country witnessed 60,000 cases of bank fraud in the last two financial years involving Rs 48,244 crore.

SC had began its journey as a protector of environment in a petition filed by retired forest officer T N Godavarman Thirumalpad in 1995 seeking protection of the Nilgiri forests from illegal felling of trees, and in the span of three decades, it has protected northeastern forests, Kashmir Khair trees, Aravalli hills, Western Ghats, Saranda forest, sanctuaries and stopped illegal stone quarries and mining.On Monday, the case related to the protection of Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh triggered the rethink on the part of SC. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi castigated the Haryana and Punjab govts for being in collusion with real estate agents to allow rapid urbanisation around the water body to throttle its catchment area.However, it said Punjab and Haryana HC, which is just 500 metres from the lake, would be better placed to gauge the local situation and pass appropriate orders. It asked amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, and representative of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to identify localised issues raised in a large number of petitions pending before the green bench.The cases involving local issues should be dealt with by HCs concerned, the bench said, adding, ""We cannot sit here in Delhi and usurp the jurisdiction and wisdom of HCs, which are in a better position to handle the issues raised.Moreover, local environmentalists may not always be able to travel to Delhi to present the views of the local population. HCs would be in a much better position to consider views of local people. ""Petitioner Thirumalpad passed away on June 1, 2016, at the age of 86. In his 1995 petition, he had moved SC being distressed by the systematic destruction of pristine forests in Gudalur in the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu. On Dec 12, 1996, a bench led by then CJI J S Verma passed an interim order stopping felling of trees and all non-forest activities across the country.Senior advocate Harish Salve was appointed amicus curiae. SC, thereafter, banned movement of timber from northeast, and several orders followed as the top court kept an eagle eye on forests through continuous mandamus.","SC had began its journey as a protector of environment in a petition filed by retired forest officer T N Godavarman Thirumalpad in 1995.

Not about AI, but

fabrication of case laws

: Senior advocate

NEW DELHI: In the first instance of misuse of artificial intelligence in the judicial process - detected in Supreme Court - a litigant took the help of AI tools to draft a response that contained hundreds of fake cases. Taking cognisance of the matter, SC said it could not brush it aside but would hear the case on merit.Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul said a rejoinder filed in the court cited many cases which are all fake and not part of any judicial record. He alleged that some of these cases were correctly mentioned but the questions of law, which were decided in these cases, were misreported. Senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for Gstaad Hotels Bengaluru promoter Deepak Raheja, admitted it was a mistake, saying, ""I have never been more embarrassed. ""Sundaram read out an affidavit filed by the filing advocate in the case.Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for Omkara Asset Reconstruction, said the rejoinder submitted by Gstaad Hotels Bengaluru promoter Deepak Raheja was prepared using AI tools and fabricated cases were cited to convince the court in his favour.Kaul submitted that the erring party was not entitled to be heard after the grave mistake. ""Fake case laws were invented using AI tools and questions of laws, which were decided by the court, were fabricated by using AI. It is not about AI, but fabrication of case laws and concoction of points of law,"" he said. It would be difficult for a bench to detect falsehood as it is supposed to hear 70-80 cases, and if the court relies on the AI-generated falsehood, then it would be disastrous for the judicial system, he added.Sundaram said that he was in complete agreement with Kaul on this issue and told the bench that it was a terrible error committed in court.Reading out the affidavit - filed by the advocate-on-record (AoR), who is responsible for filing any document in SC - Sundaram said the lawyer tendered unconditional apology and assured SC that he would be cautious in future not to repeat the mistake. He sought permission to withdraw the response. ""We cannot simply brush it aside,"" the court said, and asked why the AoR should take the blame as the response said very clearly that the affidavit was drafted under the guidance of the litigant. SC, thereafter, went ahead hearing the case on merit.The controversy revolves around a high-profile case between Omkara Assets Reconstruction Private Limited and Gstaad Hotels Private Limited. The case went to SC following the hearing in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).","Supreme Court encountered its first AI misuse case where a litigant submitted a response with hundreds of fabricated legal precedents.

No calls and emails after office hours: Right to Disconnect Bill introduced in Lok Sabha to set workplace boundaries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/no-calls-and-emails-after-office-hours-right-to-disconnect-bill-introduced-in-lok-sabha-to-set-workplace-boundaries/articleshow/125806984.cms,"What the Right to Disconnect Bill proposes





Winter Session Of Parliament: Bills On Atomic Energy, Excise On Agenda; Oppn Gears Up For SIR

Why the Bill argues boundaries are necessary





Rules for overtime and digital responsibility





Two other proposals introduced by Sule





What private member’s bills can signal





(with inputs from Agencies)

The debate over work-life balance in India moved into Parliament on Friday when Lok Sabha Member of Parliament Supriya Sule introduced a private member’s proposal that seeks to give employees the legal right to disconnect from work after official hours. The “Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025” aims to create clear and enforceable boundaries between professional demands and personal time, as digital communication, constant connectivity, and remote work have increasingly blurred the two.At the core of the Bill is a simple idea. Employees should not be obligated to answer calls, emails or messages outside designated work hours and on holidays, regardless of the nature or urgency of the communication. The proposal also outlines penalties for employers who do not comply, with a suggested sanction of 1% of the total remuneration of the organisation’s employees for violations, ensuring stronger accountability and clearer protection for workers.The Bill contends that constant availability has become a structural feature of the modern workplace. Sule says that digital tools allow flexibility but have also produced a culture where workers feel pressure to check emails or respond to messages late into the evening. The accompanying statement cites research linking such practices to sleep deprivation, emotional exhaustion and a form of cognitive overload described as “telepressure” or “info-obesity”.The legislation positions the right to disconnect as a measure to protect personal space and mental health. However, it acknowledges the varied needs of companies and leaves room for negotiation between employers and employees. It allows organisations to set specific terms of service that suit their work models while requiring transparency and consent.If employees choose to work outside official hours, the Bill states that overtime pay at the standard wage rate should apply. This is intended to curb the rise in unpaid overtime that has grown with digital transformation.The draft law also proposes the creation of an employees’ welfare authority responsible for promoting the right to disconnect. Additional provisions include counselling services to increase awareness of reasonable technology use and the establishment of digital detox centres to help workers reduce distractions and focus on personal relationships.Sule introduced two additional private member’s proposals in the House. The first is the Paternity and Paternal Benefits Bill, 2025, which seeks to introduce paid paternal leave and support shared caregiving during early childhood. The second is an amendment to the Code on Social Security intended to classify platform-based gig workers as a distinct group with rights relating to minimum wages, regulated hours, social security and fair contracts.Private member’s bills rarely become law. They allow members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to flag issues on which they believe legislation is needed. Most are withdrawn after the government responds. The Right to Disconnect Bill, however, draws attention to a shift already underway in many workplaces as employees and employers reconsider how digital communication should be used and what limits are necessary to maintain a sustainable working life.Whether the proposal progresses or not, the questions it raises are likely to remain in public debate. The issue is not only about calls and emails. It concerns how technology has altered the basic terms of employment and how workers maintain the ability to step away once the working day ends.","Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, aims to create clear and enforceable boundaries between professional demands and personal time.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir is under increasing scrutiny after consecutive home Test series defeats, despite enjoying early success with India’s Champions Trophy and Asia Cup wins since taking charge in July last year. The team’s struggles in red-ball cricket — including a 3-0 loss to New Zealand followed by a 2-0 defeat against South Africa — have raised alarms, especially as India have been whitewashed in a home Test series only three times in history, with two of those coming during Gambhir’s stint.However, former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes criticism should not be directed at just one individual. Speaking on Prabhat Khabar’s YouTube podcast, he urged a broader view of accountability.""So when results come, one thing the public should remember is that players should also take responsibility. It should not be that you target one individual. It has happened to me, that is why I am speaking from experience. So it is important that the players also take the rap on the knuckles when something like this happens. There should be pride. They should feel hurt that we have lost. Until that happens, things will not move forward,"" he said.""Har match jitna hai. Nahi jitega to bandook tumhari taraf. Agar ye mere saath hota to mai pehle responsibility leta. Wo pride hona chaiye. Hurt hona chaiye ki hum haare hain. Pressure sabko aata hai. Jhelna padta hai. Cricket is 90 percent here in the mind [We have to win every match. If we don’t win, the gun will point at you. If this had happened with me, I would have taken responsibility first. There should be pride. You should feel hurt that we have lost. Everyone feels pressure. You have to deal with it. Cricket is 90 percent here — in the mind],"" Shastri said.Shastri also highlighted the importance of leadership qualities beyond tactics.""If your performance is poor, you could be fired. Therefore, you need to maintain patience. Communication and man-management skills are crucial here. Only then can you motivate the players to win. And that's what we did. The most important thing is to enjoy whatever you do. Don't take it as pressure,"" he explained.Drawing from his time overseeing India’s dominant Test period between 2014 and 2021, Shastri stressed that defeats should be viewed collectively.Watch the video here ""Everyone, right from the team management to the players, you can't single out one person. It's a collective decision. South Africa defeated India; no single player defeated India. South Africa played well as a team. Where did we play?"" he questioned.While he avoided directly criticising Gambhir, Shastri reiterated shared accountability for the recent slump.India’s first-ever home Test whitewash took place in 1999–2000, also against South Africa — a reminder of how rare such setbacks have been.",India head coach Gautam Gambhir is under increasing scrutiny after consecutive home Test series defeats. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes criticism should not be directed at just one individual.

Owner still absconding

Saurabh Luthra

NEW DELHI: Police on Monday detained another manager linked to the tragic Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire in Goa that claimed 25 lives.The accused was identified as Bharat. According to police, he used to run daily operation of Birch by Romeo Lane at the club.The owner of Birch by Romeo Lane, Saurabh Luthra, remains absconding following the devastating fire at his Arpora nightclub on Saturday night, which claimed 25 lives and injured six others.Until last year, Luthra had aimed to launch 50 restaurants across India, but his weekend property turned into the site of one of Goa’s worst nightlife tragedies.Luthra’s LinkedIn profile lists him as ‘Chairman at Romeo Lane, Birch and Mama’s Buoi’. Activist Tahir Noronha described him as “like a ghost,” saying he rarely stays in Goa and often avoids legal proceedings, sending representatives in his place.“He is out of touch with the impact of his ventures,” Noronha said. Socialites and staff also described him as aloof; Jayesh Diukar, a kitchen staffer who survived the fire, said Luthra visited the club only once a month and rarely interacted with employees.At least 100-200 persons were on the dance floor of a nightclub in North Goa when a fire broke out there, and in an attempt to escape, some of them ran downstairs to its kitchen where they got trapped along with the staff.While the state police said the blaze occurred at the nightclub due to a cylinder blast after midnight on Sunday, some of the eyewitnesses claimed the fire started on the club's first floor, where tourists were dancing.Most of the dead were the club's kitchen workers, and included three women, chief minister Pramod Sawant said. There were “three to four tourists” among those killed, he added.""There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting. We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,"" Fatima Shaikh, a tourist from Hyderabad, told PTI at Arpora in the wee hours of Sunday.","The owner of Birch by Romeo Lane, Saurabh Luthra, remains absconding following the devastating fire at his Arpora nightclub on Saturday night.

GOA: Another harrowing video has emerged from Goa showing the moment a fire broke out at a popular nightclub, capturing guests fleeing for their lives.The blaze occurred late on Saturday at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora during a belly-dance performance.In the footage, flames can be seen spreading rapidly across the first-floor dance area, sending people scrambling in panic.Smoke quickly filled the club, forcing some guests to flee to the basement kitchen, where 23 victims suffocated. Two others were later found on a staircase.Around 150 people were present in the DJ and dance area at the time. Initial investigations suggest the fire was triggered by electric firecrackers striking the wooden ceiling, rather than a gas cylinder, which had been speculated earlier.The victims included 20 staff members from various Indian states and Nepal, and five tourists.The club, situated on a salt pan with a single narrow access lane, had inadequate fire safety measures, which delayed rescue efforts. Authorities said it was operating without proper licences and violated building norms.Following the incident, four club staff members were arrested, and the owners, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, have been named in an FIR for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A police team has been dispatched to Delhi to serve arrest warrants.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of ₹2 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured. The state government has also sealed another club owned by the Luthras for inadequate safety measure",The blaze occurred late on Saturday at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora during a belly-dance performance.

World's nuclear arsenal

In an era where global powers are flexing their nuclear muscles and dormant arsenals hum with renewed urgency, India stands at a perilous crossroads: should it reignite the fire of nuclear testing to assert its strategic sovereignty, or maintain the delicate restraint that has balanced diplomacy and deterrence for decades?The shadow of India's 1998 Pokhran-II tests still lingers, marked by geopolitical reverberations and economic sanctions. Yet today, with US President Donald Trump publicly accusing rival states like Pakistan and China of clandestine nuclear tests, India faces a high-stakes dilemma.India's nuclear journey began with its first nuclear test, code-named 'Smiling Buddha', in 1974, which stunned the world with a bold demonstration of atomic capability.However, there was then a long gap of 24 years before India conducted its next round of tests, the definitive Pokhran-II in 1998.Now, 27 years after that landmark moment, the clock ticks again — prompting a crucial question: Is it time for India to conduct another series of nuclear tests to secure its place amid a shifting geopolitical order? The answer may shape not just India's nuclear strategy, but the future stability of South Asia and its global standing.Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington, said that a resumption of US atomic tests would ""open the door for states with less nuclear testing experience to conduct full-scale tests that could help them perfect smaller, lighter warhead designs"".Joseph Rodgers, fellow at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said that states such as China or India stand to profit from a resumption of nuclear tests.“It makes more sense for them to test” than it does for the US or Russia, the two states that have conducted most atomic tests to date, Rodgers said.Ahead of his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping in South Korea on October 29–30, 2025, Trump posted on social media that, because other countries were conducting nuclear tests, he had instructed the US military to begin testing nuclear weapons again on ""an equal basis"" with those nations, and that this process would ""commence immediately"".Trump's comments were interpreted by many as a sign the US was preparing to restart full-scale nuclear blasts for the first time since 1992.In an interview with 60 Minutes on CBS, Trump reiterated his position. ""I am saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes,"" Trump said when asked by if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years.""Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,"" he added. ""I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,"" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.Just days after Trump's remark, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that America is not planning to conduct nuclear explosions.""These are not nuclear explosions,"" Wright told Fox News on Sunday. ""These are what we call sub-critical explosions."" But Wright, whose agency oversees testing, said people living in the Nevada desert should have ""no worries"" about seeing a mushroom cloud.""Americans near historic test sites such as the Nevada National Security Site have no cause for concern,"" Wright said. ""So we're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry, and they set up the nuclear explosion.""Sub-critical nuclear testing refers to experiments that involve nuclear materials like plutonium but use less than the amount necessary to start a chain reaction that would cause a nuclear explosion.No nuclear explosion occurs because the test does not achieve ""criticality,"" the point at which a self-sustaining nuclear reaction happens.These tests involve compressing or shocking small amounts of fissile material with high explosives to study how the material behaves under extreme conditions.Subcritical tests help scientists validate computer models and ensure the safety, security, and reliability of nuclear weapons without performing full nuclear detonations.They are usually done underground to contain any radioactive byproducts and prevent a nuclear blast.Countries like the US, Russia, and China use subcritical tests to maintain their nuclear stockpiles under international test bans like the CTBT.Thus, subcritical tests are a way to ""test"" the components of nuclear weapons at a small, safe scale without violating nuclear test bans or triggering nuclear explosions.Sub-critical nuclear tests are generally very low-yield and do not produce a nuclear explosion, so they release minimal energy and radiation. Because of this, subcritical tests are often difficult or impossible to detect by international monitoring systems like the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) International Monitoring System (IMS).The IMS uses seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide stations to detect nuclear explosions worldwide. While it can detect all full-scale nuclear tests, the very low yield of subcritical tests—often below a threshold of about 1 kiloton equivalent—means they usually do not produce detectable seismic or atmospheric signatures. Radionuclide detectors also rely on gases released during an explosion, which do not occur in subcritical tests.Sub-critical tests are mostly not picked up by the IMS or satellite monitoring, making them effectively clandestine from the perspective of existing international nuclear test detection systems unless detected through other intelligence sources or on-site inspections after the CTBT enters into force.If India were to conduct a nuclear test today, it would reflect significantly evolved scientific, strategic, and geopolitical conditions compared to the 1998 Pokhran-II tests.The characteristics of a modern Indian nuclear test would likely include:The 123 Agreement, formally called the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement, is a bilateral pact signed in 2008 that allows civil nuclear trade and cooperation between India and the United States.It was a landmark deal that ended decades of nuclear isolation for India, enabling it to engage in global nuclear commerce despite not being a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The agreement requires India to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities, with civilian reactors subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards while retaining control of its nuclear weapons program.The 123 Agreement facilitates technology transfer, fuel supply, and nuclear commerce, strengthening India’s civilian nuclear energy capabilities and strategic partnership with the US.Per Article 14 of the 123 Agreement, should India conduct a nuclear test explosion, the United States holds the right to immediately terminate all nuclear cooperation. This has significant ramifications for India’s civilian nuclear energy expansion plans and international standing. Past statements by US policymakers, including former US president Barack Obama, emphasized pushing for India’s eventual ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as part of broader nonproliferation goals.The 123 Agreement between India and the United States does not explicitly mention subcritical nuclear testing.The agreement is primarily focused on prohibiting ""nuclear explosive devices"" testing and maintaining a moratorium on nuclear testing as a condition for continued civil nuclear cooperation.Subcritical tests, which do not involve a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction or an actual nuclear explosion, typically fall outside the scope of what is conventionally defined as nuclear explosive testing.This nuance means subcritical tests are not explicitly banned under the 123 Agreement’s terms related to nuclear testing moratoriums.However, any full nuclear explosive test would constitute a breach, prompting the US to have the right to terminate cooperation and possibly impose sanctions.At present there are 9 countries (Russia, US, China, France, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea) that possess nuclear weapons.These countries have roughly 12,331 nuclear warheads, with over 9,600 in active military stockpiles, according to the Federation of Atomic Scientists' 2025 Status of the Worlds Nuclear Forces.While this is a significant decline from the approximately 70,000 warheads owned by the nuclear-armed states during the Cold War, nuclear arsenals are expected to grow over the coming decade.Russia has the most confirmed nuclear weapons, with nearly 5,500 nuclear warheads. The US follows behind with 5,177 nuclear weapons. Total nuclear warheads owned by these 2 countries alone counts for nearly 90% of nuclear weapons in the world.Over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests have been carried out since 1945.The first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT.The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the Tsar Bomba of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen, an estimated 50–58 megatons.","India's nuclear journey began with its first nuclear test, code-named 'Smiling Buddha', in 1974. It took 24 years before India conducted its next round of tests, the definitive Pokhran-II in 1998. Now, 27 years after that landmark moment, the clock ticks again.

Vande Mataram debate: Priyanka Gandhi's 'chronology' jab at Centre; questions PM Modi's 'selective' history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-matram-debate-priyanka-gandhis-chronology-jab-at-centre-questions-pm-modis-selective-history/articleshow/125833088.cms,"'Only 2 Reasons': Priyanka Gandhi Slams PM Modi, Links Vande Mataram Debate To Bengal Polls

NEW DLEHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha, alleging that his recent speech during the Vande Mataram anniversary debate lacked ‘facts’ and historical details. While acknowledging the PM’s oratory, she said he “falls weak on the facts,” and went on to take a ""chronology"" jab at the government, describing how Vande Matram was introduced as the national song.Vadra questioned why the PM did not mention that “in 1896 Rabindranath Tagore sang Vande Mataram for the first time at a Congress convention,” asking, “was it Hindu Mahasabha, was it RSS, what were you attempting to hide that it was a Congress convention?”Recounting the song’s origins, she said Bankim Chattopadhyay wrote the first two stanzas in 1875, followed by the publication of Anandamath in 1882, which included additional stanzas. She noted that Vande Mataram emerged as a symbol of unity during the 1905 anti-partition movement of Bengal, when “stalwart freedom fighters like Rabindranath Tagore hit the street singing the songs.”""Soon, people from all walks of life started singing. Understand the power of this song - Britishers used to dread the song, our bravehearts used to find strength after listening to the song to fight the Raj.The song invokes the feeling of dying for the motherland - this is the real power of this song,"" she said.Also read: 'Only two reasons' - Priyanka Gandhi targets government over Vande Matram debate; brings in 'Bengal election' Vadra argued that the song became politicised in the 1930s amid rising communal divides. She then criticised the PM for selectively quoting correspondence between Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru.She said that ahead of the 1937 Congress convention in Kolkata, Bose wrote to Nehru on October 17, stating, “We shall have a talk in Calcutta, and also discuss the question in the working committee if you bring it up there. I have written to Dr Tagore to discuss the matter with you when you visit Shanti Niketan.”According to her, Nehru’s reply on October 20 included more than the line read by the PM. She quoted Nehru as saying, “There is no doubt that the present outcry against Vande Mataram is to a large extent manufactured by the communalists… whatever we do, we can’t pander to communalist feelings.”Vadra added that after Tagore met Nehru, Tagore wrote that he supported separating the first two stanzas, noting their deep significance and warning that the later additions “can be misconstrued as communal.”She said that on October 28, the Congress Working Committee, with Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Sardar Patel and Tagore present, declared the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram as the national song.She went on to say, “When in 1950, Dr Rajendra Prasad in constituent assembly announced the song as our national song almost all of these leaders were present and along with them was Dr Ambedkar and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee but no one had an issue with it.”She accused the ruling dispensation of revealing an anti-constitution mindset by questioning Vande Matram’s current form.“Questioning the current form of Vande Matram isn’t just insulting to all those stalwarts who in their great wisdom took this decision but it also reveals an anti-constitutional mentality. Are the treasury benches so arrogant to think of themselves as bigger than Gandhi, Tagore, Maulana Azad, Neta ji Bose, Rajendra Prasad?” she said.She went on to add, “The PM's statement that the national song was cut by an anti-national ideology is an insult to all those great leaders, those who devoted their entire lives to the freedom struggle. By accusing them of dividing Vande Matram you’re accusing the entire constituent assembly. This is a direct attack on our constituent assembly and our constitution.”Vadra later defended Nehru and recounted his contribution to the state, asserting if he would not have laid the foundation of multiple institutions like IITs and AIIMS, how would we have become Vikshit Bharat.“Insofar Jawaharlal Nehru is considered, for as long the PM Modi has been the Prime Minister, that’s 12-years, Nehru spent that much time in jail for what? For the independence of the country, and after that 17-years as the country's PM. You criticise him but if he wouldn’t have established ISRO your Mangalyan wouldn’t be there, if there was no DRDO your Tejas wouldn’t exist, if he wouldn’t have established IITs and IIM’s, then would not have led in IT…if he wouldn’t have established the institutions which you’re selling today, so would this Viksit Bharat exist? Pandit Nehru lived for the country and died serving this nation. ”Earlier in the day opening the debate on Vande Matram PM Modi told the Lok Sabha that “Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru wrote a letter to Subhash Chandra Bose after Jinnah’s opposition to Vande Mataram, stating that he had read the background of Vande Mataram and thought it might provoke and irritate Muslims. He added that they would examine the use of Vande Mataram, and that too in Bankim Chandra’s Bengal.”Setting the debate in the context of what he described as the Congress’ past compromises with the Muslim League, the Prime Minister argued that the party had weakened the song’s legacy and “fragmented” it, undermining the sentiments of the freedom movement.He said the decisive moment came on October 26 that year. “The Vande Mataram song was sung. But it is the misfortune of the country that on October 26, the Congress compromised on Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram ke tukde kardiye. That decision was a failure, a betrayal,” he said, adding that the Congress “bowed to the Muslim League and decided to fragment Vande Mataram.”","Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha.

Da or Babu?

NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Roy on Monday interrupted Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his address on Vande Mataram in the Lok Sabha over the choice of words he used to refer to the composer of the national song, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.During his speech, the Prime Minister, on one occasion, referred to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee as “Bankim Da.” Roy immediately objected to the remark and said that PM Modi should use “Bankim Babu” instead.PM Modi quickly corrected himself and said, “I will say Bankim Babu. Thank you, I respect your sentiments.”“Can I call you dada, or is that also an issue?” he added.In the Bengali language, “Da” is the short form of “dada,” meaning elder brother. It is also used informally for someone older in a friendly way.On the other hand, “Babu” is a more formal and respectable suffix used for educated, respected gentlemen. At times, it is also used sarcastically to refer to the Bhadralok Bengalis who adapted to British culture.In the 10-hour discussion on Vande Mataram in Parliament, PM Modi recounted how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.“When they divided Bengal in 1905, Vande Mataram stood like a rock,” he said, adding that “Vande Mataram also showed India the path to self-reliance. Back then, from matchboxes to large ships, ‘Vande Mataram’ was written as a tradition. It became a means to challenge foreign companies and emerged as a slogan of the Swadeshi movement.”He described the song as something far deeper than a political chant. “Vande Mataram was not just a mantra for political independence. It was not limited to our independence; it was way beyond that. The freedom movement was a war to free our motherland from the clutches of slavery... During our Vedas, it was said: This land is my mother, and I am the son of the soil.”PM Modi also invoked Mahatma Gandhi, telling the House, “In the weekly Indian Opinion on 2 December 1905, Mahatma Gandhi wrote that the song Vande Mataram, composed by Bankim Chandra, had become famous across Bengal... He wrote that this song was so popular it had become like our national anthem, carrying deeper emotions and more melody than the national songs of other countries.”The Prime Minister asked why the song suffered “injustice” in the last century. “Vande Mataram was so great, then why did injustice happen to it in the last century? Why was there betrayal with Vande Mataram? Which were those powers whose wishes overshadowed the emotions of Mahatma Gandhi?” he said, arguing that Congress’ compromises ultimately fed into the conditions that led to Partition. “Congress compromised on Vande Mataram and, as a result, had to accept the decision of the country’s Partition. ”PM Modi urged Parliament to treat the occasion as a moment of national reaffirmation. “Some great people of India dreamed of a free India, and today’s generation dreams of a prosperous India. The inspiration for both is Vande Mataram,” he said, adding that India must become “Aatmanirbhar and Viksit by 2047.”","All India Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Roy interrupted Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his address on Vande Mataram in the Lok Sabha.

Indigo crisis enters seventh day





NEW DELHI: The aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu vowed in Rajya Sabha on Monday that the government will take “very, very strict action” against Indigo over the recent fiasco to ""set an example"" across the industry.Speaking during question hour, Naidu said the disruption was a result of IndiGo’s internal lapses. Blaming the carrier for failing to manage its crew and duty roster, the minister said, “We are not taking this situation easily. We are doing an inquiry. We will take very, very strict action not only for this situation but also as an example.""Responding to a query from Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, who sought to know whether the cancellations stemmed from a malfunction in the automatic message switching system (AMSS) - the glitch that hit flight operations in early November 2025 - Naidu clarified that the two incidents were unrelated. The IndiGo crisis, he said, arose from “anomalies and mismanagement” in the airline’s crew roster system.The minister also outlined the timeline of the revised flight duty time limitations (FDTL), introduced after a high court order in April 2025. Of the 22 guidelines, 15 were implemented on July 1 and the remaining seven on November 1. He stressed that multiple consultations were held with all stakeholders, including IndiGo, and that the rules had to be followed “without any compromise on safety.”Naidu said the directorate general of civil aviation has been in continuous discussions with airlines since FDTL came fully into force, and had granted limited exemptions based on operational variations and safety assessments.Noting that the crisis erupted “almost one whole month” after the final phase of FDTL implementation, he pointed out that IndiGo did not flag any imminent issues during a meeting with the ministry on December 1.“This is a day-to-day operation - something that Indigo should have maintained. Indigo was supposed to manage the crew, roaster through its day-to-day operations,” he said.Reiterating that accountability is non-negotiable, Naidu added: “If there is any mis-compliance, non-compliance, non-adherence for any single person, entity and organisation, or any operator functioning in this civil aviation, we will take very, very strict action so that we set an example in the industry.”Indigo’s operational crisis entered into its seventh consecutive day of chaos on Monday. With more 500-large scale flight cancellations continuing across major airports.According to the civil aviation ministry, IndiGo is scheduled to operate 1,802 flights across 137 of its 138 destinations on Monday. The ministry also said the airline has already returned around 4,500 misplaced bags to passengers and aims to deliver the remaining 4,500 within the next 36 hours.Separately, the Supreme Court refused to entertain a petition seeking judicial intervention over the large-scale flight cancellations, noting that the matter did not warrant its involvement at this stage.(With inputs from agencies)","The aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu vowed in Rajya Sabha on Monday that the government will take “very, very strict action” against Indigo.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Monday issued a strong-worded message asked China to issue assurance to India after the recent harassment of an Arunachal Pradesh woman at Shanghai airport.The statement follows growing concerns over arbitrary checks and mistreatment of Indian passengers in transit, after reports emerged of an Arunachal Pradesh woman being harassed at Shanghai airport.Responding to the matter, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We expect the Chinese authorities to provide assurances that Indian citizens transiting through Chinese airports will not be selectively targeted, arbitrarily detained or harassed and that regulations governing international air travel would be respected by the Chinese side.""""We have stated many times that Arunachal Pradesh is and will remain an integral part of India, and we do not want any interference in it,"" Jaiswal added.On the China-India relationship, Jaiswal said, ""...This relationship is gradually moving in a positive direction, and we want to keep it moving in that direction.""The MEA also issued an advisory urging Indian nationals to be cautious. ""MEA would advise Indian nationals to exercise due discretion while travelling to China or transiting through the country,"" Jaiswal stated.Ministry of external affairs last month after the incident strongly protested China’s “arbitrary detention” of an Indian passport holder from Arunachal Pradesh at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, stating that no amount of political denial will alter the fact that the northeastern state is an “integral and inalienable” part of India.The ministry of external affairs said it issued a strong demarche to Beijing and its embassy in New Delhi after the woman, identified as Prema Wangjom Thongdok, was detained during transit despite being eligible for visa-free passage under Chinese regulations.“We want to say that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a fact that is self-evident. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.According to the MEA, the Indian national, holding a valid passport, was travelling onward to Japan when she was stopped at Shanghai airport. India said the detention lacked legal basis and breached norms of international travel.“This issue has been taken up strongly with the Chinese side. Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel,” Jaiswal said. He added that China’s actions contradicted its own policy for visa-free transit.The MEA warned that such incidents undermine diplomatic engagement between the two countries. “Arbitrary actions by China involving an Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh are most unhelpful towards efforts being made by both sides to build mutual trust and understanding and gradually move towards normalisation of bilateral relations,” Jaiswal noted.However, China has rejected India’s accusations. Responding to Beijing-based media, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that “the lawful rights and interests of the person concerned were fully protected and no compulsory measures were taken on her,” dismissing claims of detention or harassment.This response came despite the Indian citizen narrating her “long ordeal”, alleging that Chinese immigration officials “mocked and raised questions” about her Indian identity, with the situation resolved only after intervention by Indian missions in Shanghai and Beijing.",The statement follows growing concerns over arbitrary checks and mistreatment of Indian passengers in transit.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Monday took a swipe at Pakistan, saying India is closely tracking developments in the neighbouring country. He added that “democracy and Pakistan don’t go together,” as concerns deepen over the country’s weakening democratic institutions.""We keep a close eye on every development in Pakistan. But regarding democracy, you're saying that democracy in Pakistan is becoming weak and its strengths are being weakened. Democracy and Pakistan don't go together,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Jaiswal added that India is aware of reports of border clashes with Pakistan that killed several Afghan civilians and “strongly condemns attacks on innocent people,” reaffirming India’s support for Afghanistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.In connection to anti-terror discussions, Jaiswal also highlighted the 21st meeting of the India-US Counter-Terrorism Working Group, held on December 3. “Both sides attach high importance to counter-terrorism cooperation. It is an important element of our comprehensive global strategic partnership with the United States,” he said.He noted that the two countries strongly condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Pahalgam and Delhi, and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation against terrorism through platforms such as the UN, the Quad, the Financial Action Task Force, and other forums.""The two sides renewed their commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation in the fields of terrorism, including at the UN, within the format of Quad, as well as in the format of Financial Action Task Force and several other multilateral forums where we discuss and continue to discuss these aspects,"" Jaiswal added.At the meeting, India and the United States pressed for tougher UN actions against Pakistan-based terror groups, seeking additional punitive measures such as asset freezes and arms embargoes on Lashkar-e-Taiba , Jaish-e-Mohammad, their proxy outfits, and their backers.They also called for further designations of ISIS and al-Qaida affiliates under the UN sanctions regime. Although these groups are already listed and subject to existing restrictions, both sides stressed the need to broaden and intensify global pressure on them.During the talks, India thanked the US State Department for designating The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). The designation followed the group’s claim of responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack ""The two sides called for additional designations of ISIS and al-Qa'ida affiliates, and LeT and JeM and their proxy groups, supporters, sponsors, financiers and backers, under the UN 1267 sanctions regime, ensuring their members face a global asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo,"" the statement by MEA read.","The ministry of external affairs on Monday took a swipe at Pakistan, saying India is closely tracking developments in the neighbouring country. “democracy and Pakistan don’t go together,” as concerns deepen over the country’s weakening democratic institutions.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of using his speech during the Lok Sabha discussion on “Vande Mataram” to “rewrite history” and give a “political colour” to the debate.During the day-long discussion on 150 years of Vande Mataram , Congress deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi said the prime minister has a “habit” of bringing up Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress in almost every speech, irrespective of the issue.""It seemed that your political ancestors participated in various movements against the British.

The original song mentioned 7 crore, but in 1905, during the Banaras session, Sarla Dev Chaudhurani made it 30 crore and turned the focus of the entire country to Vande Mataram,"" Gogoi said.He noted that it was the Muslim League that had called for boycotting Vande Mataram. He recalled that “Congress’ Maulana Azad said, ‘I have no problems with Vande Mataram’. That was the difference between the Congress and Mohammad Ali Jinnah.”Despite pressure from the League, he said, the Congress decided at its 1937 session that the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram would be sung at national gatherings. He added that although both the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha opposed the move, the Congress chose to follow public sentiment rather than their diktat.The Lok Sabha on Monday opened a special discussion to mark 150 years of, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiating the debate and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh scheduled to conclude it.

NEW DELHI: A special discussion may have been held on 150 years of Vande Mataram on Monday, but the Bengal assembly elections - scheduled next year - took centre stage as slogans like ""Bihar ki jeet hamari hai, ab Bengal ki baari hai"" were raised by NDA MPs in the Parliament as Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered the House to initiate the debate.During the 10-hour discussion, while the ruling party invoked the Bengal partition and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's legacy, the opposition accused the ruling party of holding the special discussion for its poll prospects in West Bengal.While opening the discussion in Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister recalled how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.“When they divided Bengal in 1905, Vande Mataram stood like a rock,” he said, adding that “Vande Mataram also showed India the path to self-reliance.

It was not limited to our independence; it was way beyond that. The freedom movement was a war to free our motherland from the clutches of slavery... During our Vedas, it was said: This land is my mother, and I am the son of the soil.”During the discussion, PM Modi was also interrupted by TMC's Sugata Roy for referring Bankim Chandra Chaterjee as 'Bankim Da' and not 'Bankim Babu.'PM Modi quickly corrected himself and said, “I will say Bankim Babu. Thank you, I respect your sentiments.”“Can I call you dada, or is that also an issue?” he added.Meanwhile, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a broadside against the Bharatiya Janata Party and claimed that the only purpose of the special discussion on the national song was to serve the ruling party with poll prospects in the upcoming West Bengal assembly elections.During her address in the Lok Sabha, Priyanka said that there are two reasons for the debate on the national song in Parliament.“There are two reasons for the debate on Vande Mataram in the House today.

No matter how many elections we lose, we will sit here and keep fighting you and your ideology. We will keep fighting for our country. You cannot stop us,” she further said.Trinamool Congress's Kalyan Banerjee also said the way the Prime Minister addressed author Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay was very ""disturbing"".""The debate was started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is really, very sorry to say, it was below standard. The debate was for Vande Mataram, not for attacking Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi,"" he said.""The way he addressed the great author, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, it was really disturbing. Actually, not only Narendra Modi or (home minister) Amit Shah, BJP people are Bengali haters.""They hate them but under compulsion, one has to tolerate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, one has to tolerate the Bengalis' fight for freedom, one has to tolerate Rabindranath Tagore, because India has been enriched by Bengalis.

I cannot call the prime minister Narendra Modi da, my culture does not allow that...,"" Banerjee added.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also weighed in on the issue and questioned the BJP over its stance on not appreciating freedom fighters.Addressing a press conference in Kolkata, Banerjee said, ""I heard some people from the BJP say that they don't appreciate Netaji. You don't appreciate Netaji, Rabindranath Tagore, Raja Ram Mohan Roy — then who do you appreciate?""The West Bengal assembly election is due in March–April next year.

And the victory in Bihar, like the river, has paved the way for our victory in Bengal,"" PM Modi had said.Mamata Banerjee has been in power since 2011 after defeating the Communist government of multiple decades.The BJP managed to get 77 seats, its highest ever in the state, in the 2021 contest.","PM Modi recalls how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.

'Will Set An Example': IndiGo Faces Heat As Aviation Minister Promises Tough Action In Rajya Sabha

IndiGo outlines ‘preliminary factors’ behind disruption



NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Monday replied to the DGCA’s show-cause notice, saying it is “realistically not possible to pinpoint the exact cause(s)” immediately due to the complexity and scale of its operations. The response addressed the recent large-scale operational disruptions and flight cancellations across the airline’s network.The reply by the airline’s chief executive officer and chief operating officer, was submitted, with the airline requesting additional time to complete a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA).""The airline notes that the DGCA’s manual allows a fifteen-day response timeline for show-cause notices, suggesting more time is needed to conduct a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA). The complete RCA will be shared once finished,"" the statement read.In its submission, IndiGo expressed that it is “profusely apologetic” and deeply regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers. The airline attributed the disruptions to the “compounding effect of multiple factors,” which coincided in an “unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence.”The DGCA had earlier granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo respond to its showcause notice, setting the new deadline at 6 pm on Monday.The regulator warned that failure to meet the deadline would lead to the matter being decided ex-parte.The notice cited “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” as the primary reasons behind the airline’s large-scale operational failure.Preliminary factors cited by IndiGo included minor technical glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and challenges arising from the implementation of updated crew-rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitation Phase II). The airline added that it had been engaging with the DGCA regarding difficulties in implementing FDTL Phase II and had sought variations, exemptions, or extensions.IndiGo said the disruptions began in early December when these factors collectively affected crew availability and on-time network performance. To manage the situation, the airline carried out a network ""reboot” on 5 December, involving a large number of cancellations to recover stranded passengers, ease airport congestion, and reposition crew and aircraft. Services began normalizing from 6 December onwards.The airline also stated that it provided timely notifications and assistance to passengers, including meals, refreshments, hotels, and local transport, in line with DGCA requirements. Substantial refunds have reportedly been processed for most affected customers.The DGCA is currently examining IndiGo’s response and said that enforcement action, if deemed necessary, will be taken in due course.The current disruption is linked to the implementation of revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules for pilots, which impose longer weekly rest periods, stricter night duty limits, and reduced night landings.Initially opposed by domestic carriers including IndiGo and Air India, the rules were phased in during July and November following Delhi High Court directions. IndiGo has obtained temporary relaxations for the second phase of the norms until February 10.IndiGo’s operational crisis entered its seventh day on Monday, with over 500 flights cancelled across major airports, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across the country.",IndiGo on Monday replied to the DGCA’s show-cause notice.

Right to Disconnect Bill 2025: Supriya Sule moves legislation to promote work-life balance for employees after office hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supriya-sule-moves-bill-to-ensure-right-to-disconnect-after-office-hours/articleshow/125803345.cms,"Supriya Sule (ANI image)

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill in the Lower House to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.The Bill, ""The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025"", seeks to impose sanctions at a rate of 1 per cent of the total remuneration of its employees on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill.The Bill, as introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday, provides every employee the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications.""It aims to foster a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing the ""burnout caused by today's digital culture,"" she wrote on X.While digital and communication technology offer benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries a significant risk of eroding the boundaries between professional and personal life, she argued in the private member's Bill.""Studies have found that if an employee is expected to be available round the clock, they tend to exhibit risks of over-work like sleep deprivation, developing stress and being emotionally exhausted. This persistent urge to respond to calls and emails (termed as 'telepressure'), constant checking of emails throughout the day, and even on weekends and holidays, is reported to have destroyed the work-life balance of employees,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill read.""According to a study, the constant monitoring of work related messages and emails, may overtax employees' brains leading to a condition called 'info-obesity'.""The Bill argued that there is a need to respect the personal space of the employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employer's calls, emails etc., during out-of-work hours.""The need is also to recognise the rights of the employees, it also takes into consideration the competitive needs of the companies and their diverse work cultures. Flexibility in the right to disconnect rules and leaves it to the individual companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees is need of the hour,"" the Bill further read.The digital transformation has direct impact on conditions in the employment contract, like the time and the place of work.Hence if an employee agrees to works during out-of-work hours, overtime pay at the same rate as his wage rate is also necessary to check the surge in unpaid overtime work, brought about by digital transformation, she argued in the Bill.The Bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use.To free an employee from digital distractions and enable him to truly connect with the people around him, the Bill provides for digital detox centres.""The Bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect. The Bill seeks to recognise right to disconnect as a way to reduce stress and ease tension between an employees' personal and professional life,"" the Bill concluded.She introduced all together what she termed forward-looking Private Member Bills in the Parliament - the other two were The Paternity and Paternal Benefits Bill, 2025. It introduces paid paternal leave to ensure fathers have the legal right to take part in their child's early development. It breaks the traditional model, supports the new mother's well-being, and promotes flexible parenting.The other one is the Code on Social Security (Amendment) Bill, 2025, that recognises platform-based gig workers as a distinct category, ensuring minimum wages, regulated hours, social security, fair conditions, and equitable contracts to ensure a fairer, more sustainable environment and economy for them.Several other members of the Lok Sabha also introduced their Private Member Bills in the House.","Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.

The Battle Pakistan Lost To India Days Before 1971 War | I Witness

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war, underscoring how air power proved decisive in shaping the conflict’s outcome and paving the way for India’s victory and the creation of Bangladesh.In a post on X, the IAF recalled its strike on the Sakesar radar station, which crippled Pakistan’s key western air defences for two days.“On the third day of the 1971 war, the IAF was everywhere the enemy looked — and many places where they didn’t expect. Hunters tore through Drigh Road and Karachi, smashing storage hangars. Canberras kept up relentless pressure, delivering 1,44,000 lbs of ordnance across four major airfields,” the post said.The IAF added that 132 missions were flown on the western front, with An-12s and Canberras “raining devastation on enemy concentrations.” On the eastern front, with the Pakistan Air Force effectively grounded, 104 offensive sorties by the IAF cleared the way for the Indian Army’s rapid march into East Pakistan, ultimately leading to the birth of Bangladesh.It also recalled the legendary Battle of Longewala, fought from December 4 to 7, 1971, in Rajasthan’s Longewala sector, where heavily outnumbered Indian troops held their ground against a major Pakistani assault — a defence in which the IAF also played a crucial role.“Four Hunters rewrote history — shattering an enemy armoured thrust and leaving 27 tanks destroyed and 10 more damaged. Jaisalmer stood safe because air power arrived when it mattered,” the post highlighted.The 1971 India–Pakistan war began on December 3 with Pakistan launching pre-emptive strikes on Indian air bases amid the Bangladesh Liberation War in East Pakistan. The conflict ended on December 16 with Pakistan’s defeat, the surrender of 93,000 troops — the largest military capitulation since World War II — and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war.

Who is Saurabh Luthra ?







NEW DELHI: A packed nightclub in North Goa turned into a death trap after a massive fire broke out just after midnight on Sunday, killing 25 people and injuring six. The blaze ripped through Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, triggering panic among visitors and raising serious questions about illegal operations and safety violations.Police initially suspected a cylinder blast, but a tourist who survived claimed fireworks went off during a dance performance and were the likely cause. The deceased included four tourists and 14 staff members, while the identities of seven others were still being confirmed.Chief minister Pramod Sawant vowed strict action against officials who allowed the club to run despite safety violations, and police registered an FIR against the owners under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita.Police have registered an FIR against Saurabh Luthra and Gaurav Luthra, the owners of Birch by Romeo Lane, along with the nightclub’s manager and event organisers.

Current situation:

NEW DELHI: Under fire for its handling of the IndiGo crisis, govt said on Monday it would set an ""example"" for other airlines with ""very, very strict action"" against the budget carrier once the probe into the massive flight disruptions is complete. The unprecedented disruption was caused by an ""internal crisis"" in the airline, Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in the Rajya Sabha Monday.Also, with the duopoly situation - Air India Group and IndiGo - being blamed for making the bad situation even worse, Naidu said India needs more airlines. ""We have envisioned the demand to be growing at such a rate that we want to have more airlines in the picture... India today has the capacity of five big airlines. We are talking about two airlines, but the capacity, the demand that India is creating, we need to have five big airlines,"" he said, adding that this was ""the time to start an airline in India"". Naidu said govt wants ""more pillars"" in the industry to counter concentration and build resilience. ""There is so much growth that is happening. So let us all encourage more airlines to come into this industry along with govt,"" he said.""We are not taking this situation easily. We are conducting an inquiry... Revised flight duty time limitation (FDTL) was introduced after an April 2025 HC order. Of the 22 guidelines, 15 were implemented on July 1 and remaining seven on Nov 1. Multiple consultations were held with all stakeholders, including IndiGo, and rules had to be followed without any compromise on safety,"" Naidu said.The DGCA ""has been in continuous discussions with airlines since FDTL came fully into force, and had granted limited exemptions based on operational variations and safety assessments"", he said. The crisis erupted ""almost one whole month"" after the Nov 1 implementation and IndiGo did not flag any imminent issues during a meeting with the ministry on Dec 1. ""This is a day-to-day operation, something that IndiGo should have maintained. .. We care for pilots, crew and passengers. We made it clear to all the airlines. IndiGo was supposed to manage the crew and roster. Passengers faced a lot of difficulties. We are not taking the situation lightly.""IndiGo is fast returning to near normal, with the airline saying it expected to operate over 1,800 flights on Monday. ""We have optimised our operations and managed to reduce the number of cancellations which are being notified to customers in advance. Our on-time performance has improved to 91% across the network.""Rs 827 crore already refunded, and the rest is under process for cancellations up to Dec 15, 2025. Over 4,500 bags have been delivered to respective customers, and we are on track to deliver the rest in the next 36 hours,"" IndiGo said.The Union aviation ministry said about 5.9 lakh PNRs for travel between Dec 1 and 7 have been cancelled and refunds of about Rs 570 crore have been issued.","The disruption was caused by an ""internal crisis"" in the airline, Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in the Rajya Sabha.

NEW DELHI: In a rare decision aimed at facilitating the education of a minor girl, Supreme Court on Monday approved issuance of an SC certificate based on the 'Adi Dravida' caste of her mother, who is married to a non-SC person, even though it is yet to adjudicate a bunch of petitions challenging the norm that a child inherits their father's caste.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi refused to entertain a challenge to a Madras HC order directing grant of SC caste certificate to the Puducherry girl on the sole ground that her academic career may suffer without it.""We are keeping the question of law open,"" the bench said. However, what the CJI said next could lead to a big debate. He said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.The mother had requested the tahsildar to grant SC certificates to her three children - two daughters and a son - based on her caste certificate as her husband had stayed at her parents' house since their marriage. In her application, she had contended that her parents and grandparents belonged to Hindu Adi Dravida community.The presidential notifications of Mar 5, 1964, and Feb 17, 2002, read with instructions of the Union ministry of home affairs, say that a person's eligibility to get a caste certificate is primarily based on their father's caste as well as his residential status in the state or UT's jurisdiction.In Punit Rai Vs Dinesh Chaudhary [(2003) 8 SCC 204], a case relating to reservation, SC had said that the decisive factor for determination of caste of a person will be the caste of the father as per customary Hindu Law and that in the absence of statutory law, they would inherit their caste from the father and not the mother.In the 2012 judgment in 'Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika vs Gujarat', a two-judge bench of SC ruled, ""The determination of caste of a person born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in complete disregard of attending facts of the case."" It said, ""In an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, there may be a presumption the child has the caste of the father. This presumption may be stronger in the case where in the inter-caste marriage or a marriage between tribal and non-tribal, the husband belongs to a forward caste.""""But by no means is the presumption conclusive or irrebuttable, and it is open to the child of such marriage to lead evidence to show he/she was brought up by the mother who belonged to SC/ST. By virtue of being the son of a forward caste father, he did not have any advantageous start in life but on the contrary suffered the deprivations, indignities, humiliations and handicaps like any other member of the community to which his/her mother belonged. Additionally, he was always treated as a member of the community to which her mother belonged not only by that community but by people outside the community as well,"" it said.","CJI Surya Kant said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125853517,imgsize-1051879,width-400,resizemode-4/sc-had-earlier-held-fathers-caste-as-decisive-factor.jpg"

NEW DELHI: IndiGo may have its schedule cut by 5% and the same - roughly about 110 daily flights - could be given to other airlines that have the resources to add capacity. A livid government is mulling incremental cuts to the schedule starting with 5%, followed by another 5% in coming days if need be, say sources, adding that other actions are also being considered in the wake of the severe disruptions caused by flight cancellations.Meanwhile, a ""profusely apologetic"" IndiGo has in its reply to the DGCA's show-cause notice blamed a combination of five factors, including new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules and winter schedule-related changes, for its massive flight disruptions.The airline said given the scale of its operations, it is ""realistically not possible to pinpoint the exact cause(s)"" in the time given. It sought more time for a ""comprehensive root-cause analysis"", citing DGCA's manual that allows a 15-day response time.DGCA is in the process of examining the response and enforcement action as deemed appropriate will be taken in due course,"" the aviation ministry said regarding the responses submitted at 6.01pm Monday by CEO Pieter Elbers and COO Isidre Porqueras, who is also the accountable manager.Given the public anger at aviation authorities, it remains to be seen whether IndiGo will be granted more time. The DGCA could now scale down IndiGo's flights in proportion to its crew strength and make the slots available to other airlines depending on their resource availability.Apart from a hefty financial penalty, the top executives, who are approved by the DGCA, including the airline's accountable manager (the COO), may face action. The airline, too, may either seek resignations or sack key people seen as responsible for the huge mess.The airline has attributed the disruption to the ""compounding effect of multiple factors which coincided in lesser or greater measure"" in an ""unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence"".

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the treatment meted out to a resident of Arunachal Pradesh transiting through the Shanghai airport, India has sought assurances from Beijing that its citizens will not be selectively harassed.The govt had earlier registered strong protest with China for the detention of the Indian woman, reiterating its position that the north-eastern state is an integral and inalienable part of India and no amount of denial by China would change this reality.“We expect Chinese authorities to provide assurances that Indian citizens transiting through Chinese airports will not be selectively targeted, arbitrarily detained or harassed...” said external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Regulations governing international air travel would be respected by the Chinese side,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.“MEA would advise Indian nationals to exercise due discretion while travelling to or transiting through China,” he added.Denying that the woman was harassed, the Chinese foreign ministry had earlier said that having border checks on people entering and exiting a country and carrying out law enforcement according to the “specific situation of the entry or exit is the usual practice” of border enforcement authorities of countries across the world.

Let's have debate on Nehru, close that chapter: Priyanka Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Monday said the discussion on Vande Mataram in Parliament was timed for the approaching West Bengal assembly polls and that the govt wanted to divert attention from the problems people were facing.Participating in a discussion in Lok Sabha on 150 years of the national song, penned by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at Modi, saying he is not the PM he used to be as his ""self-confidence was decreasing and policies were weakening the country"".The Wayanad MP also slammed BJP for targeting India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru and alleged the govt wanted the debate to make fresh charges against those who fought for the country's freedom.The Congress MP also listed the ""chronology"" of 'Vande Mataram', citing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's letter to which Nehru replied, to rebut the PM's charge that Congress indulged in politics of appeasement over the national song.Modi ji mentioned a letter in the House, in which he said that on Oct 20, Nehru ji had written to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.But the PM did not mention the letter written on Oct 17, which Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose ji had written to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji... PM Modi quoted one line of this (Nehru's) reply here, but the rest of what Nehru ji wrote was - 'there is no doubt that the present outcry against Vande Mataram is to a large extent a manufactured one by the Communalists. Whatever we do, we cannot pander to Communalist feelings',"" Priyanka Gandhi said.Referring to Modi's speech, she said, ""Since you keep talking about Nehru, let's do one thing, let's assign a time for a discussion, list out all the insults against him... debate it and let's close the chapter once and for all,"" she said, adding that ""after that, let's talk about today's issues - price rise and unemployment...The topic that we are discussing is part of the soul of the country. When we mention 'Vande Mataram', it reminds us of the history of our freedom struggle. This debate is strange; this song has made a place in people's hearts; so what is the need for a debate?"" Priyanka said. In 1896, Rabindranath Tagore sang it for the first time at a Congress session, she said.She added questioning the decision of having the first two stanzas of 'Vande Mataram' as the national song was akin to questioning the Constituent Assembly and its members.Congress deputy leader in LS Gaurav Gogoi said it is the PM's habit to keep referring to Nehru and Congress whenever he speaks on any issue. ""He (Modi) took Nehru ji's name 14 times and that of Congress 50 times during the debate on Operation Sindoor. When there was a discussion on the 75th anniversary of the Constitution, Nehru's name was taken 10 times and that of Congress 26 times.""""During the discussion on the President's address in 2022, he took Nehru ji's name 15 times. The PM, during the discussion on the President's address in 2020, took Nehru ji's name 20 times. I want to say with utmost humility to Modi ji and his entire system, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to put even a single blot on Pandit Nehru's contributions."" Gogoi said the PM's speech had two objectives - ""to rewrite history and give a political colour to this debate"".","Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at PM Modi, saying he is not the PM he used to be.

NEW DELHI: Accusing Congress of portraying ' Vande Mataram ' as ""communalist"" on account of its own appeasement politics - which made it see the national song through the lens of MA Jinnah - defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday urged parliamentarians across party lines to restore its glory by adding a new fundamental duty in the Constitution that mandates according the same respect to 'Vande Mataram' as is given to the national anthem ""My request to all members is that we all come together and consider whether we can add a new fundamental duty under Article 51A of the Constitution - that all citizens shall accord the same respect to 'Vande Mataram' as we accord to the national anthem. If we do this, it will be a perfect tribute to 'Vande Mataram', its author, and Bengal's great nationalist thinker Bankim Chandra Chatterjee,"" Singh said while participating in a discussion in Lok Sabha on the 150th anniversary of the national song.Singh said that after Independence, it was decided that the national anthem and the national song would be given equal status, but only the national anthem ' Jana Gana Mana ' became an integral part of the country's consciousness, while the national song 'Vande Mataram' was treated like an ""extra"".""On the very soil where 'Vande Mataram' was composed, the Congress took the decision to truncate the song in 1937. Every generation must know about the political deceit and injustice done to 'Vande Mataram'.This injustice was not only to a song but to the people of independent India and the freedom fighters who fought for freedom with chants of 'Vande Mataram',"" he said.'Vande Mataram' is complete in itself, yet attempts were made to make it incomplete. ""However, it has remained the immortal song of our nation, and it will remain so,"" he added.Singh emphasised that future generations must understand the mentality of those who undermined the song, calling it an injustice to India's cultural and national identity.Earlier, LS Speaker Om Birla described 'Vande Mataram' as a reflection of India's harmony and strength. In his opening remarks, Birla said that as the country commemorates the 150-year glorious journey of 'Vande Mataram', it remains etched in the heart of every Indian even today.Former Union minister and BJP MP Anurag Thakur said, ""Vande Mataram' is not just a song; it is a 'Maha Mantra'. It is neither a religious song nor a party, nor individual, song. 'Vande Mataram' represents national pride and Indian culture.""","Defence minister Rajnath Singh urges parliamentarians across party lines to restore its glory by adding a new fundamental duty in the Constitution.

"Vande Mataram debate done with eye on Bengal poll, says TMC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-mataram-debate-done-with-eye-on-bengal-poll-says-tmc/articleshow/125847316.cms,"NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress claimed on Monday that the govt had pushed for a discussion on 'Vande Mataram' in the Parliament only with an eye on West Bengal elections, calling BJP's commitment to the national song a ""badly scripted comedy"".With BJP making a determined bid to unseat CM Mamata Banerjee, TMC MPs Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Mahua Moitra slammed the party for its ""divisive"" politics and for being removed from the state's soul, while SP's Akhilesh Yadav said BJP members are not ""rashtrawadi"" (nationalists) but ""rashtra vivadi"" (those who stoke dispute) and follow the British in dividing society.Praising the national song, Yadav said it had awakened millions and energised and unified the struggle against the British. BJP wants to own everything, including the icons who do not belong to it, he said. ""Going by their comments and speeches, it appears the song has been created by them,"" he said.Dastidar accused PM of insulting Bankim Chandra Chatterjee by referring to him as ""Bankim da"", giving the impression that ""he was having a casual conversation with the literary icon at a local tea shop"". Modi had switched to ""Bankim babu"" after another TMC MP, Saugata Roy, objected to it during his speech.Dastidar said Bengalis will not tolerate the belittling of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, just as they had not tolerated the disrespect shown to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar when his bust was vandalised.In her speech, Moitra said the irony of a discussion on the song is not lost on anyone when the opposition is preve-nted from raising pressing issues of national importance, like states being starved of funds due to them, pollution crisis, and people in large nu-mbers being subjected to ma-ss ""disenfranchisement"".","TMC MPs Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Mahua Moitra slammed the party for its ""divisive"" politics and for being removed from the state's soul.

"Critical of NTA, panel says return to pen-paper tests",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/critical-of-nta-panel-says-return-to-pen-paper-tests/articleshow/125846156.cms,"NEW DELHI: The parliamentary standing committee on education has said National Testing Agency 's (NTA) handling of entrance examinations in 2024 ""has not inspired much confidence"" and recommended a shift towards pen-and-paper based tests along with a nationwide blacklist of firms involved in exam irregularities.On pen-and-paper based tests, the panel said there are several models that have been leak-proof for years, such as CBSE board exams & UPSC.The committee, headed by Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, noted in its report that ""in 2024 alone, of the 14 competitive examinations conducted by NTA, at least five faced major issues"". It recorded that ""three examinations - UGC-NET, CSIR-NET and NEET-PG - had to be postponed, one examination viz. NEET-UG saw instances of paper leaks, and one examination CUET (UG/PG) saw its results postponed"".The committee also flagged that in JEE (Main) 2025 held in Jan, at least 12 questions had to be withdrawn due to errors in the final answer key. It observed that ""such instances do not inspire confidence of the examinees in the system"". ""The committee, therefore, recommends that NTA needs to quickly get their act together so that such instances, which otherwise are fully avoidable, do not occur in future,"" the report said.On exam security, the panel weighed risks in both online and offline modes. It noted that pen-and-paper exams ""offer more opportunities for paper leaks"", while computer-based tests (CBT) ""can be hacked in a manner that is difficult to detect"". Between the two, it supported a stronger shift to traditional formats, stating that NTA should closely study and replicate the CBSE and UPSC models. For CBT, the panel recommended that such exams be hosted only in government-controlled centres and ""never in private centres"".The report also flagged concerns over the continuing engagement of tainted vendors. It said several firms involved in paper setting, administration and correction have been blacklisted by organisations and state governments, yet continue to secure contracts elsewhere. ""Such blacklisted firms must not be engaged for any entrance test by the NTA or state govts,"" it said, recommending a nationwide list of blacklisted firms and associated individuals to prevent future contracts.Highlighting NTA's finances, the panel noted that the agency ""collected an estimated Rs 3,512.9 crore while it has spent Rs 3,064.7 crore on the conduct of exams, thereby creating a surplus of Rs 448 crores in the last six years"". It recommended that this corpus be used to build NTA's internal capability or to strengthen regulatory and monitoring systems for vendors.The panel also flagged growing dependence on private coaching, urging tighter alignment of entrance examinations with school curricula and recommending a task force to explore regulatory oversight of coaching sector.","The parliamentary standing committee on education has said National Testing Agency's handling of entrance examinations in 2024 ""has not inspired much confidence"" The committee, headed by Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, noted in its report that ""in 2024 alone, of the 14 competitive examinations conducted by NTA, at least five faced major issues""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125846244,imgsize-563455,width-400,resizemode-4/critical-of-nta-panel-says-return-to-pen-paper-tests.jpg"

The plea of default bail is untenable since no substantial change in circumstances has occurred subsequent to the rejection of their earlier bail applications,” judge Manjeet Singh Manhas said in his order.Earlier, on Oct 4, the court had rejected bail applications of all accused.In their fresh bail applications, the policemen argued that the chargesheet was filed on Oct 22, 2025, and the most serious charges like attempt to murder had been dropped against them.The CBI counsel contended that the chargesheet still contained substantive offences.The case is based on an FIR registered by the CBI on July 26, 2025, following directions from the Supreme Court of India in a 2023 special leave petition.As per case details, constable Khursheed Ahmed Chowhan was detained at an interrogation centre and tortured from Feb 20 to Feb. 26, 2023. Chowhan’s wife, Rubeena Akhter, had approached the Supreme Court alleging he was subjected to brutal torture by police under the pretext of investigating narcotics-related offenses.According to her complaint, Chowhan was beaten with iron rods and wooden sticks, given electric shocks and left in a critical condition. She also alleged he suffered severe injuries to his private parts and that the accused had inserted iron rod into his rectum and thrown chili powder into it.On July 21, the SC directed the CBI to register a case.Chowhan had earlier approached the J&K High Court seeking registration of an FIR, but his plea was dismissed.","Eight policemen, including a deputy SP, are accused of illegally detaining a constable in custody for six days in Feb 2023.

The quiet strength of humility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-quiet-strength-of-humility/articleshow/119985268.cms,"

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

A disquieting transformation can be seen unfolding before us if we observe the glittering talk shows, blockbuster films, the viral social media clips - humility's quiet retreat. In its place, aggressiveness, vanity, and pride reign supreme. Somehow, humility has been misinterpreted as self-deprecation rather than self-awareness.

As C S Lewis, the renowned British author and Anglican theologian, clarified: ""Humility is not thinking less of yourself. It's thinking of yourself less.""

I wish I had the power to change the tone of the narrative that humility is weakness, forgiveness is cowardice, and snobbery, a form of strength.

Throughout human history , spiritual traditions have exalted humility as the supreme quality that illuminates one's inner journey toward divine connection.

There is a striking commonality among the various demons In Hindu mythology—whether Mahishasur, Surapadma, Hiranyaksha, or Ravana—their inflated self-importance. These characters are dominated by 'Ahankara' or super-ego, which swells until they demand universal submission. When the world refuses to bow, they unleash torment upon humanity, necessitating their ultimate destruction by divine avatars.

The Bible echoes this sentiment: ""God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble"" while the Quran teaches that the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth humbly.

Donald Grey Barnhouse, a famous preacher, once visited a beach incognito to escape adulation. He met a young girl playing alone who told him that her parents allowed her seaside playtime while they read scriptures at home.

After their pleasant interaction, Barnhouse said: ""When you go home, Mary, tell your mother that you were playing with Donald Grey Barnhouse. She will be elated.""

Mary reflected briefly before responding: ""When you go home, Donald, tell your mother that you were playing with Mary. She will be elated too.""

The priest later described this exchange as the most humbling moment of his life.

Einstein once declined the honour of being Israel's prime minister in 1952, while cricketer Rahul Dravid declined an honorary doctorate from Bangalore University, saying he had worked hard at cricket but haven't studied enough to deserve this honour.

These luminaries remind us that humility isn't diminishment—it's expansion. We shrink through unyielding arrogance but grow through humble attempts at self-effacement. The world's strangest paradox may be this: to truly grow, one must become small.

In one of his couplets, Valluvar brings up this paradox, where he declares that modest people tower even more than the colossal mountains.

""Nilayin Thiriyaadhu Adangiyaan Thotram

Malayinum Maanap Peridhu""

The steadfast, self-controlled, humble humans stand aloft,

Taller than the mightiest mountain.

I wondered what made the saint compare humans with great mountains. Symbols of permanence in countless literary and spiritual traditions, mountains stand in silent judgment of our transience. Gazing at their majestic forms, one wonders: Do they look down upon the fleeting human drama with cosmic amusement?

RS passes waqf bill 128-95 as BJD boosts NDA numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-passes-waqf-bill-128-95-as-bjd-boosts-nda-numbers/articleshow/119993588.cms,"Budget session ends, both Houses adjourned sine die

NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill with 128 votes in favour and 95 against after a marathon 15-hour debate which started at 11am on Thursday and wound up around 2.30 am the next day.The lengthy debate, marked by acrimonious exchanges, ended with the opposition seeking a division and the bill sailing through with National Democratic alliance's (NDA's) 'secular' allies firmly in its corner.BJD's surprising decision to withdraw its whip to allow its seven members to vote as ""per their conscience"" brought a few extra votes for the governing side and took its tally beyond the anticipated 123 votes to 128. A minimum of 119 votes was required for passage, and BJP's deft floor management ensured a comfortable margin. The opposition bloc, expected to muster 98 votes, fell short at 95.The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday after nearly 14 hours of discussion, with 288 members supporting it and 232 against it. With both Houses approving the bill, it now awaits President Droupadi Murmu's assent to amend the Waqf Act of 1995.Parliament also approved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, with the Rajya Sabha giving its nod. The lower house had earlier cleared the bill. The budget session of Parliament, which began on Jan 31, came to a close with both Houses being adjourned sine die on Friday.Replying to the debate, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju dismissed the opposition's charges as fear mongering, while putting up a spirited defence of the bill.""We have since yesterday consistently said that Muslims will constitute the overwhelming majority in both central waqf council and state waqf boards - 18 out of 22 and eight out of 11, in that order. Still, it was repeated ad nauseam that these bodies will be controlled by non-Muslims as a conspiracy to divest Muslims of their assets,"" the minister said.Rijiju, however, was blunt in saying that the two bodies could not be allowed to be exclusive Muslim entities either.""Their brief is not religious and disputes over waqf properties invariably involve non-Muslims,"" he said, adding that the central govt worked for all with the motto of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.The minister said the waqf board was a statutory body and, like all govt bodies, it should be secular. He said the inclusion of a few non-Muslims on the waqf board would not alter the decisions of the body and, instead, would add value.The waqf bill debates were the budget session's highlight, with the Rajya Sabha sitting until 4.02am on Friday - echoing a 1981 session on the Essential Services Maintenance Bill that lasted until 4.43am. Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar called the 15-hour debate ""unprecedented"".Historically, Parliament has seen marathon discussions. The longest, on the 'state of our democracy', spanned 20.08 hours in the Lok Sabha, followed by the 1993 Railway Budget (18.35 hours) and the 1998 Railway Budget (18.04 hours). This session also saw swift discussions on other matters, like the ratification of President's rule in Manipur, cleared in 42 minutes by the Lok Sabha and 1.24 hours by the Rajya Sabha.","The Rajya Sabha passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill with 128 votes in favour and 95 against.

""The bill was passed according to the rules of the House.

Congress members raised slogans as the Speaker delivered the valedictory address, ensuring a raucous end to the session.

"In counter to Yunus's remark, PM Modi says Northeast integral to Bimstec",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-counter-to-yunuss-remark-pm-modi-says-northeast-integral-to-bimstec/articleshow/119956816.cms,"Modi to meet Yunus today, claim top Bangladesh officials

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.

SC to examine if Worship Act applies to Shahi Idgah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-examine-if-worship-act-applies-to-shahi-idgah/articleshow/119992715.cms,"SC: HC call to bunch suits filed by Hindu sides appears correct

NEW DELHI: SC on Friday agreed to examine the contrasting arguments of Hindu and Muslim sides on applicability of the Places of Worship Act , 1991, which freezes the religious character of structures as it existed on Aug 15, 1947, to Mathura's Shahi Idgah-Srikrishna Janmasthan , protected under the ASI Act.The Muslim side said Allahabad HC's decision to club all 15 suits filed by Hindu sides, claiming right of worship over the entire disputed land, was wrong and went against the provisions of the PoW (Special Provisions) Act, 1991.The bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan, said HC's decision to bunch the suits filed by Hindu sides ""prima facie appears to be correct"", a reiteration of the view it had taken during the hearing on Jan 10.The Muslim side was represented by advocate Tasneem Ahmadi. Ahmadi said the PoW (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 barred high court from entertaining any suit that intended to change the religious character of the structure to one other than what it was on Aug 15, 1947. For the Hindu side, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said since the Idgah was a protected monument under ASI Act, it would not come under the ambit of PoW Act. When Ahmadi protested Jain's stand, the bench said, ""If you take defence under the 1991 Act, they are entitled to counter it by arguing the Act is not applicable to the structure.""The bench said that it had on Dec 12 barred courts from passing any interim order in suits relating to temple-mosque disputes and asked courts not to entertain any fresh suit for reclamation of temples which were converted into mosques during Islamic rule, including disputes relating to Varanasi's Gyanvapi-Kashi Viswanath and Mathura's Shahi Idgah-Srikrishna Janmasthan. The bench on Dec 12 also directed, ""In pending suits, trial courts will not pass any effective and final order including orders for survey till the next date of hearing.""Allahabad HC had on Aug 1 last year ruled that suits were not barred by any provisions of Waqf Act, PoW Act, Specific Relief Act, Limitation Act or Civil Procedure Code. HC on Oct 23 last year had rejected the Muslim side's plea for recall of its Jan 11, 2024, order directing consolidation of all suits on the Shahi Idgah-Srikrishna Janmasthan dispute.SC agreed to list the appeal by the Muslim side, challenging the orders - consolidation of suits and non-applicability of PoW Act to the Idgah - along with cross petitions on PoW Act. Some of these petitions challenge the constitutional validity of PoW Act while others seek its implementation in letter and spirit.

India urges BRICS nations to unite on mobilising $1.3 trillion annually to achieve climate action goals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-urges-brics-nations-to-unite-on-mobilising-1-3-trillion-annually-to-achieve-climate-action-goals/articleshow/119952936.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday called on the BRICS group of nations to unite on the 'Baku to Belem Roadmap' to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for achieving climate action goals. The group, which earlier comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, now has 11 countries as its members, collectively negotiating for climate governance at multilateral forums, including the UN climate conference.India pitched for a collaborative approach to achieve the climate action goals—nationally determined contributions—at the 11th BRICS Environment Ministers’ Meeting in Brasilia, Brazil. The 30th session of the UN climate conference (COP30) will be held in Belem, Brazil, in November.Articulating the country’s stand, the Indian team led by Amandeep Garg, Additional Secretary in the Environment Ministry, urged the BRICS partners to strengthen climate financing mechanisms to meet global sustainability commitments effectively. They highlighted the urgent need for developed nations to fulfil their commitments, noting that the proposed $300 billion per year by 2035 under the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance is far below the required $1.3 trillion.With BRICS nations facing common environmental challenges such as desertification, pollution, and biodiversity loss, India stressed the importance of collective action and shared responsibility. The country also reiterated its leadership in conservation and sustainability, mentioning initiatives such as the International Big Cat Alliance, a global effort for wildlife conservation.Reaffirming its commitment to working collaboratively with BRICS partners to drive transformative change in climate action, environmental cooperation, and sustainable development , India, during its participation, urged all 11 nations to join global sustainability initiatives like the International Solar Alliance, Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT), and Global Biofuel Alliance to accelerate collective climate action.BRICS nations collectively account for 47% of the world’s population and contribute 36% of global GDP. Six countries that joined the group in the past year include Egypt, Ethiopia, UAE, Iran, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia.On energy security, India reiterated commitments made in the BRICS New Delhi Declaration (2021), which promotes a diversified energy mix, including fossil fuels, hydrogen, nuclear, and renewables.“A Just Transition must acknowledge the diverse economic realities of nations. Each country has a unique development pathway, and the provision of adequate means of implementation—in finance, technology, and capacity-building—is essential to ensuring that no nation or community is left behind in this transition. As BRICS nations, we must strengthen our engagements in multilateral forums, championing the interests of developing economies and advocating for a fair and equitable transition,” said India’s statement issued at the meeting.","India called on the BRICS group of nations to unite on the 'Baku to Belem Roadmap' to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for achieving climate action goals.

Annamalai says not in race for Tamil Nadu chief post: Is BJP setting stage for AIADMK tie-up?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/annamalai-says-not-in-race-for-tamil-nadu-chief-post-is-bjp-setting-stage-for-aiadmk-tie-up/articleshow/119987341.cms,"Annamalai and Edappadi K Palaniswami, Union home minister Amit Shah (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Has the BJP signalled a shift in its politics in Tamil Nadu? State BJP president K Annamalai , whose aggressive brand of politics helped popularise the lotus in Tamil Nadu, on Friday said he was not in the race for the post of the next state unit chief.""I am not in the race for the post of the new state president. I am not ready for any quarrel (related to the next chief and whether he has any preference for any particular leader) and I am not in the race,"" Annamalai said when asked about the issue.Annamalai's announcement, which comes days after AIADMK general secretary and Tamil Nadu leader of opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami ( EPS ) met Union home minister Amit Shah, gives credence to reports that the BJP may be exploring an alliance with its former partner for the assembly elections in the state due next year.Amit Shah-EPS meeting last month sparked intense political speculation about a possible revival of the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the state. However, reports claimed that AIADMK had put Annamalai's ouster as state party chief a precondition for any possible tie-up.The AIADMK and BJP were alliance partners in the 2021 state elections, during which the saffron party won four seats. However, the relationship between the two parties suffered after Annamalai made a controversial reference to late AIADMK supremo and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's conviction in a corruption case.Senior AIADMK leaders accused Annamalai of disrespecting the alliance's spirit and failing to recognise the AIADMK's leadership within the state coalition.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the two parties fought separately, forming independent alliances and both suffered in the process as the DMK-led coalition swept all seats in Tamil Nadu.With chief minister M K Stalin already in election mode for the assembly polls next year, perhaps both the BJP and the AIADMK realise the importance of coming together. EPS has announced that for his party the DMK was the ""sole enemy"" and he was ready to join hands with any like-minded party for an alliance.However, the big question is: Can AIADMK treat BJP as like-minded party given the issues that the saffron party has pushed for in the recent past - the three-language formula, the Waqf Bill. Will the AIADMK gain from this alliance? Also, will this tieup take away from the BJP all the gains it had made in the last few years under Annamalai who projected BJP as an alternative to the state parties?Political analysts feel that BJP's stand on the three-language formula and the passage of the Waqf Bill may make the AIADMK nervous about the possible electoral fallout.""The BJP's agenda on delimitation, Neet, language policy, Waqf Bill makes the saffron party a difficult partner in Tamil Nadu for any regional party, says Vijaya Sankar, senior journalist and political analyst.He feels the BJP and AIADMK will have to woo other parties and make a grand coalition if it wants to challenge the DMK-led front, which, according to him has already got a head-start thanks to some smart moves made by chief minister M K Stalin.""All existing political players would be keenly watching the moves of actor-turned-politician Vijay. He is the unknown factor in the next elections and it remains to be seen who suffers due to his presence in the political arena,"" says Vijaya Sankar.Elections in Tamil Nadu are still a year away. The BJP may have to tone down the issues it has been raking up in the state if it wants a coalition. But one thing is certain, if the BJP-AIADMK coalition indeed happens, Annamalai will perhaps be the biggest loser.",State BJP president K Annamalai said he was not in the race for the post of the next state unit chief. His announcement comes days after AIADMK general secretary and Tamil Nadu leader of opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami ( EPS ) met Union home minister Amit Shah.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119988284,imgsize-1097978,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-25.jpg"

Poll Do you think the Waqf Amendment Bill will positively impact the community? No Yes

NEW DELHI: The leaders of Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal United or JD(U) went on a resigning spree over their disagreement with the party's support for the passage of the contentious Waqf Amendment Bill in the Parliament.Not one or two but at least five leaders submitted their resignations as the bill was passed, first in Lok Sabha and then the Rajya Sabha on Thursday and Friday, respectively.The latest to resign from the party was Nadeem Akhtar, his resignation follows that of four other leaders, including JD(U) leader Raju Nayyar, Tabrez Siddiqui Alig, Mohammad Shahnawaz Malik, and Mohammed Kasim Ansari.While Nadeem, Raju, and Tabrez resigned on Friday, Shahnawaz and Mohammaed Kasim Ansari submitted their resignation on Thursday.Raju Nayyar wrote in his resignation, ""I resign from JD(U) after the Waqf Amendment Bill is passed and supported in the Lok Sabha.""He went on to express his deep disappointment with the party, stating, ""I am deeply hurt by the JD(U) voting in favour of this black law, which oppresses Muslims.""""I resign from the post of former state secretary of JD(U) youth and primary membership of the party. I request to send a letter to the Honorable CM Nitish Kumar and relieve me from all responsibilities,"" he added.Meanwhile, Independent MP from Purnia, Pappu Yadav, claimed that the Bihar chief minister and the JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar was not in a good mental state and that he was no longer in control of his party. ""Nitish Kumar ji's mental state is not very good at present. In his party, 90 per cent of the leaders are against SC/ST but aligned to the BJP. After 5 PM on the day voting takes place in Bihar, the BJP will no longer need Nitish Kumar.. JD(U) is not in the hands of Nitish ji now,"" Yadav said while talking to the news agency ANI.In a letter to JDU national president and Bihar chief minister, Tabrez Siddiqui Alig conveyed strong disappointment, accusing the party of ""betraying the trust of the Muslim community.""Meanwhile, Shahnawaz Malik wrote in his letter, ""Millions of Indian Muslims like us firmly believed that you stood for a truly secular ideology. That belief now stands shattered.""“Millions of Indian Muslims like us had unwavering faith that you are the flag bearer of a purely secular ideology. But now, this belief has been shattered. Millions of dedicated Indian Muslims and activists like us are deeply shocked by JDU's stand regarding the Waqf Bill Amendment Act 2024,” reads the letter written by Shah Nawaz Malik.Moreover, Ansari wrote that the Waqf Bill was “against Indian Muslims” and could not be accepted “under any circumstances.”“This bill violates many fundamental rights of the Constitution. Through this bill, Indian Muslims are being humiliated and insulted. Neither you nor your party realises this. I regret that I gave many years of my life to the party,” he wrote.However, JD(U) national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad responded to Ansari and Malik's resignations, saying that neither Ansari, from East Champaran, nor Malik, from Jamui, were officially part of the party.Ansari, in a letter shared on social media, identified himself as the medical cell president of JD(U) in East Champaran and claimed he was a candidate from the Dhaka assembly seat. However, JD(U) did not contest that seat in the 2020 elections. The Dhaka seat was won by BJP’s Pawan Jaiswal, a JD(U) ally.Speaking to the news agency PTI, Prasad said, ""I wonder what to say about things. I have been associated with the party for a long time. I say with full responsibility that neither person has been a part of our rank and file.""He also said, ""We admit that some genuine members of our party, like national general secretary Ghulam Rasool Baliyawi, are not very happy with the passage of the Bill. Their grievances will be dealt with at the appropriate level. But those who are coming up with the claim of resignation from the party were never members in the first place.""Earlier on Thursday, Baliyawi and Syed Afzal Abbas, who heads the Bihar Shia Waqf Board, also shared concerns about the Bill. They said that several suggestions made by Muslim leaders during meetings with the Joint Parliamentary Committee were not included. However, they did not criticise the party’s support for the Bill.Parliament approved the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 in the early hours of Friday after a detailed discussion in the Rajya Sabha. The Bill passed in the Rajya Sabha with 128 members voting in favour and 95 against. It had been earlier cleared in the Lok Sabha, where 288 MPs supported it and 232 voted against the bill.The Waqf Bill issue is expected to remain active in Bihar until the state assembly elections later this year.Recently, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) held a protest in Patna, asking Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and NDA allies like Chirag Paswan to stop the Bill.Nitish Kumar has said he follows the ideas of Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia and often talks about his record on supporting secular values, even while being a BJP ally since the 1990s.At a recent event also attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, he mentioned his government’s work for minorities and criticised the RJD, which was in power for 15 years, for failing to prevent Hindu-Muslim clashes despite getting Muslim votes.The RJD, Congress, and Left parties are expected to raise the Waqf Bill issue during the election campaign to criticise the JD(U) and try to gain the support of Muslim voters for the Mahagathbandhan alliance.","Leaders of Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal United or JD(U) went on a resigning spree over their disagreement with the party's support for the passage of the contentious Waqf Amendment Bill.

NEW DELHI: The legal and political battle over the Waqf Amendment Bill , 2025 has reached the Supreme Court, with AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi joining Congress MP Mohammad Jawed in challenging the bill’s constitutional validity.Both leaders have alleged that the proposed amendments infringe on the fundamental rights of Muslims and introduce discriminatory state control over Islamic religious endowments.The petitions, filed through advocate Anas Tanwir, come even before the Bill has received Presidential assent.It was passed by both Houses of Parliament amid sharp opposition.Jawed, a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that reviewed the bill, argued that the amendments violate Articles 14, 25, 26, 29, and 300A of the Constitution, which relate to equality, religious freedom, minority rights, and property. He said the bill introduces arbitrary restrictions, including one based on the duration of religious practice, which could prevent recent converts from dedicating property under waqf — a condition he said is alien to Islamic law, reported Bar and Bench.Another contentious change flagged in the petition is the proposed inclusion of non-Muslim members in Waqf Boards and the Central Waqf Council. “This selective intervention lacks any reasonable justification and constitutes an arbitrary classification,” the plea mentioned, noting that similar interference is absent in the governance of Hindu or Sikh religious trusts.Speaking to the media, Jawed said, “Several people in India will file this petition, several parties will do this... In the Parliament, everyone in the Opposition said that this is unconstitutional... How can you snatch away our right? If you have numbers, it doesn’t mean you get passed anything you want and do something unlawful.”AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi has also called the Bill a “brazen violation” of the Muslim community’s rights.During the debate in Parliament, he tore a copy of the legislation, comparing his act to Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience in South Africa. “Like Gandhi, I am also tearing up this law. This is unconstitutional. The BJP wants to create divisiveness in this country in the name of temples and mosques,” he said.He also urged the government to consider the 10 amendments he proposed during the debate, warning that the Bill would curtail Muslim rights.The Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to revise the Waqf Act, 1995, which governs religious endowments under Islamic law in India. It defines the roles of Waqf Boards, Tribunals, and administrative structures overseeing waqf properties. While the government says the amendments are aimed at better regulation and transparency, critics argue the bill introduces state interference not applied to other religious institutions and undermines community autonomy.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi joins Congress MP Mohammad Jawed in challenging the bill's constitutional validity.

Tyeb Mehta's bull run continues: 2nd priciest Indian painting at 61.8cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tyeb-mehtas-bull-run-continues-2nd-priciest-indian-painting-at-61-8cr/articleshow/119957048.cms,"His work is worth crores, but Tyeb struggled most of his life

The bull run seems to be truly on in the Indian market, and who better to capture its animal spirits than Tyeb Mehta, the celebrated modernist who made the bull his enduring motif?Less than a fortnight after a work by his contemporary M F Husain joined the Rs 100-crore club, Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' (1956) went for Rs 61.8 crore ($7.27 million), becoming the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil 's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023. Mehta's powerful image of a shackled and subjugated bull went for nearly nine times its higher estimate at a Saffronart auction in Mumbai on Wednesday.This is not the first time Mehta, who lived in Mumbai most of his life and passed away in 2009, has raised the bar for Indian art. In 2002, his triptych, 'Celebration', from The Times of India's collection, made history as the first modern Indian artwork to sell for over a crore (Rs 1.5 crore at Christie's).It was a Tyeb work again ('Mahishasura') which crossed the $1m mark for the first time in 2005. Now, he has set another benchmark for Indian art. Wednesday's auction was also a benchmark for homegrown auction house Saffronart, which celebrated its 25th anniversary with an auction that raked in a record-breaking $25 million. ""It's a global record for an Indian art auction . It shows the strength of the art market when other asset classes are struggling,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart CEO and co-founder. ""It's even more meaningful because it is Mehta's centenary year.""The proceeds will go to the Mehta family since the work was from their collection. For most of his life, the artist lived in a cramped one-room apartment that was studio by day and bedroom at night. It was only in the 1990s that he and his wife Sakina could afford to move into a two-bedroom place in Lokhandwala. ""Like many other artist wives of that period, Sakina supported him. She used to work as a teacher,"" said Kishore Singh, senior VP at DAG (formerly Delhi Art Gallery).His work now goes for sums that are as jaw-dropping as his pregnant Kali and avenging yet tender Durga but to talk of Mehta purely in terms of zeroes does no justice to the man and the ideals he lived by. ""The power of painting was far more important to him than the prices it commanded,"" said Singh, narrating an anecdote from Delhi gallerist Arun Vadehra who was close to Mehta. ""Arun used to have one of his paintings hanging in his office. One day, Mehta took it away, only to replace it later with another work. When Arun asked, he said he had ripped the earlier painting because he wasn't happy with it. Tyeb may not have been very prolific but he stayed true to his art.""Mehta's strong imagery was always rooted in his life, with his canvases charting the tumult around him - the horrors of Partition, the struggles of a newly independent India and the violence of the 1992 Bombay riots. In an interview, he recounted his memories of Partition. ""At the time, I was living on Mohammed Ali Road, which was virtually a Muslim ghetto. I remember watching a young man being slaughtered in the street below my window. The crowd beat him to death, smashed his head with stones."" Those images haunted him for life, as did the sight of bullocks being led to slaughter at an abattoir in Bombay. The bull, Mehta later said, was important to him on many levels. ""The way they tie up the animal's legs and fling it on the floor of the slaughterhouse before butchering it... you feel something very vital has been lost. The trussed bull also seemed representative of the national condition... the mass of humanity unable to channel or direct its tremendous energies...""In the winter of his life, Mehta's vision was impaired. ""Those primary colours that he used so much was because his sight was affected,"" explained Singh. But he continued to paint, a perfectionist till the end.","Tyeb Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' is the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023.

"Don’t push us to the wall, Omar and allies tell LG over transfers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-push-us-to-the-wall-omar-and-allies-tell-lg-over-transfers/articleshow/119990500.cms,"Omar Abdullah

SRINAGAR: J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) and ally Congress on Friday passed a resolution slamming lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha over alleged usurpation of powers through transfer of officers and warned the Centre-appointed appointed authority “not to push them to the wall”.The ultimatum went out from a meeting in Srinagar called by chief minister Omar Abdullah and attended by MLAs of NC, Congress and two independents supporting the state govt. A separate resolution was passed at the meeting condemning the Waqf Act passed by Parliament.Although the NC and its allies didn’t name Sinha, the LG offered a rare response on the claims. “With all responsibility I am saying I have not done anything beyond J&K Reorganisation Act passed by Parliament on Aug 5, 2019. I know my limits and I won’t overstep them,” Sinha said on the sidelines of an event in Jammu.The bone of contention emerged on April 1 when Sinha ordered transfers of 48 Jammu Kashmir Administrative Service (JKAS) officers while the CM and other members of his National Conference (NC) were away for Eid holidays.A power-sharing structure between the elected govt and LG in place after the Aug 2019 abrogation of special status under Article 370 that turned J&K into a Union territory has worked in the past six months since NC took office. According to NC, LG has powers to transfer IAS officers, while the elected govt wields similar authority over JKAS cadre.At Friday’s meeting, NC and its allies made it clear they would not brook any further “interference” and declared that similar moves in the future would be taken to “the floor of the assembly”.NC legislator and spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq asserted that the Omar-led govt had been coordinating with LG. “This coordination should not be mistaken for weakness. We are here with our final appeal -- don’t push us to the wall. People of J&K gave a mandate through an election (result) in Oct 2024 and that must be respected. Anyone who fails to do so is insulting the people of J&K and their mandate,” Sadiq said. Congress legislator Nizamuddin Bhat backed Sadiq’s assertions and declared his party stood with NC and Omar on the issue.Many NC leaders believe transfers of revenue officers, like SDMs and Tehsildars and projecting them as law-and-order officers, amount to asserting power over the entire bureaucracy. They say these revenue officials are assigned law and order duty on occasions but that doesn’t bring them under LG. Since J&K became a UT, LG handles the home department.Omar’s rivals took potshots at Friday’s meeting, suggesting NC had already “surrendered” before the Centre and its authorities.“People brought Omar to office to get prisoners released, provide a sense of security and employment to youth. Instead, his own department employees were terminated and he remained silent. Once they (NC) assumed power, they said they wouldn’t take a confrontational stance with the Centre. No one wants confrontation with Delhi but they should have talked on the issues instead of surrendering,” PDP chief and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti said.PDP MLA Waheed Parra echoed the views. “NC once appointed its own Sadri Riyasat (president) and PM in J&K. It is now fighting over revenue (officials’) transfers,” Parra said. Peoples Conference legislator Sajad Lone likened Omar’s party to an “unhappy worker who agrees to continue at existing wages”.",J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) and ally Congress on Friday passed a resolution slamming lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha over alleged usurpation of powers.

"Drunken misconduct: Court orders community service for 4 convicts at Sufi shrine, school",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drunken-misconduct-court-orders-community-service-for-4-convicts-at-sufi-shrine-school/articleshow/119990282.cms,"Representative image

SRINAGAR: A Srinagar court Friday ordered four men — convicted of drinking and creating public nuisance — to perform community service at Sufi shrine Makhdoom Sahib and clean a govt girls’ higher secondary school.While sentencing the accused — who had pleaded guilty to the charges — additional judicial magistrate Zirgham Hamid observed that the four were poor and the sole bread-earners of their families; imprisonment would disrupt their daily routine. In contrast, community service is seen as a way to integrate offenders back into society, allowing them to make amends for their actions through constructive contributions, the judge said, adding: ""This approach also reflects a more humane and progressive view of justice, recognising the potential for positive change in every individual.""The community service is to be carried out from 8am to 11am on April 5 and 6 at the Sufi shrine in Srinagar’s old city, which not only serves as a religious place but is also a hub of cultural and social activities, hosting events and festivals that bring the community together, the judge said. The cleaning of the school in Nowhatta (also part of the old city) is to be conducted from 9am to 12pm on April 7 and 8, the court ruled.On April 1, 2025, a complaint was filed at Nowhatta police station alleging that the four men — Manzoor Ahmad Malla, Javid Ahmad Qureshi, Parveez Ahmad Monchi and Shabir Ahmad Sheikh — were causing annoyance and abusing the general public at the main road in Nowhatta’s Sheikh Colony.A police party found the four in an inebriated state, creating a nuisance. Later, their medical examination proved that they were drunk.When produced before the court, the accused said they wanted to “confess their guilt” and sought a lenient view, pleading “they are very poor labourers and don’t have money to pay a fine”. While the court told them that they were not bound to plead guilty, they insisted that their decision was not induced by fear, pressure or undue influence but was voluntary.","A Srinagar court Friday ordered four men to perform community service at Sufi shrine Makhdoom Sahib and clean a govt girls’ higher secondary school.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has downgraded the security cover of Gursharan Kaur, wife of late ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, from Z-plus to Z, based on her revised threat perception.Sources in the govt told TOI that a recent review by the Central intelligence agencies had found her threat level to be lower, leading them to stipulate her to be placed under ‘Z’ category protection.Former PM Manmohan Singh had passed away at the age of 92 on December 26, 2024.CRPF will continue to man her ‘Z’ security detail, though with scaled down protocol and lesser number of personnel.A PTI report said Kaur will have the protection of about a dozen armed commandos for her personal protection as well as for her home.Manmohan Singh was provided Z-plus cover, along with an advanced security liaison (ASL) protocol of the CRPF in 2019, after the government changed the Special Protection Group Act to restrict SPG protection for former prime ministers and their immediate kin living at the former’s allotted residence, to five years after the ex-PM has demitted office.Singh had served as prime minister for two terms between 2004 and 2014.","The Centre has downgraded the security cover of Gursharan Kaur, wife of late ex- Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

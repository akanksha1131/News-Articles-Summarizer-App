Heated outposts, oxygen cylindersand other basic facilities with wide roads connecting the Indian side were some of the things they boasted of.Speaking to TOI later, Rijiju said our border infrastructure and facilities were comparable to the Chinese.When asked about the friendly exchange of sweets on Diwali, Rijiju said, “The Chinese don’t like sweets, they are not very fond of it.”","Kiren Rijiju visited forward Army outposts at over 15,000 feet in Bumla in Tawang district along the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh.

"Army starts full-scale patrols in Demchok, Depsang to follow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-starts-full-scale-patrols-in-demchok-depsang-to-follow/articleshow/114868528.cms,"Army starts full-scale patrols in Demchok, Depsang to follow

NEW DELHI: The Army has now kicked off full-scale patrolling at Demchok in eastern Ladakh , while it will soon follow suit in Depsang Plains after the initial patrols in the area verified that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had completely dismantled its temporary structures and pulled back its troops to pre-April 2020 positions.The patrolling is being conducted after informing the PLA in advance as per the terms of the Oct 21 pact on “patrolling arrangements”, which led to disengagement in the remaining two of the seven major face-off sites that arose after multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.“Our patrols now have full unrestricted access to the five patrolling points (PPs) in Depsang and two in Demchok, which was earlier blocked by Chinese soldiers. The PLA, too, has begun its own patrols with prior information to us to prevent the possibility of any clash,” a defence source told TOI on Friday.As part of the initial patrols, Indian soldiers went up to PP-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13 in Depsang Plains for the first time in almost five years through the “Bottleneck”, the area around 18-km inside Indian territory where the PLA was blocking them from going any further since April-May 2020.“The patrols at both Depsang and Demchok will be determined by our operational requirements and tasking,” the source said. The longer duration patrols with more distance to cover will have 20-25 armed soldiers, while the shorter ones will have 10-15 soldiers.Depsang, a table-top plateau located at an altitude of 16,000-feet, is part of India’s vital Sub-Sector North (SSN), which also includes the Daulat Beg Oldie airstrip, and strategically located near the critical Karakoram Pass in the northernmost part of eastern Ladakh. China claims almost all the 972 square km of territory in the Depsang Plains, where both sides have vast overlapping claims.“Depsang, where tanks can also operate, is far more important than other areas like Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh. It is the only place where our PPs fall short of our perception of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). In other places, the PPs are almost bang on the LAC,” another source said.At the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok in the south, Indian troops will now access two important PPs, while villagers can also go to their traditional grazing grounds there. “Our troops will now be able to patrol right till Charding La (La means pass) at an altitude of over 19,000-feet,” the source said.After “stabilization” at Depsang and Demchok, India’s focus will shift to the restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established after previous rounds of disengagements till Sept 2022.These buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory. “They were temporary arrangements to prevent clashes. We want unhindered patrolling in these areas as well,” the source said.There is, of course, still a long way to go for India’s demand for de-escalation and de-induction of the over 50,000 PLA troops forward deployed in eastern Ladakh, with another 90,000 across Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector, to be accepted by China.",Army has now kicked off full-scale patrolling at Demchok in eastern Ladakh.

My protocol does not come in my way. I go directly to the people, listen and talk to them... I believe that the farmers have the first right to our government's treasury. We gave Rs. 15000 crores in 2 years to compensate for the losses... The Opposition asks if this is the work of the CM, to go on the road. I ask if it is the CM's job to sit at home, is his job only to go live on Facebook. We are people who work face-to-face. Ours is not a deaf and dumb government. I am proud that within a short time, people have started saying that this is their government. My Ladli Yojana has become a super hit, is that wrong? People's money should be spent to save people's lives. Wherever I am, in the ministry, at home, in the car, in a programme, anywhere, if a slip of CM Relief Fund comes, I immediately sign it. One lakh lives have been saved, this is a matter of great fortune for me,"" he said.The Shiv Sena leader also played down reports of him being projected as the CM candidate by the Mahayuti alliance.""Work, development of the state, lifestyle change, our government has done all of this. In the Lok Sabha elections, the vote share moved towards the Shiv Sena. The same will be repeated in these elections also. I am the team leader as of now. Our team is working. Everyone in our team is equal. Our goal is to bring the Mahayuti government and develop the state.""While the BJP has been keen on not fielding a candidate against Raj Thackeray's son in Mahim, Eknath Shinde remained non-committal. Shinde has put up strongman Sadav Sarvankar on the seat.""He (Raj Thackeray) was with us in the Lok Sabha elections. I had a conversation with him as to what is his strategy, and he said to let Shiv Sena, BJP and NCP decide first. But they directly fielded their candidates. We also have an MLA there. I talked to him. The workers should also be looked after while contesting elections. We should not let the morale of the workers down. Certainly, today we have an alliance of Shiv Sena, BJP and NCP Ajit Pawar. We are contesting the elections under the same alliance, we have RPI's Athavale and Jan Suraaj... We will contest the elections and will win with a majority,"" he said.Eknath Shinde also tore into Congress after its Chief Mallikarjun Kharge had warned the party of not promising freebies beyond the state budget.""He (Kharge) is correct because they do not have the intention to give. They dont know how to give, they know how to take. If PM Modi sends one rupee then the entire rupee goes into the DBT (Direct Bank Transfer). They have not learnt to give. We followed the guidelines of the RBI and the Central Government. We can take a loan of 25% of the GDP. Our loan is 17.5% and we are within the 3% of FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act). We follow every guideline, we have not violated anything, therefore we have kept the entire year's budget for it, therefore this scheme will not be stopped. No one will stop the Ladli Behen Yojana ,"" he said.The Ladli Behen Yojna has been one of the strongest campaign points for the Yuti alliance and Shinde is confident that it will yeild results for the Yuti in the elections.""All of this was unexpected for the Opposition, they think we're just puppets. They did not know that we would run such a big scheme and take development forward. The industry is also trusting us. Our government works for the people and the previous government used to work for itself, to build its property, for its own benefit. Some of their leaders used to say, khata khat, khata khat, not even a single rupee was given. Our government put the money in people's accounts, pat pata, pat. The money for the Ladli Behen scheme should not be stopped because of the Model Code of Conduct, that is why we gave the November money in October. Elections are on November 20, results are on 23. After that, we will give the money for December in November. I belong to a poor farmer family. I have seen poverty. I used to think that whenever I would get the power, I would do something for my beloved sisters, mothers, farmers, brothers and senior citizens... As soon as I got the power, I told both my deputy CMs what we had to do and we did. The Opposition has not been able to digest this. They are going to lose, they have started defaming it,"" Shinde said.The Maharashtra assembly elections are scheduled for November 20 with the results for Maharashtra and Jharkhand to be declared on November 23.",Eknath Shinde says that he believes in going directly to the people and listening to them.

In all, 24 men accused of the attempted jailbreak were in jail in the serial blasts case.In Aug, HC had granted bail to two accused - Nisar Ahmed Patel and Nadeem Saiyed . Before this, Supreme Court had granted bail to Raziuddin Nasar from Hyderabad. These accused got bail 11 years after they were charged in the jailbreak case, and two years after acquittal in the serial blasts case in Feb 2022.While granting regular bail to Shaikh, Justice Nirzar Desai considered the aspect of parity: his role was identical to the roles of three co-accused who had been granted bail.

"Congress slams Election Commission for ‘lack of neutrality’, panel hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-slams-ec-for-lack-of-neutrality-panel-hits-back/articleshow/114867915.cms,"NEW DELHI: Accusing the Election Commission (EC) of replying to its complaints pertaining to 20 seats in recent Haryana polls with attacks on Congress netas and the party, and of adopting a “condescending” tone, Congress said, “If the current EC’s goal is to strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality, then it is doing a remarkable job at creating that impression”.EC responded by saying Congress’s statement seemed more like criticism directed at the commission than a counter to core issues clarified by EC in its letter to Mallikarjun Kharge on October 29.The letter to EC, written by senior Congress functionaries K C Venugopal, Ashok Gehlot, Ajay Maken, Abhishek Singhvi, Jairam Ramesh and Pawan Khera, says, “Judges who write decisions don’t attack or demonise a party raising issues. However, if the EC persists, we shall have no choice but to seek legal recourse to expunge such remarks.”Election Commission is familiar with this remedy since it unsuccessfully sought to do the same with a high court’s unflattering but accurate observations after Covid.Congress sent a scathing reply to EC after the watchdog dismissed its complaints pertaining to 20 constituencies in Haryana elections as designed to bring the entire results under a cloud.Congress’s letter said the party had raised specific issues in Haryana but the “EC response is generic and focused on diminishing the complaints and the petitioners”. It said that the “EC has given a clean chit to itself... the answer given to the question of the machines’ fluctuating batteries seeks to confuse rather than clarify”.The Congress letter took exception to EC calling its engagement with the party as “exceptional”, arguing the constitutional watchdog with quasi-judicial functions was only doing its duty by hearing a political party — adding that “the commission seems to have forgotten” the fact.“We do not know who is advising or guiding the commission,” the letter said, adding that the party can take legal recourse if EC refuses to engage with it over its complaints.In fact, Congress slammed as “disingenuous” EC’s bid to identify a pattern in its complaints, arguing that most of its petitions pertain to the short duration of elections where causes of action arise quickly.It said EC has not taken action in any of the over 100 complaints against PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, while acting against Congress’ Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi for their speeches.Reacting to the letter, an EC official told TOI, “EC had made three points. First, that the allegations relating to EVM battery and electoral processes in Haryana were unfounded and baseless, with Congress candidates or their agents being involved at every stage. Second, EC had pointed to a ‘pattern’ in raising of unfounded doubts by Congress on ‘core’ aspects of the electoral process over past 5-6 elections, on which too the party has maintained silence.“Third, EC had said raising unfounded doubts on electoral processes during polling or counting, while the anxiety of the public and political parties is already at its peak, leads to public unrest and turbulence... this point also appears to have been accepted by Congress,” the official added.Another official further said, “Congress seems to be in a dilemma after its allegations of irregularities in Haryana were rejected by EC. It had the option to file an election petition in the high court, since the result was already declared. But Congress chose to petition EC despite being aware of the rules.”Congress can still challenge the result as an election petition can be filed within 45 days from the result.",Congress sent a scathing reply to EC after the watchdog dismissed its complaints pertaining to 20 constituencies in Haryana elections. EC responded by saying Congress’s statement seemed more like criticism directed at the commission than a counter to core issues clarified by EC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114867978,imgsize-95864,width-400,resizemode-4/114867978.jpg"

Introduction of Digi Exam Platform



Enhanced Security Measures



Hybrid Approach to Exam Administration



Robust Grievance Redressal System



Restructuring the National Testing Agency (NTA)

Establishing an empowered and accountable governing body comprising domain experts.



Bolstering the agency with additional personnel.



Creating ten distinct verticals within the NTA to cover research and development, test security, infrastructure for test centers, and international collaborations, among other areas.

One of the most significant controversies in India's education sector this year was the NEET UG paper leak. In response, a government-appointed panel, led by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) head Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, has proposed a series of reforms aimed at tightening examination security. The seven-member panel submitted its report last week, outlining an ambitious two-phase reform plan, suggest media reports.According to media reports, a key proposal from the panel involves the development of a “Digi Exam” platform, drawing inspiration from the successful Digi Yatra initiative implemented in Indian airports. This innovative platform is expected to leverage biometrics, including facial recognition technology, to facilitate secure candidate identification and authentication. By adopting this approach, the examination authorities aim to transition towards a more streamlined and paperless process for registration, exam access, and potentially remote testing.To prevent future exam breaches, the committee suggested implementing multi-level biometric verification processes at various stages, including registration, test centers, counseling, and admissions. This strategy aims to foster a more secure testing environment.Furthermore, the panel recommended a hybrid approach to exam administration, acknowledging logistical challenges. This model proposes the strategic use of both computer-based testing (CBT) and pen-and-paper testing (PPT). In the long term, the panel envisions collaborating with Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas to develop state-of-the-art digital and physical testing infrastructures, as per media reports.Additionally, the committee emphasized the need for a robust grievance redressal system to address concerns promptly and effectively communicate with all stakeholders. It also called for enhanced oversight mechanisms for coaching centers and detailed recommendations to promote social inclusivity for disadvantaged and rural students.In its initial phase of implementation, the committee proposed a five-point restructuring plan for the National Testing Agency (NTA). This includes:These proposed reforms hold the potential to reshape the landscape of medical entrance examinations in India, ensuring greater transparency, security, and accessibility for all candidates.(With inputs from several media reports)Ready to lead with AI?

Kharge's questions to BJP

Promise of 2 Crore Jobs per year? Why is India's Unemployment Rate at a 45-year high?

Why are stampedes witnessed wherever there are vacancies for a handful of jobs? Who is responsible for 70 paper leaks in 7 years? Who snatched 5 Lakh Govt jobs by selling stake in PSUs? Bahut Hui Mehangai Ki Maar?

Why have the household savings plunged to a 50-year low? Why has the cost of a common thali increased by 52% in just last year? TOP — Tomato Prices increased by 247%, Potato by 180% and Onion by 60%? Who levied GST on essential food items such as Milk, Curd, Atta, Dal? Who is penalising Middle Class through LTCG by indulging in Tax Terrorism? What happened to Acche Din?

Rupee is at an all-time low. Is it in ICU or in Margdarshak Mandal? Your Govt has borrowed ₹150 lakh+ crores in past 10 years, amounting to a debt of ₹1.5 lakh on every Indian. MSMEs have been destroyed through DeMO + Flawed GST. Economic Inequality is at a 100-year-high. Average Growth is below 6% in this lost decade, while during UPA it was 8%. Private Investment is at a 20-year low, while average growth in Manufacturing is just 3.1% in the past decade, while it was 7.85 during Congress-UPA, flopping tall claims of 'Make in India' ! What happened to Viksit Bharat?

Everything you claim to construct is collapsing like a pack of cards — Shivaji statue in Maharashtra inaugurated by you, Delhi Airport roof, Ram Mandir leaks in Ayodhya and Atal Setu develops cracks. Bridge collapses in Gujarat (Morbi), while new bridges falling is a regular feature in Bihar! Innumerable Railway accidents have taken place, while Minister is busy in REEL PR! What happened to Na Khaunga, Naa Khane Doonga?

We have only two words for you — Modani Mega Scam & SEBI Chairperson. Looting through Unconstitutional Electoral Bonds by extortion is BJP’s biggest financial crime.

What PM Modi said

NEW DELHI: In a scathing response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's attack on the Congress 's ""unreal"" and ""fake"" promises to the people, party president Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday accused the government of indulging in deceitful tactics and using ""cheap PR stunts"".Referring to the BJP's 100-day plan as ""mere publicity,"" Kharge claimed it lacked substance and authenticity. He also questioned the government's assertion of taking input from over two million people for a 2047 roadmap, noting that a Right to Information ( RTI ) query to the Prime Minister's Office reportedly failed to provide details to substantiate this claim, revealing what he called ""an orchestrated lie."" Kharge went on to remark that the letters ""B"" and ""J"" in BJP stand for ""Betrayal"" and ""Jumla"" (empty promises), slamming the party for what he believes is a continuous betrayal of public trust.This came after Kharge, earlier in the day, advised the Karnataka unit about fiscal responsibility, saying: ""They should announce guarantees based on budget. Otherwise, there'll be bankruptcy. If there's no money for roads, everyone will turn against you."" It was followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations about Congress accepting making ""unreal"" and ""fake"" promises to the state's residents, which prompted the reaction.Kharge then questioned BJP over their promises. Here are the claims the Congress chief directly questioned PM Modi about:Calling out PM Modi for his remarks, the Congress supremo added, ""Modi ji, before finger-pointing, please note that - MODI KI GUARANTEE is a cruel joke on 140 Crore Indians!""Also read: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah reaction to PM Modi's remarks Prime Minister Narendra Modi had slammed Congressfor making ""unreal"" and ""fake"" promises to the people, adding that the poor, youngsters, farmers and women had become the ""victims of such politics.""""The people of the country will have to be vigilant against the Congress sponsored culture of fake promises!

NEW DELHI: After facing backlash for allegedly referring to Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC as "" imported maal "" in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly polls , UBT faction MP Arvind Sawant claimed on Friday that he did not mention Shaina's name and said that he is the true victim of defamation . His defence came after a police complaint filed by Shaina against him at Nagpada Police Station earlier in the day.Sawant clarified that his remark was aimed at outsiders not being suitable for the local context, emphasising that Shaina is a friend he respects.""I never mentioned her name. I only said that someone who is an outsider will not be able to work here. It’s their habit to create uproar,"" he told ANI.Sawant also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of being an expert in falsehoods and referencing the alleged Rs 75,000 crore irrigation scam involving NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who became Maharashtra's deputy chief minister""The PM is an expert in lying,"" Sawant said, accusing the ruling party of trying to set a false narrative and deflect attention from their weak foundation.Defending his long political career and respect for women, Sawant said his opponents are trying to malign his reputation. ""They file defamation cases, yet it is they who are defaming me. I have always respected women,"" he said.""Shaina NC is my friend, she has worked for me, and I respect her... They are 'satta jihadi' people, as our leader Uddhav Thackeray says,"" he added.A case was registered against Sawant at Nagpada Police Station after Shaina NC's complaint over his ""imported maal"" remark. The case falls under sections 79 and 356(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).The controversy began when Sawant allegedly referred to Shaina as ""imported maal,"" implying that newcomers from other parties would not be effective. In response, Shaina criticised Sawant and questioned his respect for women. She warned, ""Now you will be 'behaal' because you called a woman 'maal'.""Shaina condemned the ""objectification of women"" and noted Congress MLA Amin Patel's reaction to the comment. She contrasted this incident with women-empowerment initiatives by Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde and the central government.""You will have to apologise at Nagpada police station.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka 's chief minister Siddaramaiah on Friday responded strongly to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations about Congress making ""unreal"" and ""fake"" promises to the state's residents.Criticising PM's remarks, the Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah posted on X, ""Before pointing fingers at Congress, take a hard look at BJP 's disastrous legacy in Karnataka! We are fulfilling every promise we made to our people – all 5 guarantees implemented with a budget over Rs 52,000 crore, and an additional Rs 52,903 crore in capital outlay to build Karnataka's future.""Siddaramaiah further added, ""BJP left Karnataka plagued with 40% commission corruption, draining resources that could have transformed lives. We’re using that same 40%—redirecting it to benefit the people. What was your ‘achievement’ here? Empowering corrupt practices, leaving Karnataka debt-ridden, and using propaganda to cover up your failures? And let’s not forget: under your watch, India’s debt is projected to reach ₹185.27 trillion by FY25—a staggering 56.8% of GDP! This isn’t just bad governance; it’s a burden you’re placing on every Indian’s back.""Siddaramaiah also talked about Karnataka's contribution to the centre but don't get adequate in return. ""While Karnataka contributes significantly to the Union's coffers, your government starves us of our rightful share to prevent us from implementing guarantee schemes. For every rupee Karnataka gives, we only receive 13 paise back. This is not ‘cooperative federalism’; it’s outright exploitation,"" he said.Other Congress leaders also responded to PM Modi 's remark. Former MLA Udit Raj said, ""Nobody in Congress party can lie like PM Modi.

""First, the ECI prefaces its reply by stating the 'exceptional' nature of its indulgence in engaging with us on the issues raised. We do not know who is advising or guiding the Hon'ble Commission, but it seems that the Commission has forgotten that it is a body set up under the Constitution and charged with the discharge of certain crucial functions- both administrative and quasi- judicial. If the Commission grants a recognised National Party a hearing or examines issues raised by them in good faith it is not an 'exception' or 'indulgence'. It is the performance of a duty which it is required to do.""

prefaces its reply by stating the 'exceptional' nature of its indulgence in engaging with us on the issues raised. We do not know who is advising or guiding the Hon'ble Commission, but it seems that the Commission has forgotten that it is a body set up under the Constitution and charged with the discharge of certain crucial functions- both administrative and quasi- judicial. If the Commission grants a recognised National Party a hearing or examines issues raised by them in good faith it is not an 'exception' or 'indulgence'. It is the performance of a duty which it is required to do."" ""If the Commission is refusing to grant us a hearing or refusing to engage on certain complaints (which it has done in the past) then the law allows recourse to the Higher Courts' extraordinary jurisdiction to compel the ECI to discharge this function (as happened in 2019). Se let us disabuse the ECI of this notion that it has in any way, shape or form indulged us.""

""Second, the recent tone of the Commission's communications to the INC is a matter that we refuse to take lightly anymore. Every reply from the ECI now seems to be laced with ad-hominem attacks on either individual leaders or the party itself. The INC's communications confine themselves to issues and are written with a regard for the high office of the CEC and his brother Commissioners. This can be verified from the INC's representations which are in the public domain. However, the ECI's reply are written in a tone that is condescending. If the current ECI's goal is to strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality, then it is doing a remarkable job at creating that impression. Judges who write decisions do not attack or demonise the party raising the issues. However, if the ECI persists then we shall have no choice but to seek legal recourse to expunge such remarks (a remedy with which the ECI is familiar since it unsuccessfully sought to do the same with a High Court's unflattering but accurate observations after Covid).""

""Third, the 'pattern' sought to be identified by the ECI in Para 8 of its reply is disingenuous, the vast majority of issues raised relate to that short period from the announcement of the Model Code of Conduct to the conclusion of the Elections i.e. the date of counting. The causes of action arise quickly, in literal minutes, and sometimes only become apparent after the results are declared and sometimes after the information from other booths can be compared. If they are not redressed on the ground then they become redundant. And then the only remedy available is an Election Petition which is a lengthy process taking years to resolve. Thus, we approach the ECI with whatever information we have, and the ECI with the vast resources at its command, examines and reviews this information to see if the same is correct. Many times, the ECI has found our information to be correct. Other times, not so. But we do not name and shame the ECI for those moments after the Election is over.""

""Fourth, if we were bad faith actors, then we would never engage with the ECI to begin with. We would not painstakingly document our grievances and present them with legal precedent and arguments. Instead, we would focus on naming and shaming the Commission with examples from the ECI's own recent history which do not shroud it with glory. We would highlight that of over a hundred complaints against the PM and HM, the ECI has taken action in precisely zero complaints, while calling our party president and former party president to account for their actions/speeches. We would point out how the ECI never published a dissent note, actively suppressing it instead, by a former Commissioner in this regard. We would point out that the ECI has almost always fought any move for transparency and increase in VVPAT verification numbers, with the same having to be ordered by the Supreme Court. We challenge the ECI to fact check the above since it finds the INC's misgivings to be based on phantoms. We have many such examples, far more than the same 2-3 examples the ECI seems adamant on repeating.""

We have many such examples, far more than the same 2-3 examples the ECI seems adamant on repeating."" ""Finally, as stated at the outset we are not surprised that the ECI has examined our complaints and given itself a clean chit. The answer given to the question of the machines' fluctuating batteries seeks to confuse rather than clarify. At any rate, the ECI reply is nothing more than a standard and generic set of bullets on how the machines function rather than a specific clarification on specific complaints. In short, while our complaints were specific the ECI response is generic and focused on diminishing the complaints and the petitioners.""

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday slammed the Election Commission for its "" generic "" response to the party's complaint over alleged irregularities in the recently concluded Haryana assembly elections, particularly criticising the poll panel's ""tone and tenor, and the language used"".""The Election Commission's reply is nothing more than generic set of bullet points on how machines work rather than specific clarification on our Haryana complaints ... While our complaints in Haryana were specific, the EC's response is generic and focused on diminishing complaints and petitioners,"" the party said in a letter addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar.The Congress also took a jab at the EC for giving a ""clean chit to itself"" and slammed the poll panel for its "" condescending "" reply.""If the EC's goal is to strip itself of last vestiges of neutrality, then it's doing remarkable job at creating that impression,"" the Congress added.The sharp criticism came days after the EC categorically dismissed the party's claims of irregularities in the Haryana Assembly elections as ""baseless"" and ""frivolous"".The poll panel had emphasised that it found no evidence to support Congress's allegations, particularly those concerning the display of a 99% battery status on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during vote counting.The ECI further said that such unfounded accusations could incite public unrest and disrupt social order, urging political parties to refrain from making sensational complaints during critical electoral phases.

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad made a sharp criticism at the Congress party on Friday for its ' Shakti scheme ,' demanding an apology from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi . Prasad accused the grand old party of misleading the public and making empty promises.Speaking at a press conference, Prasad referenced Kharge's recent statement on announcing schemes based on budgetary provisions.""The Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge has accepted that we should make an announcement for only those items for which we have budgetary provisions and financial availability, Has Mallikarjun Kharge taught this lesson to Rahul Gandhi? Rahul Gandhi is an expert in making announcements, and he keeps doing it"" Prasad said.He questioned if Kharge had shared this advice with Rahul Gandhi, who, according to Prasad, frequently makes unfulfilled promises.Prasad also criticised the situation in Himachal Pradesh , where chief minister Sukhvinder Sukhu reportedly asked state employees to forgo their salaries. He pointed out that the Congress government had to withdraw a proposed tax on toilets due to public backlash.He accused the grand old party of making false announcements for votes without any intent to implement them, citing Karnataka as an example. ""They just make announcements and fool the public for the sake of votes and then they don't implement their promises,"" Prasad said.""For the first time, Congress has accepted that they have misled the public...Will Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge apologise for what is happening in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh?... The INDI alliance will do the same in Maharashtra and Jharkhand and mislead the public...Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the nation,"" the BJP leader added.Pralhad Joshi , a Union minister, echoed Prasad's sentiments, accusing Congress of making promises solely for electoral gains without following through. ""Congress throughout the country in many states are making false promises and are not implementing the guarantees,"" Joshi told ANI.Earlier today, Mallikarjun Kharge advised Congress units to be cautious with their promises, stressing fiscal responsibility.""They should announce guarantees based on budget. Otherwise, there’ll be bankruptcy. If there’s no money for roads, everyone will turn against you,"" Kharge said.Conflicting statements within the Karnataka Congress emerged regarding the Shakti scheme, which offers free bus transport for women.While there were suggestions of a review, Karnataka transport minister Ramalinga Reddy assured that there would be no changes to the scheme. Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar also clarified his stance, stating that his previous comments were misinterpreted and reaffirming commitment to the scheme.""Whatever our elders say we follow that. My statement was twisted. A few have suggested is what I have said. There is no question of closing the schemes. I had just said that we will discuss it. But the BJP just wants to do politics,"" he said.","BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad demands an apology from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi.

WASHINGTON: The US imposed sanctions on nearly 400 entities and individuals from over a dozen countries, including India, accusing them of supplying Russia with advanced technology to support its ""war machine"" against Ukraine.The action, taken by the treasury and state depts, was the most concerted push so far against third-country evasion of the sanctions imposed on Russia.

"Bibek Debroy, economist with epic career, dead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bibek-debroy-economist-with-epic-career-dead/articleshow/114867467.cms,"W hen his daytime job was putting together a blueprint for transforming Indian Railways , he combined it with translating a complete 10-volume Mahabharata in English — only the second Indian to do so.When he was roped in by the finance ministry to research and write a series of reports on legal reforms in India, he also produced some of the most prolific works on India’s negotiations in several rounds of WTO talks. As if the complicated trade talks and legal documents weren’t challenging enough, he would be out on weekends teaching chess to school kids in Delhi.Bibek Debroy, 69, a polymath in the truest sense of the word, passed away at AIIMS Delhi on Friday morning. He was suffering from heart-related ailments. With his undying curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge, he created a body of work that defies categorisation. He was chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister. In his tribute, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: “Dr Bibek Debroy Ji was a towering scholar, well-versed in diverse domains like economics, history, culture, politics, spirituality and more. Through his works, he left an indelible mark on India’s intellectual landscape. Beyond his contributions to public policy, he enjoyed working on our ancient texts, making them accessible to the youth.”Debroy’s early work was in theoretical and empirical economics, specialising in trade. Keen on studying physics at the Presidency College, Kolkata, he was nudged to opt for economics by his father. He did his master’s from Delhi School of Economics and pursued PhD from Trinity college, Cambridge. A die-hard believer in ‘freemarket economy with well thought-out regulation’, Debroy authored columns and books on subjects as eclectic as history of the fountain pen to absurdities of Indian laws, and from ‘DNA and RNA of corruption in India’ to dogs in Indian mythology. His belief in the free market came from his experience of growing up in what he called a shortage economy. He would recall how he had to wait for years to buy an HMT watch or get an MTNL phone connection in the 1970s and 80s.In the last decade, his most profound work was in the field of translating Indian scriptures. Apart from translating the unabridged Mahabharata into English in 10 volumes, he translated Ramayana in three volumes, followed by the Harivamsa and the Vedas. He translated six Puranas in different volumes, though in a column written for Indian Express dated Oct 28, he mentioned that his work on Puranas wasn’t finished. Other than 19th century scholar Manmatha Nath Dutt, he is the only other person to have translated both the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, in unabridged form, into English.From its inception in Jan 2015 until June 2019, Debroy was a member of the NITI Aayog . While there, he made a strong case for taxing agricultural income of rich farmers, arguing that tax-free treatment of farm income had become a growing source of tax evasion. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2015. In her remembrance tweet, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: “As chairman of EAC-PM, he profusely participated in policy making.

An economist who was known to speak his mind, Debroy stepped down as chancellor of the Pune-based Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics on what he had termed “moral grounds”.His resignation came after the Bombay high court allowed Ajit Ranade to continue as vice chancellor. Ranade was removed as VC by Debroy after a report had concluded that his appointment was not legally tenable as he did not fulfil the criteria. Debroy had also courted controversy for inviting the editor of Organiser to a 2002 conference when he was director of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies. In 2004, a study on the economic rating of states, which ranked Gujarat on top, prompted Congress brass to ask him to get all reports published by the institute to be vetted. Debroy did not agree to the proposal and resigned.

NEW DELHI: India has committed to prioritise effective restoration of at least 30% of its degraded terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine areas by 2030 in sync with the country's 23 national biodiversity targets as well as the global 30x30 biodiversity goals . It said the country would need an annual average amount of Rs 81,664 crore for implementation of its updated pledges up to 2029-30.The country unveiled its voluntary commitments in its updated National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan ( NBSAP ) during the 16th session of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ( COP16 ) at Cali, Colombia where countries representatives are negotiating multiple issues to protect nature, including a financial mechanism to support countries towards their efforts.India in its updates also outlined its 23 national biodiversity targets, aligning it with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF) adopted by 196 countries in Montreal during COP15 in 2022 as part of a larger global goal to protect 30% of the planet Earth by 2030 (popularly known as 30x30 targets) through halt and reverse biodiversity loss and achieve a nature-positive world.India in its updated NBSAP claimed that it spent around Rs 32,207 crore annually on biodiversity protection , conservation, and restoration from 2017-2018 to 2021-2022.India's 23 targets focus on reducing threats to biodiversity, ensuring sustainable use of resources, and enhancing tools for implementation. Each target is linked to specific strategies aimed at promoting ecosystem resilience, species recovery, and sustainable management practices.""India’s diverse geography, climate, and socio-economic conditions contribute to its status as a megadiverse country, housing numerous species across various ecosystems. With over 55,000 plant taxa and 1,00,000 animal species, India plays a crucial role in global biodiversity. This diversity supports essential ecosystem services vital for human livelihoods and ecological health,"" said India's updated NBSAP.It said, ""India employs bothandconservation strategies. Protected areas (PAs) are central to conservation efforts, complemented by community-driven initiatives and managed forest practices. Agrobiodiversity is recognized as critical for food security, with extensive efforts made in conservation and sustainable management of agricultural biodiversity.""Since achieving the country's national biodiversity targets needs, India in its submission noted that the financing of biodiversity initiatives has been identified as a ""significant challenge"".It said, ""The estimated financial requirements for implementing the updated NBSAP are substantial, necessitating innovative resource mobilization strategies. The establishment of a comprehensive biodiversity monitoring framework is also essential for tracking progress against national targets, leveraging indicators that reflect the ecological health and biodiversity status across India.""","India has committed to prioritise effective restoration of at least 30% of its degraded terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine areas by 2030.

NEW DELHI: This October was the warmest on record in the country, breaking the previous high of 1951, the Met office said Friday. Central India (Madhya Pradesh, parts of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh) led the mean temperature chart for October, becoming the warmest on record, too, whereas northwest India, which includes Delhi-NCR, became the second warmest on record since 1901.The ‘above-normal’ temperature phase may continue in many parts of the country in the first two weeks of November, with the possibility of a slight fall in the second week followed by a gradual dip in temperature during the rest of the month, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Since La Nina — a climate phenomenon associated with periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in central and east-central equatorial Pacific — has not yet developed, the Met department is not in a position to clearly predict the nature of winter as yet. There is still a prediction of La Nina formation in NovemberDec. If that happens, there is a possibility of a harsher winter (Dec-Feb) ahead.“La Nina is usually linked with a fall in temperature in north and northwest India during winter, but we can’t forecast anything at this juncture. Research is going on to find out why the La Nina condition has not yet developed despite favourable conditions,” IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said.We need to find out why all global models went wrong, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said, adding, ""Latest global model forecasts indicate a higher chance of La Nina conditions developing during November-Dec, and therefore, we need to wait to make any forecast about the nature of winter at this stage, even as there are many other climate factors which impact the season.""On reasons behind a warm October , Mohapatra attributed it to formation of four low pressure systems, late withdrawal of summer monsoon, and absence of western disturbances during the month. As far as November is concerned, IMD predicted 'above normal' maximum temperatures (warmer days) over northeast and east central India, and some parts of northwest and Peninsular India. ""Normal to below normal maximum (day) temperatures are likely over west central India and adjoining areas of northwest India and north peninsular India,"" it said.In terms of minimum temperatures, most parts of the country, except some areas of northwest, may face 'above-normal' temperatures (warmer nights) during the month.","October was the warmest on record in the country, breaking the previous high of 1951.

It was a long flight. Around me, passengers slipped easily into slumber as the crew shut the windows, while I watched them with quiet envy. Sleep proves elusive but reading in the dim light of the cabin was too much of a strain. Resigned, I turned to the in-flight entertainment and chanced upon the movie ‘Battle of the Sexes’ on the extraordinary tennis player, Billie Jean King .Bobby Riggs, a former Wimbledon champion, was infamous for his unapologetic sexism. He believed women’s sports were inherently inferior to men’s, once declaring, “Women belong in the bedroom and the kitchen, in that order.” Determined to back up his claims, he challenged top seeded woman player Margaret Court to a match — and won. Elated by his triumph, Bobby continued to spew derogatory remarks about women’s capabilities in sports.That’s when Billie Jean King stepped forward, not just to shut down Bobby’s chauvinistic rhetoric but also to challenge the gross inequality in the American Tennis Federation. At the time, women were paid one-eighth of what male players earned. The justification? Women, they argued, lacked the emotional fortitude to endure pressure like men did.There are moments in life when reality outstrips fiction. For Billie, this was one such moment. The match, called the Battle of the Sexes, wasn’t just about tennis — it was a battle for respect. Billie agreed to play a best-of-five sets match, adhering to the men’s format.On Sept 20, 1973, the day of the match, Bobby made an ostentatious entrance, in a cart pulled by young women. The stage was set. Over 30,000 people crowded into Houston’s Astrodome, while an astounding 90 million watched on television, making it the most watched tennis match ever.Billie triumphed, winning in straight sets: 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.Few can truly grasp the pressure on Billie that day. The match wasn’t just against Bobby Riggs — it was against a mindset that had plagued women for centuries. Had she lost, women’s tennis, and perhaps women’s sports as a whole, could have been set back by decades.But Billie’s victory did more than just defeat Riggs. It sparked a revolution and a new era in women’s sports, fuelling the broader movement for gender equality and conversations on pay parity. Every woman who competes against men in any arena owes something to Billie.Life sometimes chooses certain individuals to bear the mantle of change who toil under immense pressure, not for personal glory but for future generations. Their struggles carve paths for others to follow, leaving deep imprints on the sands of time.As I watched the film and glimpses of the actual footage from that day, I felt Billie didn’t stand alone in the court.She was supported by the unspoken fury and indignation of countless women who had been oppressed for centuries. It was that hidden energy that empowered the sling stone of David when he faced Goliath, over and above her determination, relentless practice, and grit.I wonder who pulled the cart Billie arrived in. Perhaps the god of justice, the god of equality, the god who stands with the oppressed when they rise to fight.Thiruvalluvar affirms this timeless truth.When one resolves to raise their tribe,The gods, adorned in armour, lead the way.As the captain’s voice announced our descent, I turned off the movie. The screen went blank, but my heart was full — with admiration and gratitude for Billie Jean King, the pioneer, the fighter, and the voice of a movement.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114849660,imgsize-81446,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/114849660.jpg"

Congress badly exposed due to unreal promises: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-badly-exposed-due-to-unreal-promises-pm-modi/articleshow/114865312.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: :Latching on to recent remarks of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on poll sops, PM Modi on Friday claimed the opposition party “is realising the hard way that making unreal promises is easy but implementing them properly is tough or impossible”. Modi cautioned people to be “vigilant” against Congress’s “culture of fake promises”.“Campaign after campaign they (Congress) promise things to people, which they also know they will never be able to deliver. Now, they stand badly exposed in front of people,” Modi said in a series of posts on X with the hashtag #FakePromisesOfCongress. Kharge, remarking on Karnataka deputy CM D K Shivakumar’s statement acknowledging problems in carrying on with a scheme, had emphasised the need to take into account fiscal constraints while making promises.K harge urged careful consideration and warned that an unplanned approach could lead to financial difficulties and negatively impact future generations. Underscoring the importance of fiscal responsibility, he said that if the central govt failed to deliver on its commitments, it could result in a bad reputation and hardship for the community. BJP , which has been critical of Congress and other rivals for making “irresponsible promises”, treated the remark as a validation of its charge. “Check any state where Congress has govts today — Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana — the developmental trajectory and fiscal health is turning from bad to worse,” PM Modi said as he expanded the attack on Rahul Gandhi’s “khata khat” promises.“Their so-called guarantees lie unfulfilled, which is a terrible deceit upon people of these states. The victims of such politics are the poor, youngsters, farmers and women, who are not only denied the benefits of these promises but also see their existing schemes diluted,” Modi further said, his remarks set to further inflame the political rivalry during the campaign for Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls.Kharge responded to Modi by alleging that the PM was guilty of not keeping scores of his promises. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah also stepped in to assert that his govt was committed to implement the five guarantees. However, his intervention fed into the perception of the widening divergence between him and his deputy, with Modi suggesting that people and the state are suffering because of the relentless feuding between Congress functionaries.Making a veiled reference to the schism in Karnataka Congress, Modi said the party is busy in intraparty politics and loot instead of delivering on development. “Not only that, they are also going to roll back existing schemes,” he added.PM Modi said even in Himachal Pradesh, salaries of govt employees were not paid on time; in Telangana, farmers were waiting for the promised waiver. The PM said people will have to be vigilant against Congress’s culture of fake promises .“We saw recently how people of Haryana rejected their lies and preferred a govt that is stable, progress-oriented and action driven. There is a growing realisation across India that a vote for Congress is a vote for non-governance, poor economics and unparalleled loot. People of India want development and progress, not the same old,” he added.Earlier, BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad mockingly asked if Kharge had given his first “gyan” to Rahul, noting the former Congress president often boasted of “khata khat” (immediate) transfer of money to different population segments during elections in case his party came to office.","PM Modi warns people to be “vigilant’ against Congress’s “culture of fake promises” “Campaign after campaign they (Congress) promise things to people, which they also know they will never be able to deliver.

KOLKATA: A murder convict who spent seven years in jail was acquitted last month by Calcutta HC , which, after going through evidence, found serious lacunae in establishing beyond doubt that he had committed the crime.The incident dates to April 23, 2015, when Kolkata resident Ranadip Banerjee , alias Rinku, was accused of murdering his elder brother, who suffered from a neurological disorder. A cousin of the two brothers, Joydeep Banerjee, had registered a case with Gariahat police station. In 2017, Ranadip was convicted of murder by a trial court under IPC Section 302 .Ranadip challenged his conviction before a division bench of Justice Soumen Sen and Justice Uday Kumar citing discrepancies and inconsistencies in evidence. ""Chain of circumstances has been fabricated by police as per their whim and fancy in absence of any evidence to commission of offence whatsoever,"" his counsel stated.The state's counsel contended that it had been established that the relationship between the brothers was bitter and the accused used to assault the victim. On the day of murder he caused injury to the victim and prevented him from receiving proper treatment, leading to his death.However, after going through the case details, HC bench observed that while courts can ignore trivial inconsistencies, material contradictions are fatal and demolish a case that is based on circumstantial evidence due to failure to establish links.The bench expressed surprise at the investigating officer not recording statements of immediate neighbours and tenants on the premises in which the crime was committed. It pointed out that while the prosecution had claimed that a blood-stained rod recovered from the room was the murder weapon, no forensic examination was conducted to ascertain if the blood on it matched that of the victim or whether the accused's fingerprints were present on it","Ranadip Banerjee was accused of murdering his elder brother, who suffered from a neurological disorder.

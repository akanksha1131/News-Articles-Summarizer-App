India capitalof untreated diabetics: Lancet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-capitalof-untreated-diabetics-lancet/articleshow/115274307.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: India has the highest number of persons with untreated diabetes, claims a new study published in The Lancet medical journal.According to the study, an estimated 828 million adults (aged 18 years and older) had diabetes in 2022. Of these, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India, followed by 148 million in China, 42 million in the US, 36 million in Pakistan, 25 million in Indonesia, and 22 million in Brazil.The study was carried out by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) — a global network of health scientists that provides rigorous and timely data on risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for 200 countries and territories, in collaboration with WHO.Senior author professor Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, said the study highlights widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing.“This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications — including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss — or in some cases, premature death,” Ezzati said.According to the study, global diabetes rates doubled in men (6.8% to 14.3%) and women (6.9% to 13.9%) between 1990 and 2022. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), experienced the largest increases while some higher-income countries, such as Japan, Canada and some countries in western Europe (eg. France, Spain and Denmark), saw no change or even a small decrease in diabetes rate over the past three decades.In India, the researchers pointed out, the diabetes rate nearly doubled in women and men. In women, it went up from 11.9% in 1990 to 24% in 2022. In men, it went up from 11.3% to 21.4% in the corresponding period. In comparison, the treatment coverage increased only marginally for both genders; 21.6% to 27.8% in women between 1990 and 2022 and 25.3% to 29.3% in men in the same period.Dr Sachin Kumar Jain , professor and HOD, department of endocrinology at Amrita Hospital, Faridabad, said India’s status is a sobering reality and highlights a pressing public health challenge. “The reasons behind this situation are multifactorial — limited access to healthcare facilities, socio-economic constraints, cultural perceptions and lack of awareness about diabetes,” he said,“From my experience as an endocrinologist, early detection and continuous care can drastically alter diabetes outcomes. Collaborative efforts between govt bodies, healthcare professionals, and community organisations are vital to mitigate the burden of untreated diabetes in India, improve health literacy, and deliver timely, equitable care across all geographies.”Dr Anoop Misra, chairman Fortis C-Doc, told TOI untreated diabetes is a serious problem. However, he added, that treatment coverage is unlikely to be less than 30%, as reflected in the Lancet study. “Many people opt for alternative therapies, some self-medicate and there are many others who try to deal with the condition by lifestyle modification until the condition worsens. All this is true and requires urgent action,” he said.","An estimated 828 million adults (aged 18 years and older) had diabetes in 2022.

First draft text on new post-2025 climate finance goals released,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-draft-text-on-new-post-2025-climate-finance-goals-released/articleshow/115274244.cms,"COP29

Albanian PM goes off script, speech creates a stir

Special envoy says US will continue path of decarbonisation

BAKU: With the first draft decision text on new post-2025 climate finance goals released at CO here on Wednesday, amid huge differences between rich and developing nations on the issue, UN climate body said developing countries would need $1.1-2.4 trillion annual investment by 2030, and up to $2.9 trillion till 2035, to meet mitigation goals.This could, at least, be an indication to negotiators of rich nations about requirement when developing countries have been struggling to get a deal on having at least $1.3 trillion a year from their developed counterparts with a significant provision component for adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage.Developing countries, however, don’t want it in the form of “investment” as currently much of climate finance discussions are focused on investments in mitigation actions.Though the new text has mentioned the amount ($1.3 trillion), it also carried the other much lesser options in brackets with caveats on the nature of climate finance which won’t be acceptable to developing countries.Developing countries expressed that climate finance should be “adequate, predictable, accessible, grant-based, low-interest and long-term”. The developed countries have, so far, not put in any numbers.Referring to the text, developing countries have already pointed out that it was an attempt to push weak language to avoid providing real grant-based finance. Negotiations at CO would, therefore, see more texts on a new climate finance goal — calledNew Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) — in the coming days for countries to thrash out their differences. In all probability, the more intense discussions for some convergence in the final text is expected next week when ministers are around.Albanian PM Edi Rama created a stir on Wednesday at CO, claiming that nothing had actually changed in the real world despite big appeals by leaders, who he blamed lacked common political will to go beyond words and unite for meaningful action. Citing an observation he had made a day before, Rama said he decided to leave aside his “well prepared speech” after watching the “silent TV” in the leaders’ lounge.“People there eat, drink, meet, and take photos together, while images of voiceless speeches from leaders play on and on and on in the background. To me, this seems exactly like what happens in the real world every day,” he said.Putting up a brave face amid the threat of dilution of climate actions under Donald Trump, the American special Presidential envoy for climate John Podesta said the US economy would continue down the path of decarbonisation, reducing emissions for years to come, because of historic private sector investments made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.Delivering his nation’s statement here at CO, he said the US is on track to meet President Biden’s ambitious international public finance commitment of $11 billion per year by the end of 2024. He emphasised that the American negotiators would need to first conclude the key negotiated outcomes including Article 6 (carbon market) and a robust new climate finance target here at the climate conference.“It should be multi-layered with an ambitious, realistically achievable support layer involving new contributors ... underpinned by a set of qualitative elements that evolve the international financial architecture,” said Podesta in the context of the new post-2025 finance goal.","UN climate body said developing countries would need $1.1-2.4 trillion annual investment by 2030, and up to $2.9 trillion till 2035.

Chennai Doctor Stabbed: Chennai govt hospital doctor stabbed by patient's son,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chennai-govt-hospital-doctor-stabbed-by-patients-son/articleshow/115274147.cms,"PTI photo

Attacker tried to escape after attack, caught by hosp staff

CHENNAI: The head of the oncology department at state-run Kalaignar Centenary Super-Specialty Hospital was stabbed multiple times Wednesday in his consultation room by a man allegedly dissatisfied with the treatment his mother was receiving.Dr Balaji Jaganathan suffered serious wounds to his scalp, head, neck, back, and ear. He was rushed into emergency surgery. “His condition is stable. He will be monitored in ICU by a team of doctors,” said hospital director Dr L Parthasarathy.The attack triggered protests by doctors and paramedics at the hospital and other medical facilities. The Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association demanded swift action against the attacker, and called for stronger security and a central law to protect medical staff from violence. A flash strike hit services, except for emergencies.This happened amid growing demands by doctors across India for better protection and legal safeguards against violence, especially after the rape-murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College on Aug 9. Jaganathan’s attacker, identified as M Vignesh, was caught by hospital staff while attempting to flee. The automobile engineering diploma-holder was later remanded in judicial custody.Police said his mother Prema Manoharan was an advanced-stage cancer patient who had received six rounds of chemotherapy and palliative care at the hospital. Her condition worsened at home three days ago. According to Parthasarathy, the attacker had visited the hospital a day before the attack, where he quarrelled with oncologist Jaganathan.On Wednesday, Vignesh took an outpatient slip, waited for his turn and once inside the doctor’s consultation room, locked the door and launched a vicious attack with a kitchen knife. He discarded the bloodstained knife on the hospital premises and attempted to escape.Opposition parties condemned the assault, while criticising the DMK-led govt’s handling of law and order in the state and its “failure” in protecting doctors in medical facilities. In response, deputy chief minister Udhayanidhi Stalin visited the hospital and assured its staff and the medical community that the govt would take stringent action against the attacker.Chennai police commissioner A Arun also visited the hospital and announced that security would be increased. State health minister Ma Subramanian reaffirmed govt’s commitment to safety, noting recent measures to improve hospital security such as the installation of CCTV cameras at over 2,000 primary health centres across Tamil Nadu in recent months.","Dr Balaji Jaganathan suffered serious wounds to his scalp, head, neck, back, and ear.

Mom of 3 was brutally tortured before being set ablaze in Manipur: Autopsy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mom-of-3-was-brutally-tortured-before-being-set-ablaze-in-manipur-autopsy/articleshow/115273837.cms,"Manipur violence (File photo)

Autopsy findings suggestive of “third-degree” torture using nails and burns inflicted while the victim was alive accentuated on Wednesday the horror of a 31-year-old mother of three being allegedly raped before being burned to death by armed intruders inside her village home in Manipur’s Jiribam on Nov 7, leading to a sequence of other violent happenings in the district since.The autopsy at Silchar Medical College in neighbouring Assam couldn’t ascertain if the woman, a tribal resident of the Zairawn village, was sexually assaulted before being killed as her charred body ruled out any chance of doctors collecting a vaginal smear.The FIR registered at Jiribam quotes her husband as saying she was raped before being “brutally killed” in “our residence”. The perpetrators, who plundered and set 17 homes ablaze in Zairawn that night, are suspected to be members of a valley-based outfit.Manipur woman’s body 99% burnt, even bones charred: ReportThe autopsy report mentions “a wound in the back of right thigh” and a “metallic nail embedded in the medial aspect of left thigh”. The body was found to have 99% burns, with even the bone fragments charred. “The right upper limb, parts of both lower limbs, and the facial structure are missing,” the report notes.Most of the other details are too graphic to reproduce, indicative of the torture and pain the woman was subjected to before flames enveloped her along with the home she, her husband and children lived in. It isn’t clear where the victim’s husband and children were when the assailants arrived.Kuki-Zo organisations have condemned the woman’s killing as “barbaric”, with tempers flaring over security agencies being unable to identify the killers.The Indigenous Tribes Advocacy Committee of Pherzawl and Jiribam requested central intervention to safeguard the Kuki-Zomi-Hmar people of the twin tribal-dominant districts. The Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum , a conglomerate of tribal communities of Churachandpur, warned of more turmoil if the assailants weren’t arrested.The woman’s alleged rape and the manner of her killing harks back to the worst of Manipur’s theatre of violence since May last year, including instances of women being stripped, paraded naked, gang-raped and killed in the initial weeks of the still-raging ethnic strife. The hill-valley divide caused by acts of violence by both sides continues to keep hundreds of displaced families confined to relief shelters in Jiribam and elsewhere in the state.Manipur Police said they took the tribal woman’s charred remains to Silchar, less than 50km from Jiribam, instead of Imphal for autopsy because it was purportedly “very much inconvenient to transport the body by road via NH-37 due to ongoing ethnic crisis”.","Mother of three, 31, allegedly raped before being burned to death in Manipur.

"For every rupee Isro spends, return is Rs 2.5, says space agency chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-every-rupee-isro-spends-return-is-rs-2-5-says-space-agency-chief/articleshow/115273716.cms,"Isro chairman S Somanath

NEW DELHI: A recent study by the Indian space agency on whether the money invested in the sector has benefitted society found that for every rupee that the organisation spent, the return is Rs 2.5, said Isro chairman S Somanath on Tuesday.At an interactive session with students of Karnataka Residential Educational Institutions Society, Somnath said Isro’s goal is to serve the country rather than to compete for supremacy among the spacefaring nations. “Going to the Moon is a costly affair. And we cannot depend only on the govt for funding. We must create business opportunities. If you have to sustain it, you have to create a use for it. Otherwise, after we do something, the govt will tell you to close down,” he said.Somanath was referring to the Socio-Economic Impact Analysis of Indian Space Programme, a report commissioned by Isro in collaboration with European space consultancy Novaspace that assessed the benefits of India’s space program. The report, however, talked about the returns the space sector was receiving in terms of dollars. The report, released by space minister Jitendra Singh on National Space Day, said the space sector has contributed $60 billion to India’s GDP between 2014 and 2024. For every dollar generated by the space sector, the Indian economy has seen a multiplier effect of $2.54.The Indian space sector’s revenues have grown to $6.3 billion as of 2023, making it the eighth-largest space economy in the world. It has created 4.7 million jobs, including 96,000 jobs in the public and private sector, it said.As of 2024, the Indian space economy is valued around Rs 6,700 crore ($8.4 billion), contributing 2%-3% of the global space economy which is expected to reach $13 billion by 2025 at compound annual growth (CAGR) of 6%. India aims to capture a 10% share of the global economy by the next decade.The total investment in Isro till date in the last 55 years since its inception is less than a single year’s budget of US space agency Nasa. Isro’s current annual budget is about $1.6 billion and Nasa’s current annual budget is $25 billion, which is about 15.5 times larger than India’s spending on space. India has over 400 private space companies — which was just 54 in 2020As per last estimates by Isro, a total of 127 Indian satellites, including those from private operators and academic institutions, have been launched till Dec 31, 2023. India has launched 97 rockets and sent 432 foreign satellites to space. It has three different rockets available for commercial launches. The report said Isro helps eight lakh fishermen daily and 140 crore Indians get the benefit of satellite-based weather forecasts. India’s spy satellites with 25cm resolution are among the best in the world.On the interplanetary exploration front, India made history by capturing the orbit of the Moon and Mars in its first attempts. India also soft-landed its Chandrayaan-3 lander Vikram near the Moon's unexplored south pole. India is at present studying the Sun 24x7 through the Aditya L-1 satellite .","Isro chairman S Somanath said Isro’s goal is to serve the country rather than to compete for supremacy among the spacefaring nations.

Maoist boycott calls fall flat as voters flock to Jarkhand booths

(With inputs from Abhijit Sen in Hazaribagh, Vishvendu Jaipuriar in Chatra, KA Gupta in Gumla and B Sridhar in Jamshedpur)

The overall voter turnout in the first phase of the Jharkhand election on Wednesday, for 43 seats, was 64.8%, higher than 63.7% for these 43 seats in 2019.Rural areas, mostly tribal belts in JMM ’s stronghold of Kolhan division, saw brisk voting since the morning, while urban apathy led to low turnouts across constituencies overlapping Ranchi and Jamshedpur as 1.4 crore voters cast their ballots.At 79.1%, Kharsawan (ST seat) saw the highest turnout, while Ranchi recorded the lowest turnout, 52.3%. Jamshedpur East and West segments settled at 57% and 56.3%, respectively.“In Budha Pahad area in Garhwa district, once considered a stronghold of extremists, long queues, and peaceful polling at Hesatu Polling station signalled the deep penetration of democratic ethos… this polling station was set up in Budha Pahad area for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, allowing residents to vote in their own village,” Election Commission said on Wednesday.Even as voters lined up outside booths, hectic campaigning for the second phase of the election for the 38 remaining seats, in the crucial JMM strongholds of tribal heartland Santhal Pargana and coal-rich Koylanchal, picked up pace.The final phase of voting will be held on Nov 20. Early in the day, Odisha governor Raghubar Das voted in Jamshedpur (East), while chief minister Hemant Soren and his wife, Kalpana Soren, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh, former Indian cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni and other VIPs cast their votes in Ranchi.Former CM Champai Soren, who cast his vote in Seraikela (ST), said BJP would ride home on the issue of infiltration.The INDIA bloc of JMM, Congress and RJD, and NDA, led by BJP Ajsu party and JDU, remained hopeful of a good show in the first phase. Of the 43 seats where voting was held on Wednesday, JMM holds the most seats (17), followed by BJP (12) and Congress (9). In 2019, BJP lost all 14 seats to JMM and Congress in the crucial Kolhan division, which comprises Jamshedpur’s urban seats and the iron-ore rich hinterlands of West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts.“The farmers, women, workers and the youth sent a clear message today, that the Hemant Soren govt will return to office for another term. Specially, electors in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and other urban constituencies have shattered the myth that JMM is not liked by urban voters,” JMM said in a statement. BJP, on the other hand, claimed it would win two-thirds of the 43 seats that went to polls on Wednesday.In 950 out of the nearly 15,344 polling booths voting ended an hour earlier, keeping in mind the threats from Maoists; polling remained peaceful with no cases of arson, violence or bloodshed being reported till the evening. Voters defied bandh calls by Maoists in Jagannathpur (ST) and Manoharpur (ST) assembly segments and turned up in numbers to exercise their franchise.In Gumla (ST) seat, locals of several villages boycotted polls over unfulfilled demands for roads and bridges but later exercised their franchise upon assurances from the local administration. In Kanke, Congress workers raised an alarm when a BJP polling agent was found with a bag with Modi’s photograph embossed on it.In Simariya (SC) constituency, a 90-year-old prominent folk singer, Saraswati Devi, died two hours after voting after suffering a heart attack. JMM and BJP workers clashed in Tandwa, in Chatra, while women turned out to vote in large numbers in Hazaribagh.","The overall voter turnout in the first phase of the Jharkhand election on Wednesday, for 43 seats, was 64.8%, higher than 63.7% for these 43 seats in 2019.

"SC bans ‘bulldozer justice’, calls it unconstitutional, drafts norms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-bans-bulldozer-justice-calls-it-unconstitutional-drafts-norms/articleshow/115273220.cms,"Supreme Court

‘Executive’s abuse of power can’t be tolerated by courts’

NEW DELHI: Imposing a pan-India ban on instant ‘ bulldozer justice ’, Supreme Court on Wednesday said demolition of a citizen's house merely because he is an accused or even a convict, that too without following the due process as prescribed by law, will be “totally unconstitutional”. It laid down a lengthy process for razing illegal structures and ruled that a state cannot breach a family’s right to shelter by demolishing their house only because one of its members is accused of a heinous crime.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan, which had taken suo motu cognisance of demolition of houses and properties belonging to families of accused in many states, especially in Uttar Pradesh, ordered strict compliance of the SC-laid down procedure for removal of illegal structures and warned of serious consequences for officers indulging in wanton demolition of private properties.“Violation of any of the directions would lead to initiation of contempt proceedings in addition to prosecution of officers. If demolition is found to be in violation of orders of this court, the officers would be held responsible for restitution of the demolished property at his/their cost in addition to payment of damages,” the bench said.Beginning the 95-page judgment by quoting famous Hindi poet Pradeep to illuminate the importance of shelter for a family, Justice Gavai said, “The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building, when authorities have failed to follow the basic principles of natural justice and have acted without adhering to the principle of due process, reminds one of a lawless state of affairs, where ‘might was right’.”Justice Gavai pointed out that mere registration of an FIR naming a person, even in a heinous crime, did not erase his right embodied in the concept of ‘innocent till proven guilty in a court of law’. “The executive cannot pre-judge the guilt of an accused and pronounce a disproportionate punishment, that too demolition of a house,” he said.“In our Constitution, which rests on the foundation of ‘the rule of law’, such high-handed and arbitrary actions have no place. Such excesses at the hands of the executive will have to be dealt with by the heavy hand of the law. Our constitutional ethos and values would not permit any such abuse of power, and such misadventures cannot be tolerated by the court of law,” Justice Gavai said.The instant deployment of bulldozers to raze an accused person’s house, co-owned and inhabited by other members of the family who are innocent, amounted to “inflicting collective punishment on them without reason”, the apex court said and underlined that right to shelter is part of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.The bench raised several questions on the practice of bringing down of an accused person’s house.“Can the family be penalised by demolishing the property without them even being involved in any crime only based on them being related to an alleged accused person? What is their mistake if their relative is arrayed as an accused in some complaint or FIR?” it asked.“As is well known, a pious father may have a recalcitrant son and vice versa. Punishing such persons who have no connection with the crime by demolishing the house where they live in, or properties owned by them, is nothing but an anarchy and would amount to a violation of the right to life guaranteed under the Constitution,” it added.Justices Gavai and Viswanathan said under India’s constitutional scheme and criminal jurisprudence, it was impermissible to demolish a house belonging to a family merely because one of its members was involved in a crime because it amounted to “inflicting a collective punishment on the entire family or the families residing in such structure”.When solicitor general Tushar Mehta said every demolition has to be carried out in strict adherence to the procedure laid down, the bench said it has come to light that authorities have adopted a “pick and choose” attitude towards illegal structures, singling out those belonging to the accused while sparing similar ones in the vicinity. “When a particular structure is chosen all of a sudden for demolition and the rest of the similarly situated structures in the same vicinity are not even being touched, mala fide may loom large,” the bench said.“In such cases, where the authorities indulge in arbitrary pick and choose of structures and it is established that soon before initiation of such an action an occupant of the structure was found to be involved in a criminal case, a presumption could be drawn that the real motive for such demolition proceedings was not the illegal structure but an action of penalising the accused without even trying him before the court of law,” it said.“No doubt, such a presumption could be rebuttable. The authorities will have to satisfy the court that it did not intend to penalise a person accused of demolishing the structure,” the bench added.","Justices Gavai and Viswanathan said under India’s constitutional scheme and criminal jurisprudence, it was impermissible to demolish a house belonging to a family merely because one of its members was involved in a crime. “The executive cannot pre-judge the guilt of an accused and pronounce a disproportionate punishment, that too demolition of a house,” the bench said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115273260,imgsize-215380,width-400,resizemode-4/115273260.jpg"

Sticks and stones were hurled around as the violence continued for about an hour despite police intervention.Police sources said workers of the Sena faction, headed by Uddhav Thackeray, had gathered to protest against the alleged distribution of money inside Matoshree Club, leading to riots and demonstrations. Matoshree Club is run by Sena MP Ravindra Waikar , whose wife, Manisha, is an assembly election candidate.Shiv Sena filed two FIRs against Shiv Sena (UBT), alleging an attempt to murder a woman activist by pursuing her vehicle and molestation of a woman politician.

PAKUR/DUMKA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped up campaigning in Santhal Pargana for the second phase of the Jharkhand assembly election , calling upon voters to unite and bring BJP into govt if they valued their “roti, beti, and maati (employment, daughters, and land)”.Ahead of polling on Nov 20 for the remaining 38 assembly seats in Jharkhand, PM Modi addressed election rallies at the temple town of Deoghar and in adjacent Godda district, seeking support for NDA candidates contesting 18 seats in Santhal Pargana region.His rallies coincided with the first phase of elections when voting was underway in 43 seats across almost half of Jharkhand. Targeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Modi accused Congress of being against the reservation policy and hinted that the demand for a caste-based census is aimed at dividing people and ending reservation benefits enjoyed by them.“Congress is moving ahead with the dangerous plan of ending reservation so that those lakhs and lakhs of people who stand together on being called Scheduled Tribes , Scheduled Castes, or OBCs do not remain united,” he said, noting that Congress had been wiped out from states in which the SC, ST, or OBC population is dominant.“Congress understands well that they can never get elected if these people remain united, so ending reservation is important for them. But I decided to fight all such forces and remind you—Ek hain to safe hain (United you are safe).” Targeting the Santhal tribes, Modi said demographic changes in Jharkhand were serious and that the number of tribals in Santhal region had been halved in recent years.“For electoral and personal gains, Congress and JMM encourage infiltrators to settle here. If this kind of infiltration in Jharkhand continues, not just land and daughters, the entire state will be at risk,” he said. Claiming Congress was anti-tribal and that its politicians demean tribal leaders, Modi cited the example of Sita Soren being abused by a Congress candidate.","PM Narendra Modi steps up campaigning in Santhal Pargana for the second phase of the Jharkhand assembly election.

As the hours ticked by Wednesday, the restiveness of tribal protesters awaiting the autopsy findings grew along with the size of the crowd.By evening, the protesters were raising slogans demanding that they be informed of what was happening. Cachar district SP Numal Mahatta sought to quell conspiracy theories, saying there was “no deliberate postponement” of autopsies.In Aizawl, MNF declared the 10 slain men as “fallen heroes”, mirroring claims by Kuki-Zo & Hmar outfits that a joint CRPF-police team killed “village volunteers” and passed them off as militants.“CRPF exhibited bias... Such actions risk exacerbating fragile situation in Manipur... If we survive, we will survive together, and if we die, we will ensure no one dies alone. We denounce CRPF’s actions, and its discriminatory behaviour,” MNF said. It added the bodies would be taken from Silchar to their homes “via Mizoram”.Amid the gathering storm, 13 civil rights organisations enforced a shutdown in Manipur valley — Imphal East & West, Thoubal, Kakching and Bishnupur — over the alleged abduction of three women and as many children from a shelter for displaced Meitei people in Jiribam.Armed men torched two trucks carrying supplies near Old Kaiphundai in Naga-dominant Tamenglong district, next to Jiribam.",Tribal organisations question the “prolonged autopsy process’ Mizo National Front (MNF) termed the casualties “extra-judicial killings” Doctors completed autopsies on six of the 10 slain Hmar “militants” by Tuesday evening and scheduled the rest for the following day.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115268943,imgsize-195936,width-400,resizemode-4/115268943.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A Rolls-Royce car of 1951 vintage, one of its kind built by H J Mulliner & Co for the Maharani of Baroda and ordered on her behalf by India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru , appears to have wrecked the marriage of the daughter of a Gwalior royal family , reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The girl and the family claimed their ancestor was admiral of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the ruler of Konkan. The boy, whose father was a colonel in the Army, carried on the lucrative family business of running an educational institution at Indore. Both gave different accounts of how the ‘rista’ got finalised and the engagement took place in Gwalior in March 2018 and the marriage in Rishikesh a month later. But one fact was common. The bride was never taken to her matrimonial home amid disputes.The man filed a complaint against the girl and her parents for cheating his family of a large sum of money during the wedding.The woman retaliated with a dowry harassment FIR against the boy man and his family. But this FIR was quashed by MP HC. She moved SC challenging it. She said the man was so enamoured by the Rolls-Royce car that he and his parents demanded that as part of dowry along with a flat in Mumbai.Senior advocate Vibha Datta Makhija Wednesday told the SC bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan the woman is in a piquant position as “in her old-fashioned royal community, there is no tradition of re-marriage.” The bench appointed former HC judge R Basant as the mediator for conducting conciliation proceedings between the warring parties.","The woman, daughter of a Gwalior royal family, said her husband was so enamoured of a Rolls-Royce car of 1951 vintage in her family home that he wanted it as part of dowry.

NEW DELHI: SC on Wednesday told Ajit Pawar-led NCP, which has been allowed to use the prized ‘clock’ symbol for Maharashtra assembly elections subject to certain conditions, not to use Sharad Pawar’s pictures in its campaign and asked NCP functionaries to try to stand on their feet.It was a bitter verbal clash between senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Pawar Sr, and senior advocate Balbir Singh, who appeared for Ajit-led NCP and told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan that the party had scrupulously followed SC’s order in issuing disclaimer advertisements in media about the ‘clock symbol’ being sub judice.Singhvi repeatedly complained that a functionary of Ajit-led NCP, MLC Amol Mitkari, had posted pictures of Pawar Sr on X (formerly Twitter), and alleged that the attempt was to show that the Pawars were still united as a family and that there was no rift in order to create confusion in the minds of voters.“Ajit Pawar-led NCP can’t piggyback on Sharad Pawar’s goodwill in blatant violation of SC orders,” Singhvi said. Maharashtra votes on Nov 20.The bench doubted whether rural voters would be affected by an X post, which is generally for consumption of urban population. “Do you think people of Maharashtra do not know that the two leaders have parted ways and gone in opposite directions?” the bench said and wanted to know from Singhvi the assembly seats in which these two parties are in direct contest.Singhvi said they were in direct contest in 36 seats, but the attempt was to create confusion in all 288 seats to benefit the rival coalition in which Ajit’s NCP was a partner.Could an X post cause confusion when disclaimers had been published virtually in all newspapers, the bench wondered.To determine the veracity of the allegations of violations by Ajit Pawar-NCP, a fact-finding committee must be constituted, it said.Listing further hearing for Nov 19, a day before the polls, the bench sought clarification from Ajit’s party on a certain post using Pawar Sr’s photo and said: “You have published disclaimers. But what Singhvi is saying is right. Whether it is an old or recent photo of Sharad Pawar, ask your functionaries not to use any of his photos.”“Tell your party functionaries that they will not use old or new video clips or use photographs of Sharad Pawar with whom your party is having ideological differences.

"Fix creamy layer criteria without delay, say MPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fix-creamy-layer-criteria-without-delay-say-mps/articleshow/115270466.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The twin controversies over determination of “creamy layer” for OBCs — pending revision of income ceiling and the practice of including “salary” in the “income” of backward candidates with PSU background qualifying UPSC exams — echoed in the meeting of a parliamentary panel on Wednesday, with members demanding that they be settled without further delay.The MPs complained that clubbing “salary” in “income” is hurting OBC candidates qualifying the civil services examinations.Sources said members, including one from BJP, in the Parliamentary Committee on Welfare of OBCs , headed by BJP MP Ganesh Singh, questioned govt about the non-revision of income ceiling for OBC reservations . They lamented it was last done in 2017 and is stuck at Rs 8 lakh.As per norms, the income ceiling is to be revised every three years to factor in inflation. A lower threshold hurts the backwards by making it easier for them to fall in the “creamy layer” bracket, and thus ineligible for Mandal reservations in jobs and education. As per the schedule, the income ceiling hike is twice overdue now.With secretary of social justice and empowerment and a senior official of the DoPT in attendance, sources said the panel members demanded that the revision be clinched without delay. Among those who raised the issue included DMK’s TR Baalu, Congress’ Manickam Tagore, SP’s Ramashankar Rajbhar and a BJP member.Flagged equally vociferously by the MPs was the practice of the DoPT of calculating a candidate’s family “income” by including “salary”, contrary to the 1993 OM which states that “income” would not include “salary” and “Agricultural income”.It is done in the case of candidates with parents in PSUs and other govt departments where “equivalence of posts” has not been done – meaning where the Centre has not yet worked out the table to determine which posts in the PSUs fall under Group A, B, C and D, as happens in the govt. Earlier, Madras and Delhi High Courts had ruled against the practice with strictures against the govt, and the issue is said to be pending in the Supreme Court.Sources said members questioned why does the govt include the “salary” in calculating income, arguing that it is hurting the poor OBCs. Interestingly, the OBC parliamentary panel under the same chairman had in a special report on “rationalization of creamy layer” in March 2019 termed the practice as discriminatory, and asked the govt to stop it immediately.According to sources, when it was underlined that the issue was in court, an MP even argued that the govt can promulgate a law to settle it.It is learnt that the parliamentary panel has been asked to convene a joint meeting with DoPT and Social Justice Ministry officials to settle the issue. While revision of income ceiling is the domain of the social justice ministry, the calculation of “cream layer” falls in the jurisdiction of DoPT.",The MPs complained that clubbing “salary” in “income” is hurting OBC candidates qualifying the civil services examinations.

On June 27, district administration in Bareilly bulldozed a builder’s 12-room bungalow, reducing the structure and his children’s and grandchildren’s belongings to rubble for his alleged involvement in a gunfight. Days later, the houses of seven families in next door Moradabad were razed after a man was accused of orchestrating a dacoity and kidnapping . Today, both families are forced to live wretched lives. SC’s strictures against “bulldozer justice” may have come just a tad too late for many such families across India.Builder Rajiv Rana’s granddaughter, Avantika, clung to her mother that day as bulldozers in Bareilly inched closer, drowning out the sounds of daily life. “I was six months pregnant, preparing a meal, and my mother-in-law was helping Avantika get ready for school when officials arrived, shouting our house was illegal and had to be demolished,” said Rana’s daughter-in-law, Maalu Singh.By the end of the day, the three-storey home was gone, leaving Maalu and her husband Ashish burdened not just with EMIs as they sat cross-legged on the rubble of their former house, but frantically calling up relatives for help and shelter. When the house was destroyed, there were toys and books of the children inside, Ashish said.In Moradabad, a similar story played out. Muslim Hussain, a 25-year-old carpenter, was accused of enlisting professional criminals to carry out a dacoity at the home of his married lover. That set off a chain of devastating consequences. Not only was Hussain’s house demolished, but seven homes belonging to his relatives were also razed by the district administration.“That happened on June 30,” Hussain’s relative said. “We couldn’t explain anything to anyone. Why were we punished? Our houses were flattened with all the valuables inside. Our families now live with great difficulties, and some of the children have stopped studying. All for one person’s alleged crime. Where is the justice in this?”Families left in the cold spoke to TOI not just about the trauma of seeing houses — often built brick by brick by their fathers and grandfathers — turn to dust, but also the discomfort that displacement brought and the shame that followed. One of them said, “We had relatives but no one rich or kind enough to accept us in their houses. We finally had to leave our native town. Our children either changed schools or had to leave studies. The old and the ailing in the family lost the touch of local doctors.”In July this year, authorities, once again in Bareilly, demolished 14 houses and arrested 58 individuals after a clash during Muharram processions in UP’s Gausganj village led to a small riot.Among houses razed for Muharram violence, one belonged to mason Mustaq Ali, despite no case against him. His wife said, “We had saved money for our daughter’s marriage. Everything’s lost.”",Houses of seven families in next door Moradabad were razed after a man was accused of orchestrating a dacoity and kidnapping.

Singh was an ADGP when the FIRs were registered. According to Singh’s counsel, among the key reasons for quashing the FIR was that the person from whose custody a 1kg gold bar was seized, was not made an accused under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and the scooter where it was found wasn’t registered in Singh’s name.Similarly, in the extortion case, the FIR was registered after a gap of six years and the complainant was not known to Singh, said the counsel. And in the sedition matter, the original documents were never produced in the court and from the videography conducted by the anti-corruption bureau, it was not proved that Singh was ‘tearing a paper that had seditious content’, Singh’s counsel added.The court noted the absence of evidence in the FIRs, which “appeared to have been filed solely for harassment purposes”, leading to their dismissal.","Chhattisgarh HC quashed all three FIRs filed against 1994-batch IPS officer G P Singh in connection with sedition, extortion and disproportionate assets charges.

HYDERABAD: Tragedy struck them early in life, but these children have managed to weather the storm to forge ahead in life. R Poojitha is only 14 and has been in an orphanage for the past four years. But that did not stop her from embarking on her entrepreneurial journey. Her venture, ‘ RMP Flowers ’, sells bouquets made from exotic flowers and herbs.The class 9 student and her sister, who is in class 8, were sent to the orphanage in 2020 after their father allegedly killed their mother and a disabled sister. She said she was sad and angry all the time. “Now, I am happy and confident that I can stand on my own feet,” Poojitha said. A Vinay Kumar, founder and executive director of Touch Foundation, said, “Poojitha was moody and did not talk to anyone back then. From that, to starting her own venture now is a big leap.”While shadows from the past do sometimes hang heavy, the teen is elated to start her own business along with her friends. “We make bouquets using flowers and herbs from the orphanage’s garden,” she told TOI, adding that she wants to be a doctor.Like Poojitha, there are other children at Touch Foundation orphanage who have started their own businesses. These children are provided with a seed amount of Rs 1,000 by Young Tinker Foundation to execute their ideas and create the initial product. The foundation also started Young Tinker Space at the orphanage to support their ventures.“I sold five handmade photo frames at International Startup Festival 2024, held in Hyderabad a few months back. The number is small, but it gave a big boost to my confidence,” said S Yashaswi, who along with other children makes frames with reused materials such as paper, cardboard and stones for their firm‘RDY Framers Company’. The class 10 student, along with her brother and sister, was sent to the orphanage by relatives over three years ago after their parents succumbed to Covid-19.“I used to think that we are forced to live in an orphanage as we do not have anyone. Now, I want to do well in life and take care of my brother and sister,” she said. Yashaswi and her team watches videos and consults their teachers during spare time to learn about designing different types of frames for their firm, ‘RDY Framers Company’.Md Mahabub, who has been at the orphanage since his father died 10 years ago, is pursuing a vocational course and plans to sell eco-friendly shampoo from the soap nut trees near the hostel.He said they plan to tie up with local shops to sell the product.","R Poojitha is only 14 and has been in an orphanage for the past four years.

Centre issues new guidelines to curb misleading ads by coaching institutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-issues-new-guidelines-to-curb-misleading-ads-by-coaching-institutes/articleshow/115265301.cms,"(ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: Busting exaggerated claims of coaching centres about the number of their students cracking competitive exams, the govt on Wednesday issued new guidelines to curb misleading advertisements by such institutes and prohibited them from luring new batches by making unrealistic promises of “100% selection”.Citing the analysis carried by Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), Union consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare shared that just 11 coaching institutes claimed selection of 3,636 students in the 2022 UPSC Civil Services Exam (CSE) while the UPSC recommended only 993 candidates. Similarly, in the 2023 CSE, while the UPSC recommended names of only 1,016 candidates, nine coaching institutes claimed selection of their 3,636 students.The CCPA also found that multiple coaching institutes were using photos of the same successful candidate in their advertisements. The investigations revealed how the institutes were fudging disclosures of courses these students joined and their duration.“We have seen coaching institutes deliberately concealing information from prospective students. So, we have come out with the guidelines to provide guidance to people involved in the coaching industry and also the consumers. We are not against these institutes issuing advertisements. But we want them to be truthful and transparent,” Khare, who is also chief commissioner of CCPA, told reporters.The CCPA has so far issued 45 notices and imposed penalties of about Rs 54.6 lakh on 18 institutes till date for misleading advertisements. “Failure to comply with the guideline can attract a penalty of up to Rs 10 lakh for the first offence and upto Rs 50 lakh for subsequent offences. The CCPA can order withdrawal of such advertisements and can stop them from further publication for 1-3 years,” Khare said.As per the guidelines, any coaching institute having more than 50 students will have to follow these rules. The institutes must disclose important information such as rank secured, name and duration of course, including whether it’s paid. They must adequately represent the service, facilities, resources and infrastructure of coaching centres. They must take consent of selected minor candidates after selection for use of their photograph and testimonial.The secretary said candidates joining govt service need to be careful of not violating service rules in case they consent to use of their photograph or testimonial to a coaching institute in lieu of a monetary gain. The consumer affairs department has written to DoPT on this aspect as well.","Just 11 coaching institutes claimed selection of 3,636 students in the 2022 UPSC Civil Services Exam.

We do what our seniors tell us to: Ajit on 2019 BJP talks

Proof Maharashtra sarkar is Adani sarkar: Opposition

MUMBAI: Industrialist Gautam Adani was part of political talks between BJP and the undivided Sharad Pawar-led NCP five years ago, Ajit Pawar said on Tuesday. He was referring to discussions that happened just before he joined hands with BJP and formed a short-lived govt with Devendra Fadnavis as CM and himself as deputy CM in 2019. “Amit Shah, Gautam Adani, Praful Patel, Fadnavis & Pawar Saheb... All were there...,” Ajit Pawar said in an interview to Newslaundry.When asked about the ideological incompatibility between NCP and BJP and his having gone with BJP in spite of it, he said BJP formed the govt in Maharashtra in 2014 after NCP declared outside support. “When results of the 2014 assembly polls were out, NCP spokesperson Praful Patel declared we will support BJP from outside,” Ajit said.After 2014 assembly polls, NCP spokesperson Praful Patel had declared support for BJP from outside, Ajit Pawar said, adding NCP later declared the support was not permanent but only for forming govt, resulting in BJP and Sena coming together again.Asked further on the subject, he said, “we do what our senior functionaries tell us” and referred to the ‘meeting’ before his early morning swearing-in with Fadnavis. “It has been five years, everyone knows where the meeting happened, it was in Delhi at a businessman’s house, everyone knows it. Yes, there were five meetings… Amit Shah was there, Gautam Adani was there, Praful Patel was there, Devendra Fadnavis was there, Pawar Saheb was there… All were there... Everything was decided.” He further said, “Blame for it has fallen on me, and I have taken it. I took blame and made others safe.”Asked why Pawar Senior then later hesitated and didn’t go with BJP, Ajit said he didn’t know the reason. “Pawar Saheb is a leader whose mind no one in the world can read. Not even our aunty (Sharad Pawar’s wife Pratibha) or our Supriya (Sule).” Sharad Pawar has consistently denied any involvement with power-sharing talks with BJP in 2019. BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis had alleged last year that Pawar had had a series of meeting with BJP between 2017 and 2019.Asked about him having split NCP, Ajit said there was no question of a split and “one who has the majority controls the party.”Questioned if the Pawar family could get together again, he said, “I haven’t thought about it now. Right now my focus is on the elections and on Mahayuti winning 175 seats.”On the matter of ideology, Ajit asked how Shiv Sena had allied with Congress and NCP for 2.5 years during MVA rule. “When we were told to work with them, we did.” He subsequently said, “Don’t ask about ideology. Maharashtra’s politics has changed. Everyone wants power and has kept ideology aside. They want to form and run a govt.”He denied that charges of corruption made against him had anything to do with him going with BJP. “Allegations were made in 2009 and I went with BJP in 2023,” he said. He further said he was cleared in cases because there was no evidence against him at all. “If I had been guilty, there would have been action against me,” he said.Ajit went back to Sharad Pawar after the swearing-in in 2019 as he could get the support of only a few NCP MLAs, with most party legislators sticking to Pawar Senior. Later in 2023, he carried a majority of the party’s legislators with him when he joined the Eknath Shinde-led Mahayuti govt.Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) functionaries reacted sharply to Ajit Pawar’s revelation about industrialist Gautam Adani being part of BJP-NCP talks in 2019, saying it was proof the Maharashtra govt was “Adani sarkar.” Gautam Adani was not available for comment.Mumbai Congress president and MP Varsha Gaikwad said information had “come from the horse’s mouth” now. In a post on X, she said, “What was Gautam Adani’s locus standi, why was he sitting in the meetings regarding the formation of govt? I reiterate, MVA govt was destabilised only for Adani, so that he could get Dharavi and any other projects he wanted. This is why we say, this is not Maharashtra sarkar, but Adani sarkar. Now, the truth is there for everyone to see.”UBT Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Priyanka Chaturvedi stated in a post, “As per Ajit Pawarji, this meeting was in 2019 when Devendra Fadnavis became the shortest duration chief minister in a very early morning ceremony… Adani sarkar for a reason. As per the interview given to a digital platform by a senior minister, Gautam Adani sat through in meetings to decide how to get BJP to power in the state by trying to fix unlikely alliances, it raises some serious questions. Is he a BJP authorised negotiator, has he been given the responsibility to fix alliances, why is a businessmen so keenly and closely working to bring BJP to power at any cost in Maharashtra?..Bol Dharavi Bol.”BJP did not comment but in the past, Fadnavis has said Sharad Pawar has had a series of meetings with BJP between 2017 and 2019.",NCP chief Ajit Pawar says industrialist Gautam Adani was part of political talks between BJP and undivided Sharad Pawar-led NCP five years ago.

Dick served as a lieutenant at Seringapatam in the 75th Highland Regiment of Foot. The regiment formed part of the storming party at the battle, their objective to breach the walls by use of ladders. Lt Dick is therefore likely to have been amongst the first of the British forces to enter the city, and it was his regiment that assisted with the search for Tipu’s body after the battle.A silver-hilt Seringapatam medal belonging to Peter Cherry, who was present at the siege in the capacity of paymaster, which depicts a “British lion overcoming the tiger”, sold for £23,040 (Rs 24 lakh).A report on the secret alliance between Tipu Sultan and the nawabs of the Carnatic, signed by N B Edmonstone, Persian translator to govt of Bengal, dated April 6, 1800, sold for £35,840 (Rs 38.6 lakh).The Edmonstone document is a manuscript copy of the report to the govt of Bengal on the cache of correspondence between Tipu Sultan and his ministers which was found at Seringapatam after the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and is believed to reveal a secret alliance between Tipu Sultan and two successive nawabs of the Carnatic, Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah and Umdat al-Umara, who were notionally allied with the British. The findings were used to compel Umdat al-Umara's successor, Azim ud-Daul, to sign the Carnatic Treaty , one of the treaties by which the British Empire acquired its rule over the Indian subcontinent.",The sword has an unbroken provenance taking it back to the 1799 battle in which Tipu Sultan met his end.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

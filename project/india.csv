"Junk the ghoonghat, walk the talk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/junk-the-ghoonghat-walk-the-talk/articleshow/118401588.cms,"Married at 16, Ashalata Pandey of Ambajogai — a temple town known as the ‘maternal home of education’ in Maharashtra ’s Beed — had to hide her face after her husband left for a religious trip one fine day, from which he never returned.“Aren’t you sad about the fact that he left you?” “How can you simply move on?”These were just some of the questions that the young mother of two was bombarded with on her way to work at an NGO that fetched a meagre monthly pay of Rs 800, to raise awareness on a range of issues from women’s rights to reproductive health.Stung by such adverse comments, Ashalata quit her job. With no property of her own and no support from her in-laws, she took up the job of an ASHA worker. Covering her head, like a shroud, with the edge of her sari, she took deserted roads on her way to work to ensure she kept those inquisitive glares at bay.It was during one of those solitary walks to work that Ashalata had a chance encounter with Chitratai.Married off at 12 by an alcoholic father to a man desperately looking for dowry, Chitratai aka Chitra Patil was not just a cheerful health worker, but also a newly-minted ‘saheli’ who had freed several villagers from greedy money lenders by creating 14 savings groups that charged a 2% fixed interest rate.Encouraged by Chitratai, Ashalata enrolled herself for the grassroots leadership development programme ( GLDP ) and on the very third day of the course, she realised she was entitled to certain rights, including the right to her husband’s property.“My father-in-law owned a large house. I wanted to co-own it, rightfully. Now, I actually do,” says Ashalata, sharing her expe rience from being an ‘SW’ (single woman) to one of the many vocal, local leaders of Ekal Mahila Sangathana (EMS) -a women’s organisation in Marathwada that galvanises its 22,000-strong marginalised population of abandoned, separated, widowed women into becoming agents of social change.Ashalata is currently working on violence against women across Marathwada.Started a decade ago by 27 single women in Beed, Latur, Osmanabad and Nanded -the rustic western Maharashtra belt -EMS today boasts of nearly 22,000 members.Having rescued droves of single women from social stigma, unemployment and domestic violence, EMS is one of more than 500 organisations across Maharashtra and Rajasthan that have been facilitated by non-profit CORO India.“CORO stands for ‘Jyanche prashna tyanche netrutva’ (the question is the same as the truth). The drive to initiate change should come from within,” says Dr Sujata Khandekar, founder of the 34-yearold holistic community development NGO.Formed in 1989 by people from privileged backgrounds, CORO later evolved into “a people’s organisation, with people not as mere beneficiaries but as leaders of the organisation”, as Mahendra Rokade, the director of CORO, puts it.In the last three decades, its efforts in rural and urban Maharashtra and Rajasthan have created more than 1,688 “grassroots leaders”, of which, 69% are women -including transwomen.Majority of these earthy change-makers hail from notified and denotified tribes, backward classes, minorities and other marginalised communities. These leaders – aged between 20 and 50 – now address issues ranging from gender rights to forest rights.“Since women are constantly and consistently denied permission to do things since childhood and punished for transgressing those boundaries, later in their lives, women themselves start believing that they are lesser humans,” explains Khandekar.Culled over two decades, such insights paved the way for the Grassroots Leadership Training Programme (GLDP) -a syllabus spanning skills such as advocacy and constitutional rights that were inspired by Brazilian educator Paulo Freire’s philosophy of ‘conscientisation’. Meanwhile, EMS, which began working on ensuring safety and access to govt schemes for single women in areas where they were seen as “commodities up for grabs”, has now percolated into remote Rajasthan where Teena Rawat, who survived two suicide attempts after her husband abandoned her, now beams proudly inside a courtroom where she is defending herself as a lawyer. “If you hadn’t abandoned her,” the judge told her former husband against whom she had filed five cases, “this woman would have spent her whole life following you around in a ghoonghat. Instead, she’s a lawyer now. Look at how little you’ve achieved and how much she has done with her life”.CORO recently launched Atta Deep Academy of Grassroots Leadership in Mumbai as an extension of GLDP. “ ‘Atta Deep means selfenlightenment’,” says Khandekar.The arrival of four transwomen has expanded CORO’s lens on gender issues. Case studies in its 2023 annual report point to how issues addressed by grassroots women leaders transcend gender.Udaipur’s Durga -who learned how to open and operate a Facebook account during her fellowship -was surfing the net casually one day when she chanced upon a govt website listing the names of 42 villagers that had received money to build cattle sheds. “None of the people concerned even knew that their applications had been approved,” recalls Durga, who downloaded the receipts and armed with those printouts, the villagers then pressurized the sarpanch into giving them their rightful share.That’s change. That’s power…➤ 500 grassroots organisations that CORO has worked with in Maharashtra and Rajasthan➤ 249 out of 358 tehsils that CORO has reached in Maharashtra➤ 122 out of 390 talukas that CORO has reached in Rajasthan➤ In the last 15 years, GLDP has spawned 1,688 community leaders across Maharashtra and Rajasthan➤ 3 million lives touched 3,224 villages covered in Maharashtra➤ Over time, initiatives evolved from leadership programmes and became independent processes➤ 268 women (83 sarpanch and 38 deputy sarpanch) and 217 men from various COROfacilitated campaigns have been elected in recent local-self-government elections➤ 22 GLDP leaders in Maharashtra working on community forest rights claimed and acquired 1.73 lakh acres of forest land in 121 villages in Vidarbha➤ The ‘Right to Pee campaign’-which lobbies for hygienic urinals for women has now touched 9 lakh lives across Maharashtra➤ 1,617 villages covered in Rajasthan➤ The campaign on ‘equal property rights for women’ is underway in the Konkan region and is spreading across Maharashtra. 84 leaders and 39 organisations are working on the campaign in 96 villages across 17 districts of Maharashtra","Married at 16, Ashalata Pandey of Ambajogai had to hide her face after her husband left for a religious trip one fine day, from which he never returned.

"No mega rocket for crewed Moon mission, Isro to rely on docking",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-mega-rocket-for-crewed-moon-mission-isro-to-rely-on-docking/articleshow/118398404.cms,"Representative image

More docking in mid-March

BENGALURU: India will not build a large rocket for its planned crewed mission to the Moon, but instead rely on multiple launches and satellite docking technology , as per Isro’s current plans for the mission targeted for 2040.“One option is to build a huge rocket and take a single module. But what will you do with that rocket thereafter? Economically, we have to understand and really look at all aspects. So, we are not going to build a huge rocket. We are going to have multiple modules. Maybe right now, our thinking is two modules. You take them separately and dock,” Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI in an exclusive interview.The approach builds on India’s recent success with the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission, which achieved its first docking manoeuvre on Jan 16. The mission involved two 220-kg satellites initially separated by 11 km, orbiting at approximately 28,400 km per hour.Docking technology is crucial for India’s upcoming space initiatives, including the planned space station project comprising five modules, and the crewed lunar mission . The space station modules too will be launched separately and assembled in orbit, with the first module already receiving govt approval.The technology Isro is developing through SpaDeX will provide valuable insights for future crewed Moon landing missions. While the successful first docking marked a milestone, Isro will conduct multiple manoeuvres at various orientations to thoroughly understand the dynamics involved. Each iteration will provide new insights that will inform the development of future space systems.Narayanan, who took charge as Isro chairman on Jan 13, explained the complexity of the docking process: “Imagine two buses going on the road with each traveling at 100 kilometre per hour speed…And if both have to be get docked, you know, lot of things has to be done. Number one, you have to come exactly within millimetre level.”The satellites, which were previously controlled independently, now function as a single unit. The next phase involves establishing power transfer between the modules, a crucial step for future missions including Chandrayaan-4, where multiple docking operations will be required.While Isro has completed the first crucial docking manoeuvre, SpaDeX will continue for an extended period. “The satellites are currently in an elliptical orbit, where power generation varies based on position. This is not a one-time operation. We’ll conduct multiple docking attempts to demonstrate our capability to perform the procedure reliably and repeatedly beginning mid-March,” Narayanan said.The key objectives are to evaluate: How precisely Isro can execute multiple docking maneuvers, how well the algorithms perform under various conditions, how the integrated inertial systems function and how the propulsion system performs during repeated operations.“This is truly a multidisciplinary endeavor. Through these multiple trials, we will generate extensive data to support future applications. Before conducting any actual experiments, we thoroughly test everything in our ground simulator. We validate our understanding and approach through simulation first, then proceed with the real operation only when we are fully confident. This careful approach is essential to prevent any mistakes,” he said.Isro’s methodical approach involves gathering extensive data to refine the technology for future applications. While the initial docking marked a milestone, Narayanan indicated that the mission would continue for an extended period, with numerous experiments planned to master this complex capability.","India's Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) achieved its first docking manoeuvre on Jan 16.

Bengaluru space firm tests payload in extreme cold conditions in space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengaluru-space-firm-tests-payload-in-extreme-cold-conditions-in-space/articleshow/118398381.cms,"BENGALURU: Space startup GalaxEye, which earlier this year completed analysis of the data from the payload it had deployed and tested aboard Isro’s PSLV Orbital Experiment Module (POEM) platform — on the rocket that launched India’s Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission on Dec 30, 2024 — has achieved another success.The firm, its CEO and co-founder Suyash Singh confirmed to TOI, has successfully tested its SyncFusion Imaging System, which was part of the payload on POEM, in one of the most extreme environments in orbit—the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), a region where Earth's magnetic field is unusually weak.“The POEM platform was going through SAA and we had an opportunity to activate our payload and repeat our test sequence. We weren’t certain of success since it was essentially a prototype payload. There was some uncertainty involved. We’d met our primary objectives the previous month. However, this time we wanted to test under extreme conditions, it’s about -10°C there,” Singh told TOI.The success has prompted the firm to consider testing the payload another time. “SAA has an extreme cold temperature, we’ll now also try to do it on the other side of the temperature, which is in the extreme heat conditions as well. Temperatures could be as high as 150°C,” Singh said.Earlier, the firm had said that its ‘GLX-SQ payload’ onboard POEM was the world’s first fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery in orbit.“Our payload demonstrates an unprecedented capability to merge SAR and optical imaging technologies, enabling unprecedented insights for defence, agriculture, and disaster management applications. The system’s most remarkable feature is its ability to process and compress massive data volumes in less than 10 minutes, delivering real-time, actionable solutions,” the firm said.Singh said this was not just a technological milestone, but the beginning of a journey to redefine the possibilities of remote sensing and space-based solutions.Leveraging Isro’s POEM platform, which converts a PSLV rocket’s fourth stage into an orbital testbed, GalaxEye validated its advanced technologies in a real-world space environment. The successful mission sets the stage for the company’s upcoming Mission Drishti, a flagship multi-sensor satellite project aimed at providing all-weather, high-resolution imaging.Founded in 2021, GalaxEye’s goal is to build the world’s first multi-sensor satellite capable of delivering comprehensive, high-resolution data across various industries.","GalaxEye has successfully tested its SyncFusion Imaging System in one of the most extreme environments in orbit.

Rekha Gupta to be Delhi CM: Frontrunners lose race again as BJP picks first-time MLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rekha-gupta-is-delhi-cm-bjp-surprises-again-picks-first-time-mla-over-heavyweights/articleshow/118393944.cms,"Rekha Gupta will be the only woman chief minister among the states being ruled by the BJP at present.

She enjoys close ties with the RSS and is actively engaged with women-related matters.

Gupta is also the national vice president of BJP Mahila Morcha and a member of the party's national executive.

She is a former president of the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) and a civic body councillor.

Rekha Gupta entered politics as an Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member in 1992.

NEW DELHI: Another state, another surprise pick. The BJP has done it again. On Wednesday, the BJP, which returned to power in Delhi after 27 long years, picked first-time MLA Rekha Gupta as its chief minister. While the announcement ended days of suspense and speculation, it did reinforce the notion that being a heavyweight or a frontrunner for the top post in any BJP-ruled state is actually a disadvantage.The likes of Parvesh Verma , Vijender Gupta - party's old warhorses in Delhi, would perhaps have known the disadvantages of being frontrunners in this race even as they would have hoped for an exception from the party high command.When it comes to selecting chief ministers, the BJP's script has been the same - state after state. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana - all these BJP-ruled states have chief ministers who were relatively unknown figures in the party till they were picked to lead the state. The heavyweights and the frontrunners in these states lost the race to the top post.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself leading the campaign in all state elections, the BJP uses CM pick keeping in mind long-term gains for the party.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Goa CM Pramod Sawant and Uttarakhand's Pushkar Singh Dhami are some of the BJP chief ministers who could buck the trend and continue with the top post after the party's victory.To that extent, Rekha Gupta should consider herself lucky as her name was also doing the rounds for the top post in Delhi. A number of factors could have helped Rekha Gupta pip the heavyweights, who played crucial role in BJP's victory.Immediately after the formal announcement, the Delhi CM-designate thanked the top BJP leadership for reposing confidence in her. ""I thank the top leadership from my heart for its belief in me for entrusting me with the post of Chief Minister. This faith and support have evoked a new energy and motivation in me. I pledge to strive with total honesty, commitment and dedication for the welfare of the residents of Delhi. I am fully committed to the significant responsibility of taking Delhi to a new pinnacle,"" she said in a post on X in Hindi.",Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) picks first woman as its chief minister.

JKSA national convener Nasir Khuehami claimed Hamim had been subjected to ""months of harassment due to a power struggle"" as he captains the 2023-batch cricket team.The accused arrested have been identified as Mohammed Zainul, 23, from Vijayapura; Sameer, 24, from Sandur, Ballari district; Shaik Sawood, 23, from Mudagal, Raichur district; Mansoor Bhasha, 24, from Shiraguppa, Ballari district; and Muzzaffer alias Mujeeb Jamadar, 23, from Indi Taluk, Vijayapura district.The alleged incident took place Tuesday evening during a match between the 2019 and 2022 batches. ""While standing near the boundary line, a senior asked him to stay outside. He promptly moved away. As verbal intimidation escalated, seniors humiliated him, ordered him to perform an ‘Al-Ameen salute', sing songs, and dance for their amusement. They even attempted to force him into their car,"" Khuehami alleged.When Hamim refused, citing college regulations, tensions escalated. ""Sensing danger, he took out his phone to record the incident, hoping it would deter them. Instead, this enraged them. Later in the evening, 6-8 individuals stormed into his hostel room and assaulted him. They repeatedly beat him, forced him to record a video apologising under duress, and issued death threats, warning he would not be allowed to play cricket for the next four years,"" Khuehami added.Following a social-media post tagging PM Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, J&K CM Omar Abdullah, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar, the matter drew attention of Vijayapura Rural police officials, who visited the college to conduct an inquiry.Dr Jilani Awati, medical college superintendent, said, ""The incident was a quarrel between two student teams during the cricket match. Hamim might have informed the Kashmiri student leader, who, unaware of the full context, sought help by tagging officials on social media.

That's the problem,"" a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyay and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela told Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Railways.The court was hearing a PIL over the recent stampede at the New Delhi railway station and asked the authorities to file an affidavit giving details of measures taken on these issues. The plea sought the implementation of existing provisions by Railways that may have helped avoid such incidents and cited sections 57 and 147 of the Railway Act that deal with overcrowding.""If you could implement a simple thing, such situations could be avoided... but not fixing the strength to be accommodated in a particular coach, this provision appears to have been neglected all along,"" HC remarked, while referring to Section 57 of the Railways Act, which says every railway administration must fix the maximum number of passengers allowed in each compartment of every carriage type.SG Mehta submitted that the PIL was not taken in an adversarial manner and the Railways is bound to follow the law. He said there was an ""unprecedented"" situation and assured the court that the issues raised in the PIL would be considered at the highest level. ""We are following the law, if there are any lacunae etc that can be taken care of,"" Mehta assured the court.During the hearing, the HC also pointed out that as per rules, the number of passengers that can be carried in each compartment should be ""conspicuously displayed outside each compartment"". It asked the SG to show what steps Railways will take to implement existing laws that limit the number of passengers in coaches and penalise persons entering without authority.""Let the issues raised in the petition be examined, as suggested by the SG, at the highest level at the Railway Board and thereafter an affidavit be filed giving details of the decisions taken by the Railway Board,"" the court directed, posting the matter for next month.HC noted that the PIL - filed by Arth Vidhi, an organisation of legal and business professionals - was not confined to the recent incident of the stampede as it sought implementation of the existing legal provisions with respect to the maximum number of passengers in a compartment and the sale of platform tickets.

I have been commissioned into the 18th battalion, the Jammu and Kashmir rifles, where you have a Masjid, Gurdwara, Durga Mata, and Mahakal, all under one roof.""General Dwivedi recounted how his subedar major, a Maulvi, would perform Durga Mata Puja without any issues, demonstrating the regiment's spirit of mutual respect.

Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham.

Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there.

He shared that it was simply fate that led him to join the Army.""See, when we were in school, we used to look at all three services. We used to love all three, if I can say that. It just so happened that I came into the army. Let me tell you about AP first. As far as AP is concerned, from NDA days, he is a gold torch. And he is, everybody has a natural liking towards him.

BJP, Congress demand probe into 'external interference' in polls



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"". This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.""Why are we giving $21 million to India? They have a lot more money. They are one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us; we can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high,"" he asked while signing executive orders at Mar-a-Lago.Categorically mentioning that he had ""a lot of respect"" for PM Narendra Modi, Trump questioned the funding. ""I have a lot of respect for India and their prime minister, but giving $21 million for voter turnout?"" he said. The two leaders recently held bilateral talks where they discussed trade, illegal immigration, defence and energy, among other key sectors.The Musk-led department had last week shared a list of areas from where it had decided to revoke the US aid. One of those included -- ""$21M for voter turnout in India"" -- prompting political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress in the country.The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, former CEC SY Quraishi clarified that while the Election Commission had an understanding with USAID, no financial assistance was involved.“So, DOGE has discovered that USAID allocated $21 million for ‘voter turnout’ in India, a euphemism for paying voters to cast their votes to effect regime change. Veena Reddy was sent to India in 2021 (ominous?) as head of USAID’s Indian mission. Post Lok Sabha elections 2024 (presumably her voter turnout mission done), she returned to US. Pity because investigating agencies here could have asked her some questions about who this money was given to for applying it to voter turnout operations,” BJP MP Mahesh Jethmalani said.The Congress party has also condemned foreign interference in India's electoral process, urging the Modi government to probe USAID’s claims and take action if any wrongdoing is uncovered.","US President Donald Trump asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" He said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"" The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter.

NEW DELHI: Hit by the Covid pandemic, albeit later than intended, CBSE will roll out twice-a-year board exams for class X from 2026 and introduce the CBSE Global Curriculum for 260 foreign schools affiliated to it from 2026-2027.The education ministry held a discussion, led by minister Dharmendra Pradhan, with CBSE officials and heads of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), where draft schemes, set for public consultation on next Monday, were thoroughly deliberated.Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has announced plans to implement multiple board exams annually, allowing students to take their exams twice and retain their best score. This reform aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasises flexibility and a student centric approach.According to a ministry official, “The initiative aims at reducing the high pressure, one-time examination system and provide students with an opportunity to improve their performance without the stress of a single high-stakes test. By offering multiple attempts, CBSE seeks to create a more supportive learning environment that prioritizes conceptual understanding over rote memorisation.”The policy advocates for competency-based evaluations over traditional summative assessments, shifting focus to formative learning and skill mastery. “CBSE is encouraging a shift towards formative learning, where students can focus on skill mastery and self-improvement rather than mere exam performance. This model also aligns with global best practices, such as the SAT system in the US, which allows students to take tests multiple times and submit their best scores,” said the official.The move also supports NEP’s goal of inclusivity, accommodating students facing challenges such as exam anxiety or illness. Providing multiple attempts ensures students from diverse backgrounds have a fair chance to showcase their abilities. CBSE is also scaling up teacher training to ensure a smooth transition toward this progressive assessment model.Pradhan emphasised that the new format is a crucial step towards a stress free learning environment. “Examination improvement and reform is a key step towards this. This reform will help mitigate exam-related stress and ensure a more balanced evaluation system,” he said.In addition, CBSE will also launch its Global Curriculum for foreign schools in 2026-2027. The curriculum will integrate core Indian subjects.","CBSE will roll out twice-a-year board exams for class X from 2026.

Poll How Can Water Contamination Risks Be Addressed at Major Events? Raise Public Awareness on Health Risks Improve Water Quality and Monitoring

What is faecal coliform?

'Increase in faecal concentration'

'High levels of faecal and total coliform at various locations'

'Quality of Ganga water not good for bathing'

'People back from Kumbh experiencing medical issues'

'

Respiratory tract infections

due to crowded settings'

NEW DELHI: Water quality at several locations in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the ongoing Maha Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal on Monday.According to the CPCB,—a key indicator of sewage contamination—should not exceed the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml.Faecal coliform bacteria are a group of microorganisms found in the intestines of humans and animals. Their presence in water indicates contamination from sewage or animal waste. While not all coliform bacteria are harmful, their detection raises concerns about the potential presence of dangerous pathogens like viruses, Salmonella, and E. coli.A tribunal panel, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava and comprising Judicial Member Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Expert Member A Senthil Vel, reviewed measures to prevent sewage discharge into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Prayagraj. The bench took note of a CPCB report dated February 3, highlighting certain non-compliances and violations.""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform (FC) at all the monitored locations on various occasions. A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report said.The tribunal noted that UPPCB had not submitted a comprehensive action taken report as previously directed, instead providing only a covering letter with water test results.""Even upon reviewing the documents enclosed with the covering letter dated January 28, 2025, sent by the in-charge of the central laboratory, UPPCB, it is reflected that high levels of faecal and total coliform have been found at various locations,"" it continued.The counsel for Uttar Pradesh received one day to examine and respond to the report. The tribunal instructed the UPPCB Member Secretary and relevant state authority responsible for Ganga water quality at Prayagraj to attend the next virtual hearing scheduled for February 19.Speaking to news agency PTI, Jyotish Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati said: ""The National Green Tribunal had highlighted this even before the Kumbh started that the quality of Ganga and Yamuna waters was not good for bathing. They had also issued certain directions, especially on controlling the flow drains into the river. 40-50 crore people are taking bath there, it is being advertised all over the world, but the basic facility of clean water for bathing is not being provided.""While in a separate video, a Senior Consultant in Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi, told news agency ANI: ""We are definitely seeing people with medical problems who are coming back from Kumbh, but obviously in a place which has so many people taking a dip in the water. We would expect that this would happen. The number of people who are coming with medical problems is much less as compared to the volume of people that are going over there.""That way, I think the control is very good, but yes, people are definitely coming with something like what we call gastroenteritis , where they're having loose motions, vomiting, and all that. They're having a fever of unspecific or unspecified origin. Most probably, they're viral fevers that are happening,"" the expert warned.The Senior Consultant said that many people returning from Kumbh are experiencing respiratory tract infections which is a common ailment in crowded settings.""Quite a few people are suffering from respiratory tract infections, like a runny nose, sneezing, cough, and cold, which is obviously very common. When you go to such a crowded place, and then you take a dip, which might be at 3 am in the morning, you can get exposed to this cold,"" he continued.He further advised the ""people to carry their own water, maybe water from home or maybe bottles of water, and they should drink water from a good place or carry their own bottles"".""The second thing is to eat food from a healthy place and eat cooked food rather than raw food, wear a mask and try to keep people at a distance...Do not drink the water while taking a dip in the river,"" the doctor added.","Water quality at several locations in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the ongoing Maha Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal on Monday.

Residents have threatened mass agitation if the plan to ""use the holy water for commercial purposes"" is not withdrawn.It was proposed at the recent meeting of the Special Area Development Authority that a new nature park would be built in Kasol, having 'jacuzzi hot baths', water for which would be brought from Manikaran through a network of pipes.Enraged by the proposal, Manikaran residents met Kullu deputy commissioner Torul S Ravish and sent a memorandum to the CM, demanding scrapping of the plan. ""Manikaran is a site of pilgrimage, and no one should be allowed to misuse the water. If govt wants to build hot baths, then they should do it in Manikaran itself,"" said Narender Kumar, a local. He added that even the deities were against transferring water from Manikaran to Kasol.Opposing the project, local resident Shailender Sharma said, ""Imposition of SADA in Manikaran has led to zero development, and now they want to take away our water... we would not let them do so."" The proposal has also sparked a war of words among local politicians. BJP's Narotam Thakur accused Kullu's Cong MLA Sundar Singh Thakur of having ""vested interest"" in the project. ""It's a bad idea to transfer the holy water of Manikaran, which is a globally famous religious site. Neither the people of Manikaran want the water to be diverted nor the people of Kasol. It's just the local MLA...,"" he added.Last week, former MP Maheshwar Singh had publicly voiced opposition to the proposal, saying that the water from a sacred site like Manikaran should not be used for commercial purposes as ""the holy water of Manikaran is used even by the local deities"". Responding to the allegations, Kullu MLA Sunder Singh Thakur had last week said, ""Whenever we have talked about development, some people in Kullu have opposed it, making religion an excuse. They opposed projects from the ski village to even paragliding in Dhalpur, Kullu.

NMC does U-turn on penalising colleges for not paying stipends,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-does-u-turn-on-penalising-colleges-for-not-paying-stipends/articleshow/118398046.cms,"File photo

After threatening penal action against medical colleges that did not pay stipend to MBBS interns or doctors doing post graduate training, National Medical Commission (NMC), has done an about-turn saying that it is up to state authorities to take action. However, the Maintenance of Standards of Medical Education Regulations 2023 gazetted in Sept 2023, give the NMC vast powers to penalise medical colleges monetarily, or by withholding accreditation, or by reducing seats.In Jan 2024, in response to an RTI application NMC refused to share details of what action was taken against the offending colleges claiming that the matter was sub judice. However, in response to yet another RTI application on the same issue, on Tuesday it stated that ""NMC is the regulatory body which issues guidelines, regulations from time to time. The implementation of the guidelines /instruction/advisory is solely at the discretion of the concerned state authorities under which the medical college/institute is located"".On Aug 11, 2023, the NMC issued an advisory on payment of stipend to PG medical students directing all private colleges to pay stipend in keeping with the Post Graduate Medical Education Regulation 2000. ""All the self-financed/private medical colleges are warned that NMC will take strict action for non-compliance of the provisions of the Regulations of PGMER, 2000, if any complaint is received in the future,"" stated the advisory. Supreme Court has ruled in 2022 and 2023 in favour of students stating that stipend has to be paid by govt and private medical colleges.On Nov 28, 2024, NMC issued a show cause notice to 198 colleges (115 govt and 83 private ones) for not submitting details of stipend paid to undergraduate interns, postgraduate residents, senior residents and postgraduates in super specialty courses, as directed through a public notice issued in April 2024. This notice was issued on the direction of SC. The court asked NMC to submit the details of stipend paid to interns and residents in all colleges. The NMC threatened penal action against colleges for their failure to submit the required information.""The NMC is being evasive regarding the action taken against the medical colleges stating it is the discretion of state authorities It is clear that the NMC is solely responsible for non-compliance of regulations by private medical colleges regarding payment of stipend,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist who filed the request seeking details of the action taken against the colleges.The Aug 2023 advisory was issued by NMC following an online survey among undergraduate and post graduate students in private medical colleges which revealed that hundreds of colleges were not paying stipend equal to that being paid in govt colleges as stipulated. Thousands of students also stated that they were not receiving any stipend. Shockingly, 1,228 students informed NMC that the stipend given was taken back by the college management.","National Medical Commission (NMC) has done an about-turn saying that it is up to state authorities to take action.

The committee has sought to know if the ministry is proposing any amendments in IT Act, 2000 and other measures being contemplated for ""regulation and monitoring of obscene, indecent, vulgar and slanderous content in digital and social media platforms"".The committee has sought the information in light of growing incidents of misuse of digital and social media platforms.

MYSURU: Lokayukta Police gave a clean chit Wednesday to Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah , his wife Parvathi and two other co-accused in the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (Muda) land-swap case, saying the charges levelled by petitioner Snehamayi Krishna against them ""could not be substantiated"".However, Siddaramaiah, for whom the case posed a challenge to his pre-eminence within the state Congress, apparently isn't out of the woods yet. ED is separately investigating laundering charges linked to the CM's wife allegedly benefiting from preferential allotment of 14 plots within Mysuru city by Muda in exchange for land on the outskirts.Lokayukta’s inquiry report will be submitted Thursday to the special MP/MLAs’ court in Bengaluru, where a hearing is scheduled for Feb 24.Mysuru Lokayukta SP and investigation officer TJ Udesha said a notice had been issued to petitioner Krishna, giving him a week to file objections. The notice, whose contents Krishna shared with the media, states that the investigation didn’t throw up any evidence to implicate CM Siddaramaiah, his wife and others named in case.The activist dismissed the probe report as “pre-planned drama”, saying Lokayukta never bothered to cross-check any of its findings with him. “I visited Lokayukta office only to hand over the documents I had collected. My fight will continue. I will file objections,” he said.According to the Sept 27 FIR registered under IPC, Prevention of Corruption Act, Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act and Karnataka Land-Grabbing Prohibition Act, Parvathi received 14 prime plots in Mysuru’s Vijayanagar under the 50:50 Muda scheme. She returned the 14 plots to Muda after the case was filed.CM Siddaramaiah was accused of conspiring to get ownership of the 14 sites in the heart of Mysuru in his wife’s name in exchange for 3 acres, 16 guntas of land at Kesare on the city’s outskirts. The FIR named the CM, his wife, brother-in-law BM Mallikarjuna Swamy and land owner J Devaraju. After an investigation spanning 138 days, Lokayukta compiled a nearly 1,000-page report containing statements of more than 100 serving and retired Muda officers, politicians, Muda commissioner and tahsildar, among others.Lokayukta Police clarified that further investigation into Muda’s compensatory plot allocations between 2016 and 2024 was underway.

Mukesh Meena, a private individual from Anand, was also arrested for his involvement, the CBI said.They are accused of collecting bribes from railway employees by ensuring selection in an upcoming 'Limited Departmental Examination' for promotion in the railways.The action came after the CBI on Tuesday registered an FIR against three Western Railway (WR) officials and a private individual following raids at multiple locations over allegations of bribery linked to departmental examination selections.CBI investigations revealed that on Feb 13, Wasan directed Tiwari to identify at least ten candidates willing to pay bribes for favourable results. Tiwari contacted Meena, who confirmed collecting money from five candidates. Sinha also informed Tiwari that he found four candidates and collected money from three of them.On Feb 17, Tiwari approached Rajendra Ladla, proprietor of Dhanraj Jewellers in Vadodara, inquiring about purchasing 400 grams of gold in cash, without an invoice. The following day, Tiwari met Meena in Anand and collected bribe money on behalf of the candidates.""During the investigation, it is also revealed that a nursing superintendent in the WR was intercepted and 650 grams of gold was found with him, which was obtained by him from the jeweller after payment of around Rs 57 lakh (approx.), and the said gold was to be delivered to the accused senior divisional personnel officer,"" the CBI statement said.The FIR has been registered under Section 61 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for criminal conspiracy and Sections 7 and 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (amended 2018).CBI officials said the investigation will focus on uncovering the full extent of the bribery network and identifying other potential beneficiaries and intermediaries. More searches and arrests are likely, they said.","CBI seized 650 grams of gold and Rs 5 lakh in cash during its searches at 11 locations, including Vadodara. The action came after the CBI on Tuesday registered an FIR against three Western Railway (WR) officials and a private individual following raids at multiple locations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118397700,imgsize-354833,width-400,resizemode-4/118397700.jpg"

EuRekha! BJP picks first-time MLA as Delhi’s 4th woman CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eurekha-bjp-picks-first-time-mla-as-delhis-4th-woman-cm/articleshow/118397639.cms,"NEW DELHI: Catching heavyweights and hopefuls in the party off-guard, BJP Wednesday chose a first-time MLA from Shalimar Bagh, Rekha Gupta , as Delhi chief minister.The fourth woman to get the top job in Delhi after Sushma Swaraj (BJP), Sheila Dikshit (Congress) and Atishi (AAP), Gupta, 50, will steer BJP's govt in the city, 27 years after the last one led by Swaraj.After Gupta, a three-time councillor, was elected leader of the legislature party, she went to Raj Niwas and staked her claim to form the govt before LG V K Saxena. Her name had been proposed by MLAs Parvesh Verma, Satish Upadhyay and Vijender Gupta — all probable candidates for the coveted job before the central brass announced its decision.Saxena greeted her with a bouquet and gave BJP the green signal for the swearing-in ceremony to be held at Ramlila Maidan on Thursday noon.Gupta was accompanied to Raj Niwas by Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva and central observers for conducting the legislature party meet, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Om Prakash Dhankhar.""I want to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi, our party's top leadership and people of Delhi for giving me the responsibility to preside over a new era that is starting in Delhi after 27 years. This is a moment of pride for women across the country,"" said Gupta. ""To fulfill each and every commitment of BJP made to people of Delhi is the goal of my life,"" she said. ""All MLAs will work like Team Modi to fulfill these commitments,"" she added.Gupta has been accorded 'Z' category security by Delhi Police.The office of the party's Delhi unit on 14 Pant Marg had been decorated with flowers with the sound of dhol and shehnai wafting in the air. The MLAs started arriving at 6 pm with the meeting beginning around 7 pm and lasting for an hour.Outside the venue, supporters of senior party functionaries and claimants to the top job, besides media personnel, had gathered in large numbers long before the meeting began. The supporters were shouting slogans in favour of their preferred choice, particularly Rekha Gupta and Parvesh Verma, in a show of strength.Party sources said Delhi BJP Chief Virendra Sachdeva had a private discussion with Verma, Vijender Gupta and Upadhyay. Parvesh defeated AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal; Upadhyay has previously served as the party's state chief; and Vijender Gupta had managed to buck the trend by winning in the assembly polls in 2015 and 2020 in the face of an AAP wave.According to party sources, they are all being considered for important positions, including that of ministers, speaker and other posts.When Verma came out of the meeting, he was asked if he was being considered for the post of deputy CM but he did not reply. ""We are going to the LG's office. It is a matter of happiness that a woman has been made CM,"" he said.Most MLAs who emerged from the legislature party meeting stressed on the party's decision to appoint a woman CM, highlighting its dedication to women empowerment . Party functionaries said she fulfilled three crucial criteria: that of being a woman, belonging to the Bania community and maintaining a low-key public profile. This is in keeping with the recent trend of the party going for relatively low-profile leaders for the chief minister's role as evident in other states.BJP MP from South Delhi Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who had drafted the party's manifesto, said after the meeting: ""She will prove to be the best chief minister of Delhi. The party has always been a pioneer in women empowerment, and this is another example of that. Delhi will now become the developed and prosperous capital of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's dreams.""MP Manoj Tiwari, who was also present at the meeting, said, ""This is a message for women empowerment. It was our party that brought the women's reservation bill in Parliament, and now we have taken another step that proves our commitment to women empowerment.""","Rekha Gupta, 50, will steer BJP's govt in the city, 27 years after the last one led by Sushma Swaraj.

UP government faces HC ire for 11-year aid delay to acid attack survivor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-government-faces-hc-ire-for-11-year-aid-delay-to-acid-attack-survivor/articleshow/118397557.cms,"MEERUT: Allahabad high court (HC) on Wednesday slammed the district magistrate of Meerut and UP govt for the ""apathetic handling"" of a compensation case involving an acid attack survivor , who has been waiting for relief under the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund for 11 years.A two-judge bench comprising Justices Vipin Chandra Dixit and Shekhar B Sarraf said, ""The lackadaisical approach of the district magistrate, Meerut, clearly indicates incompetency and a lack of compassion. Authorities are required to fulfil their primary duty to serve the people, especially those disabled by egregious acts of violence.""In Dec 2013, a woman from Meerut, 18 at the time, had suffered severe burns in an acid attack following a dispute over road construction. The attack left her with 100% disability, affecting her eyes, chest, neck, and face. While state govt granted her Rs 5 lakh compensation in 2016, she has since been struggling to receive an additional Rs 1 lakh from the PM Relief Fund.""I have been running from pillar to post for the additional compensation, but nothing has happened,"" the survivor said.Shaheen Malik, founder of Brave Souls Foundation, an NGO supporting acid attack survivors, said, ""She contacted us last year. We pursued the matter and sent multiple reminders to the authorities, but there was no response. This led us to file a writ petition in the Allahabad high court in Sept.""The court also noted that despite the Union ministry of home affairs sending a letter to the district magistrate on Sept 3, 2024, seeking a response, no action was taken. The court called this inaction ""alarming"", especially in a case which involved an acid attack survivor's rightful compensation.To prevent such delays in future, HC ordered the UP govt to issue a circular to all DMs, instructing them to ensure timely compensation. Additionally, it instructed the registrar (compliance) to communicate the order to the state govt's principal secretary (home).""With regard to the present case, the district magistrate, Meerut, is directed to ensure compliance with the letter dated Sept 3, 2024, within a period of one week,"" the HC order stated. It further instructed the department concerned of the Central govt to ""act on a war footing"" and process the additional compensation within six weeks of receiving the necessary documents.","A woman from Meerut, 18 at the time, suffered severe burns in an acid attack following a dispute over road construction.

Assam tribunal on foreigners can't overturn own finding: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-tribunal-on-foreigners-cant-overturn-own-finding-sc/articleshow/118397414.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that once a designated Foreigners Tribunal rejects Assam govt's claim that a person is an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant who entered the state after March 25, 1971, the tribunal cannot review its own order based on the administration's fresh plea and additional documents.A tribunal had on Feb 15, 2018, after considering oral and documentary evidence in a case filed in 2016, decided that one Rejia Khatun was not a foreigner from Bangladesh who entered India on or after March 25, 1971.There was another case registered in 2012 alleging the same person to be a foreigner from Bangladesh. This was taken up for hearing on Dec 24, 2019, and the tribunal ruled that despite its Feb 15 order, it had the power to scrutinise documents and materials and even its findings in earlier proceedings. This was challenged by Khatun before Gauhati HC, which upheld the power of the tribunal to go into the question afresh notwithstanding the earlier decision declaring Khatun as not a foreigner.Senior advocate Pijush Roy, appearing for Khatun, told a bench of Justices A S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan that the tribunals had no power to review its own orders. Accepting the argument, the bench said state govt was a party to the 2018 order and neither did it seek recall of the order nor challenge it before the HC.""The (Dec 2019) order indicates that the tribunal wants to sit in an appeal against its own concluded judgment and order. Such power can never be exercised by the tribunal. The remedy of the state govt or for that matter the central govt was to challenge the order dated Feb 15, 2018,"" it said.The bench said the tribunal is powerless to reconsider its own orders and set aside the HC order as well as the Dec 24, 2019, decision of the tribunal. In addition, the bench shut out the Centre or Assam govt from challenging the tribunal's 2018 order.","A tribunal had on Feb 15, 2018, after considering oral and documentary evidence in a case filed in 2016, decided that one Rejia Khatun was not a foreigner from Bangladesh who entered India on or after March 25, 1971.

Tiger cub killed in Uttarakhand hit-&-run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tiger-cub-killed-in-uttarakhand-hit-run/articleshow/118397208.cms,"File photo

A six-month-old tiger cub was killed after being hit by an unidentified vehicle while crossing the Rampur-Haldwani road in the Tanda range of the Terai Central Forest Division , about 1.5 km from Sanjay Van around 9pm Tuesday, officials said. Tanda range officer Roop Narayan Gautam and his team reached the spot upon receiving the information and took the cub's carcass into custody.""The vehicle that struck the cub remains unidentified. An autopsy will be conducted Wednesday and we are initiating legal action against the unknown driver,"" Gautam said. He added that tigers, elephants, and other wildlife frequently cross this stretch of road.""A tigress was spotted in the area a few days ago. The deceased cub likely belonged to her,"" he said. This is not the first such incident. On Jan 6 last year, a six-year-old tiger was fatally hit by a car. Several similar accidents have been reported in the past. In 2023, a six-year-old tiger was fatally struck by a speeding car on the Haldwani road near Rudrapur. Uttarakhand recorded 15 tiger deaths in 2024, down from 22 in 2023, with causes including natural factors, territorial fights, and accidents. While poaching cases have significantly declined, authorities remain concerned about the impact of road traffic on wildlife movement.","A six-month-old tiger cub was killed after being hit by an unidentified vehicle.

"Car crash in Kolkata leads to 3 bodies at home, cops suspect suicide pact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/car-crash-in-kolkata-leads-to-3-bodies-at-home-cops-suspect-suicide-pact/articleshow/118396594.cms,"KOLKATA: A car crash on EM Bypass early Wednesday that left three members of a family gravely injured, followed by the discovery of three lifeless bodies of family members of the crash survivors at their home in Kolkata's Tangra has left police sniffing a suicide pact, even though they have also lodged a murder complaint.Police suspect the family members were driven to take the extreme step after failing to recover from Covid-time losses in their leather goods manufacturing trade. The family lived jointly in a four-storey house. The chain of events, at least the public part of it, began at 3.35am near Avishikta crossing, when a sedan - occupied by Prasun Dey, 45, Pranay Dey,44, and Pratip Dey,14, Pranay's son - dashed into a pillar at 100kmph, smashing the vehicle beyond recognition. Miraculously, all the three occupants were alive, and taken to hospital.The next link of the macabre chain fell into place six hours later, when Pranay told cops from his hospital bed that there were three women lying dead at his house - his wife Sudeshna, sister-in-law Romi and niece Priyamvada, joint CP Rupesh Kumar told TOI. Pranay said the family had consumed payesh (a traditional dessert) laced with sedatives in order to die, and some of them also inflicted injuries on themselves. He said the three of them then set out in the car to die by suicide. Pratip was sitting in rear seat with his father, while his brother was driving.Cops rushed to the Deys's house and broke open the main door lock to gain entry. On the first floor, they found the three bodies in different rooms. Police surmise that the car crash was deliberate, part of a suicide pact between the six members of the family.","Police suspect the family members were driven to take the extreme step after failing to recover from Covid-time losses in their leather goods manufacturing trade.

Concerned over ISI team’s visit to Bangladesh: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concerned-over-isi-teams-visit-to-bangladesh-army-chief/articleshow/118396480.cms,"NEW DELHI: India since 2014 has been ""assertive"" in its communication to Pakistan and ""they have understood that we mean business"", Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said on Wednesday, while also expressing ""concern"" over reports that a Pak Army-ISI delegation recently visited areas in Bangladesh close to 'Chicken's Neck' or the Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal.Gen Dwivedi also said India and China are now looking at how they both can reduce the massive number of troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control after the disengagement at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct, while reiterating all corps commanders have been ""empowered"" to resolve minor issues related to patrolling and grazing so that they do not ""escalate into violence"".In the backdrop of defence minister Rajnath Singh earlier this month refuting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's claim that the Army chief had stated Chinese troops were present inside Indian territory, Gen Dwivedi, during a podcast with ANI, said the armed forces should not be dragged into political controversies. Singh had accused Gandhi of misquoting the Army chief and indulging in ""irresponsible politics"" on matters of national security. Gen Dwivedi, on his part, said, ""I think the political answer has been given by the Raksha Mantri (Singh). But the thing which I learnt is that it's important that I must make an endeavour that the Army should not be involved in politics.""On the Pakistan front, the Army chief said the neighbour has been very clearly told that the entire J&K is ""an integral part of India"", with the reading down of Article 370 in Aug 2019. ""There is no compromise with this,"" he said, noting that the number of ""local people"" being recruited as terrorists in J&K has significantly gone down, people no longer have ""confusion"" over their identity and the theme of ensuring the move from ""terrorism to tourism"" was working well on the ground.""India has said very clearly that we will be assertive in our communication (to Pakistan). And if required, we can be aggressive also. So, if you force us, then we will be aggressive enough to communicate our intent,"" he said. Asked about last month's visit of the Pak Army-ISI delegation to Rangpur in Bangladesh, which is close to the Siliguri Corridor in Bengal, Dwivedi said, ""I had used the word epicentre of terrorism for a particular country (Pakistan). Now those countrymen, if they go to any other place and they happen to be our neighbour, as far as I am concerned, I should be concerned about it.."" The Army chief had earlier said India and Bangladesh consider each other ""strategically important"" neighbours and any kind of ""animosity"" between the two countries is not in the interest of either. The relationship between the two militaries is ""very strong"" and ""we are able to exchange notes whenever we want,"" he said.","India since 2014 has been ""assertive"" in its communication to Pakistan, says Army chief.
